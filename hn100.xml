Obviously the post could have been more pragmatic, but then bland? Not everyone enjoys onion even though the flavour is remarkable.
But in a way the “denigration”  is like the pretty demo effects. It dresses the whole comment up in something that pops out and here we are having been derailed from the op subject</span></p></div></td></tr>

<p dir="auto">The eSpeak NG is a compact open source software text-to-speech synthesizer for
Linux, Windows, Android and other operating systems. It supports
<a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/languages.md">more than 100 languages and accents</a>. It is based on the eSpeak engine
created by Jonathan Duddington.</p>
<p dir="auto">eSpeak NG uses a "formant synthesis" method. This allows many languages to be
provided in a small size. The speech is clear, and can be used at high speeds,
but is not as natural or smooth as larger synthesizers which are based on human
speech recordings. It also supports Klatt formant synthesis, and the ability
to use MBROLA as backend speech synthesizer.</p>
<p dir="auto">eSpeak NG is available as:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/src/espeak-ng.1.ronn">command line</a> program (Linux and Windows) to speak text from a file or
from stdin.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/integration.md">shared library</a> version for use by other programs. (On Windows this is
a DLL).</li>
<li>A SAPI5 version for Windows, so it can be used with screen-readers and
other programs that support the Windows SAPI5 interface.</li>
<li>eSpeak NG has been ported to other platforms, including Solaris and Mac
OSX.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Includes different Voices, whose characteristics can be altered.</li>
<li>Can produce speech output as a WAV file.</li>
<li>SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) is supported (not complete),
and also HTML.</li>
<li>Compact size.  The program and its data, including many languages,
totals about few Mbytes.</li>
<li>Can be used as a front-end to <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/docs/mbrola.md">MBROLA diphone voices</a>.
eSpeak NG converts text to phonemes with pitch and length information.</li>
<li>Can translate text into phoneme codes, so it could be adapted as a
front end for another speech synthesis engine.</li>
<li>Potential for other languages. Several are included in varying stages
of progress. Help from native speakers for these or other languages is
welcome.</li>
<li>Written in C.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/blob/master/ChangeLog.md">ChangeLog</a> for a description of the changes in the
various releases and with the eSpeak NG project.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <em>espeak-ng</em> binaries use the same command-line options as <em>espeak</em>, with
several additions to provide new functionality from <em>espeak-ng</em> such as specifying
the output audio device name to use. The build creates symlinks of <code>espeak</code> to
<code>espeak-ng</code>, and <code>speak</code> to <code>speak-ng</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The espeak <code>speak_lib.h</code> include file is located in <code>espeak-ng/speak_lib.h</code> with
an optional symlink in <code>espeak/speak_lib.h</code>. This file contains the espeak 1.48.15
API, with a change to the <code>ESPEAK_API</code> macro to fix building on Windows
and some minor changes to the documentation comments. This C API is API and ABI
compatible with espeak.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>espeak-data</code> data has been moved to <code>espeak-ng-data</code> to avoid conflicts with
espeak. There have been various changes to the voice, dictionary and phoneme files
that make them incompatible with espeak.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>espeak-ng</em> project does not include the <em>espeakedit</em> program. It has moved
the logic to build the dictionary, phoneme and intonation binary files into the
<code>libespeak-ng.so</code> file that is accessible from the <code>espeak-ng</code> command line and
C API.</p>

<p dir="auto">The program was originally known as <strong>speak</strong> and originally written
for Acorn/RISC_OS computers starting in 1995 by Jonathan Duddington. This was
enhanced and re-written in 2007 as <strong>eSpeak</strong>, including a relaxation of the
original memory and processing power constraints, and with support for additional
languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">In 2010, Reece H. Dunn started maintaining a version of eSpeak on GitHub that
was designed to make it easier to build eSpeak on POSIX systems, porting the
build system to autotools in 2012. In late 2015, this project was officially
forked to a new <strong>eSpeak NG</strong> project. The new eSpeak NG project is a significant
departure from the eSpeak project, with the intention of cleaning up the
existing codebase, adding new features, and adding to and improving the
supported languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <em>historical</em> branch contains the available older releases of the original
eSpeak that are not contained in the subversion repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">1.24.02 is the first version of eSpeak to appear in the subversion

<h2 id="org4b21c19"><span>1.</span> The problem</h2>
<div id="text-1">
<p>
Lisp programmers claim that their system of s-expression code in addition to its featureful macro system makes it a
metaprogrammable and generalized system. This is of course true, but there's something very broken with lisp: metaprogramming
and programming <i>aren't the same thing</i>, meaning there will always be rigid syntax within lisp
(its parentheses or the fact that it needs to have characters that tell lisp to <i>read ahead</i>). The left parenthesis tells
lisp that it needs to keep on reading until the right parenthesis in order to finish some process that allows it to stop
and evaluate the whole expression. This makes the left and right parenthesis unchangable from within the language (not
conceptually, but under some implementations it is not possible), and, more importantly, it makes the process of retroactively
changing the sequence in which these tokens are delimited <i>impossible</i>, without a heavy amount of string processing. Other
langauges have other ways in which they need to read ahead when they see a certain token in order to decide what to do.
This process of having a program read ahead based on current input is called <i>syntax</i>.
</p>

<p>
And as long as you read ahead, or assume a default way of reading ahead, you fall into the trap of having some form of syntax.
Cognition is different in that it uses an antisyntax that is fully <i>postfix</i>. This has similarities with concatenative
programming languages, but concatenative programming langauges also suffer from two main problems: first, the introduction
of the left and right bracket character (which is in fact prefix notation, as it needs to read ahead of the input stream),
and the quote character for strings. This is unsuitable for such a general language. You can even see the same problem
in lisp's C syntax implementation: escape characters everywhere, awkward must-have spaces delimit the start and end
of certain tokens (and if not, it requires post-processing). The racket programming language has its macro system,
but it is not <i>runtime dynamic</i>. It still utilizes preprocessing.
</p>

<p>
So, what's the percise solution to this connundrum? Well, it's beautiful; but it requires some <i>cognition</i>.
</p>
</div>

<h2 id="org3b97608"><span>2.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div id="text-2">
<p>
Cognition is an active research project that Matthew Hinton and I have been working on for the past
couple of months. Although my commit history for <a href="https://github.com/metacrank/cognition">this project</a> has not been impressive, we came up with
a lot of the theory together, working alongside each other in order to achieve one of the most generalized
systems of syntax we know of. Let's take a look at the conceptual reason why cognition needs to exist, as
well as some <i>baremetal cognition</i> code (you'll see what I mean by this later). There's a paper about this language
available about the language in the repository, for those interested. Understanding cognition might require a
lot of background in parsing, tokenization, and syntax, but I've done my best to write this in a very understandable way.
The repository is available at <a href="https://github.com/metacrank/cognition">https://github.com/metacrank/cognition</a>, for your information.

<h2 id="org77b69e3"><span>3.</span> Baremetal Cognition</h2>
<div id="text-3">
<p>
Baremetal cognition has a couple of perculiar attributes, and it is remarkably like the <i>Brainfuck</i> programming language.
But unlike its look-alike, it has the ability to do some <i>serious metaprogramming</i>. Let's take a look at what the
bootstrapping code for a <i>very minimal</i> syntax looks like:
</p>
<pre id="orgfa76d0a">ldfgldftgldfdtgl
df 
 
dfiff1 crank f
</pre>
<p>
And <b>do</b> note the whitespace (line 2 has a whitespace after df, line 3 has a whitespace, and the newlines matter).
Erm, okay. What?
</p>

<p>
So, our goal in this post is to get from a syntax that looks like <i>that</i> to a syntax that looks like <a href="https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz/blog/stem.html">Stem</a>.
But how on earth does this piece of code even work? Well, we have to introduce two new ideas: delimiters, and ignores.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgccf59e3">
<h3 id="orgccf59e3"><span>3.1.</span> Tokenization</h3>
<div id="text-3-1">
<p>
Delimiters allow the tokenizer to figure out when one token ends and another begins. The list of single character tokenizers
is public, allowing that list to be modified and read from within cognition itself. Ignored characters are characters
that are completely ignored by the tokenizer in the first stage of every read-eval-print loop; that is, at the start of
collecting the token, it fist skips a set of ignored characters. By default, every single character is a delimiter, and
no characters are ignored characters. The delimiter and ignored characters list allows you to toggle a flag to tell it
to blacklist or whitelist the given characters, adding brevity (and practicality) to the language.
</p>

<p>
Let's take the first line of code as an example:
</p>
<pre id="orgd8f2f2d">ldfgldftgldfdtgl
</pre>
<p>
because of the delimiter and ignored rules set by default, every single character is read as a token, and no character
is skipped. We therefore read the first character, <code>l</code>. By default, Cognition works off a stack-based programming language
design. If you're not familiar, see the <a href="https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz/blog/stem.html">Stem blogpost</a> for more detail (in fact if you're not familiar this <i>won't work</i>
as an explanation for you, so you should see it, or read up on the <i>Forth</i> programming language).
Though, we call them <i>containers</i>, as they are more general than stacks. Additionally, in this default environment, <i>no</i>
word is executed except for special <i>faliases</i>, as we will cover later.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, the character <code>l</code> gets read in and is put on the stack. Then, the character <code>d</code> is read in and put on the stack.
But <code>f</code> is different. In order to execute words in Cognition, we must take a look at the falias system.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgd968480">
<h3 id="orgd968480"><span>3.2.</span> Faliases</h3>
<p>
Faliases are a list of words that get executed when they are put on the stack, or container as we will call it in the future.
All of them in fact execute the equivalent of <code>eval</code> in stem but as soon as they are put on their container. Meaning, when
<code>f</code>, the default falias, is run, it doesn't go on the container, but rather executes the top of the container which is <code>d</code>.
<code>d</code> changes the delimiter list to the string value of a word, meaning that it changes the delimiters to <i>blacklist</i> only
the character <code>l</code> as a delimiter. Everything else by default is a delimiter because everything by default is parsed
into single character words.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgfecc467">
<h3 id="orgfecc467"><span>3.3.</span> Delimiter Caveats</h3>
<div id="text-3-3">
<p>
Delimiters have an interesting rule, and that is that the delimiter character is excluded from the tokenized word
unless we have not ignored a character in the tokenization loop, in which case we collect the character as a part of
the current token and keep going. This is in contrast to a third kind of tokenization category called the singlet, which
<i>includes</i> itself into a token before skipping itself and ending the tokenization collection.
</p>

<p>
In addition, remember what I said about the <i>blacklist</i>? Well, you can toggle between <i>blacklisting</i> and <i>whitelisting</i>
your list of delimiters, singlets, and ignored characters. By default, there are no <i>blacklisted</i> delimiters, no
<i>whitelisted</i> singlets, and no <i>whitelisted</i> ignored characters.
</p>

<p>
We then also observe that all other characters will simply skip themselves while being collected as a part of the current
token, without ending this loop, therefore collecting new characters until the loop halts via delimiter or singlet rules.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orged57430">
<h3 id="orged57430"><span>3.4.</span> Continuing the Bootstrap Code</h3>
<div id="text-3-4">
<p>
So far, we looked at this part of the code:
</p>
<pre id="orgbd064f8">ldf
</pre>
<p>
which simply creates <code>l</code> as a non-delimiter. Now, for the rest of the code:
</p>
<pre id="org57ac2d1">gldftgldfdtgl
df 
  
dfiff1 crank f
</pre>
<p>
<code>gldf</code> puts <code>gl</code> on the stack due to <code>d</code> being a delimiter, and <code>f</code> is called on it, meaning that now <code>g</code> and <code>l</code> are
the only non-delimiters. Then, <code>tgl</code> gets put on the stack and they become non-delimiters with <code>df</code>. <code>dtgl</code> gets
put on the stack, and the newline becomes the only non-delimiter with <code>\ndf</code> (yes, the newline is actually a part of
the code here, and spaces need to be as well in order for this to work). Then, the space character, due to how delimiter
rules work (if you don't ignore, the first character is parsed normally even if it is a delimiter)
and <code>\n</code> gets put on the stack. Then, another <code>\ \n</code> word is tokenized (you might not see it, but there's another
space on line 3). The current stack looks like this (bottom to top):
</p>
<pre id="org9630bb4">3. dtgl
2. [space char]\n
1. [space char]\n
</pre>
<p>
<code>df</code> sets the non-delimiters to <code>\ \n</code>. <code>if</code> sets the ignores to <code>\ \n</code>, which ignores these characters at the start
of tokenization. <code>f</code> executes <code>dtgl</code>, which is a word that toggles the <i>dflag</i>, the flag that stores the whitelist/blacklist
distinction for delimiters. Now, all non-delimiters are delimiters and all delimiters are non-delimiters.
Finally, we're put in an environment where spaces and newlines are the delimiters for tokens, and they are ignored at the
start of tokenizing a token. Next, <code>1</code> is tokenized and put on the stack, and then the <code>crank</code> word, which is then executed
by <code>f</code> (the <code>1</code> token is treated as a number in this case, but everything textual in cognition is a word).
We are done our bootstrapping sequence! Now, you might wonder what <code>crank</code> does. That we will explain in a later section.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div id="outline-container-org7f6ffa3">
<h2 id="org7f6ffa3"><span>4.</span> Bootstrapping Takeaways</h2>
<p>
From this, we see a couple principles: first, cognition is able to change how it tokenizes on the fly and it can do it
programmatically, allowing you to program a program in cognition that would theoretically automate the process of changing
these delimiters, singlets, and ignores. This is something impossible in other languages, being able to
<i>program your own tokenizer for some foreign language from within cognition</i>, and have
<i>future code be tokenized exactly like how you want it to be</i>. This is solely possible because the language is postfix
and doesn't read ahead, so it doesn't require more than one token to be parsed before an expression is evaluated. Second,
faliases allow us to execute words without having to have prefix words or any default execution of words.
</p>
</div><div id="outline-container-org0457514">
<h2 id="org0457514"><span>5.</span> Crank</h2>
<div id="text-5">
<p>
The <i>metacrank</i> system allows us to set a default way in which tokens are executed on the stack. The <code>crank</code> word takes
a number as its argument and by effect executes the top of the stack for every <code>n</code> words you put on the stack. To make
this concept concrete, let's look at some code (running from what we call <i>crank 1</i> as we set our environment to
crank one at the end of the bootstrapping sequence):
</p>
<pre id="org9978e80">5 crank 2crank 2 crank
1 crank unglue swap quote prepose def
</pre>
<p>
the crank 1 environment allows us to stop using <code>f</code> in order to evaluate tokens. Instead, every <i>1</i> token that is
tokenized is evaluated. Since we programmed in a newline and space-delimited syntax, we can safely interpret this code
intuitively.
</p>

<p>
The code begins by trying to evaluate <code>5</code>, which evaluates to itself as it is not a builtin. <code>crank</code> evaluates and puts
us in 5 crank, meaning every <i>5th</i> token evaluates from here on. <code>2crank</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>crank</code>, <code>1</code> are all put on the stack,
leaving us with a stack that looks like so (notice that <code>crank</code> doesn't get executed even though it is a bulitin because
we set ourselves to using crank 5):
</p>
<pre id="org7d54adf">4. 2crank
3. 2
2. crank
1. 1
</pre>
<p>
<code>crank</code> is the 5th word, so it executes. Note that this puts us back in crank 1, meaning every word is evaluated.
<code>unglue</code> is a builtin that gets the value of the word at the top of the stack (as <code>1</code> is used up by the <code>crank</code> we
evaluated), and so it gets the value of <code>crank</code>, which is a builtin. What that in effect does is it gets the function
pointer associated with the crank builtin. Our new stack looks like this:
</p>
<pre id="orge55cca4">3. 2crank
2. 2
1. [CLIB]
</pre>
<p>
Where CLIB is our function pointer that points to the <code>crank</code> builtin. We then <code>swap</code>:
</p>
<pre id="orgd45a0ba">3. 2crank
2. [CLIB]
1. 2
</pre>
<p>
then <code>quote</code>, a builtin that quotes the top thing on the stack:
</p>
<pre id="org6db7950">3. 2crank
2. [CLIB]
1. [2]
</pre>
<p>
then prepose, a builtin like <code>compose</code> in stem, except that it preposes and that it puts things in what we call a VMACRO:
</p>
<pre id="orgfc72b7c">2. 2crank
1. ( [2] [CLIB] )
</pre>
<p>
then we call <code>def</code>. This defines a word <code>2crank</code> that puts <code>2</code> on the stack and then calls a function pointer pointing
us to the crank builtin. Now, we still have to define what VMACROs are, and in order to do that we might have to explain
some differences between the cognition stack and the stem stack.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbc4ce5f">
<h3 id="orgbc4ce5f"><span>5.1.</span> Differeneces</h3>
<p>
In the stem stack, putting words on the stack directly is allowed. In cognition, words are put in containers when
they are put on the stack and not evaluated. This means words like <code>compose</code> in stem work on words (or more accurately
containers with a single word in them) as well as other containers, making the API for this language more consistent.
Additionally, words like <code>cd</code> as we will make use of this concept.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54f2537">
<h4 id="org54f2537"><span>5.1.1.</span> Macros</h4>
<p>
Macros are another difference between stem quotes and cognition containers. When macros are evaluated, everything in
the macro is evaluated, ignoring the crank. If bound to a word, evaluating that word evaluates the macro which will ignore
the crank completely and will only increment the cranker by one, while evaluating each statement in the macro. They
are useful for making crank-agnostic code, and expanding macros is very useful for the purpose of optimization, although
we will actually have to write the word <code>expand</code> from more primitive words later on (hint: it uses recursive <code>unglue</code>).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org685ef23">
<h3 id="org685ef23"><span>5.2.</span> More Code</h3>
<div id="text-5-2">
<p>
Here is te rest of the code in <code>bootstrap.cog</code> in <code>coglib/</code>:
</p>
<pre id="org2a708c8">getd dup _ concat _ swap d i 
_quote_swap_quote_compose_swap_dup_d_i eval 

2crank ing 0 crank spc
2crank ing 1 crank swap quote def

2crank ing 1 crank
2crank ing 1 crank if
</pre>
<p>
Okay, well, the syntax still doesn't look so good, and it's still pretty hard to get what this is doing. But the
basic idea is that <code>2crank</code> is a macro and is therefore crank agnostic, and we guarantee its execution with <code>ing</code>, another
falias (because it's funny). Then, we execute an <code>n crank</code>, which standardizes what crank each line is in (you might
wonder what <code>ing</code> and <code>f</code>'s interaction is with the cranker. It actually just guarantees the evaluation of the previous
thing, so if the previous thing already evaluated <code>f</code> and <code>ing</code> both do nothing). In any case, this defines words that
are useful, such as <code>load</code>, which loads something from the coglib. It does this by <code>compose</code>-ing things into quotes and
then <code>def</code>-ing those quotes.
</p>

<p>
The crank, and by extension, the metacrank system is needed in order to discriminate between <i>evaluating</i> some tokens
and <i>storing</i> others for metaprogramming without having to use <code>f</code>, while also keeping the system postfix. Crank
is just one word that allows for this type of behavior; the more general word, <code>metacrank</code>, allows for much more
interesting kinds of syntax manipulation. We have examples of <code>metacrank</code> down the line, but for now I should explain
the <i>metacrank word</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcf6ff88">
<h3 id="orgcf6ff88"><span>5.3.</span> Metacrank</h3>
<div id="text-5-3">
<p>
<code>n m metacrank</code> sets a periodic evaluation <code>m</code> for an element <code>n</code> items down the stack. The <code>crank</code> word is therefore
equivalent to <code>0 m metacrank</code>. Only one token can be evaluated per tokenized token, although <i>every</i> metacrank is incremented
per token, where lower metacranks get priority. This means that if you set two different metacranks, only <i>one</i> of them
can execute per token tokenized, and the lower metacrank gets priority. Note that metacrank and, by extension, crank,
don't <i>just</i> depend on tokenized words; they also work while evaluating word definitions recursively, meaning if a word
is evaluated in <code>2 crank</code>, one out of two words will execute in each level of the evaluation tree. You can play around
with this in the repl to get a sense of how it works: run <code>../crank bootstrap.cog repl.cog devel.cog load</code>
in the coglib folder, and use stem like syntax in order to define a function. Then, run that function in <code>2 crank</code>.
You will see how the evaluation tree respects cranking in the same way that the program file itself does.
</p>

<p>
Metacrank allows for not only metaprogramming in the form of code building, but also
direct syntax manipulation (i.e. <i>I want to execute this token once I have read n other token(s)</i>). The advantages to
this system compared to other programming languages' systems are clear: you can program a prefix word and <code>undef</code> it
when you want to rip out that part of syntax. You can write a prefix character that doesn't stop at an ending character
but <i>always</i> stops when you read a certain number of tokens. You can feed user input into a math program and feed the
output into a syntax system like metacrank. The possibilities are endless! And with that, we will slowly build up the
<code>stem</code> programming language, v2, now with macros and from within our own <i>cognition</i>.

2crank ing 1 crank #comment: geti getd gets crankbase '' d '' i '\n' s ( drop halt crank s d i ) halt 1 1 metacrank
</pre>
<p>
and it is our first piece of code that builds something <i>truly</i> prefix. The comment character is a prefix that drops
all the text before the newline character, which is a type of word that tells the parser to <i>read ahead</i>. This is our
first indication that everything that we thought was possible within cognition truly <i>is</i>.
</p>

<p>
But before that, we can look at the first couple of lines:
</p>
<pre id="org2c444c5">2crank ing 0 crank ff 1
2crank ing 1 crank cut unaliasf
2crank ing 0 crank 0
2crank ing 1 crank cut swap quote def
2crank ing 0 crank
</pre>
<p>
which simply unaliases <code>f</code> from the falias list, with <code>ing</code> being the only remaining falias. In cognition, even these
faliases are changeable.
</p>

<p>
Since we can't put <code>f</code> directly on the stack (if we try by just using <code>f</code>, it would execute), we instead utilize some
very minimal string processing to do it, putting <code>ff</code> on the stack and then cutting the string in half to get two copies
of <code>f</code>. We then want <code>f</code> to mean false, which in cognition is just an empty word. Therefore, we make an empty word by
calling <code>0 cut</code> on this string, and then <code>def</code>-ing f to the empty string. The following code is where the comment is
defined:
</p>

<pre id="org7cec6fa">2crank ing 0 crank #
2crank ing 0 crank geti getd gets crankbase f d f i endl s
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose compose
2crank ing 0 crank drop halt crank s d i
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast quote compose
2crank ing 0 crank halt 1 quote ing 1 quote ing metacrank
2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose VMACRO cast
2crank ing 1 crank def
2crank ing 2 crank # singlet # delim
2crank ing 1 crank #comment: geti getd gets crankbase '' d '' i '\n' s ( drop halt crank s d i ) halt 1 1 metacrank
</pre>
<p>
Relevant: <code>halt</code> just puts you in 0 for all metacranks, and <code>VMACRO cast</code> just turns the top thing on the stack from a
container to a macro. <code>geti</code>, <code>getd</code>, <code>gets</code> gets the ignores, delims, and singlets respectively as a string; <code>drop</code> is
<code>dsc</code> in stem. <code>singlet</code> and <code>delim</code> sets the singlets and delimiters. <code>endl</code> is defined withint <code>bootstrap.cog</code> and just
puts the newline character as a word on the stack. <code>crankbase</code> gets the current crank.
</p>

<p>
we call a lot of <code>compose</code> words in order to build this definition, and we make the <code>#</code> character a singlet delimiter in
order to allow for spaces after the comment. We put ourselves in <code>1 1 metacrank</code> in the <code>#</code> definition while altering
the tokenization rules beforehand in order to tokenize everything until a newline as a token while calling <code>#</code> on said word
in order to effectively drop that comment and get ourselves back in the original crank and metacrank. Thus, the brilliant
<code>#</code> character is written, operating on a token that is tokenized <i>in the future</i>, with complete default postfix syntax.
With the information above, one can work out the specifics of how it works; the point is that it <i>does</i>, and one can test
that it does by going into the <code>coglib</code> folder and running <code>../crank bootstrap.cog repl.cog devel.cog load</code>, which will load
the REPL and load <code>devel.cog</code>, which will in turn load <code>comment.cog</code>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org44f030d">
<h3 id="org44f030d"><span>6.1.</span> The Great Escape</h3>
<div id="text-6-1">
<p>
Here, we accelerate our way out of this primitive syntax, and it all starts with the great escape character. We make
many great leaps in this section that aren't entirely explained for the sake of brevity, but you are free to play around
with all of these things by using the repl. In any case, I hope you will enjoy this great leap in syntax technology; by
the end, we will have reached something with real <i>structure</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here we define a preliminary prefix escape character. Also you will notice that <code>2crank ing 0 crank</code> is used as
padding between lines:
</p>
<pre id="org0e3b3d9">2crank ing 2 crank comment.cog load
2crank ing 0 crank
2crank ing 1 crank # preliminary escape character \
2crank ing 1 crank \

2crank ing 1 crank compose compose compose compose
2crank ing 2 crank VMACRO cast
2crank ing 1 crank def
2crank ing 0 crank
2crank ing 0 crank
</pre>
<p>
This allows for escaping so that we can put something on the stack even if it is to be evaluated,
but we want to redefine this character eventually to be compatible with stem-like quotes. We're
even using our comment character in order to annotate this code by now! Here is the full quote definition (once we have
this definition, we can use it to improve itself):
</p>
<pre id="orge6fa7f5">2crank ing 0 crank [

<p>
Um, it's quite the spectacle how Matthew Hinton ever came up with this thing, but alas, it exists. Then, we use it in
order to redefine itself, but better as the old quote definition can't do recursive quotes
(we can do this because the definition is <i>used</i> before you redefine the word due to postfix <code>def</code>, a
development pattern seen often in low level cognition):
</p>
<pre id="org83d40ff">\ [

<p>
Okay, so now we can use recursive quoting, just like in stem. But there are still a couple things missing that we probably
want: a good string quote implementation, and probably escape characters that work in the brackets. Also, since Cognition
utilizes macros, we probably want a way to notate those as well, and we probably want a way to expand macros. We can do
all of that! First, we will have to redefine <code>\</code> once more:
</p>
<pre id="org4a03906">\ \
[ [ 1 ] metacrankbase [ 1 ] = ]
[ halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank quote compose [ dup ] dip swap ]
\ VMACRO cast quote quote compose
[ halt [ 1 ] crank ] VMACRO cast quote quote compose
[ if halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank ] compose \ VMACRO cast
def
</pre>
<p>
This piece of code defines the bracket but for macros (split just splits a list into two):
</p>
<pre id="org0010001">\ (
\ [ unglue
[ 11 ] split swap [ 10 ] split drop [ macro ] compose
[ 18 ] split quote [ prepose ] compose dip
[ 17 ] split eval eval
[ 1 ] del [ \ ) ] [ 1 ] put
quote quote quote [ prepose ] compose dip
[ 16 ] split eval eval
[ 1 ] del [ \ ) ] [ 1 ] put
quote quote quote [ prepose ] compose dip
prepose
def
</pre>
<p>
We want these macros to automatically expand because it's more efficient to bind already expanded macros to words,
and they functionally evaluate identically (<code>isdef</code> just returns a boolean where true is a non-empty string, false
is an empty string, if a word is defined):
</p>
<pre id="org6f539f6">\ (
( crankbase [ 1 ] metacrankbase dup [ 1 ] =
  [ ( dup \ ) =
      ( drop swap drop swap [ 1 ] swap metacrank swap crank quote compose ( dup ) dip swap )
      ( dup dup dup \ [ = swap \ ( = or swap \ \ = or
        ( eval )
        ( dup isdef ( unglue ) [ ] if compose ( dup ) dip swap )
        if )
      if ) ]
  [ ( dup \ ) =
      ( drop swap drop swap [ 1 ] swap metacrank swap crank )
      ( dup dup dup \ [ = swap \ ( = or swap \ \ = or
        ( eval )
        ( dup isdef ( unglue ) [ ] if compose ( dup ) dip swap )
        if )
      if ) ]
  if dup macro swap
  [ 0 ] crank [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank ) def
</pre>
<p>
and you can see that as we define more things, our language is beginning to look more or less like it has syntax!
In this <code>quote.cog</code> file which we have been looking at, there are more things, but the bulk of it is pretty much done.
From here on, I will just explain the syntax programmed by quote.cog instead of showing the specific code.
</p>

<p>
As an example, here is <code>expand</code>:
</p>
<pre id="org5e3961a"># define basic expand (works on nonempty macros only)
[ expand ]
( macro swap
  ( [ 1 ] split
    ( isword ( dup isdef ( unglue ) ( ) if ) ( ) if compose ) dip
    size [ 0 ] &gt; ( ( ( dup ) dip swap ) dip swap eval ) ( ) if )
  dup ( swap ( swap ) dip ) dip eval drop swap drop ) def

# complete expand (checks for definitions within child first without copying hashtables)
[ expand ]
( size [ 0 ] &gt; ( type [ VSTACK ] = ) ( return ) if ?
  ( macro swap
    macro
    ( ( ( size dup [ 0 ] &gt; ) dip swap ) dip swap
      ( ( ( 1 - dup ( vat ) dip swap ( del ) dip ) dip compose ) dip dup eval )
      ( drop swap drop )
      if ) dup eval
    ( ( [ 1 ] split
        ( isword
          ( compose cd dup isdef
            ( unglue pop )
              ( pop dup isdef ( unglue ) ( ) if )
            if ) ( ) if
          ( swap ) dip compose swap ) dip
        size [ 0 ] &gt; ) dip swap
      ( dup eval ) ( drop drop swap compose ) if ) dup eval )
  ( expand )
  if ) def
</pre>
<p>
Which recursively expands word definitions inside a quote or macro, using the word <code>unglue</code>. We've used the <code>expand</code>
word in order to redefine itself in a more general case.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2 id="org2f4962b"><span>7.</span> The Brainfuck Dialect</h2>
<div id="text-7">
<p>
And returning to whence we came, we define the <i>Brainfuck</i> dialect with our current advanced stem dialect:
</p>
<pre id="orgda535e1">comment.cog load
quote.cog load

[ ] [ ] [ 0 ]

[ &gt; ] [[ swap [[ compose ]] dip size [ 0 ] = [ [ 0 ] ] [[ [ 1 ] split swap ]] if ]] def

      ( swap [ \ ] ] concat pick )
      if )
    ( dup [ \ [ ] =

      if )
    if )
  dup [ 1 ] swap f swap halt [ 1 ] [ 1 ] metacrank
) def

&gt;&lt;+-,.[] dup ( i s itgl f d ) eval
</pre>
<p>
test with <code>../crank -s 2 bootstrap.cog helloworld.bf brainfuck.cog</code>. You may of course load your favorite brainfuck
file with this method. Note that brainfuck.cog isn't a brainfuck parser in the ordinary sense; it actually
<i>defines brainfuck words</i> and <i>tokenizes</i> brainfuck, running it in the native cognition environment.
</p>

<p>
It's very profound, as well, how our current syntax allows us to define an <i>alternate</i> syntax with great ease. It might
make you wonder if it's possible to <i>specifically craft</i> a syntax whose job is to write other syntaxes. Another interesting
observation you might have is that Cognition defines syntax by defining a prefix character as a <i>word</i> that uses metacrank,
rather than reading symbols and deciding what to do based on symbols. It's almost as if the syntax becomes <i>inherent</i> to the
word that's being defined.
</p>

<p>
These two ideas synthesize to create something truly exciting, but that hasn't yet been implemented in the standard library
(though we very much know that it is possible). Introducing: the <i>dialect dialect</i> of Cognition…
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge3e7aa3">
<h3 id="orge3e7aa3"><span>7.1.</span> The Dialect Dialect</h3>
<div id="text-7-1">
<p>
Imagine a word <code>mkprefix</code>, that takes two input words (say for example <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>), and an operation, and
<i>automatically defines</i> <code>[</code> to apply said operation until it hits a <code>]</code> character. This is possible because constructs
like <code>metacrank</code> and <code>def</code> are all just <i>regular words</i>, so it's possible to use <i>them</i> as words to metaprogram with.
In fact, <i>everything</i> is just a word (even <code>d</code>, <code>i</code>, and <code>s</code>), so you can imagine a hyperabstract dialect that includes
words like <code>mkprefix</code>, using syntax to automate the process of implementing more syntax. Such a construct I have not
encountered in <i>any other programming language</i>. Yet, in your own <i>Cognition</i>, you can make nearly anything a reality.
</p>

<p>
Such creative things Matthew Hinton and I have discussed as possibilities regarding the standard library. Right now, the
standard library has metawords that generate abstract words automatically and call them. This is possible through string
concatenation and using <code>def</code> in the definition of another word also (this is also possible in my prior programming
language Stem). We have discussed the possibility of a word that searches for word-generators to abstract its current
wordlist automatically, and we have talked about the possibility of directing this abstraction framework for the purpose
of solving a problem. These are conceptually possible words to write within cognition, and this might give you an idea
of how <i>powerful</i> this idea is.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div id="outline-container-org4746985">
<h2 id="org4746985"><span>8.</span> Theoretical Musings</h2>
<p>
There are a couple of things about Cognition that make it interesting beyond its quirks. For instance,
string processing in this language is equivalent to tokenizer postprocessing, which makes string operations inherently
extremely powerful in this language. It also has potential applications in Symbolic AI and in syntax and grammar research,
where prototypes of languages and metalanguages can be tested with ease. I'd imagine that anyone configuring a program
that reads a configuration file would really want their configuration language to be something like this, where they can
have full freedom over the syntax (and metasyntax) in which they program in (think about a Cognition based shell,
or a Cognition based operating system!). Though, the point of working on this language was never its applications;
its intrinsic beauty is its own philosophical statement.
</p>
</div><div id="outline-container-org089e302">
<h2 id="org089e302"><span>9.</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>
You can imagine cognition can program basically any syntax you would want, and in this article, we demonstrate the power
of the already existing code that makes cognition work. In short, the system allows for true <i>syntax as code</i>, as my
friend Andrei put it; one can <i>dynamically program</i> and even <i>automate</i> the production of syntax. In this article, we
didn't have the space to cover other important Cognition concepts like the <i>Metastack</i> and words like <code>cd</code>, but this
can be done in a part 2 of this blog post. For now, let's leave off here, and we can meet here once more for a <i>part two</i>.

            <p>Researchers at the University of Florida report they have developed an mRNA cancer vaccine that quickly reprograms the immune system to attack glioblastoma in a first-ever human clinical trial of four adult patients.</p>
<p>Their results published in <em><a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24)00398-2">Cell</a> </em>mirror those from preclinical mouse studies, and from a newly reported trial with the mRNA vaccine in 10 pet dogs that developed spontaneous brain tumors. The dogs’ owners had approved their animals’ treatment using the new vaccine as there were no other therapy options. The researchers say the aim is to progress the mRNA vaccine into an expanded Phase I clinical trial involving adult and pediatric brain cancer patients.</p>
<p>The new strategy uses the patient’s own tumor cells to create a personalized vaccine, and also harnesses an engineered complex lipid particle (LP) delivery mechanism, generating multi-lamellar LP aggregates (LPA) that can simultaneously function as vaccines and as immunomodulating agents.</p>
<p>“Instead of us injecting single particles, we’re injecting clusters of particles that are wrapping around each other like onions, like a bag full of onions,” said Elias Sayour, MD, PhD, a UF Health pediatric oncologist who pioneered the new vaccine. “And the reason we’ve done that in the context of cancer is these clusters alert the immune system in a much more profound way than single particles would.” Results from the canine trial showed how the vaccine reprogrammed the tumor microenvironment (TME) within days, allowing the activated immune system cells to fight the tumor.</p>
<p>Among the most impressive findings from the reported study was how quickly the new vaccine, delivered intravenously, triggered a vigorous immune-system response to reject the tumor, said Sayour, who is principal investigator of the RNA Engineering Laboratory within UF’s&nbsp;Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy&nbsp;and a UF Health Cancer Center and McKnight Brain Institute investigator.</p>
<p>“In less than 48 hours, we could see these tumors shifting from what we refer to as ‘cold’—immune cold, very few immune cells, very silenced immune response—to ‘hot,’ very active immune response. That was very surprising given how quick this happened, and what that told us is we were able to activate the early part of the immune system very rapidly against these cancers, and that’s critical to unlock the later effects of the immune response.”</p>
<p>In their paper, the team stated, “In a first-in-human trial, RNA-LPAs elicited rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, and glioma-specific immune responses in glioblastoma patients … These data support RNA-LPAs as a new technology that simultaneously reprograms the TME while eliciting rapid and enduring cancer immunotherapy.”</p>
<p>Glioblastoma is the most aggressive and lethal type of brain tumor, with a median survival time of around 15 months. Current standard of care involves surgery, radiation, and some combination of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The new publication is the culmination of promising translational results over seven years of studies, starting in preclinical mouse models and then progressing to a study involving 10 pet dogs that had spontaneously developed terminal brain cancer and had no other treatment options. Dogs offer a naturally occurring model for malignant glioma because they are the only other species that develops spontaneous brain tumors with some frequency, said Sheila Carrera-Justiz, DVM, a veterinary neurologist at the UF College of Veterinary Medicine who is partnering with Sayour on the clinical trials. Gliomas in dogs are universally terminal, she noted.</p>
<p>The canine study yielded promising results, the team reported. “In client-owned canines with terminal gliomas, RNA-LPAs improved survivorship and reprogrammed the TME, which became ‘hot’ within days of a single infusion.” After treating the pet dogs with personalized mRNA vaccines, Sayour’s team then advanced the research to a small FDA-approved clinical trial in four human patients with primary MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma. The study was designed to ensure safety and test feasibility before expanding to a larger trial.</p>
<p>The vaccine was personalized to each patient, with the aim of maximizing immune system response. To generate each vaccine RNA was first extracted from each patient’s own surgically removed tumor, and then the messenger RNA was amplified and wrapped in the newly designed packaging of biocompatible lipid nanoparticles, to make tumor cells “look” like a dangerous virus when reinjected into the bloodstream and prompt an immune-system response.</p>
<p>“In a first-in-human accelerated-dose titration [ADT] study (n = 3), we show that RNA-LPAs elicit rapid cytokine/chemokine release, immune activation/trafficking, and expansion of T cell immunity in immunotherapy-refractory MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma patients,” the team stated. “In the first subject treated on the expanded Phase I trial, we observed significant immunologic response after the fourth vaccine, including tissue-confirmed pseudoprogression, supporting the ability of RNA-LPAs to act as both the peripheral and intratumoral immunomodulators while simultaneously eliciting antigen-specific immunity against glioma-associated antigens.”</p>
<p>Co-author Duane Mitchell, MD, PhD, director of the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute and the UF Brain Tumor Immunotherapy Program, further stated, “The demonstration that making an mRNA cancer vaccine in this fashion generates similar and strong responses across mice, pet dogs that have developed cancer spontaneously, and human patients with brain cancer is a really important finding, because oftentimes we don’t know how well the preclinical studies in animals are going to translate into similar responses in patients. And while mRNA vaccines and therapeutics are certainly a hot topic since the COVID pandemic, this is a novel and unique way of delivering the mRNA to generate these really significant and rapid immune responses that we’re seeing across animals and humans.”</p>
<p>The authors acknowledged that it is too early in the trial to assess the clinical effects of the vaccine, but the canine patients lived a median of 139 days, compared with a median survival of 30–60 days typical for dogs with the condition. The authors also noted that one limitation is continued uncertainty about how best to harness the immune system while minimizing the potential for adverse side effects. “Although innate and adaptive responses are critical for cancer immunotherapy, it is not clear how to time the administration of RNA-LPAs (neoadjuvant versus adjuvant treatment) and booster infusions (weekly, biweekly, monthly), or the associated frequency (number of total vaccines), all while reconciling these administrations with standard-of-care approaches including chemoradiation,” they added. With this knowledge, they suggested, it may be possible to develop mRNA backbone constructs that then balance innate and adaptive immunity to maximize the effects.</p>
<p>But despite the noted limitations, the authors wrote, “The work herein reports a distinct approach to reprogram innate immunity while simultaneously polarizing adaptive immune responses. These data highlight the importance of innate immunity in overcoming tumor-mediated immunosuppression, which is essential for the long-term success of adaptive immunotherapy in many immunologically ‘‘cold’’ tumors.” The results, they pointed out, “… show that RNA-LPAs rapidly reprogram the TME in less than 24 h, allowing simultaneously activated T cells to exert their effector functions. This approach overcomes the first step necessary for successful cancer immunotherapy, tumor immunosuppression and systemic tolerance, allowing effector cells to compete in a hostile immunoregulatory host system to engender rapid and long-lasting immunologic responses across murine, canine, and human cancer.”</p>
<p>The next step will be an expanded Phase I clinical trial, including up to 24 adult and pediatric patients, to validate the initial findings. Once an optimal and safe dose is confirmed, an estimated 25 children would participate in Phase II, said Sayour, an associate professor in the Lillian S. Wells Department of Neurosurgery and the department of pediatrics in the UF College of Medicine, part of UF Health.</p>
<p>For the new clinical trial, Sayour’s lab will partner with a multi-institution consortium, the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium, to send the immunotherapy treatment to children’s hospitals across the country. They will do this by receiving an individual patient’s tumor, manufacturing the personalized vaccine at UF and sending it back to the patient’s medical team, said Sayour, co-leader of the Immuno-Oncology and Microbiome research program at the UF Health Cancer Center.</p>
<p>The researchers are hopeful that this could be a new paradigm for how patients are treated and a new platform technology for how the immune system can be modulated. “I am hopeful for how this could now synergize with other immunotherapies and perhaps unlock those immunotherapies,”concluded Sayour. “We showed in this paper that you actually can have synergy with other types of immunotherapies, so maybe now we can have a combination approach of immunotherapy.”</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Years of accumulated security debt at Microsoft are seemingly crashing down upon the company in a manner that many critics warned about, but few ever believed would actually come to light.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft is an entrenched enterprise provider, owning nearly one-quarter of the </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/cloud-market-gets-its-mojo-back-q4-increase-in-cloud-spending-reaches-new-highs"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>global cloud infrastructure services</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> market and, as of Q1 last year, nearly 20% of the worldwide SaaS application market, according to Synergy Research Group.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Though not immune to scandal, in the wake of two major nation-state breaches of its core enterprise platforms, Microsoft is facing one of its most serious reputational crises.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>



<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“It’s certainly not the first time a nation-state adversary has breached Microsoft’s cloud environments and after so many instances, empty promises of improved security are no longer enough,” </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Adam Meyers, SVP of counter adversary operations at CrowdStrike</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, said via email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In January, Microsoft said a Russia-backed threat group called Midnight Blizzard, </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/federal-agencies-credentials-exposed/713064/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>gained access to emails</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, credentials and other sensitive information from top Microsoft executives, certain corporate customers and a number of federal agencies.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Then in early April, the federal Cyber Safety Review Board</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cyber-safety-review-board-releases-report-microsoft-online-exchange-incident-summer-2023">released a long-anticipated report</a> which showed the company failed to prevent a massive 2023 hack of its Microsoft Exchange Online environment. The hack by a People’s Republic of China-linked espionage actor led to the theft of </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>60,000 State Department emails and gained access to other high-profile officials.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Just weeks ago, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/federal-agencies-credentials-exposed/713064/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>issued an emergency directive</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, which orders federal civilian agencies to mitigate vulnerabilities in their networks, analyze the content of stolen emails, reset credentials and take additional steps to secure Microsoft Azure accounts. While the order only applies to Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies, CISA warned other organizations could be impacted.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For many critics of Microsoft, the events of the past nine months are the logical conclusion of a company that has ridden the wave of market dominance for decades and ignored years of warnings that its product security and practices failed to meet the most basic standards.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>


<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“In a healthy marketplace, these would be fireable offenses,” said </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>AJ Grotto, director of the Program of Geopolitics, Technology and Governance at the Stanford Cyber Policy Center and a former White House director for cyber policy</span>. “Regrettably, the marketplace is far from healthy — Microsoft has the government locked in as a customer, so the government’s options for forcing change at Microsoft are limited, at least in the short term.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The concern was, and is, that Microsoft's security gaps would potentially lead to catastrophic outcomes.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft needs to dedicate its internal resources towards zero-trust initiatives and make new investments in its infrastructure, according to</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> Karan Sondhi,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CTO, public sector at Trellix.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Currently, Microsoft directs the vast majority of their security investments in revenue generating roles instead of internal security roles,” Sondhi said via email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has a considerable stake in the cloud security space. Not only is Microsoft one of the world’s largest cloud providers, but it is also a major security provider to the enterprise. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has more than 1 million security customers, with 700,000 using four or more of its security products, CEO Satya Nadella said during the company’s fiscal second quarter conference call in January</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The company generates more than $20 billion in revenue per year from its security business.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Vulnerable ecosystem</span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The state-linked activity targeting Microsoft systems also impacted on other companies that use Microsoft products —&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/hpe-cyberattack-email-stolen/705615/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Hewlett Packard Enterprise disclosed</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> it was impacted by ongoing activity from the threat group as well.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>HPE in January said Midnight Blizzard gained access to a small number of company mailboxes dating back to May 2023, stealing data from executives in cybersecurity and other key departments, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The activity appears to be related to the access and exfiltration of SharePoint files, according to the filing.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>HPE in January told Cybersecurity Dive the threat actor “used a compromised account to gain unauthorized access to the Office 365 email environment." HPE has declined to comment further on the Midnight Blizzard threat activity beyond its SEC filings.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/32471/html#d808756dex991.htm"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>in a March filing with the SEC</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, said Midnight Blizzard was trying to use various secrets it stole from the company. Microsoft said it had shared secrets with certain customers via email, and was reaching out to those customers to help them take mitigation steps.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Midnight Blizzard has repeatedly launched attacks against Microsoft customers using a variety of means, including password spray attacks and social engineering.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>CISA and other officials are still assessing the ongoing threat from the Midnight Blizzard attacks to federal agencies and other Microsoft customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Center for Internet Security, through the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center, provided “intelligence and response information regarding the campaign of activity targeting Microsoft products,” said </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Randy Rose, VP of security operations and intelligence at CIS.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Rose confirmed a “low number” of MS-ISAC participants were notified that they were likely impacted. However, there were no reports of external activity linked to this and no reports of incident response.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Indeed, the CSRB report </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2024/04/02/cyber-safety-review-board-releases-report-microsoft-online-exchange-incident-summer"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>laid out a blistering assessment of a corporate culture</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> that has failed for years to take cybersecurity seriously.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>


<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The report was designed to assess the company’s response to the summer 2023 breach from the People’s Republic of China-linked threat actor that breached the company’s Microsoft Online Exchange environment.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>However, it also laid out a security culture that failed to adhere to the most basic standards, given the enormous market power that Microsoft yields across modern business applications in government and the private sector.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>One of the more damaging findings was that Microsoft learned of the attacks only because the State Department had set up an internal alert system after purchasing a G5 license from the company. Customers who failed to purchase the enhanced license, were not able to see the extensive logging capabilities that would have alerted them to a breach.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Failure of accountability </span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Many in the security community see the CSRB report and the recent CISA emergency directive as direct indictments not only of Microsoft’s security culture, but a government that has allowed Microsoft to maintain lucrative government contracts with no fear of competition across many of its services.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The federal government gets off the hook a little easy in this report,” said </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mark Montgomery, senior director at the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>. “</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Despite significant encouragement from outside experts, the Biden administration, and its predecessors, have failed to treat cloud computing as a national critical infrastructure, that is itself critical to maintaining the security of our national critical infrastructures.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden_letter_to_cisa_doj_ftc_re_2023_microsoft_breach.pdf"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>who called for a federal investigation</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> following the State Department email hack, said the federal government shared responsibility for the negligent behavior disclosed in the report.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Wyden said Microsoft has been rewarded with billions of dollars in federal contracts, while not being held to account for even the most basic security standards.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>“Many switched to Exchange Online or Microsoft 365 to get away from on-premise servers and [managed service providers]. If the other choice is going 'back' —&nbsp;or a potentially disruptive switch to another platform like Google Workspace —&nbsp;they most often just ride it out and trust Microsoft to fix the issues.”</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“The government’s dependence on Microsoft</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>poses a serious national security threat, which requires strong action,” Wyden told Cybersecurity Dive after the CSRB report was released earlier this month.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Technology vendors should be held to strict cybersecurity standards, use independent audits to make sure vendors are adhering to those standards and if violated, the company and senior executives must be held accountable, Wyden said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft officials said they understand the larger concerns raised by the summer 2023 attacks and the continued threat from Midnight Blizzard and other nation-state actors. The company is working to make extensive changes in its engineering processes, improve its relationships with the security community and its responsiveness to customer needs.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>“We are energized and focused on executing Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative commitments,” </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Bret Arsenault, corporate VP and chief cybersecurity advisor at Microsoft,</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>said in a statement. “And this is just the beginning. We commit to sharing transparent learnings and future milestones as part of our efforts to strengthen all systems against attacks.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As part of the larger shakeup of Microsoft’s security operations, </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie--bell/recent-activity/all/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft in December named</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> Igor Tsyganskiy to take over as the new global CISO effective Jan. 1, moving Arsenault out of that role after 14 years.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Aresenault pointed out that since launching the company’s Secure Future Initiative in November, the company has </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/03/06/enhancing-protection-updates-on-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>sped up related engineering work</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span> in several areas:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has accelerated the lifecycle management of tenants, with a focus on either unused or older systems. The company eliminated more than 1.7 million Entra ID systems related to used, aging or legacy technology. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;It has also made multifactor authentication enforcement automatic across more than 1 million Entra ID tenants.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>More than 730,000 apps have been removed across production and corporate tenants that were either out of lifecycle or not meeting current SFI standards.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>New employees and vendors are given short-term credentials to make impersonation and credential theft more difficult. More than 270,000 have been implemented thus far.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The company’s internal MFA implementation using Microsoft authenticator has been enhanced, by eliminating a call feature and relying on an in-app login feature. This change covers more than 300,000 employees and vendors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Customer renewal or rejection</span></span></strong></span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>How private industry and government agencies respond to these security challenges is a near-term concern for Microsoft.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Dante Stella, an attorney at Dykema and specialist in incident response</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, says enterprise customers do not usually walk away in the face of nation-state threats against Microsoft, in part due to its enormous presence as a cloud provider.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“Many switched to Exchange Online or Microsoft 365 to get away from on-premise servers and [managed service providers]," Stella said via email. “If the other choice is going 'back' —&nbsp;or a potentially disruptive switch to another platform like Google Workspace —&nbsp;they most often just ride it out and trust Microsoft to fix the issues.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Attacks like these will spur proactive security measures at many companies, for example increasing employee training, upgrading email security to an E5 level, adopting the use of audit logs and increasing the use of encryption during file transfers, Stella said.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>E5 is considered the premium tier for Microsoft 365 customers, offering enhanced security and other services, he said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Though Nadella says security is </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/microsoft-ceo-security-priority/714450/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft's No. 1 priority</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>, the company also has raced to develop artificial intelligence and incorporate it into its products.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft has placed a major bet that customers will embrace its effort to incorporate AI into its security product platforms. Microsoft said, after months of testing with customers, that Security Copilot helped security analysts be 22% faster and 7% more accurate.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In addition, the company sees a larger number of Microsoft 365 customers embracing E5, which provides enhanced security protection and is reflected in higher average revenue per user.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft </span></span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/03/13/microsoft-copilot-for-security-is-generally-available-on-april-1-2024-with-new-capabilities/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>made Security Copilot generally available earlier this month</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span> and is offering the technology on a pay as you go basis to make it more affordable to a wider range of customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Sixty years ago, on May 1, 1964, at <a href="https://www.dartmouth.edu/basicfifty/basic.html">4 am in the morning</a>, a quiet revolution in computing began at Dartmouth College. That's when mathematicians John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz successfully ran the first program written in their newly developed BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) programming language on the college's General Electric GE-225 mainframe.</p>
<p>Little did they know that their creation would go on to democratize computing and inspire generations of programmers over the next six decades.</p>
<h2>What is BASIC?</h2>
<p>In its most traditional form, BASIC is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreted</a> programming language that runs line by line, with line numbers. A typical program might look something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 PRINT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME?"</p>
<p>20 INPUT N$</p>
<p>30 PRINT "HELLO, ";N$</p></blockquote>
<p>Programs could jump between lines using commands like GOTO, which often led to simple looping programs created by beginners that would fill the screen with repeating words. Or one could quickly write a program that counted upward toward infinity like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>10 LET X=X+1</p>
<p>20 PRINT X</p>
<p>30 GOTO 10</p></blockquote>
<p>Today, most programming languages use different types of structural paradigms (such as functions and object-oriented programming), but the easy-to-grasp syntax of BASIC, with its plain English keywords, proved popular and easy to use for beginners.</p>
<h2>The journey to BASIC</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/825555/where-did-the-term-computer-user-come-from/">Before</a> early computers became small, inexpensive, and "personal," they were difficult to use. At first, programming a computer involved literally connecting wires, then flipping switches, and even punching paper cards. Over time, engineers <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/2580/vcg-anthology-the-evolution-of-computer-displays#more-2580">developed ways</a> to abstract away low-level programming operations with a more friendly interface. That's where programming languages come in.</p>

BASIC's creators used a similar computer four years later to develop the programming language.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Prior to BASIC, programming languages like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL">Algol</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> proved complex and were primarily used by professionals. Kemeny and Kurtz saw a need for amateurs who were not dedicated computer engineers to be able to use computers as well. Their journey to create a more user-friendly language began in 1956 with Dartmouth Simplified Code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARSIMCO">DARSIMSCO</a>), followed by the Dartmouth Oversimplified Programming Experiment (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Oversimplified_Programming_Experiment">DOPE</a>). While DOPE proved too simple to be of much use, the lessons learned from these projects informed the development of BASIC, which started in 1963.</p>
<p>In the same year, Kemeny applied for a National Science Foundation grant to bring a <a href="https://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/GE225.html">GE-225 computer</a> to Dartmouth and build the first fully functional general-purpose time-sharing system. Despite the grant referees' doubts about his plan to accomplish the work with a group of undergraduates, Kemeny secured the funding.</p>
<p>Together with Kurtz and a group of undergraduate students, Kemeny built a time-sharing system to open computer access to all at Dartmouth. The simplicity and power of BASIC quickly made it a favorite among students and faculty alike.</p>
<h2>BASIC goes PC</h2>

<p>As part of the deal to buy the GE 225 computer, Kemeny, Kurtz, and others had earlier built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_Time_Sharing_System">time sharing operating system</a> for General Electric. BASIC running on this operating system allowed colleges, high schools, and individuals across the country to dial into mainframe computers and write programs using the language. The impact of BASIC began to extend far beyond Dartmouth's campus.</p>                                            
                                                        

<p>In 1975, Paul Allen and Bill Gates adapted the language for personal computers like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800">Altair 8800</a>, expanding its reach to a new audience of small computer owners and founding Microsoft in the process. In 1976, Steve Wozniak <a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-steve-wozniak-wrote-basic-for-the-original-apple-fr-1570573636">developed a BASIC interpreter from scratch</a> for the Apple I using self-taught methods and minimal resources. This became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_BASIC">Integer BASIC</a> for the Apple II a year later, and BASIC (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applesoft_BASIC">Applesoft BASIC</a>) remained a key part of the Apple II throughout the platform's lifespan.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, BASIC continued its prominent role as a programming interface and quasi-operating system for popular home computers such as the <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432140/how-atari-took-on-apple-in-the-1980s-home-pc-wars">Atari 800</a>, TRS-80, Commodore VIC-20, Commodore 64, TI-99/4A, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/bbc-basic-keeps-evolving-and-now-you-can-run-it-on-nearly-any-platform/">BBC Micro</a>, and the IBM PC, where it either came preinstalled in ROM as part of the operating system or shipped as an easily accessible programming environment. Early computer magazines such as Compute! <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2018/11/first-encounter-compute-magazine-and-its-glorious-tedious-type-in-code/">printed BASIC code listings</a> that could be typed in line by line.</p>
<h2>BASIC today</h2>
<p>Today, BASIC remains popular in hobbyist retrocomputing circles, but few use it as a practical language. And yet it never truly died out—instead, it continued to evolve.</p>
<p>Many other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC#Post-1990_versions_and_dialects">BASIC dialects</a> exist today for different platforms, but some of Microsoft's are most commonly used. After Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GW-BASIC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBASIC">QuickBasic</a>, descendants of BASIC such as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/28/nostalgic_for_basic/">Visual Basic</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">Visual Basic for Applications</a> (VBA), and <a href="https://smallbasic-publicwebsite.azurewebsites.net/">Microsoft Small Basic</a> live on. Visual Basic, introduced by Microsoft in 1991, became a popular choice for developing Windows applications, while VBA is widely used for scripting and automation in Microsoft Office applications. Microsoft Small Basic, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/11/yet-another-programming-language-from-microsoft-small-basic/">released in 2008</a>, serves as an educational tool for teaching programming concepts to beginners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, other modern languages, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>, have taken on roles similar to those once filled by BASIC. These languages prioritize simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making them popular choices for introductory programming courses and rapid application development.</p>
<p>Despite the decline in its practical use, BASIC's legacy lives on through its influence on subsequent programming languages and its role in making computing accessible to a broader audience. As we commemorate the 60th anniversary of BASIC, let's raise a glass to Kemeny and Kurtz for empowering several generations of young computer programmers.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://go.dev/blog/">The Go Blog</a></h2>
    

    
      
      
      
      <p>Since Go 1 was <a href="https://go.dev/blog/go1">released in March 2012</a>,
changes to the standard library have been
constrained by Go’s <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">compatibility promise</a>.
Overall, compatibility has been a boon for Go users,
providing a stable base for production systems,
documentation, tutorials, books, and more.
Over time, however, we’ve realized mistakes in the original APIs
that cannot be fixed compatibly; in other cases,
best practices and convention have changed.
We need a plan for making important, breaking changes too.</p>
<p>This blog post is about Go 1.22’s new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/v2/"><code>math/rand/v2</code></a> package,
the first “v2” in the standard library.
It brings needed improvements to the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/"><code>math/rand</code></a> API,
but more importantly it sets an example for how we can
revise other standard library packages as the need arises.</p>
<p>(In Go, <code>math/rand</code> and <code>math/rand/v2</code> are two different packages
with different import paths.
Go 1 and every release after it have included <code>math/rand</code>; Go 1.22 added <code>math/rand/v2</code>.
A Go program can import either package, or both.)</p>
<p>This post discusses the specific rationale for the changes in <code>math/rand/v2</code>
and then <a href="#principles">reflects on the general principles</a> that will guide
new versions of other packages.</p>
<h2 id="pseudo">Pseudorandom Number Generators</h2>
<p>Before we look at <code>math/rand</code>, which is an API for a pseudorandom number generator,
let’s take a moment to understand what that means.</p>
<p>A pseudorandom number generator is a deterministic program
that generates a long sequence of
seemingly random numbers from a small seed input,
although the numbers are not in fact random at all.
In the case of <code>math/rand</code>, the seed is a single int64,
and the algorithm produces a sequence of int64s
using a variant of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear-feedback_shift_register" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">linear-feedback shift register (LFSR)</a>.
The algorithm is based on an idea by George Marsaglia,
tweaked by Don Mitchell and Jim Reeds,
and further customized by Ken Thompson for Plan 9 and then Go.
It has no official name, so this post calls it the Go 1 generator.</p>
<p>The goal is for these generators to be fast,
repeatable, and random enough to support simulations,
shuffling, and other non-cryptographic use cases.
Repeatability is particularly important for uses like
numerical simulations or randomized testing.
For example, a randomized tester might pick a seed
(perhaps based on the current time), generate
a large random test input, and repeat.
When the tester finds a failure, it only needs to print the seed
to allow repeating the test with that specific large input.</p>
<p>Repeatability also matters over time: given a particular
seed, a new version of Go needs to generate the same
sequence of values that an older version did.
We didn’t realize this when we released Go 1;
instead, we discovered it the hard way,
when we tried to make a change in Go 1.2
and got reports that we had broken certain tests
and other use cases.
At that point, we decided Go 1 compatibility included
the specific random outputs for a given seed
and <a href="https://go.dev/change/5aca0514941ce7dd0f3cea8d8ffe627dbcd542ca">added a test</a>.</p>
<p>It is not a goal for these kinds of generators to produce
random numbers suitable for deriving cryptographic keys
or other important secrets.
Because the seed is only 63 bits,
any output drawn from the generator, no matter how long,
will also only contain 63 bits of entropy.
For example, using <code>math/rand</code> to generate a 128-bit or 256-bit AES key
would be a serious mistake,
since the key would be easier to brute force.
For that kind of use, you need a cryptographically strong
random number generator, as provided by <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/crypto/rand/"><code>crypto/rand</code></a>.</p>
<p>That’s enough background that we can move on to what needed
fixing in the <code>math/rand</code> package.</p>
<h2 id="problems">Problems with <code>math/rand</code></h2>
<p>Over time, we noticed more and more problems with <code>math/rand</code>.
The most serious were the following.</p>
<h3 id="problem.generator">Generator Algorithm</h3>
<p>The generator itself needed replacement.</p>
<p>The initial implementation of Go, while production ready, was in many ways a “pencil sketch”
of the entire system, working well enough to serve as a base for future development:
the compiler and runtime were written in C; the garbage collector was a conservative, single-threaded,
stop-the-world collector; and the libraries used basic implementations throughout.
From Go 1 through around Go 1.5, we went back and drew the “fully inked”
version of each of these: we converted the compiler and runtime to Go; we wrote a new, precise, parallel,
concurrent garbage collection with microsecond pause times; and we replaced
standard library implementations with more sophisticated, optimized algorithms
as needed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the repeatability requirement in <code>math/rand</code>
meant that we couldn’t replace the generator there without
breaking compatibility.
We were stuck with the Go 1 generator,
which is reasonably fast (about 1.8ns per number on my M3 Mac)
but maintains an internal state of almost 5 kilobytes.
In contrast, Melissa O’Neill’s <a href="https://www.pcg-random.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">PCG family of generators</a>
generates better random numbers in about 2.1ns per number
with only 16 bytes of internal state.
We also wanted to explore using
Daniel J. Bernstein’s <a href="https://cr.yp.to/chacha.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">ChaCha stream cipher</a>
as a generator.
A followup post will discuss that generator specifically.</p>
<h3 id="problem.source">Source Interface</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Source"><code>rand.Source</code> interface</a> was wrong.
That interface defines the
concept of a low-level random number generator that generates
non-negative <code>int64</code> values:</p>
<pre><code>% go doc -src math/rand.Source
package rand // import "math/rand"

// A Source represents a source of uniformly-distributed
// pseudo-random int64 values in the range [0, 1&lt;&lt;63).
//
// A Source is not safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.
type Source interface {
    Int63() int64
    Seed(seed int64)
}

func NewSource(seed int64) Source
%
</code></pre>
<p>(In the doc comment, “[0, N)” denotes a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Definitions_and_terminology" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">half-open interval</a>,
meaning the range includes 0 but ends just before 2⁶³.)</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Rand"><code>rand.Rand</code> type</a> wraps a <code>Source</code>
to implement a richer set of operations, such as
generating <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Rand.Intn">an integer between 0 and N</a>,
generating <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Rand.Float64">floating-point numbers</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>We defined the <code>Source</code> interface to return a shortened 63-bit value
instead of a uint64 because that’s what the Go 1 generator and
other widely-used generators produce,
and it matches the convention set by the C standard library.
But this was a mistake: more modern generators produce full-width uint64s,
which is a more convenient interface.</p>
<p>Another problem is the <code>Seed</code> method hard-coding an <code>int64</code> seed:
some generators are seeded by larger values,
and the interface provides no way to handle that.</p>
<h3 id="problem.seed">Seeding Responsibility</h3>
<p>A bigger problem with <code>Seed</code> is that responsibility for seeding the global generator was unclear.
Most users don’t use <code>Source</code> and <code>Rand</code> directly.
Instead, the <code>math/rand</code> package provides a global generator
accessed by top-level functions like <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Intn"><code>Intn</code></a>.
Following the C standard library, the global generator defaults to
behaving as if <code>Seed(1)</code> is called at startup.
This is good for repeatability but bad for programs that want
their random outputs to be different from one run to the next.
The package documentation suggests using <code>rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())</code> in that case,
to make the generator’s output time-dependent,
but what code should do this?</p>
<p>Probably the main package should be in charge of how <code>math/rand</code> is seeded:
it would be unfortunate for imported libraries to configure global state themselves,
since their choices might conflict with other libraries or the main package.
But what happens if a library needs some random data and wants to use <code>math/rand</code>?
What if the main package doesn’t even know <code>math/rand</code> is being used?
We found that in practice many libraries add init functions
that seed the global generator with the current time, “just to be sure”.</p>
<p>Library packages seeding the global generator themselves causes a new problem.
Suppose package main imports two packages that both use <code>math/rand</code>:
package A assumes the global generator will be seeded by package main,
but package B seeds it in an <code>init</code> func.
And suppose that package main doesn’t seed the generator itself.
Now package A’s correct operation depends on the coincidence that package B is also
imported in the program.
If package main stops importing package B, package A will stop getting random values.
We observed this happening in practice in large codebases.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was clearly a mistake to follow the C standard library here:
seeding the global generator automatically would remove the confusion
about who seeds it, and users would stop being surprised by repeatable
output when they didn’t want that.</p>
<h3 id="problem.scale">Scalability</h3>
<p>The global generator also did not scale well.
Because top-level functions like <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Intn"><code>rand.Intn</code></a>
can be called simultaneously from multiple goroutines,
the implementation needed a lock protecting the shared generator state.
In parallel usage, acquiring and releasing this lock was more expensive
than the actual generation.
It would make sense instead to have a per-thread generator state,
but doing so would break repeatability
in programs without concurrent use of <code>math/rand</code>.</p>
<h3 id="problem.rand">The <code>Rand</code> implementation was missing important optimizations</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Rand"><code>rand.Rand</code> type</a> wraps a <code>Source</code>
to implement a richer set of operations
For example, here is the Go 1 implementation of <code>Int63n</code>, which returns
a random integer in the range [0, <code>n</code>).</p>
<pre><code>func (r *Rand) Int63n(n int64) int64 {
    if n &lt;= 0 {
        panic("invalid argument to Int63n")
    }
    max := int64((1&lt;&lt;63 - 1)  - (1&lt;&lt;63)%uint64(n))
    v := r.src.Int63()
    for v &gt; max {
        v = r.Int63()
    }
    return v % n
}
</code></pre>
<p>The actual conversion is easy: <code>v % n</code>.
However, no algorithm can convert 2⁶³ equally likely values
into <code>n</code> equally likely values unless 2⁶³ is a multiple of <code>n</code>:
otherwise some outputs will necessarily happen more often
than others. (As a simpler example, try converting 4 equally likely values into 3.)
The code computes <code>max</code> such that
<code>max+1</code> is the largest multiple of <code>n</code> less than or equal to 2⁶³,
and then the loop rejects random values greater than or equal to <code>max+1</code>.
Rejecting this too-large values ensures that all <code>n</code> outputs are equally likely.
For small <code>n</code>, needing to reject any value at all is rare;
rejection becomes more common and more important for larger values.
Even without the rejection loop, the two (slow) modulus operations
can make the conversion more expensive than generating the random value <code>v</code>
in the first place.</p>
<p>In 2018, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10941" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Daniel Lemire found an algorithm</a>
that avoids the divisions nearly all the time
(see also his <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2019/06/06/nearly-divisionless-random-integer-generation-on-various-systems/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">2019 blog post</a>).
In <code>math/rand</code>, adopting Lemire’s algorithm would make <code>Intn(1000)</code> 20-30% faster,
but we can’t: the faster algorithm generates different values than the standard conversion,
breaking repeatability.</p>
<p>Other methods are also slower than they could be, constrained by repeatability.
For example, the <code>Float64</code> method could easily be sped up by about 10%
if we could change the generated value stream.
(This was the change we tried to make in Go 1.2 and rolled back, mentioned earlier.)</p>
<h3 id="problem.read">The <code>Read</code> Mistake</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, <code>math/rand</code> is not intended for
and not suitable for generating cryptographic secrets.
The <code>crypto/rand</code> package does that, and its fundamental
primitive is its <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/crypto/rand/#Read"><code>Read</code> function</a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/crypto/rand/#Reader"><code>Reader</code></a> variable.</p>
<p>In 2015, we accepted a proposal to make
<code>rand.Rand</code> implement <code>io.Reader</code> as well,
along with <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Read">adding a top-level <code>Read</code> function</a>.
This seemed reasonable at the time,
but in retrospect we did not pay enough attention to the
software engineering aspects of this change.
Now if you want to read random data, now you have
two choices: <code>math/rand.Read</code> and <code>crypto/rand.Read</code>.
If the data is going to be used for key material,
it is very important to use <code>crypto/rand</code>,
but now it is possible to use <code>math/rand</code> instead,
potentially with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p>Tools like <code>goimports</code> and <code>gopls</code> have a special case
to make sure they prefer to use <code>rand.Read</code> from
<code>crypto/rand</code> instead of <code>math/rand</code>, but that’s not a complete fix.
It would be better to remove <code>Read</code> entirely.</p>
<h2 id="fix.v1">Fixing <code>math/rand</code> directly</h2>
<p>Making a new, incompatible major version of a package is never our first choice:
that new version only benefits programs that switch to it,
leaving all existing usage of the old major version behind.
In contrast, fixing a problem in the existing package has much more impact,
since it fixes all the existing usage.
We should never create a <code>v2</code> without doing as much as possible to fix <code>v1</code>.
In the case of <code>math/rand</code>, we were able to partly address
a few of the problems described above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Go 1.8 introduced an optional <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Uint64"><code>Source64</code> interface</a> with a <code>Uint64</code> method.
If a <code>Source</code> also implements <code>Source64</code>, then <code>Rand</code> uses that method
when appropriate.
This “extension interface” pattern provides a compatible (if slightly awkward)
way to revise an interface after the fact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go 1.20 automatically seeded the top-level generator and
deprecated <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Seed"><code>rand.Seed</code></a>.
Although this may seem like an incompatible change
given our focus on repeatability of the output stream,
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/56319">we reasoned</a> that any imported package that called <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Int"><code>rand.Int</code></a>
at init time or inside any computation would also
visibly change the output stream, and surely adding or removing
such a call cannot be considered a breaking change.
And if that’s true, then auto-seeding is no worse,
and it would eliminate this source of fragility for future programs.
We also added a <a href="https://go.dev/doc/godebug">GODEBUG setting</a> to opt
back into the old behavior.
Then we marked the top-level <code>rand.Seed</code> as <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/Deprecated">deprecated</a>.
(Programs that need seeded repeatability can still use
<code>rand.New(rand.NewSource(seed))</code> to obtain a local generator
instead of using the global one.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Having eliminated repeatability of the global output stream,
Go 1.20 was also able to make the global generator scale better
in programs that don’t call <code>rand.Seed</code>,
replacing the Go 1 generator with a very cheap per-thread
<a href="https://github.com/wangyi-fudan/wyhash" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">wyrand generator</a>
already used inside the Go runtime. This removed the global mutex
and made the top-level functions scale much better.
Programs that do call <code>rand.Seed</code> fall back to the
mutex-protected Go 1 generator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We were able to adopt Lemire’s optimization in the Go runtime,
and we also used it inside <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Shuffle"><code>rand.Shuffle</code></a>,
which was implemented after Lemire’s paper was published.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Although we couldn’t remove <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/#Read"><code>rand.Read</code></a> entirely,
Go 1.20 marked it <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/Deprecated">deprecated</a> in favor of
<code>crypto/rand</code>.
We have since heard from people who discovered that they were accidentally
using <code>math/rand.Read</code> in cryptographic contexts when their editors
flagged the use of the deprecated function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These fixes are imperfect and incomplete but also real improvements
that helped all users of the existing <code>math/rand</code> package.
For more complete fixes, we needed to turn our attention to <code>math/rand/v2</code>.</p>
<h2 id="fix.v2">Fixing the rest in <code>math/rand/v2</code></h2>
<p>Defining <code>math/rand/v2</code> took
significant planning,
then a <a href="https://go.dev/issue/60751">GitHub Discussion</a>
and then a <a href="https://go.dev/issue/61716">proposal discussion</a>.
It is the same
as <code>math/rand</code> with the following breaking changes
addressing the problems outlined above:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We removed the Go 1 generator entirely, replacing it with two new generators,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/v2/#PCG">PCG</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/v2/#ChaCha8">ChaCha8</a>.
The new types are named for their algorithms (avoiding the generic name <code>NewSource</code>)
so that if another important algorithm needs to be added, it will fit well into the
naming scheme.</p>
<p>Adopting a suggestion from the proposal discussion, the new types implement the
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/#BinaryMarshaler"><code>encoding.BinaryMarshaler</code></a>
and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/#BinaryUnmarshaler"><code>encoding.BinaryUnmarshaler</code></a>
interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We changed the <code>Source</code> interface, replacing the <code>Int63</code> method with a <code>Uint64</code> method
and deleting the <code>Seed</code> method. Implementations that support seeding can provide
their own concrete methods, like <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/v2/#PCG.Seed"><code>PCG.Seed</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/math/rand/v2/#ChaCha8.Seed"><code>ChaCha8.Seed</code></a>.
Note that the two take different seed types, and neither is a single <code>int64</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We removed the top-level <code>Seed</code> function: the global functions like <code>Int</code> can only be used
in auto-seeded form now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removing the top-level <code>Seed</code> also let us hard-code the use of scalable,
per-thread generators by the top-level methods,
avoiding a GODEBUG check at each use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We implemented Lemire’s optimization for <code>Intn</code> and related functions.
The concrete <code>rand.Rand</code> API is now locked in to that value stream,
so we will not be able to take advantage of any optimizations yet to be discovered,
but at least we are up to date once again.
We also implemented the <code>Float32</code> and <code>Float64</code> optimizations we wanted to use back in Go 1.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the proposal discussion, a contributor pointed out detectable bias in the
implementations of <code>ExpFloat64</code> and <code>NormFloat64</code>.
We fixed that bias and locked in the new value streams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Perm</code> and <code>Shuffle</code> used different shuffling algorithms and produced different value streams,
because <code>Shuffle</code> happened second and used a faster algorithm.
Deleting <code>Perm</code> entirely would have made migration harder for users.
Instead we implemented <code>Perm</code> in terms of <code>Shuffle</code>, which still lets us
delete an implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We renamed <code>Int31</code>, <code>Int63</code>, <code>Intn</code>, <code>Int31n</code>, and <code>Int63n</code> to
<code>Int32</code>, <code>Int64</code>, <code>IntN</code>, <code>Int32N</code>, and <code>Int64N</code>.
The 31 and 63 in the names were unnecessarily pedantic
and confusing, and the capitalized N is more idiomatic for a second
“word” in the name in Go.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We added <code>Uint</code>, <code>Uint32</code>, <code>Uint64</code>, <code>UintN</code>, <code>Uint32N</code>, and <code>Uint64N</code>
top-level functions and methods.
We needed to add <code>Uint64</code> to provide direct access to the core <code>Source</code>
functionality, and it seemed inconsistent not to add the others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adopting another suggestion from the proposal discussion,
we added a new top-level, generic function <code>N</code> that is like
<code>Int64N</code> or <code>Uint64N</code> but works for any integer type.
In the old API, to create a random duration of up to 5 seconds,
it was necessary to write:</p>
<pre><code>d := time.Duration(rand.Int63n(int64(5*time.Second)))
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>N</code>, the equivalent code is:</p>
<pre><code>d := rand.N(5 * time.Second)
</code></pre>
<p><code>N</code> is only a top-level function; there is no <code>N</code> method on <code>rand.Rand</code>
because there are no generic methods in Go.
(Generic methods are not likely in the future, either;
they conflict badly with interfaces, and a complete implementation
would require either run-time code generation or slow execution.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ameliorate misuse of <code>math/rand</code> in cryptographic contexts,
we made <code>ChaCha8</code> the default generator used in global functions,
and we also changed the Go runtime to use it (replacing wyrand).
Programs are still strongly encouraged to use <code>crypto/rand</code>
to generate cryptographic secrets,
but accidentally using <code>math/rand/v2</code> is not as catastrophic
as using <code>math/rand</code> would be.
Even in <code>math/rand</code>, the global functions now use the <code>ChaCha8</code> generator when not explicitly seeded.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="principles">Principles for evolving the Go standard library</h2>
<p>As mentioned at the start this post, one of the goals for this work
was to establish principles and a pattern for how we approach all
v2 packages in the standard library.
There will not be a glut of v2 packages
in the next few Go releases.
Instead, we will handle one package
at a time, making sure we set a quality bar that will last for another decade.
Many packages will not need a v2 at all.
But for those that do, our approach boils down to three principles.</p>
<p>First, a new, incompatible version of a package will use
<code>that/package/v2</code> as its import path,
following
<a href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">semantic import versioning</a>
just like a v2 module outside the standard library would.
This allows uses of the original package and the v2 package
to coexist in a single program,
which is critical for a
<a href="https://go.dev/talks/2016/refactor.article">gradual conversion</a> to the new API.</p>
<p>Second, all changes must be rooted in
respect for existing usage and users:
we must not introduce needless churn,
whether in the form of unnecessary changes to an existing package or
an entirely new package that must be learned instead.
In practice, that means we take the existing package
as the starting point
and only make changes that are well motivated
and provide a value that justifies the cost to users of updating.</p>
<p>Third, the v2 package must not leave v1 users behind.
Ideally, the v2 package should be able to do everything the v1 package
could do,
and when v2 is released, the v1 package should be rewritten
to be a thin wrapper around v2.
This would ensure that existing uses of v1 continue to benefit
from bug fixes and performance optimizations in v2.
Of course, given that v2 is introducing breaking changes,
this is not always possible, but it is always something to consider carefully.
For <code>math/rand/v2</code>, we arranged for the auto-seeded v1 functions to
call the v2 generator, but we were unable to share other code
due to the repeatability violations.
Ultimately <code>math/rand</code> is not a lot of code and does not require
regular maintenance, so the duplication is manageable.
In other contexts, more work to avoid duplication could be worthwhile.
For example, in the
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/63397">encoding/json/v2 design (still in progress)</a>,
although the default semantics and the API are changed,
the package provides configuration knobs that
make it possible to implement the v1 API.
When we eventually ship <code>encoding/json/v2</code>,
<code>encoding/json</code> (v1) will become a thin wrapper around it,
ensuring that users who don’t migrate from v1 still
benefit from optimizations and security fixes in v2.</p>
<p>A follow-up blog post will present the <code>ChaCha8</code> generator in more detail.</p>

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.</p><p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:</p><p>* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (50+ currently).
 * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
 * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
 * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.</p><p>We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud.

It caters to schools as well as universities and learning and development professionals. It is built in the historic city of Bruges by a small and dedicated team that aims to provide both instructors and students with better tools and ways to experience their course material.For our engineering team we are looking to hire one or more software engineers, both junior and senior, to help develop the software side of our platform. We are growing at an ever increasing speed which provides us with numerous interesting challenges to tackle and opportunities to make a meaningful difference.</p><p>* What are we looking for? *</p><p>We are looking for talented developers who have at least some experience with React and its ecosystem (Typescript, Plate, Vite, …) but are not afraid to do some work in the backend as well (Ruby/Rails in our case). As a rule, we put more value in mindset and attitude than experience with a specific stack. So if you have worked with other web technologies, such as Svelte or Vue, we’d still love to talk. It is important to note, however, that, since we are working in the Flemish educational market, we do expect you to speak Dutch or are in the process of learning Dutch.
Beyond that, we’d just love to have a chat to paint a broader picture and listen to what you can bring to the table!</p><p>* What do we offer? *</p><p>It goes without saying that you’d receive a competitive salary and all the social benefits you’d expect from a developer position. Beyond that, we offer a mix of remote work and working from our office in the city center of Bruges. We will also supply you with any development material you may need (Macbook, software, …). If you have any strong desires, we’d love to hear them as well. We really are invested in finding the right fit and making sure you enjoy working for our company for a long while!</p><p>*  Interested? *</p><p>Email us at info@brightbook.be

The pain point is so high, they typically pay consultants $60k to solve the problem. Our cofounder (former Dir of Ops @ Trader Joes) did this as a consultant and now we are turning her expertise into software. We are building a mix of a marketplace + Turbotax style functionality to bring automation and scalability to the industry. With great traction and paying customers, we just closed a $2M seed round.</p><p>We are now ready and excited to bring on our first engineer. As part of an early-stage company, you’ll have real and tangible impact on the business and our users. Along with our CTO, you will write code and ship product to a growing number of paying customers. We prioritize a developer-friendly environment by being remote first, having low infrastructure/configuration overhead, autonomy in your work, and getting rid of webpack. As with any startup, product requirements and direction can change. And we strive to always provide clarity around “what did we learn” + “how that changes our thinking”. We feel the added transparency and sense of ownership results in keeping us closer to our customers and delivers a better end product.</p><p>----</p><p>Ideal requirements</p><pre><code>  * A love for Ruby on Rails

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.</p><p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.</p><p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big. If yours are too, we want to work with you.</p><p>Open positions include:</p><p>* Senior Data Scientist, Algorithm Development</p><p>* Sr Backend Software Engineer, Rewards</p><p>* Senior Data Scientist, LLM</p><p>* Senior Software Engineer, AI/ML Productionization Engineer (LLM/RAG)</p><p>* Senior Flutter Mobile Software Engineer, Rewards</p><p>Jobs Board: <a href="https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board" rel="nofollow">https://bit.ly/nuna-job-board</a></p><p>Frontend: React, Typescript, Flutter (Android and iOS)</p><p>Backend: Django, Python, Kotlin, Scala</p><p>Cloud: AWS</p><p>Questions?

  Email: returndanilo@gmail.com<p>Hey! I'm a life-long self-taught programmer and I'm looking for a first job. As I only learned coding for fun, I don't have too many finished projects to promote so I'm having difficulty showing my qualifications: I think a technical interview would be more fit for showing what I am capable of.</p><p>I had started a mathematics bachelor's degree a few years ago but I decided to not go down the academic path in face of AGI; I'd put efforts into making a safer AGI and a safer transition into AGI.</p><p>So now my plan is to get a full time job to pay the bills and, in the free time, get up to date with the recent literature and in a few years be able to join an AI research team.

I am a soon-to-graduate PhD student at Northeastern University (prior to that a staff scientist elsewhere). My research is developing automation technologies for medical literature reviews; that is understanding, developing, modifying natural language processing models (and data, always data...) for a variety of search, information (and relation) extraction, and multi-document summarization tasks. Given my timeline, you might notice I was working on and with LLMs before they were cool, welcome to my lawn.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I would also be ecstatic to join an engineering team where I can use my years of experience building and honing products and get more experience playing Product Owner on a scrum team.

I have had the good fortune to spend the last decade working at the ground level of a startup. By starting from the bottom and working my way up to a Senior Director level position, I have been able to get a unique view of how a company functions while being part of the decisions and mistakes a company makes as it goes from being on the brink of bankruptcy to growth on a global scale.<p>My initiatives to continuously automate as much work as possible, re-evaluate working processes, and improve redundant systems allowed the company to grow at an exponential rate while not increasing headcount. The extra capital this saved us allowed us to easily handle industry-wide downturns without having to cut any of the workforce or pull back on any projects or goals.</p><p>I am fluent in Python 3+ and don't have much desire to write anything else at this point.</p><p>Areas that currently interest me are</p><pre><code>  * Climate Change, Climate Tech
  * Agriculture, AgTech
  * Automotive
  * Robotocs (MicroPython)
  * Solar
  * General Charity or 501(c)(3)
  * Research Lab
  * National security

With Covid I've come to realize I need to work in public more often.</p><p>So an ideal fit would be a small/medium company with hair on fire problems that need solving that I can talk about publicly.
What sort of problems do I like?</p><p>I worked with a Stuttgart based auto manufacturer to identify and predict when a part they had would fail. It turns out the answer will be familiar to west coast Canadians - The leaky condo crisis.</p><p>I worked with a well known cloud vendor to predict server failiures. Built a few test approaches (DL, anomoly detection, clustering, etc) and went with a simple efficient one that worked well. They got several minutes warning to load shift before a server failed.</p><p>A Taxi company in latam hired me to built a fleet maintenance system. It predicted and scheduled preventative maintenance to reduce wear and tear and avoid breakdowns. We also identified the leading cause of wear - leadfoot drivers. So we built a system that would identify aggressive driving.</p><p>Another example was a speculative sports highlights annotation system I built with a consultancy. It ingested sports video and identified predetermined highlights in baseball - diving catches in our case. The ML pipeline was a CNN model which fed into an RNN. 
Given a bunch of video clips of diving catches as training data, it could later identify those diving catches and automatically annotate the video feeds.</p><p>Who shouldn't contact me.</p><p>If your market is Ads or gambling I'm not interested. Sure there's lot of money, but I'd rather sleep at night. Thanks.</p><p>What I'm working on right now:</p><p>Low compute AI and connecting them to interpretable and defensible knowledge bases. I think these huge models that cost millions to train are the wrong path. I'll show things in public in time.

Generalist software engineer seeking a non-web role ideally, although I'm happy to work on anything as long as I get to write code. At work, I've mostly contributed to .NET web and desktop applications. In my free time I've explored diverse areas (read: dabbled in - I don't claim to be an expert in them) of software including web and application security, 3D graphics, embedded, kernel/drivers, and Linux programming. I'm currently working through Casey Muratori's code performance course.<p>[0]: <a href="https://gitcolt.github.io/resume" rel="nofollow">https://gitcolt.github.io/resume</a>

    I'm looking for engineering leadership roles where I can have a strong impact on technical excellence, team culture, process, product and ultimately customer satisfaction and the organization's success. Happy to be hands-on if and when needed, but also ready to focus on higher level objectives if that's where I'm most needed and effective. For the last 6-9 months I've been working on some solo/duo-preneur projects in the content creation space, and prior to that I was Engineering Manager for a small SaaS company where I also led DevOps for one of our corporate siblings. I also have held roles such as Director of Engineering for two edtech companies, Platform Architect for a chatbot startup and also lead engineer for a presidential campaign.</code></pre></span></p></div></td></tr>

Hi! I'm Morgan, a full-stack software engineer currently in Harrisburg, PA. I enjoy puzzles and am passionate about design and breaking down complicated problems. I also enjoy rock climbing. :)<p>Most recently, I built Reverb (<a href="https://reverb-app.github.io/" rel="nofollow">https://reverb-app.github.io/</a>), an open-source, asynchronous, event-driven workflow engine that reliably orchestrates complex background sequences. You can think of it like a lightweight Temporal with a higher emphasis on developer experience.</p><p>I would love to hear rom you if you think I would be a good fit for your team!

Hi! I'm Samuel. I have 6+ years as a product manager and 10 in product development (before pm: agile coach, UX designer, and developer). I work closely with engineering teams, supporting them in every way I can, and have contributed code in every role I have ever held. I am very curious and driven to learn, so diving in deep is always a thrill. On the flip side, I regularly tackle ambiguous problems and plan our product and company strategy with the executive team.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I've been doing consulting for a while but I'm looking to join up with a team that has 1-5 engineers ideally but I'd be fine with a larger org if I think the product is cool.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="lanl-section"><p>A research team using the ChemCam instrument onboard NASA’s Curiosity rover discovered higher-than-usual amounts of manganese in lakebed rocks within Gale Crater on Mars, which indicates that the sediments were formed in a river, delta, or near the shoreline of an ancient lake. The results were published today in <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023JE007923" target="_self">Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets</a>.</p>
<p>“It is difficult for manganese oxide to form on the surface of Mars, so we didn’t expect to find it in such high concentrations in a shoreline deposit,” said Patrick Gasda, of Los Alamos National Laboratory’s Space Science and Applications group and lead author on the study. “On Earth, these types of deposits happen all the time because of the high oxygen in our atmosphere produced by photosynthetic life, and from microbes that help catalyze those manganese oxidation reactions.</p>
<p>“On Mars, we don’t have evidence for life, and the mechanism to produce oxygen in Mars’s ancient atmosphere is unclear, so how the manganese oxide was formed and concentrated here is really puzzling. These findings point to larger processes occurring in the Martian atmosphere or surface water and shows that more work needs to be done to understand oxidation on Mars,” Gasda added.</p>
<p>ChemCam, which was developed at Los Alamos and CNES (the French space agency), uses a laser to form a plasma on the surface of a rock, and collects that light in order to quantify elemental composition in rocks.</p>
<p>The sedimentary rocks explored by the rover are a mix of sands, silts, and muds. The sandy rocks are more porous, and groundwater can more easily pass through sands compared to the muds that make up most of the lakebed rocks in the Gale Crater. The research team looked at how manganese could have been enriched in these sands—for example, by percolation of groundwater through the sands on the shore of a lake or mouth of a delta—and what oxidant could be responsible for the precipitation of manganese in the rocks.</p>
<p>On Earth, manganese becomes enriched because of oxygen in the atmosphere, and this process is often sped up by the presence of microbes. Microbes on Earth can use the many oxidation states of manganese as energy for metabolism; if life was present on ancient Mars, the increased amounts of manganese in these rocks along the lake shore would have been a helpful energy source for life.</p>
<p>“The Gale lake environment, as revealed by these ancient rocks, gives us a window into a habitable environment that looks surprisingly similar to places on Earth today,” said Nina Lanza, principal investigator for the ChemCam instrument. “Manganese minerals are common in the shallow, oxic waters found on lake shores on Earth, and it's remarkable to find such recognizable features on ancient Mars.”</p>

    </div><p>For decades, concerns about automobile pollution have focused on what comes out of the tailpipe. Now, researchers and regulators say, we need to pay more attention to toxic emissions from tires as vehicles roll down the road.</p>


										      
																																	
<p>At the top of the list of worries is a chemical called 6PPD, which is added to rubber tires to help them last longer. When tires wear on pavement, 6PPD is released. It reacts with ozone to become a different chemical, 6PPD-q, which can be extremely toxic—so much so that it has been linked to repeated fish kills in Washington state.</p>
<p>The trouble with tires doesn't stop there. Tires are made primarily of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/natural+rubber/" rel="tag">natural rubber</a> and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/synthetic+rubber/" rel="tag">synthetic rubber</a>, but they contain hundreds of other ingredients, often including steel and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/heavy+metals/" rel="tag">heavy metals</a> such as copper, lead, cadmium, and zinc.</p>
<p>As car tires wear, the rubber disappears in particles, both bits that can be seen with the naked eye and microparticles. Testing by a British company, Emissions Analytics, found that a car's tires emit 1 trillion <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ultrafine+particles/" rel="tag">ultrafine particles</a> per kilometer driven—from 5 to 9 pounds of rubber per internal combustion car per year.</p>
<p>And what's in those particles is a mystery, because tire ingredients are proprietary.</p>
<p>"You've got a chemical cocktail in these tires that no one really understands and is kept highly confidential by the tire manufacturers," said Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics. "We struggle to think of another consumer product that is so prevalent in the world and used by virtually everyone, where there is so little known of what is in them."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>Regulators have only begun to address the toxic tire problem, though there has been some action on 6PPD.</p>
<p>The chemical was identified by a team of researchers, led by scientists at Washington State University and the University of Washington, who were trying to determine why coho salmon returning to Seattle-area creeks to spawn were dying in large numbers.</p>
<p>Working for the Washington Stormwater Center, the scientists tested some 2,000 substances to determine which one was causing the die-offs, and in 2020 they announced they'd found the culprit: 6PPD.</p>
<p>The Yurok Tribe in Northern California, along with two other West Coast Native American tribes, have petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to prohibit the chemical. The EPA said it is considering new rules governing the chemical. "We could not sit idle while 6PPD kills the fish that sustain us," said Joseph L. James, chairman of the Yurok Tribe, in a statement. "This lethal toxin has no place in any salmon-bearing watershed."</p>
<p>California has begun taking steps to regulate the chemical, last year classifying tires containing it as a "priority product," which requires manufacturers to search for and test substitutes.</p>
<p>"6PPD plays a crucial role in the safety of tires on California's roads and, currently, there are no widely available safer alternatives," said Karl Palmer, a deputy director at the state's Department of Toxic Substances Control.</p>
<p>"For this reason, our framework is ideally suited for identifying alternatives to 6PPD that ensure the continued safety of tires on California's roads while protecting California's fish populations and the communities that rely on them."</p>

																																			<p>The U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association says it has mobilized a consortium of 16 tire manufacturers to carry out an analysis of alternatives. Anne Forristall Luke, USTMA president and CEO, said it "will yield the most effective and exhaustive review possible of whether a safer alternative to 6PPD in tires currently exists."</p>
<p>Molden, however, said there is a catch. "If they don't investigate, they aren't allowed to sell in the state of California," he said. "If they investigate and don't find an alternative, they can go on selling. They don't have to find a substitute. And today there is no alternative to 6PPD."</p>
<p>California is also studying a request by the California Stormwater Quality Association to classify tires containing zinc, a heavy metal, as a priority product, requiring manufacturers to search for an alternative. Zinc is used in the vulcanization process to increase the strength of the rubber.</p>
<p>When it comes to tire particles, though, there hasn't been any action, even as the problem worsens with the proliferation of electric cars. Because of their quicker acceleration and greater torque, electric vehicles wear out tires faster and emit an estimated 20% more tire particles than the average gas-powered car.</p>
<p>A recent study in Southern California found tire and brake emissions in Anaheim accounted for 30% of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, a small-particulate air pollutant, while exhaust emissions accounted for 19%. Tests by Emissions Analytics have found that tires produce up to 2,000 times as much particle pollution by mass as tailpipes.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>These particles end up in water and air and are often ingested. Ultrafine particles, even smaller than PM<sub>2.5</sub>, are also emitted by tires and can be inhaled and travel directly to the brain. New research suggests tire microparticles should be classified as a pollutant of "high concern."</p>
<p>In a report issued last year, researchers at Imperial College London said the particles could affect the heart, lungs, and reproductive organs and cause cancer.</p>
<p>People who live or work along roadways, often low-income, are exposed to more of the toxic substances.</p>
<p>Tires are also a major source of microplastics. More than three-quarters of microplastics entering the ocean come from the synthetic rubber in tires, according to a report from the Pew Charitable Trusts and the British company Systemiq.</p>
<p>And there are still a great many unknowns in tire emissions, which can be especially complex to analyze because heat and pressure can transform tire ingredients into other compounds.</p>
<p>One outstanding research question is whether 6PPD-q affects people, and what health problems, if any, it could cause. A <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.2c00821" target="_blank">study</a> published in <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology Letters</i> found high levels of the chemical in urine samples from a region of South China, with levels highest in pregnant women.</p>
<p>The discovery of 6PPD-q, Molden said, has sparked fresh interest in the health and environmental impacts of tires, and he expects an abundance of new research in the coming years. "The jigsaw pieces are coming together," he said. "But it's a thousand-piece jigsaw, not a 200-piece jigsaw."</p>

			<p><em>Washington, D.C.</em> – Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested the Federal Trade Commission investigate major automakers for breaking a pledge to protect their customers’ location data, in a letter to Chair Lina Khan sent today. The automakers had deceptively pledged that they would insist on warrants or other court orders before turning over location data from their customers’ connected automobiles to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>The letter comes in response to an inquiry by Sen. Wyden’s office, which asked the association representing automakers how their members respond to law enforcement requests for location information collected from internet-connected cars and trucks. He found that only five — GM, Ford, Honda, Stellantis and Tesla — require a warrant to provide location data to law-enforcement. And only Tesla notifies auto owners about government demands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Automakers have not only kept consumers in the dark regarding their actual practices, but multiple companies misled consumers for over a decade by failing to honor the industry’s own voluntary privacy principles. To that end, we urge the FTC to investigate these auto manufacturers’ deceptive claims as well as their harmful data retention practices,” </strong>Wyden and Markey wrote.</p>
<p>Toyota, Nissan, Subaru, Volkswagen, BMW, Mazda, Mercedes-Benz and Kia all confirmed that they will disclose location data to U.S. government agencies in response to subpoenas, which do not require a judge’s approval. Volkswagen indicated that it will require a warrant for more than seven days of location data, but will disclose six days or less in response to a subpoena. Volvo, which is owned by Geely, a Chinese company, did not respond to the request. These responses directly contradict <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160422020327/http:/www.globalautomakers.org/system/files/document/attachments/Global%27s%20and%20the%20Alliance%27s%20FTC%20Letter%20Committment%20and%20Privacy%20Principles%20%282%29.pdf">a public pledge by the auto industry</a>, that the companies signed onto, committing to require that “requests or demand from governmental entities for geolocation information, must be in the form of a warrant or court order,” except in emergency situations or with the owner’s consent.</p>
<p>Wyden and Markey warned that failing to protect Americans’ privacy could have dangerous consequences, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s <em>Dobbs </em>decision, which allows states to criminalize abortion and places other reproductive health choices at risk of criminalization. Vehicle location data can reveal intimate details of a person’s life, including for those who seek care across state lines, attend protests, visit mental or behavioral health professionals or seek treatment for substance use disorder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <b>theory of constraints</b> (<b>TOC</b>) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_paradigm" title="Management paradigm">management paradigm</a> that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of <a href="#Constraints">constraints</a>. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses <a href="#The_five_focusing_steps">a focusing process</a> to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". That means that organizations and processes are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them, or at least adversely affect the outcome.

<p>The theory of constraints (TOC) is an overall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_philosophy" title="Management philosophy">management philosophy</a>, introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_M._Goldratt" title="Eliyahu M. Goldratt">Eliyahu M. Goldratt</a> in his 1984 book titled <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)" title="The Goal (novel)">The Goal</a></i>, that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals.<sup id="cite_ref-goal_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-goal-1">[1]</a></sup> Goldratt adapted the concept to project management with his book <i>Critical Chain</i>, published in 1997.
</p><p>An earlier propagator of a similar concept was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Mewes&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Wolfgang Mewes (page does not exist)">Wolfgang Mewes</a><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> in Germany with publications on <i>power-oriented management theory</i> (Machtorientierte Führungstheorie, 1963) and following with his <i>Energo-Kybernetic System (EKS, 1971)</i>, later renamed <i><a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engpasskonzentrierte_Strategie" title="de:Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie">Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie</a></i> (Bottleneck-focused Strategy) as a more advanced <i>theory of bottlenecks</i>. The publications of Wolfgang Mewes are marketed through the FAZ Verlag, publishing house of the German newspaper <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurter_Allgemeine_Zeitung" title="Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</a></i>. However, the paradigm <i>Theory of constraints</i> was first used by Goldratt.

<p>The underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can be measured and controlled by variations on three measures: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput_(business)" title="Throughput (business)">throughput</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_expense" title="Operational expense">operational expense</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory" title="Inventory">inventory</a>. Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales.<sup id="cite_ref-essays_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-essays-3">[3]</a></sup>
</p><p>Before the goal itself can be reached, necessary conditions must first be met. These typically include safety, quality, legal obligations, etc.  For most businesses, the goal itself is to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_(economics)" title="Profit (economics)">profit</a>.  However, for many organizations and non-profit businesses, making money is a necessary condition for pursuing the goal.  Whether it is the goal or a necessary condition, understanding how to make sound financial decisions based on throughput, inventory, and operating expense is a critical requirement.<sup id="cite_ref-essays_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-essays-3">[3]</a></sup>

<h3><span id="The_five_focusing_steps">The five focusing steps</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_constraints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: The five focusing steps"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Theory of constraints is based on the premise that the rate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal" title="Goal">goal</a> achievement by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal-oriented" title="Goal-oriented">goal-oriented</a> system (i.e., the system's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput_(business)" title="Throughput (business)">throughput</a>) is limited by at least one <a href="#Constraints">constraint</a>.
</p><p>The argument by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum" title="Reductio ad absurdum">reductio ad absurdum</a> is as follows: If there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher throughput (i.e., more goal units in a unit of time), its throughput would be infinite – which is impossible in a real-life system.
</p><p>Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased.<sup id="cite_ref-goal_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-goal-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined, the steps are:
</p>
<ol><li><i>Identify</i> the system's constraint(s).</li>
<li>Decide how to <i>exploit</i> the system's constraint(s).</li>
<li><i>Subordinate</i> everything else to the above decision.</li>
<li><i>Elevate</i> the system's constraint(s).</li>
<li><i>Warning!</i> If in the previous steps a <a href="#Breaking_a_constraint">constraint has been broken</a>, go back to step 1, but do not allow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertia" title="Inertia">inertia</a> to cause a system's constraint.<sup id="cite_ref-goldratt2004_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-goldratt2004-4">[4]</a></sup></li></ol>
<p>The goal of a commercial organization is: "Make more money now and in the future",<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> and its measurements are given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput_accounting" title="Throughput accounting">throughput accounting</a> as: throughput, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventory" title="Inventory">inventory</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expenses" title="Operating expenses">operating expenses</a>.
</p><p>The five focusing steps aim to ensure ongoing improvement efforts are centered on the organization's constraint(s).  In the TOC literature, this is referred to as the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process" title="Continual improvement process">process of ongoing improvement</a></i> (POOGI).
</p><p>These focusing steps are the key steps to developing the specific <a href="#Applications">applications</a> mentioned below.

<h3><span id="Constraints">Constraints</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_constraints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4" title="Edit section: Constraints"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>A constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal. There are many ways that constraints can show up, but a core principle within TOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints. There is at least one, but at most only a few in any given system. Constraints can be internal or external to the system. An internal constraint is in evidence when the market demands more from the system than it can deliver. If this is the case, then the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint and following the five focusing steps to open it up (and potentially remove it). An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the market will bear. If this is the case, then the organization should focus on mechanisms to create more demand for its products or services.
</p><p>Types of (internal) constraints
</p>
<ul><li>Equipment: The way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods/services.</li>
<li>People: Lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill" title="Skill">skilled</a> people limits the system. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model" title="Mental model">Mental models</a> held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint.</li>
<li>Policy: A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from making more.</li></ul>
<p>The concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_(mathematics)" title="Constraint (mathematics)">constraint</a> that shows up in mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics)" title="Optimization (mathematics)">optimization</a>. In TOC, the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the system.  In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5).
</p><p>Please note: organizations have many problems with equipment, people, policies, etc. (A breakdown is just that – a breakdown – and is not a constraint in the true sense of the TOC concept). The constraint is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_factor" title="Limiting factor">limiting factor</a> that is preventing the organization from getting more throughput (typically, revenue through sales) even when nothing goes wrong.
</p>
<h3><span id="Breaking_a_constraint">Breaking a constraint</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_constraints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Breaking a constraint"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>If a constraint's throughput capacity is elevated to the point where it is no longer the system's limiting factor, this is said to "break" the constraint. The limiting factor is now some other part of the system, or may be external to the system (an external constraint). This is not to be confused with a breakdown.
</p>
<h3><span id="Buffers">Buffers</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_constraints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Buffers"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Buffers are used throughout the theory of constraints. They often result as part of the exploit and subordinate steps of the five focusing steps. Buffers are placed before the governing constraint, thus ensuring that the constraint is never starved. Buffers are also placed behind the constraint to prevent downstream failure from blocking the constraint's output. Buffers used in this way protect the constraint from variations in the rest of the system and should allow for normal variation of processing time and the occasional upset (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_Law" title="Murphy's Law">Murphy</a>) before and behind the constraint.
</p><p>Buffers can be a bank of physical objects before a work center, waiting to be processed by that work center. Buffers ultimately buy you time, as in the time before work reaches the constraint and are often verbalized as time buffers. There should always be enough (but not excessive) work in the time queue before the constraint and adequate offloading space behind the constraint.
</p><p>Buffers are <i>not</i> the small queue of work that sits before every work center in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" title="Kanban">kanban</a> system although it is similar if you regard the assembly line as the governing constraint. A prerequisite in the theory is that with one constraint in the system, all other parts of the system must have sufficient capacity to keep up with the work at the constraint and to catch up if time was lost. In a balanced line, as espoused by kanban, when one work center goes down for a period longer than the buffer allows, then the entire system must wait until that work center is restored. In a TOC system, the only situation where work is in danger is if the constraint is unable to process (either due to malfunction, sickness or a "hole" in the buffer – if something goes wrong that the time buffer can not protect).
</p><p>Buffer management, therefore, represents a crucial attribute of the theory of constraints. There are many ways to apply buffers, but the most often used is a visual system of designating the buffer in three colors: green (okay), yellow (caution) and red (action required). Creating this kind of visibility enables the system as a whole to align and thus subordinate to the need of the constraint in a holistic manner. This can also be done daily in a central operations room that is accessible to everybody.

<h3><span id="Plant_types">Plant types</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_constraints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Plant types"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>There are four primary types of plants in the TOC lexicon. Draw the flow of material from the bottom of a page to the top, and you get the four types. They specify the general flow of materials through a system, and also provide some hints about where to look for typical problems. This type of analysis is known as VATI analysis<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> as it uses the bottom-up shapes of the letters V, A, T, and I to describe the types of plants. The four types can be combined in many ways in larger facilities, e.g. "an A plant feeding a V plant".
</p>
<ul><li>V-plant: The general flow of material is one-to-many, such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products.  Classic examples are meat rendering plants or a steel manufacturer. The primary problem in V-plants is "robbing," where one operation (A) immediately after a diverging point "steals" materials meant for the other operation (B). Once the material has been processed by A, it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework.</li>
<li>A-plant: The general flow of material is many-to-one, such as in a plant where many sub-assemblies converge for a final assembly. The primary problem in A-plants is in synchronizing the converging lines so that each supplies the final assembly point at the right time.</li>
<li>T-plant: The general flow is that of an I-plant (or has multiple lines), which then splits into many assemblies (many-to-many). Most manufactured parts are used in multiple assemblies and nearly all assemblies use multiple parts. Customized devices, such as computers, are good examples. T-plants suffer from both synchronization problems of A-plants (parts aren't all available for an assembly) and the robbing problems of V-plants (one assembly steals parts that could have been used in another).</li>
<li>I-plant: Material flows in a sequence, such as in an assembly line. The primary work is done in a straight sequence of events (one-to-one). The constraint is the slowest operation.</li></ul>
<p>From the above list, one can deduce that for non-material systems one could draw the flow of work or the flow of processes, instead of physical flows, and arrive at similar basic V, A, T, or I structures. A project, for example, is an A-shaped sequence of work, culminating in a delivered product (<i>i.e., the intended outcome of the project</i>).

The solution as applied to each of these areas are listed below.
</p>
<h3><span id="Operations">Operations</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Theory_of_constraints&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Operations"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></h3>
<p>Within manufacturing operations and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_management" title="Operations management">operations management</a>, the solution seeks to pull materials through the system, rather than push them into the system. The primary methodology used is drum-buffer-rope (DBR)<sup id="cite_ref-race_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-race-7">[7]</a></sup> and a variation called simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR).<sup id="cite_ref-sdbr_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-sdbr-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Drum-buffer-rope is a manufacturing execution methodology based on the fact the output of a system can only be the same as the output at the constraint of the system. Any attempt to produce more than what the constraint can process just leads to excess inventory piling up.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The method is named for its three components. The <i>drum</i> is the rate at which the physical constraint of the plant can work: the work center or machine or operation that limits the ability of the entire system to produce more. The rest of the plant follows the beat of the drum. Schedule at the drum decides what the system should produce, in what sequence to produce and how much to produce.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> They make sure the drum has work and that anything the drum has processed does not get wasted.
</p><p>The <i>buffer</i> protects the drum, so that it always has work flowing to it. Buffers in DBR provide the additional lead time beyond the required set up and process times, for materials in the product flow. Since these buffers have time as their unit of measure, rather than quantity of material, this makes the priority system operate strictly based on the time an order is expected to be at the drum. Each work order will have a remaining buffer status that can be calculated. Based on this buffer status, work orders can be color coded into Red, Yellow and Green. The red orders have the highest priority and must be worked on first, since they have penetrated most into their buffers followed by yellow and green. As time evolves, this buffer status might change and the color assigned to the particular work order change with it.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>
</p><p>Traditional DBR usually calls for buffers at several points in the system: the constraint, synchronization points and at shipping. S-DBR has a buffer at shipping and manages the flow of work across the drum through a load planning mechanism.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i>rope</i> is the work release mechanism for the plant. Orders are released to the shop floor at one "buffer time" before they are due to be processed by the constraint. In other words, if the buffer is 5 days, the order is released 5 days before it is due at the constraint. Putting work into the system earlier than this buffer time is likely to generate too-high work-in-process and slow down the entire system.<sup id="cite_ref-International_Journal_of_Production_Research_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-International_Journal_of_Production_Research-14">[14]</a></sup>

<p>Automated production lines achieve high throughput rates and output quantities by deploying automation solutions that are highly task-specific. Depending on their design and construction, these machines operate at different speeds and capacities and therefore have varying efficiency levels.
</p><p>A prominent example is the use of automated production lines in the beverage industry. Filling systems usually have several machines executing parts of the complete bottling process, from filling primary containers to secondary packaging and palletisation.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>To be able to maximize the throughput, the production line usually has a designed constraint. This constraint is typically the slowest and often the most expensive machine on the line. The overall throughput of the line is determined by this machine. All other machines can operate faster and are connected by conveyors.
</p><p>The conveyors usually have the ability to buffer product. In the event of a stoppage at a machine other than the constraint, the conveyor can buffer the product enabling the constraint machine to keep on running.
</p><p>A typical line setup is such that in normal operation the upstream conveyors from the constraint machine are always run full to prevent starvation at the constraint and the downstream conveyors are run empty to prevent a back up at the constraint. The overall aim is to prevent minor stoppages at the machines from impacting the constraint.
</p><p>For this reason as the machines get further from the constraint, they have the ability to run faster than the previous machine and this creates a V curve.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>In general, the solution for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain" title="Supply chain">supply chains</a> is to create flow of inventory so as to ensure greater availability and to eliminate <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/surplus" title="wikt:surplus">surpluses</a>.
</p><p>The TOC distribution solution is effective when used to address a single link in the supply chain and more so across the entire system, even if that system comprises many different companies. The purpose of the TOC distribution solution is to establish a competitive advantage based on extraordinary availability by reducing the damages caused when the flow of goods is interrupted by shortages and surpluses.
</p><p>This approach uses several new rules to protect availability with less inventory than is conventionally required.
</p>
<ol><li>Inventory is held at an aggregation point(s) as close as possible to the source. This approach ensures smoothed demand at the aggregation point, requiring proportionally less inventory. The distribution centers holding the aggregated stock are able to ship goods downstream to the next link in the supply chain much more quickly than a make-to-order manufacturer can.</li>
<li>Following this rule may result in a make-to-order manufacturer converting to make-to-stock.  The inventory added at the aggregation point is significantly less than the inventory reduction downstream.</li>
<li>In all stocking locations, initial inventory buffers are set which effectively create an upper limit of the inventory at that location. The buffer size is equal to the maximum expected consumption within the average Replenishment Time ("RT"), plus additional stock to protect in case a delivery is late. In other words, there is no advantage in holding more inventory in a location than the amount that might be consumed before more could be ordered and received. Typically, the sum of the on hand value of such buffers are 25–75% less than currently observed average inventory levels
<ol><li>Replenishment Time (RT) is the sum of the delay, after the first consumption following a delivery, before an order is placed plus the delay after the order is placed until the ordered goods arrive at the ordering location.</li></ol></li>
<li>Once buffers have been established, no replenishment orders are placed as long as the quantity inbound (already ordered but not yet received) plus the quantity on hand are equal to or greater than the buffer size. Following this rule causes surplus inventory to be bled off as it is consumed.</li>
<li>For any reason, when on hand plus inbound inventory is less than the buffer, orders are placed as soon as practical to increase the inbound inventory so that the relationship on Hand + Inbound = Buffer is maintained.</li>
<li>To ensure buffers remain correctly sized even with changes in the rates of demand and replenishment, a simple recursive algorithm called Buffer Management is used.  When the on hand inventory level is in the upper third of the buffer for a full RT, the buffer is reduced by one third (and don't forget rule 3).  Alternatively, when the on hand inventory is in the bottom one third of the buffer for too long, the buffer is increased by one third (and don't forget rule 4).  The definition of "too long" may be changed depending on required service levels, however, a rule of thumb is 20% of the RT. Moving buffers up more readily than down is supported by the usually greater damage caused by shortages as compared to the damage caused by surpluses.</li></ol>
<p>Once inventory is managed as described above, continuous efforts should be undertaken to reduce RT, late deliveries, supplier minimum order quantities (both per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_Keeping_Unit" title="Stock Keeping Unit">SKU</a> and per order) and customer order batching. Any improvements in these areas will automatically improve both availability and inventory turns, thanks to the adaptive nature of Buffer Management.
</p><p>A stocking location that manages inventory according to the TOC should help a non-TOC customer (downstream link in a supply chain, whether internal or external) manage their inventory according to the TOC process. This type of help can take the form of a vendor managed inventory (VMI). The TOC distribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques to its customers' inventories. Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand from the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU. VMI results in better availability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer. The benefits to the non-TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on the competitive edge by giving the customer a reason to be more loyal and give more business to the upstream link. When the end consumers buy more, the whole supply chain sells more.
</p><p>One caveat should be considered. Initially and only temporarily, the supply chain or a specific link may sell less as the surplus inventory in the system is sold.  However, the sales lift due to improved availability is a countervailing factor. The current levels of surpluses and shortages make each case different.

<p>The thinking processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the steps of initiating and implementing a project. When used in a logical flow, they help walk through a <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/buy-in" title="wikt:buy-in">buy-in</a> process:
</p>
<ol><li>Gain agreement on the problem</li>
<li>Gain agreement on the direction for a solution</li>
<li>Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem</li>
<li>Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications</li>
<li>Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation</li></ol>
<p>TOC practitioners sometimes refer to these in the negative as working through <i>layers of resistance</i> to a change.
</p><p>Recently, the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_(theory_of_constraints)" title="Current reality tree (theory of constraints)">current reality tree</a></i> (CRT) and <i>future reality tree</i> (FRT) have been applied to an argumentative academic paper.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>Despite its origins as a manufacturing approach (Goldratt &amp; Cox, The Goal: A process of Ongoing Improvement, 1992), Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (TOC) methodology is now regarded as a systems methodology with strong foundations in the hard sciences (Mabin, 1999). Through its tools for convergent thinking and synthesis, the "Thinking processes", which underpin the entire TOC methodology, help identify and manage constraints and guide continuous improvement and change in organizations (Dettmer H. , 1998).
</p><p>The process of change requires the identification and acceptance of core issues; the goal and the means to the goal. This comprehensive set of logical tools can be used for exploration, solution development and solution implementation for individuals, groups or organizations. Each tool has a purpose and nearly all tools can be used independently (Cox &amp; Spencer, 1998). Since these thinking tools are designed to address successive "layers of resistance" and enable communication, it expedites securing "buy in" of groups. While CRT (current reality tree) represents the undesirable effects of the current situation, the FRT (the future reality tree), NBR (negative branch) help people plan and understand the possible results of their actions. The PRT (prerequisite tree) and TRT (transition tree) are designed to build collective buy in and aid in the Implementation phase. The logical constructs of these tools or diagrams are the necessary condition logic, the sufficient cause logic and the strict logic rules that are used to validate cause-effect relationships which are modelled with these tools (Dettmer W. , 2006).
</p><p>A summary of these tools, the questions they help answer and the associated logical constructs used is presented in the table below.

<p><b>TOC Thinking Process Tools:</b>
Use of these tools are based on the fundamental beliefs of TOC that organizations a) are inherently simple (interdependencies exist in organizations) b) desire inherent harmony (win – win solutions are possible) c) are inherently good (people are good) and have inherent potential (people and organizations have potential to do better) (Goldratt E. , 2009). In the book "Through the clouds to solutions" Jelena Fedurko (Fedurko, 2013) states that the major areas for application of TP tools as:
</p>
<ul><li>To create and enhance thinking and learning skills</li>
<li>To make better decisions</li>
<li>To develop responsibility for one's own actions through understanding their consequences</li>
<li>To handle conflicts with more confidence and win-win outcomes</li>
<li>To correct behavior with undesirable consequences</li>
<li>Assist in evaluating conditions for achieving a desired outcome</li>
<li>To assist in peer mediation</li>
<li>To assist in relationship between subordinates and bosses<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2016)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></li></ul>

<p>TOC was initiated by Goldratt, who until his death was still the main driving force behind the development and practice of TOC. There is a network of individuals and small companies loosely coupled as practitioners around the world. TOC is sometimes referred to as "constraint management". TOC is a large body of knowledge with a strong guiding philosophy of growth.

And Noreen Smith and Mackey, in their independent report on TOC, point out that several key concepts in TOC "have been topics in management accounting textbooks for decades."<sup id="cite_ref-tocma_17-1"><a href="#cite_note-tocma-17">[17]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 149">: 149 </span></sup> It is also claimed<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (November 2007)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> that Goldratt's books fail to acknowledge that TOC borrows from more than 40 years of previous management science research and practice, particularly from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_evaluation_and_review_technique" title="Program evaluation and review technique">program evaluation and review technique</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method" title="Critical path method">critical path method</a> (PERT/CPM) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_(business)" title="Just-in-time (business)">just in time</a> strategy.
</p><p>A rebuttal to these criticisms is offered in Goldratt's "What is the <i>Theory of Constraints</i> and How Should it be Implemented?", and in his audio program, "Beyond The Goal". In these, Goldratt discusses the history of disciplinary sciences, compares the strengths and weaknesses of the various disciplines, and acknowledges the sources of information and inspiration for the thinking processes and critical chain methodologies. Articles published in the now-defunct Journal of <i>Theory of Constraints</i> referenced foundational materials. Goldratt published an article<sup id="cite_ref-giants_26-0"><a href="#cite_note-giants-26">[26]</a></sup> and gave talks<sup id="cite_ref-giantsvideo_27-0"><a href="#cite_note-giantsvideo-27">[27]</a></sup> with the title "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants" in which he gives credit for many of the core ideas of Theory of Constraints. Goldratt has sought many times to show the correlation between various improvement methods.
</p><p>Goldratt has been criticized on lack of openness in his theories, an example being him not releasing the algorithm he used for the Optimum Performance Training system.<sup id="cite_ref-rahman1998_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-rahman1998-28">[28]</a></sup> Some view him as unscientific with many of his theories, tools and techniques not being a part of the public domain, rather a part of his own framework of profiting on his ideas.
According to Gupta and Snyder (2009), despite being recognized as a genuine management philosophy nowadays, TOC has yet failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the academic literature and as such, cannot be considered academically worthy to be called a widely recognized theory.  TOC needs more case studies that prove a connection between implementation and improved financial performance.<sup id="cite_ref-gupta2009_29-0"><a href="#cite_note-gupta2009-29">[29]</a></sup>
Nave (2002) argues that TOC does not take employees into account and fails to empower them in the production process.  He also states that TOC fails to address unsuccessful policies as constraints.<sup id="cite_ref-nave2002_30-0"><a href="#cite_note-nave2002-30">[30]</a></sup>
In contrast, Mukherjee and Chatterjee (2007) state that much of the criticism of Goldratt's work has been focused on the lack of rigour in his work, but not of the bottleneck approach, which are two different aspects of the issue.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>

<p>Facing competition from Starlink and other emerging satellite broadband networks, the two companies that own most of the traditional commercial communications spacecraft in geostationary orbit announced plans to join forces Tuesday.</p>
<p>SES, based in Luxembourg, will buy Intelsat for $3.1 billion.&nbsp;The acquisition will create a combined company boasting a fleet of some 100 multi-ton satellites in geostationary orbit, a ring of spacecraft located more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. This will be more than twice the size of the fleet of the next-largest commercial geostationary satellite operator.</p>
<p>The problem is that demand is waning for communication services through large geostationary (GEO) satellites. There are some large entrenched customers, like video media companies and the military, that will continue to buy telecom capacity on geostationary satellites. But there's a growing demand among consumers, and some segments of the corporate and government markets, for the types of services offered by constellations of smaller satellites flying closer to Earth.</p>
<p>The biggest of these constellations, by far, is SpaceX's Starlink network, with more than 5,800 active satellites in its low-Earth orbit fleet a few hundred miles above Earth. Each of the Starlink satellites is smaller than a conventional geostationary platform but linked together with laser communication terminals; thousands of these spacecraft pack enough punch to eclipse the capacity of Internet networks anchored by geostationary satellites. Starlink now has more than 2.6 million subscribers, according to SpaceX.</p>
<p>Satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) offer some advantages over geostationary satellites. Because they are closer to users on the ground, low-Earth orbit satellites provide signals with lower latency. The satellites for these constellations can be mass-produced at relatively low cost&nbsp;compared to a single geostationary satellite, which often costs $250 million or more to build and launch.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"In a fast-moving and competitive satellite communication industry, this transaction expands our multi-orbit space network, spectrum portfolio, ground infrastructure around the world, go-to-market capabilities, managed service solutions, and financial profile," said Adel Al-Saleh, CEO of SES, in a&nbsp;statement announcing the acquisition of Intelsat.</p>
<h2>A trend of consolidation</h2>
<p>Some of the largest legacy operators in geostationary orbit have made moves over the last decade to respond to the new competition.</p>
<p>The only operational low-Earth orbit Internet constellation besides Starlink was launched by OneWeb, which primarily sells capacity to existing Internet providers, who then distribute services to individual consumers. This is in contrast to SpaceX's approach with Starlink providing services directly to homes and businesses.</p>
<p>Eutelsat, the third-largest operator of geostationary satellites, merged with OneWeb last year, creating a company with a blended offering of GEO and LEO services. Viasat, a pioneer in satellite Internet services using dedicated spacecraft in geostationary orbit, last year purchased Inmarsat, which specialized in providing connectivity to airplanes and ships.</p>
<p>SES's acquisition of Intelsat stands apart due to the size of their satellite fleets. Founded in 1985, SES currently operates 43 geostationary satellites, plus 26 broadband spacecraft in medium-Earth orbit (MEO) a few thousand miles above Earth. These MEO satellites operate in a kind of middleground between LEO and GEO satellites, offering lower latency than geostationary networks while still flying high enough to not require hundreds or thousands of spacecraft to blanket the globe.</p>
<p>Intelsat has 57 geostationary satellites, primarily for television and video-relay services. Al-Saleh said the combined company will offer coverage over 99 percent of the world and provide services through a range of communication bands. For now, LEO broadband satellites in the Starlink and OneWeb networks beam signals to user terminals in the Ku-band.</p>
<p>Al-Saleh said the combined networks of SES and Intelsat will span Ka-band, Ku-band, X-band, C-band, UHF, and secure bands tailored for military use. "That gives us a unique position in the marketplace to be able to deliver to our clients," he said.</p>
<p>SES and Intelsat have 13 new satellites on order, including six GEO spacecraft and seven broadband MEO satellites. Intelsat also brings to the table access to OneWeb's LEO constellation. Earlier this year, Intelsat announced it reserved $250 million of capacity on OneWeb's network over the next six years, with an option to purchase double that amount.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>David Paul Gregg was born on the 11th of March in 1923 in Los Angeles, California. From 1940 to 1943, Gregg was in the US Navy. He attended Kansas State University from 1945 to 1947 and then transferred to the University of Southern California from which he received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1950. He then continued his postgraduate education at the Case Institute of Technology and also back at the University of Southern California. Like many students at the time, Gregg worked throughout the time of his postgraduate studies. In 1956, Gregg began working at Westrex (a Western Electric subsidiary). In 1958, he was experimenting with a shellac disc where he’d encoded audio with FM signals in pits and ridges and then read the information with a laser. Gregg’s employers wanted to own the patent for this work, and Gregg refused leading to his termination in 1960. Undeterred, Gregg went to work for Mincom (a subsidiary of 3M) who was a direct competitor of Westrex. He further developed the technology there with Wayne Johnson and Dean De Moss and he gained the patent for his work in 1962 as an</span><em> electron beam recording and reproducing system</em><span>. This work at Mincom covered recording and reading discs as well as a method for displaying the decoded data on a television. While there are patents for this work filed by 3M, Gregg refused to give up full control of his invention. He was fired yet again. David Paul Gregg was an indefatigable individual, and he chose to start his own company, Gauss Electrophysics, to further the development of optical video and audio storage. Gregg cited a technical description gracing his desk in 1956 as the inspiration for his work, and given that timing, the most likely work was that of Antonio Rubbiani from Modena, Italy. He developed a plexiglass disc that had actual images on its surface with light and magnification in the turntable. The earliest versions of this had trouble with reproduction due to interference from the electric motor in the turntable, but it was enough to publish his results.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png" width="727" height="375.5974643423138" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:326,&quot;width&quot;:631,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:727,&quot;bytes&quot;:65385,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fca1e9029-5455-4606-8ebb-8c64a446a9e4_631x326.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The two Gauss Electrophysics trademarks I could find</figcaption></figure></div><p>An interesting note is that while Gregg was continuing his work on optical storage and playback, the company’s trademark was filed for the business of magnetic tape recording and duplicating machines, and many of his patents did mention using electron beams and lasers for the reading of magnetic tape. As for Gregg’s disc technology, he called it VIDEODISK. It was an analog optical disc with video and two audio tracks. The disc was transparent and light passing through the disc was read by a sensor on the side opposite the laser.</p><p>In 1967, Gregg reached out to Philips Electronics to have them either license or purchase the technology, but Philips wasn’t interested. MCA, on the other hand, most certainly was and they purchased Gauss Electrophysics in 1968 along with all of Gregg’s patents. With this acquisition, MCA created MCA Laboratories in Torrance, California. Within just a few years, this became MCA DiscoVision, and on the 12th of December in 1972, this research arm of MCA held a press conference at Universal Studios to demonstrate their Disco-Vision system to the world. As far as I can tell, this was the first public demonstration of a technology of this sort using lasers, reflection, and spinning disks. On the MCA discs, video and audio information was encoded as variable distances between the edges of pits in a spiral track, as the laser passed over the track during the discs’s rotation these pit variations reproduced a frequency-modulated analog signal. These discs were made of thin sheets of mylar, and in the demonstration, a single Disco-Vision disc played seven minutes of video and audio clipped from twenty two different movies. However, according to MCA, these discs could hold up to twenty minutes of video on a single disc with constant angular velocity at eighteen hundred RPM. Each track on the disc then contained one video frame, permitting thirty six thousand individual frames. An alternative format MCA pursued was the constant linear velocity disc which could hold forty minutes of playback per side, but these discs didn’t allow arbitrary frame access; in other words, the original MCA discs could be either twenty minutes for forty minutes, but the forty minute discs would not allow a user to randomly access data. These formats were improved over time with CAV eventually offering thirty minutes for NTSC and thirty six minutes for PAL on a single side of a disc. CLV was eventually imrpoved to allow sixty minutes per side for NTSC and sixty four minutes for PAL.</p><p>While MCA was attempting to make ready its DiscoVision for the mass market, Philips was pursuing an extremely similar technology in the Netherlands. Representatives from Philips had attended the press conference in December 1972, and while they’d not wished to work with Gauss previously, they were apparently impressed by the demonstration, and they contacted MCA Disco-Vision immediately. While the two companies’ technologies were truly close to one another, Disco-Vision did have the distinct advantage of being able to replicate discs, and play from those discs. There is some conflicting information about Philips’ optical technologies.  The most commonly cited origin of the work at Philips is with James T. Russell working at the Battelle Memorial Institute, completely independently of David Paul Gregg, where his work was viewed by both Philips and Sony. I am sure Russell’s work was extremely influential over the years, but I believe that it was the work of Piet Kramer who led Philips’ optical research group, Klaas Compaan who caried out much of the practical work, and Gijs Bouwhuis working on optics which ultimately produced Philips’ early optical storage technology. Russell’s work became far more important later on with a different format. Compaan and Kramer began working black and white video recorded to a spinning glass disk in 1969, and they had a working prototype available in September of 1971. They demonstrated the prototype to Philips’ management in December, and then in July of 1972, they had a working color prototype.</p><p>By September of 1974, MCA Disco-Vision and Philips began to cooperate on optical disc technologies. Certainly, they wished avoid competing with one another with incompatible technologies that would likely make the medium fail completely, but it also seems to me that they were likely trying to keep RCA’s upcoming SelectaVision from becoming successful. I am sure that they were also worried about both VHS and BetaMax. While sharing research information and technologies, the two companies were able to accelerate development. The final arrangement between the two was that MCA worked on disc mastering and replication while Philips manufactured and distributed the consumer disc player through its Magnavox brand.</p><p>MCA also wanted to tackle the industrial market and they made an agreement with Pioneer to form Universal Pioneer in October of 1977 for this purpose. As a condition of this joint venture, Pioneer was also able to build a mastering and pressing facility in Japan. The most famous of these early systems was the PR-7820 models 1, 2, and 3 which was used in video game arcade cabinets, car dealerships, and many more places. This model featured 1kb of memory allowing it to execute programs stored as data on the analog right channel. While the player had basic controls on the front panel, a full-featured programming remote can be used via IR or wired connectivity as well. The PR-7820 also had a parallel port, and an optional DB-25 serial port via the UEI-232 interface box.</p><p>By this point, the discs were more recognizable to all of us today. These were twelve inches, reflective aluminum with clear plastic, and the laser that read them was helium-neon at six hundred thirty two nanometer wavelength. The image quality was superior to tape and broadcast television, and audio quality was similarly good. Early discs had analog audio with poor components and mastering, but the encoding was far better and less lossy than alternatives then available.</p><p><span>On the 13th of December in 1978, MCA DiscoVision (yes, no hyphen, they rebranded) and Philips Magnavox held a press conference at the Regency Hotel in New York. In the ballroom, they told all attending that they’d introduce their new disc system in Atlanta, Georgia followed by Seattle, Washington. On the 15th of December in 1978, MCA’s discs and Magnavox’s Magnavision VH-8000 went on sale in three stores in Atlanta. Magnavox had hoped to make fifty players available at a price of $749.00 each (about $3588 in 2024), but just half that number had made it in time. All were sold a few hours after the stores had opened, and discs sold well despite many of the purchasers not yet owning players. While MCA had hoped to have five hundred titles available at launch, by February of 1979 as the system entered Seattle stores just fifty were available. The first title marketed and sold was </span><em>Jaws</em><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg" width="722" height="667.85" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:722,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Jaws (1975) Laserdisc MCA Discovision Steven Spielberg Horror Film Classic&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Jaws (1975) Laserdisc MCA Discovision Steven Spielberg Horror Film Classic" title="Jaws (1975) Laserdisc MCA Discovision Steven Spielberg Horror Film Classic" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0f9b6fdf-bdf2-4968-9af4-e68ba96880e7_640x592.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This was a great debut, but things weren’t actually going well at all. Complaints began early. These early discs and players weren’t of high quality, some players weren’t compatible with some discs and/or features, and failure rates were high. Despite the trouble, sales continued and the two companies continued their rollout while Philips began investigating the complaints. DiscoVision engineers were also studying the problem, and their solution was to modify the player to allow playback of all available discs. Philips derided these mods as band-aids that ameliorated discs not conforming to specifcations. Much to MCA’s credit, the Pioneer PR-7820 was happily playing every available disc while Philips’ players were not.</p><p>For 1978 and 1979, the Magnavox Magnavision VLP/DiscoVision system was alone on the market, and by the end of 1980, full nationwide rollout was completed. Then, in June of 1980, Pioneer chose to introduce the VP-1000 to retail in Madison, Minneapolis, Dallas, and Syracuse using the name of LaserDisc. By Christmas, Pioneer was everywhere and they’d lowered the price of their player to $500 (roughly $1895 in 2024), the number of titles had significantly increased, and Philips was struggling to make sales.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg" width="800" height="645" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:645,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Pioneer VP-1000&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Pioneer VP-1000" title="Pioneer VP-1000" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F841c0ac2-f904-47b5-892e-e284e5e3406d_800x645.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The Pioneer VP-1000, Pioneer press image</figcaption></figure></div><p>For MCA, the situation was every bit as grim as that for Philips and even a bit more. The company had two existing plants for disc production, mastering, and duplication. One, and the first, was a small batch production and research facility in Torrence, California. The second was a large mass duplication plant in Carson. This second plant essentially had total responsibility for all disc mastering and duplication. Yields were bad, cost of replication was higher than expected, returns were high, and MCA needed money. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, if you were making a data storage medium and you wanted help, to whom did you turn? IBM. A bit of information that would surprise absolutely no one, IBM too had been researching optical storage media not too dissimilar from MCA’s. On the 19th of September in 1979, MCA DiscoVision ceased to exist. Under MCA’s new agreement with IBM, a joint venture was formed as Discovision Associates. IBM then took charge of all research, development, and manufacturing of discs, and MCA supplied them with their knowledge while continuing to do distribution, sales, marketing, and content procurement. In what appears to be a constant with IBM, their staff and that of MCA didn’t really get on. IBM had initially expressed intent to improve the Carson facility, but they chose instead to build a new location in Costa Mesa. For anyone thinking that this would be the end of it and that MCA’s fortunes would improve, I have rather bad news… that isn’t at all what happened. Instead, Pioneer completed the construction of their facility in Kofu and began mass producing discs of exceedingly higher quality than anything MCA/IBM could produce at the time. By 1981, Discovision Associates was out of money and going out of business. Pioneer bought half of the company, bought both existing facilities, and began offering their players for rebadging. Philips subsequently quit producing their own players and just resold Pioneer units.</p><p>In October 1981, LaserDisc expanded to Japan, where the format would see greater success than any other single market. Shortly after this, Pioneer brought the first major change to LaserDiscs, CAA. CAA stands for constant angular acceleration and is similar to the constant linear velocity format for discs. The difference is that CAA varies the angular rotation of the disc in steps. This format became the standard over time as it improved both sound and picture quality. This format was updated to CAA55 in 1985. The major change was that play time was reduced to fifty five minutes and five seconds per side to allow room for digital audio. This was then updated again in 1987 with CAA60 which offered sixty minutes and five seconds per side, and then CAA65 and CAA70. These later formats had digital audio of 16-bit with a sample rate of 44.1&nbsp;kHz.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

embedded computers on each player, Pioneer introduced dual format players in European markets capable of playing both NTSC and PAL discs. So, if you had a mate in North America, Japan, or South Korea and he sent a copy of </span><em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em><span> to your flat near Leeds Met or Le Mirail, you could play the disc assuming you had one of these new dual format players. Most Pioneer LaserDisc players from the middle of the 1980s onward were also capable of CD audio playback, and their disc trays contained small depressions for the smaller disc. This change was accompanied by another major change to players, infrared aluminum galluim arsenide laser diodes replaced the helium-neon lasers.</span></p><p><span>Despite LaserDisc having both superior video and superior audio when compared to VHS, VHS was winning the market. Much speculation can be made about why, but the simplest answer is pricing and convenience. While discs were rather cheap ($15 to $40, though box sets and collector’s editions could be significantly more expensive), and certainly cheaper to produce, the players were quite expensive. For a cost example, the Pioneer LD-660 cost around $800 in the middle 1980s when a VCR was $600 (that would be $2400 and $1800 respectively in 2024). This only got worse over time. As LaserDisc players improved, their costs remained high while VHS player/recorders dropped to around $250 by the end of the decade. On the convenience front, the discs were a foot across, about half a pound, easily damaged, and had to be flipped half way through a film. LaserDisc players also didn’t have a recorder function while VCRs did. The VCR’s recording function also served to lower media costs for those willing to borrow and copy a neighbor’s tape of </span><em>Back to the Future</em><span>. So why did LaserDisc persist over time? Cinemaphiles. Just as extremely high end audio and video equipment can be purchased today while lower cost and lower fidelity options are more common, this was just as true in the 1980s and 1990s. </span></p><p><span>Owing to the nature of the market LaserDisc served, LaserDiscs often came with </span><em>special features</em><span>. This was especially true of deluxe home video releases by labels such as the </span><a href="https://www.criterion.com/" rel="">Criterion Collection</a><span>. These releases were made with the best possible transfers to disc, the most numerous special features, tons of artwork and information in the booklet shipped with the disc, and were often shipped on multiple discs. Some collector’s editions, boxed sets, and deluxe releases could cost as much as $250 on release like the Star Wars Trilogy Definitive Collection.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg" width="722" height="592.265625" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c17c53cf-5027-4c40-ba9e-06dbf5d75853_640x525.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:525,&quot;width&quot;:640,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:722,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;r/LaserDisc -

In Apple’s case, this made use of HyperCard and allowed for the creation of LaserStacks on Macintosh or the IIgs. This made use of the serial port and required a LaserDisc player capable of serial control.</p><p>In 1989, Pioneer purchased nearly all the Philips videodisc patents as well as over $100 million worth of patents held by Discovision Associates (but this was not all of Discovision’s patents). By the end of 1990, LaserDisc was in roughly a million homes in the USA and Canada, but it was significantly more popular in Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong.</p><p><span>In the 1990s, the </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-commodore-part-4" rel="">Amiga</a><span> saw some games get released on LaserDisc. For these games the Amiga would need to be paired with a Pioneer unit capable of computer control such as the PR-7820, LD-V1000, or LD-V2000. Most of these were originally intended for use in arcades that combined an Amiga board (or similar m68k) with a Pioneer LaserDisc player and offered a light gun or arcade joystick. Many of these titles were later ported to Sega CD, CD-i, 3DO, Sega Saturn, or Sony Playstation. Of course, when speaking of the Amiga, a far more common use of LaserDiscs was in combination with a Genlock allowing the LaserDisc’s video to be overlaid with other video from the Amiga.</span></p><p>On the 20th of August in 1993, Pioneer released the LaserActive for $970. The LaserActive was a video game console, a CD player, a LaserDisc player, a karaoke machine, and offered an add-on port which could be used to add a Sega Genesis or a TurboGrafx-16. The LaserActive also featured an RS-232 port allowing for computer control. Given the price of the LaserActive and the price of the add-ons (known as PACs) the system wasn’t successful, though it was the single most expensive way to get a SEGA Genesis. Of course, for those fortunate enough to afford one, it did offer crazy versatility. I’d love to have one in my collection, but prices…</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg" width="1024" height="796" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:796,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;undefined&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="undefined" title="undefined" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66986d2e-0e14-49cb-bc3a-53be52df919f_1024x796.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Pioneer LaserActive with the Genesis PAC</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The 1990s saw the two final developments of the LaserDisc format, AC3 and DTS. The first was AC-3, also known as Dolby Digital, which came to LaserDisc with the release of </span><em>Clear and Present Danger</em><span> in 1995 providing 5.1 channel surround sound. DTS came to LaserDisc with the rerelease of Jurassic Park in 1997.</span></p><p><span>DVD launched in 1998, and at first, LaserDisc still offered superior picture quality due to kind of bad artefacting on DVDs and due to encoding problems on early DVDs. Yet, DVDs were far smaller and more convenient with nearly all titles requiring a single side of a single disc. The status of the LaserDisc didn’t last either. The final LaserDisc released in the USA was </span><em>Bringing Out the Dead</em><span> in 2000. The quality of both DVD players and discs improved quickly, the prices quickly dropped, and by 2001, DVD players were outselling VCRs in the USA. Despite the big disc format’s demise in the States, it continued in Japan for some time until Pioneer announced its final batch of three thousand players on the 14th of January in 2009:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Pioneer Corporation today announces that it will cease to manufacture its LaserDisc (LD) players upon completing the production of a total of approximately 3,000 more players.</em></p><p><em>In 1980, Pioneer introduced its first consumer LD player (VP-1000) in the U.S. market, followed by the Japanese market in 1981 and other markets accordingly. The company has seen worldwide sales of its LD players reach more than 9.5 million units to date in a market that saw worldwide sales top 16.8 million devices. It has contributed to the audiovisual enjoyment of so many consumers all over the world. However, under the market environment in which new media such as DVD and Blu-ray discs now dominate, it has become difficult for Pioneer to procure the parts required to produce LD players. Consequently Pioneer has been forced to terminate production of its LD products.</em></p><p><em>The final models produced by Pioneer are the DVL-919 (DVD/LD compatible player), CLD-R5 (LD/CD player), DVK-900 (DVD/LD karaoke system), and</em></p><p><em>DVL-K88 (DVD/LD compatible karaoke player).</em></p><p><em>As for repair services, Pioneer will maintain the spare parts required to restore the normal functions of Pioneer LD players during the minimum storage period.</em></p></blockquote><p>Today, the majority of both LaserDisc players and LaserDiscs can be had cheaply, and in some cases they are the only way to watch certain films. In many more cases, the special features (commentary, documentaries about the making of a film, deleted scenes, and so on) may not be available on any other medium. In fewer cases, the LaserDisc may still be the best version in video, audio, or both due to being made from higher quality sources. Unfortunately, just as early CDs and DVDs are starting to have some issues, LaserDiscs are also starting to die. On lower quality media, the aluminum layer slowly oxidizes making the disc unreadable. In other cases, the glue used to bind them is giving way as they weren’t well stored.</p><p>Discovision Associates still exists as a patent licensing company, and they still control some optical patents, which apply to nearly all optical disc products like CD, DVD, and BluRay.</p><p>I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover.

<p>The European Union suffers from numerous weaknesses compared to the United States, including the lack of European tech giants, weaker university rankings and limited private capital availability. But one frequently cited claim is wrong: in terms of output growth, the EU has not fallen significantly behind the US. In fact it has converged to the US in terms of per-capita output, per-worker output and, especially, output per hours worked.</p>
<p>A simplistic interpretation would have it that the EU is lagging badly. It had a slightly higher GDP (measured in US dollars) than the United States in 2008, but by 2022, the EU economy was a third smaller than the US<sup>
<a id="footnoteref1_6yh8bwk" href="#footnote1_6yh8bwk" aria-label="Click to open the footnote.">1</a>
</sup>
<dfn>
See for example Gideon Rachman, ‘Europe has fallen behind America and the gap is growing’, Financial Times, 19 June 2023, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/80ace07f-3acb-40cb-9960-8bb4a44fd8d9">https://www.ft.com/content/80ace07f-3acb-40cb-9960-8bb4a44fd8d9</a>, which relies on Shapiro and Puglierin (2023).
</dfn>
. This sounds like a disaster. But it overlooks the fact that EU GDP (measured again in US dollars) was one-third smaller than US GDP in 2000. So, according to this metric, before declining, the EU achieved a miracle from 2000 to 2008 by gaining one-third more output than the US.</p>
<p>Yet there was no European miracle from 2000 to 2008 and no European disaster from 2008 to 2022. The indicator, GDP in US dollars, is useful for measuring economic output at a point in time, but not for evaluating relative time trends. This is because it is strongly influenced by exchange-rate fluctuations, and it measures output in current prices, which differ across nations.</p>
<p>In 2000, €1 was worth $0.92. By 2008, the euro’s exchange rate strengthened considerably, and €1 was worth $1.47. The EU’s GDP is mostly generated in euros, and thus it was worth many more dollars in 2008 than in 2000 because of the currency appreciation. But this was just a temporary rise in the value of the euro and not a reflection of skyrocketing economic growth in the EU. After 2008, the opposite happened. By 2022, €1 was worth $1.05, so compared to 2008, the euro’s significant depreciation relative to the dollar reduced the dollar value of EU GDP.</p>
<p>The right metric for international comparisons is purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted output. This corrects for exchange rate fluctuations and differences in various national prices. Figure 1 shows both indicators by plotting the EU, US and for comparison Chinese shares of world GDP. There is considerable variation in the EU and US shares at current prices and exchange rates (left panel of Figure 1). But measured at purchasing power parity (right panel of Figure 1), the shares of the two economic giants can be seen to be declining tandem. The EU is losing slightly more, but the gap with the US is not dramatic: the EU27 and the US had the same PPP-adjusted output in 2000, while in 2022, the EU27 economy was 4 percent smaller. The International Monetary Fund (IMF,&nbsp;2023) forecast that the EU27 economy will be 6 percent smaller than the US economy in 2028.</p>
<p>The declining shares of world output of the EU and US are unsurprising given the rapid growth of China and some other emerging countries. At current prices and exchange rates, the EU and China are expected to have practically the same level of output in the 2020s (note that in IMF forecasts, exchange rates are assumed to be unchanged). However, since domestic prices are lower in China than in the EU and the US, China’s share of global output is larger when measured at PPP: China became the largest economy in the world in 2017 and is expected to become even more dominant in the future.</p>


</div><div>
<h4>Population and<em> per capita </em>incomes</h4>
<p>It is also important to relate GDP to the population sizes and dynamics. <em>Per-capita</em> GDP at PPP is the most frequently used metric for cross-country development comparisons. The US population has grown faster than the EU population over the past decades and is expected to continue to grow faster. The EU has, in fact, come closer to the US in terms of GDP <em>per capita</em>, from 67 percent in 1995 (the first year for which EU27 data is available) to 72 percent in 2022 (Figure 2, Panel A). China’s convergence has been impressive, from a mere 2 percent of the US GDP <em>per capita </em>in 1980, to 28 percent of the US in 2022. The IMF expects that China will reach 33 percent of the US level by 2028.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The EU is composed of countries at diverse levels of economic development. Western EU countries diverged from the US from 1980 to 2004 (from 88 percent to 80 percent in terms of GDP <em>per capita)</em>, but since then, <em>per-capita</em> income has fluctuated at about the same level (Panel B of Figure 2). The gap between Northern EU countries and the US has more or less been the same since 1980. Eastern EU countries have converged impressively, from 32 percent of US GDP<em> per capita</em> in 1995 to 55 percent in 2022; IMF projections suggest continued convergence to 60 percent by 2028, nearing the development level of Southern EU countries. Only the southern part of the EU is lagging. <em>Per-capita</em> GDP in the south was 73 percent of the US level in the early 2000s, but had fallen to 61 percent by the pandemic, though at least the IMF does not foresee continued relative declines in the years to come.</p>

</div><div>
<p>Since 2005, the EU27 has converged to the US according to both metrics (Figure 3). Convergence was faster in terms of hours worked than in terms of the number of employees, suggesting that labour productivity in the EU is closing the gap with the US. The temporary setback in 2020-2021 is related to different labour-market adjustments during the pandemic: there were large-scale layoffs of workers in the US, while this effect was mitigated by worker retention schemes in the EU.</p>
<p>Germany, the EU’s largest economy, has the EU’s lowest number of working hours per person employed (Figure 4). This is related to widespread part-time work. In 2022, a German employee produced 20 percent less than a US employee, but in terms of output per hour, a German working hour was 1 percent more productive than a US working hour (Figure 3).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Productivity measured as output per hour worked also exceeded the US value in Luxembourg, Ireland, Belgium and Denmark. In the Netherlands, it was the same as in the US, and it was just slightly lower in Austria (1 percent lower), France (2 percent lower) and Sweden (5 percent lower).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some western and northern European nations seem to value leisure time and prefer to work fewer hours, thereby earning lower incomes, even if in many of these countries, workers produce the same or higher amounts in an hour than workers in the US. In contrast, southern and eastern EU workers tend to work more hours a year than US workers (Figure 4).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</div><div>
<h4>Consumption compared</h4>
<p>Finally, a comparison of consumption levels is also useful. Since the EU economy is more capital intensive than the US economy – that is, the capital stock/output ratio is higher in the EU than in the US (2.9 vs 2.3 in 2022, according to European Commission calculations<sup>
<a id="footnoteref2_26rysyr" href="#footnote2_26rysyr" aria-label="Click to open the footnote.">2</a>
</sup>
<dfn>
According to the AMECO dataset, which is the annual macro-economic database published by the European Commission’s Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (European Commission, 2023).
</dfn>
) – more investment is needed in the EU to maintain the level of the capital stock and output, implying that less income is available for consumption.</p>
<p>Consequently, the EU’s consumption <em>per capita </em>measured at purchasing power standards (PPS) relative to the US (Figure 5) is lower than the EU’s GDP <em>per capita</em> relative to the US (Figure 2) – 58 percent (consumption) versus 72 percent (GDP) in 2022. The good news for the EU, however, is that it has also narrowed the gap with the US in terms of consumption<em> per capita</em>. While there was an initial decline from 54 percent of the US level in 1995 to 51 percent in 2005, the EU has steadily increased its relative position since, to 58 percent of the US level in 2019. The pandemic caused a temporary setback, and the recovery of consumption has been slower in the EU than in the US, yet the EU’s relative position returned to 58 percent in 2022, and the Commission’s forecast suggests the same level in 2024 (European Commission, 2023).</p>
<p>It is also useful to keep in mind that since disposable income inequality is lower in the EU than in the US, the EU-US gap is likely smaller for those at low- and middle-income levels than the average for the whole population reported in Figure 5.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Large language models such as GPT and Llama are trained with a next-token prediction loss. In this work, we suggest that training language models to predict multiple future tokens at once results in higher sample efficiency. More specifically, at each position in the training corpus, we ask the model to predict the following n tokens using n independent output heads, operating on top of a shared model trunk. Considering multi-token prediction as an auxiliary training task, we measure improved downstream capabilities with no overhead in training time for both code and natural language models. The method is increasingly useful for larger model sizes, and keeps its appeal when training for multiple epochs. Gains are especially pronounced on generative benchmarks like coding, where our models consistently outperform strong baselines by several percentage points. Our 13B parameter models solves 12 % more problems on HumanEval and 17 % more on MBPP than comparable next-token models. Experiments on small algorithmic tasks demonstrate that multi-token prediction is favorable for the development of induction heads and algorithmic reasoning capabilities. As an additional benefit, models trained with 4-token prediction are up to 3 times faster at inference, even with large batch sizes.
