<p>AI has made remarkable strides in the medical field, with capabilities including the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06555-x">detection of Parkinson’s disease via retinal images</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02361-0">identification of promising drug candidates</a>, and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06160-y">prediction of hospital readmissions</a>. While these advance are exciting, I’m wary of the practical impact AI will have on patients.</p>
<p>I recently watched a late-night talk show where skeptics and enthusiasts debated AI safety. Despite their conflicting views, there was one thing they could all agree upon. “AI will cure cancer,” one panelist declared, and everyone else confidently echoed their agreement. This collective optimism strikes me as overly idealistic and raises concerns about a failure to grapple with the realities of healthcare.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>My reservations about AI in medicine stem from two core issues: First, the medical system often disregards patient perspectives, inherently limiting our comprehension of medical conditions. Second, AI is used to disproportionately benefit the privileged while worsening inequality. In many instances, claims like “AI will cure cancer” are being invoked as little more than superficial marketing slogans. To understand why, it is first necessary to understand how AI is used, and how the medical system operates.</p>
<section id="how-automated-decision-making-is-used">
<h2 data-anchor-id="how-automated-decision-making-is-used">How Automated Decision Making is Used</h2>
<p>Automated computer systems, often involving AI, are increasingly being used to make decisions that have a big impact on people’s lives: determining who gets jobs, housing, or healthcare. Disturbing patterns are found across numerous countries and a range of systems: there is typically no way to surface or correct errors, and all too often the goal is to increase corporate and government revenues by denying poor people resources they need to survive.</p>
<p>A woman in France had her food benefits reduced by a computer program and can no longer afford enough to eat. She talked to a program officer, who said <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/10/how-eus-flawed-artificial-intelligence-regulation-endangers-social-safety-net">the cut was due to an error in the computer program</a>, but was unable to change it. She did not have her food benefits reinstated. The system was designed such that the computer is always considered correct, even when humans recognize an error. This woman was not alone; she was one of 60,000 people who went hungry due to these errors.</p>

<p>A man in Australia was told that he had been overpaid welfare benefits and that he was now in debt to the government. The debt was an error, based on an intentionally faulty calculation as part of the computational RoboDebt program. However, the man had no way to contest it. Despondent, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/feb/20/platitudes-and-false-words-mother-of-robodebt-victim-who-took-own-life-tells-inquiry-of-government-stonewalling">he died by suicide</a>. This was not a one-off incident. The Australian government was later found to have wrongly created debts for hundreds of thousands of people.They were putting poor people into debt with a flawed calculation system, ruining lives efficiently at scale. The government had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/29/robodebt-government-to-repay-470000-unlawful-centrelink-debts-worth-721m">increased the number of poor people it put into debt</a> each week by 50x, compared to before RoboDebt.</p>
<p>A woman in the USA with cerebral palsy needed a health aid to help her get out of bed in the morning, to get her meals, and to complete other basic tasks. Her care was drastically <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17144260/healthcare-medicaid-algorithm-arkansas-cerebral-palsy">cut due to a computer bug</a>. She was given no explanation and no option for recourse as her quality of life drastically plummeted. Only through a lengthy court case was it finally revealed that many people with cerebral palsy had wrongly lost their care due to a computer error.</p>
</section>
<section id="patterns-in-automated-decision-making">
<h2 data-anchor-id="patterns-in-automated-decision-making">Patterns in Automated Decision Making</h2>
<p>These examples always flow in the same direction. <a href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/nmlr/vol50/iss3/2/">Professor Alvaro Bedoya</a>, the founding director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at the Georgetown University Law Center, wrote “<em>It is a pattern throughout history that surveillance is used against those considered ‘less than’, against the poor man, the person of color, the immigrant, the heretic. It is used to try to stop marginalized people from achieving power.</em>” The same pattern is found in the role of technology in decision systems.</p>
<p>The goal of many automated decision systems is to increase revenues for governments and private companies. When this is applied to health and medicine, the goal is often achieved by denying poor people food or medical care. People often trust computers to be more accurate than humans, in a bias known as automation bias. A <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3240751/">systematic review of 74 research studies</a> found that automation bias exists across a range of fields, including healthcare, exerting a consistent influence. This bias can make it harder for people to recognize errors in automated decision-making. Moreover, implementing mechanisms to identify and correct errors is often seen as an unnecessary expense.</p>
<p>In all of the cases above, the people most impacted (those losing access to needed food or medical care, or unjustly being thrown into debt) recognized the errors in the system earliest. Yet the systems were built with no mechanism for recognizing mistakes, for allowing the participation of those impacted, nor for providing recourse to those harmed. Unfortunately, this can also be the case in medicine.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-the-medical-system-operates">
<h2 data-anchor-id="how-the-medical-system-operates">How the Medical System Operates</h2>
<p>An AI algorithm that reads MRIs more accurately would not have helped neurologist Ilene Ruhoy, MD, PhD, when she developed a 7 cm brain tumor. The key obstacle to her treatment was getting fellow neurologists to believe her symptoms and even order an MRI in the first place. “<em>I was told I knew too much, that I was working too hard, that I was stressed out, that I was anxious</em>,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/">Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy recounts</a>. Eventually, after her symptoms worsened further, she was able to get an MRI and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/women/features/women-doctors-symptoms-dismissed">urgently sent in for a 7 hour surgery</a>. Because of the delay in her diagnosis, her tumor was so large that it could not be completely removed, which has led to it growing back since her first surgery.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy’s experience is sadly common. While Dr.&nbsp;Ruhoy lives in the USA, a study in the UK found that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare">almost 1 in 3 patients with brain tumors</a> had to visit doctors at least 5 times before receiving an accurate diagnosis. Again, MRI-reading AI can not help these patients whose doctors won’t order an MRI in the first place. On average, it takes <a href="https://academic.oup.com/rheumap/article/4/1/rkaa006/5758274">Lupus patients 7 years</a> to receive a correct diagnosis, and 1 in 3 are initially misdiagnosed with doctors incorrectly claiming mental health issues are the root of their symptoms. Even healthcare workers are often shocked at how quickly they are dismissed and disbelieved once they become patients. For instance, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/">interviews with a dozen healthcare workers</a> revealed that their colleagues shifted to discarding their expertise as soon as they developed Long Covid.</p>

<figcaption>‘Everybody was telling me there was nothing wrong’, a BBC article by Maya Dusenbery</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>This disregard of patient experience and patient expertise severely limits medical knowledge. It results in delayed diagnoses, misdiagnoses, missing data, and incorrect data. AI is great at finding patterns in existing data. However, AI will not be able to solve this problem of missing and erroneous underlying data. Furthermore, there is a negative feedback loop around lack of medical data for poorly understood diseases: doctors disbelieve patients and dismiss them as anxious or complaining too much, failing to gather data which could help illuminate the disease.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-wrong-data">
<h2 data-anchor-id="the-wrong-data">The Wrong Data</h2>
<p>Even worse, often research problems are reformulated to shoe-horn inadequate data sources in. Analyzing electronic health record data is cheaper than searching for new causal mechanisms. Medical data is often limited by the categories of billing codes, by what doctors choose to note from a patient’s account, and what tests are ordered. The data are inherently incomplete.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180518-the-inequality-in-how-women-are-treated-for-pain">Medical bias</a> is widespread, with studies documenting that doctors give <a href="https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/13/2/150/1935962">less pain medication to Black patients</a> than to white patients for the same conditions. On average, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180523-how-gender-bias-affects-your-healthcare">women have to wait months or years longer</a> than men to get an accurate diagnosis for the same conditions. This impacts the data that is collected and will be used for AI. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/D17-1323/">Multiple research studies</a> have shown that AI not only encodes existing biases, but <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09451">can also amplify their magnitude</a>. At heart, these biases often pivot on not believing marginalized people about their experiences: not believing when they say that they are in pain nor how they report their symptoms.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>On a deeper level, ignoring patient expertise limits what hypotheses are devised, and can slow research progress. These issues will propagate into AI, unless researchers seek ways to include meaningful patient participation. These problems are not unique to any one country or any one type of medical system. Patients across the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (the 4 countries I am most familiar with) are all well-documented to experience these issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="being-honest-about-the-risks-and-opportunities">
<h2 data-anchor-id="being-honest-about-the-risks-and-opportunities">Being Honest About the Risks and Opportunities</h2>
<p>While AI holds transformative possibilities for medicine, it is important that we are clear-eyed about both the risks and the opportunities. Many talks on Medical AI give the impression that the only thing holding medicine back is a lack of knowledge. The many other factors that influence medical care, including the systematic disregard for patients’ knowledge of their own experiences, are often ignored in these discussions. Ignoring these realities will lead people to design AI for an idealized medical system that does not exist. There is already a clear pattern in which AI is used to centralize power and harm the marginalized. In medicine, this could lead to patients, who are already disempowered and often disregarded, having even less autonomy or voice.</p>
<p>In my view, some of the most promising areas of research are participatory approaches to machine learning and patient-led medical research. The <a href="https://participatoryml.github.io/">Participatory Approaches to Machine Learning workshop at ICML</a> included a powerful collection of talks and papers on both the need and the opportunities for designing systems with greater participation of those impacted. AI ethics work on topics of contestability (building in ways for participants to contest outputs) and actionable recourse are necessary. For medical research more generally, the <a href="https://patientresearchcovid19.com/">Patient Led Research Collaborative</a> (focused on Long Covid) is an encouraging model. I hope that we can see more efforts within medical AI to center patient expertise.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Among a certain tech set, Kubernetes has earned a reputation as an unnecessarily complicated time-sink that startups should avoid. Using Kubernetes with a small team is seen as a sign of over-engineering.</p>
<p>I’m guilty of taking <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1568257167882436608">pithy jabs</a> myself.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I might gripe about Kubernetes sometimes, but it really is a great piece of technology. I highly recommend it to all my competitors.</p>— Paul Butler (@paulgb) <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1568257167882436608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2022</a></blockquote> 
<p>Despite my snark, “great piece of technology” truly is sincere; at the time of that post I had <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/complexity-kubernetes">recently written</a> about how much of Kubernetes’ complexity is necessary for what it does.</p>
<p>We’ve been running Kubernetes in production for a few years now at <a href="https://jamsocket.com/">Jamsocket</a>, and I’ve found a good flow with it. Kubernetes serenity has been achieved internally. A big key to this has been <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1743361919535260053">carving out a small chunk</a> of Kubernetes’ features and pretending the rest don’t exist.</p>
<p>This post started as an internal guide to the way we use Kubernetes, so it’s not meant to apply prescriptively to every startup; nonetheless I think it’s a good starting place for avoiding many of the sandbars in the vast seas of Kubernetes.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-kubernetes-at-all"><strong>Why use Kubernetes at all?</strong></h2>
<p>As I see it, Kubernetes is the best-travelled path if you want all three of these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>To run multiple processes/servers/scheduled jobs.</li>
<li>To run them redundantly and load balance across them.</li>
<li>To configure them, and the relationships between them, as code.</li>
</ol>
<p>At its most basic, Kubernetes is just a layer of abstraction that lets you think about a pool of computers if it were one (headless) computer. If that’s your use case, and you can avoid the other parts of it, you can get pretty far.</p>
<p>Some people have told me that #2 is overkill, startups shouldn’t focus on zero-downtime deploys or high availability. But we often do multiple deploys per day, and when our products break, our customer’s products break for <em>their</em> users. Even a minute of downtime is noticed by someone. Rolling deploys give us the confidence to deploy unceremoniously and often.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-use-kubernetes">How we use Kubernetes</h2>
<p>For background, <a href="https://jamsocket.com/">Jamsocket</a> is a service for dynamically spinning up processes that a web app can talk to. Kind of like AWS Lambda, but where the process lifetime is bound to a WebSocket connection instead of a single request/response.</p>
<p>We use Kubernetes to run the long-running processes that are needed to support that. The API server, container registry, controller, log collector, some DNS services, metrics collection, etc.</p>
<p>A few things we <em>don’t</em> use Kubernetes for:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ephemeral processes themselves. We did for a hot minute very early on, but we quickly found it limiting (more on that later.)</li>
<li>Static/marketing sites. We use <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a> for those. It’s more expensive, but so is the opportunity cost of an hour of engineering time at a small startup, and Vercel saves us more of that than it costs.</li>
<li>Anything that directly stores data we would be sad to lose. We do use some persistent volumes for caching or derived data, but otherwise we use a managed Postgres DB outside of the cluster and blob storage.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s also worth noting that we don’t administer Kubernetes ourselves — the main advantage of using Kubernetes is that we can outsource the infrastructure-level operation of it! We have been happy with Google Kubernetes Engine, and while the <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/google-domains-to-shut-down/">Google Domains fiasco</a> has shaken my faith in Google Cloud, I at least sleep soundly knowing that migrating to Amazon EKS would be relatively straightforward.</p>
<h2 id="things-we-readily-use">Things we readily use</h2>
<p>There are a few types of k8s resources we use without hesitation. I’m only listing resources here that we create explicitly; most of these resources implicitly create other resources (like Pods) that I will not mention but which we of course (indirectly) use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/">Deployments</a></strong>: Most of our pods are created through deployments. Every deployment critical to our service functioning has multiple replicas and rolling updates.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/">Services</a></strong>: specifically, <code>ClusterIP</code> for internal services and <code>LoadBalancer</code> for external ones. We have avoided <code>NodePort</code> and <code>ExternalName</code> services, preferring for our DNS configuration to live outside of Kubernetes.</li>
<li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/"><strong>CronJobs</strong></a>: for cleanup scripts and that sort of thing.</li>
<li><strong>ConfigMaps</strong> and <strong>Secrets</strong>: for passing data to the above resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-we-cautiously-use">Things we cautiously use</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>StatefulSet</strong> and <strong>PersistentVolumeClaim</strong>: we have used some StatefulSets. The configuration is a bit more convoluted than Deployments, but they can have a persistent volume across restarts. We prefer to persist important data in managed services outside of k8s. We don’t have a hard rule against volumes because sometimes it’s nice to persist e.g. a cache across a service restart, but I avoid them when possible because they can interact badly (deadlock) with rolling deploys.</li>
<li><strong>RBAC</strong>: we have used this in a few places, e.g. to give a service permission to refresh a secret. It adds enough complexity to our small cluster that I mostly avoid it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="things-we-actively-avoid">Things we actively avoid</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hand-writing YAML</strong>. YAML has <a href="https://noyaml.com/">enough foot-guns</a> that I avoid it as much as possible. Instead, our Kubernetes resource definitions are created from TypeScript with <a href="https://www.pulumi.com/">Pulumi</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Non-built-in resources and operators</strong>. I’ve <a href="https://driftingin.space/posts/complexity-kubernetes">written before</a> about how the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/">control loop</a> pattern is a double-edged sword: it’s the core idea that makes K8s robust, but it’s also a source of indirection and complexity. The <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/">operator pattern</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/">custom resources</a> allow third-party software to use Kubernetes’ robust infrastructure for its own control loops, which is a great idea in theory that I’ve found to be clunky in practice. Rather than <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a>, we use <a href="https://caddyserver.com/">Caddy’s</a> certificate automation.</li>
<li><strong>Helm</strong>. Helm is a no-go because of the operators and no YAML rules, but I also just think that using unstructured string templating to generate something machine-parsable means introducing fragility for no gain. <a href="https://v2.helm.sh/docs/charts_tips_and_tricks/#using-the-include-function"><code>nindent</code></a> is like nails-on-a-chalkboard to me, I’m sorry.</li>
<li><strong>Anything with “mesh” in the name.</strong> I guess they’re useful to somebody, but not me, and not <a href="https://matduggan.com/k8s-service-meshes/">this guy</a> either.</li>
<li><strong>Ingress resources</strong>. I don’t have any battle scars from these, and I know some people use them productively, but a theme of our successful use of Kubernetes is avoiding adding unnecessary layers of indirection. Configuring Caddy works for us, so we just do that.</li>
<li><strong>Trying to replicate the entire k8s stack locally</strong>. Instead of using things like k3s or kind to replicate production exactly, we just use Docker Compose or our own scripts that start the subset of the system we actually care about in the moment.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-human-should-never-wait-for-a-pod">A human should never wait for a pod</h2>
<p>Above I alluded to the fact that we briefly ran ephemeral, interactive, session-lived processes on Kubernetes. We quickly realized that Kubernetes is designed for robustness and modularity over container start times. As a general rule, my take is that Kubernetes is good for when you want to redundantly run some long-running processes, but if a human is ever waiting for a pod to start, <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgb/status/1684718880353042432">Kubernetes is the wrong choice</a>.</p>
<p>I’ll confess that I’m talking my book here, but at least it’s an open-source book: we use an MIT-licensed Rust orchestrator called <a href="https://plane.dev/">Plane</a> that we designed specifically for quickly scheduling and running processes for interactive workloads (i.e. ones with a human waiting on them).</p>
<h2 id="higher-level-abstractions">Higher-level abstractions</h2>
<p>For completeness, I should also mention that some of the Kubernetes alternatives that have popped up are quite good. Particularly if you don’t want or need requirement #3 from my initial list (the ability to specify infrastructure as code.) For <a href="https://y-sweet.cloud/">one of our products</a>, we opted to use <a href="https://railway.app/">Railway</a> rather than our k8s cluster, mainly for the preview environments. Some friends I respect highly swear by <a href="https://render.com/">Render</a> (I’ve dabbled but personally find Railway’s environment model cleaner.) I’m also partial to <a href="https://www.flightcontrol.dev/">Flight Control’s</a> bring-your-own-cloud approach.</p>
<p>For a lot of SaaS type apps, you’ll probably get pretty far on those. But if you meet the three needs listed at the beginning of this article and you take a disciplined approach to it, don’t let anybody tell you that you’re too early for Kubernetes.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 15:59:43 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1b55686/maybe_possible_bug_in_stdshared_mutex_on_windows/">https://old.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1b55686/maybe_possible_bug_in_stdshared_mutex_on_windows/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39581664">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A team at my company ran into a peculiar and unexpected behavior with <code>std::shared_mutex</code>. This behavior only occurs on Windows w/ MSVC. It does not occur with MinGW or on other platforms.</p>

<p>At this point the behavior is pretty well understood. The question isn't "how to work around this". The questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is this a bug in <code>std::shared_mutex</code>?</li>
<li>Is this a bug in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sync/slim-reader-writer--srw--locks">Windows SlimReaderWriter</a> implementation?</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm going to boldly claim "definitely yes" and "yes, or the SRW behavior needs to be documented". Your reaction is surely "it's never a bug, it's always user error". I appreciate that sentiment. Please hold that thought for just a minute and read on.</p>

<p>Here's the scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main thread acquires <strong>exclusive</strong> lock</li>
<li>Main thread creates N child threads</li>
<li>Each child thread:

<ol>
<li>Acquires a <strong>shared</strong> lock</li>
<li>Yields until all children have acquired a shared lock</li>
<li>Releases the <strong>shared</strong> lock</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Main thread releases the <strong>exclusive</strong> lock</li>
</ol>

<p>This works <strong><em>most</em></strong> of the time. However 1 out of ~1000 times it "deadlocks". When it deadlocks exactly 1 child successfully acquires a shared lock and all other children block forever in <code>lock_shared()</code>. This behavior can be observed with <code>std::shared_mutex</code>, <code>std::shared_lock</code>/<code>std::unique_lock</code>, or simply calling <code>SRW</code> functions directly.</p>

<p>If the single child that succeeds calls <code>unlock_shared()</code> then the other children will wake up. However if we're waiting for all readers to acquire their shared lock then we will wait forever. Yes, we could achieve this behavior in other ways, that's not the question.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78090862/stdshared-mutexunlock-shared-blocks-even-though-there-are-no-active-exclus">StackOverflow post</a> that has had some good discussion. The behavior has been confirmed. However at this point we need a language lawyer, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/STL">u/STL</a>, or quite honestly Raymond Chen to declare whether this is "by design" or a bug.</p>

<p>Here is code that can be trivially compiled to repro the error.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;atomic&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;shared_mutex&gt;
#include &lt;thread&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

struct ThreadTestData {
    int32_t numThreads = 0;
    std::shared_mutex sharedMutex = {};
    std::atomic&lt;int32_t&gt; readCounter = 0;
};

int DoStuff(ThreadTestData* data) {
    // Acquire reader lock
    data-&gt;sharedMutex.lock_shared();

    // wait until all read threads have acquired their shared lock
    data-&gt;readCounter.fetch_add(1);
    while (data-&gt;readCounter.load() != data-&gt;numThreads) {
        std::this_thread::yield();
    }

    // Release reader lock
    data-&gt;sharedMutex.unlock_shared();

    return 0;
}

int main() {
    int count = 0;
    while (true) {
        ThreadTestData data = {};
        data.numThreads = 5;

        // Acquire write lock
        data.sharedMutex.lock();

        // Create N threads
        std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;std::thread&gt;&gt; readerThreads;
        readerThreads.reserve(data.numThreads);
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; data.numThreads; ++i) {
            readerThreads.emplace_back(std::make_unique&lt;std::thread&gt;(DoStuff, &amp;data));
        }

        // Release write lock
        data.sharedMutex.unlock();

        // Wait for all readers to succeed
        for (auto&amp; thread : readerThreads) {
            thread-&gt;join();
        }

        // Cleanup
        readerThreads.clear();

        // Spew so we can tell when it's deadlocked
        count += 1;
        std::cout &lt;&lt; count &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Personally I don't think the function <code>lock_shared()</code> should ever be allowed to block forever when there is not an exclusive lock. That, to me, is a bug. One that only appears for <code>std::shared_mutex</code> in the <code>SRW</code>-based Windows MSVC implementation. <em>Maybe</em> it's allowed by the language spec? I'm not a language lawyer.</p>

<p>I'm also inclined to call the <code>SRW</code> behavior either a bug or something that should be documented. There's a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170301-00/?p=95615">2017 Raymond Chen</a> post that discusses EXACTLY this behavior. He implies it is user error. Therefore I'm inclined to boldly, and perhaps wrongly, call this is an <code>SRW</code> bug.</p>

<p>What do y'all think?</p>

<p>Edit: Updated to explicitly set <code>readCounter</code> to 0. That is not the problem.</p>

  <p><strong>Supermium browser has:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Aero Glass and Aero Glass-style titlebars instead of Windows 10-style ones</li>
<br>
<li>Turnaround for major vulnerability patches generally less than one week from upstream disclosure</li>
<br>
<li>A functional sandbox for enhanced security</li>
<br>
<li>Custom tab options including trapezoidal tabs, transparent tabs, and outlined tabs</li>
<br>
<li>Many flags from ungoogled-chromium</li>
<br>
<li>Google Sync</li>
<br>
<li>On Windows 7 and up, Widevine CDM support for viewing DRM content</li>
<br>
<li>GDI font rendering, using <b>#force-gdi</b> in <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a></li>
<br>
<li>Persistent dark mode on the browser's UI elements, using <b>#force-dark-mode</b> in <a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a></li>
<br>
<li>Support for SSE2-only processors in the 32 bit build</li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Future support for:</b></p><ul>
<li>Windows 2000</li>
<br>
<li>Ungoogled Chromium features (in progress)</li>
<br>
<li>WebGPU for D3D9 renderer</li>
<br>
<li>Manifest V2 (once removed by Google)</li>
<br>
<li>...and more! If there's a feature you want, which cannot be replicated by a Manifest v2/v3 extension, please ask!</li>
  </ul>


<p><strong>It is important to note that Google Chrome is proprietary software, while Supermium, like Chromium is open source. This means that while similar, Google Chrome's feature set cannot be reproduced perfectly by Supermium.</strong></p><p><img src="https://win32subsystem.live/supermium/images/canada-ball_2X.png" <="" img="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is the story of the most unbelievable demo I've been given in world of open source. You can't make this stuff up.</p>

<p>It was 2005, and I felt like I was in the eye of a hurricane. I was an independent performance consultant and Sun Microsystems had just released DTrace, a tool that could instrument all software. This gave performance analysts like myself X-ray vision. While I was busy writing and publishing advanced performance tools using DTrace (my open source <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/dtracetoolkit.html">DTraceToolkit</a> and other <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/dtrace.html">DTrace tools</a>, aka scripts), I noticed something odd: I was producing more DTrace tools than were coming out of Sun itself. Perhaps there was some internal project that was consuming all their DTrace expertise?</p>

<center><img src="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/images/2007/Bin096_01c.png" width="626"><br><span size="-3"><i>DTraceToolkit v0.96 tools (2006)</i></span></center>

<p>As I wasn't a Sun Microsystems employee I wasn't privy to Sun's internal projects. However, I was doing training and consulting for Sun, helping their customers with system administration and performance. Sun sometimes invited me to their own customer meetings and other events I might be interested in, as a local expert. I was living in Sydney, Australia.</p>

<p>This time I was told that there was a Very Important Person visiting from the US whom I'd want to meet. I didn't recognize the name, but was told that he was a DTrace expert and developer at Sun, and was on a world tour demonstrating Sun's new DTrace-based product. Ah-hah – this must be the internal project!</p>

<p>But this would be no ordinary project. I'd seen some amazing technologies from Sun, but I'd never seen a developer on a world tour. This was going to be big, and would likely blow away my earlier DTrace work.</p>

<p>The VIP was returning to Sydney for a few days before going to the next Australian city, so we agreed to meet at the Sun Sydney office.</p>

<h2>The Meeting</h2>

<p>The DTrace expert arrived wearing casual business attire and a heavy American accent, and seemed a bit weary from his world tour. He had just been to South Africa and New Zealand, and listed other countries and cities he was heading to next. Two other Australian Sun staff joined the meeting, and one introduced me with:</p>

<p>"Brendan teaches some classes for us, and has been doing some DTrace stuff.”</p>

<p>Low-key introductions are the norm in Australia (especially for Australians) and I wondered whether he knew of this cultural difference. Another difference was that there were few roles in Australia for engineers in 2005, unlike the US. The Sun Microsystems Australia jobs, for example, were all in support and none in development, and other tech giants had not yet arrived. So back then in Australia you could find amazing engineers doing whatever roles were available.</p>

<p>I tried to expand on the "stuff" a bit by saying that I’d written the DTraceToolkit, but he wasn't impressed. He didn't recognize my name, nor had he heard of the DTraceToolkit. To him, I was just some random guy.</p>

<p>He was kind enough to give me a quick demo anyway. His DTrace product was an add-on for a larger Sun GUI that I was already familiar with. After it loaded, he showed how you could run one of several DTrace tools by double clicking an icon. Either the raw output would be printed in a separate window, or the results would be shown as a line graph. This seemed <strong>quite underwhelming</strong>. The GUI already had this functionality: Showing the raw output of tools or drawing a line graph. I was hoping for a new GUI feature.</p>

<p>The only new work was the tools themselves, of which there were several. He gave a quick sales pitch about the new and amazing observability they provided, something he must have said many times to impress customers. I got the feeling he wasn't expecting me to properly appreciate their value. </p>

<p>But I <em>did</em> understand these tools, since I had coded similar functionality for my own DTraceToolkit. They were useful, but...I was expecting a hurricane of awesome <em>new</em> DTrace content.</p>

<p>"I've done these before – I've written tools that do these things myself!"</p>

<p>"Yeah, sure." He didn’t quite say it, but gave me a look like he didn't really believe me, or that I could even truly understand what they were. This was an important innovation by Sun Microsystems, a US-based multinational company worth billions. I was just some random Aussie.</p>

<h2>Socket Tracing</h2>

<p>I browsed the GUI icons for something new, and the closest was a tool for tracing socket I/O. I had tried this in 2004 (<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/DTrace/socketsnoop.d">socketsnoop.d</a>) and published it as open source, but my tool was incomplete: I didn't have access to the kernel source code so I had to figure out everything the hard way using black box analysis. It worked for most TCP traffic types but not others, which I warned about in the script comments. I'd also not included it in the DTraceToolkit yet as I didn't consider it finished. So of all the tools he had, I was most interested to see this one. Sun could do a much better job just by referring to the source code they were instrumenting, and actually finish this tool.</p>

<p>"Can I see the socket I/O script?". I fired up a terminal. He looked alarmed at first, as if I wasn't supposed to look behind the curtain, then realized another selling feature: "Well, sure, you could even add more tools to the GUI!" and after a pause, added "if you have them". Sure, I have them all right. He gave me a path to start looking under, and after a bit of searching I found the directory with all the tools he had been demoing.</p>

<p>The tools all had familiar names. One was even called socketsnoop.d. A new possibility dawned on me.</p>

<p>No way.</p>

<p>I printed socketsnoop.d. The screen filled with <em>my own script</em>. It was the same incomplete attempt I had hacked up a year earlier, and published as open source. It included some weird code that only made sense when I wrote it (use of PFORMAT, prior to defaultargs) and was written in my earlier coding style. I was looking at <em>my own fucking script</em>.</p>

<p>"This is MY script."</p>

<p>I printed the other tools and saw the same – they were <em>all mine</em>. This hot new Sun product that Mr. VIP was touring the world showing off was actually just my own open source tools.</p>

<p>My jaw was on the floor. He didn't seem to believe me. </p>

<h2>You Can't Do That</h2>

<p>I used grep to search all his tools for my name, which was in the header comment of all my tools, to prove beyond a doubt that these were mine. But I found nothing. My name had been stripped.</p>

<p>Some of my tools had even included the line:</p>

<pre># Author: Brendan Gregg  [Sydney, Australia]
</pre>

<p>And now, here he was, in Sydney, Australia, trying to sell Brendan Gregg's tools to Brendan Gregg.</p>

<p>One of the Australian Sun staff interrupted: "Those say copyright Sun Microsystems." Most of my tools had my own copyright and a GPLv2 or CDDL license. But these only had Sun's standard copyright message, and the open source licenses had been stripped.</p>

<p>"You deleted my name! And the copyrights and licenses!"</p>

<p>The other Aussie added, to the VIP: "You <b>can't</b> do that." A silence fell over the room as the magnitude of what had happened sunk in. While some at Sun were encouraging open source contributions and building a community, others were ripping off that same community. Taking their work, changing the licence and copyrights, and then selling it.</p>

<p>The VIP wasn't prepared for this and had a look of confusion. He didn't say much, other than that he didn't know what had happened, and that he may have gotten the tools from someone else already like this (ie, don't blame me). He seemed to be only half believing what we were saying.</p>

<p>The meeting ended quickly. I suggested that he get newer copies of my tools, directly from the DTraceToolkit, since these older versions from my homepage were out of date, and some had errors that I had already fixed. I also reminded him to keep my name, copyright, and license on all of them.</p>

<p>In his defense, perhaps the meeting may have gone differently had I not been given a low-key Australian introduction. That's an Australian cultural problem (tall poppy syndrome). To an Australian, introductions in the US can sound boastful, but they can also be useful as a quick way to share one's specialties.</p>

<h2>Other Cases</h2>

<p>Of all the tools I had published as open source, I still can't believe socketsnoop.d was included. It wasn't even very good. Later on I wrote much better socket tools (in my <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/dtrace.html">DTrace</a> and <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/bpf-performance-tools-book.html">BPF</a> books).</p>

<p>A few years later, Apple added dozens of my tools to OS X. They left my name, copyright, and CDDL open source license intact, and even improved and enhanced some of them. Years later, Oracle did the same for Oracle Solaris 11, and the BSD community did for FreeBSD. My thanks to all of you.</p>

<p>You might say that this wasn't really Sun the company doing this, but rather, a careless individual. But there was something in Sun's culture that contributed to this kind of carelessness. It was something I and my consulting colleagues had run into before: The belief at Sun that only Sun could make good use of its own technologies, and anything created outside of Sun was trash. When these Sun employees found something that was good, they were inclined to assume it came from Sun, and it was therefore safe to reuse and rebrand (and relicense) as they assumed they already held the copyrights.</p>

<p>There were also others at Sun that did try hard to do the right thing by me and my work. On at least four other occasions my DTraceToolkit was built into observability products, without stripping licenses. (In one case they wanted to relicense to GPL, and talked to me and Sun legal about it, but that's another story.)</p>

<!-- You might wonder why I didn't talk about this first case publicly at the time. I'd already informed them of the problem privately and how to fix it, so there wasn't more to say. Also, Sun was the number one employer in town, and to be publicly critical could be career ending.  -->

<p>This also wasn't the last time someone unwittingly tried to sell me my own work, it was just the first. I've learned to not tell sales people that I invented what they are showing me, as they then give me funny looks like I'm a crazy person, but instead to simply say "I have a lot of experience with that technology" and leave it at that.</p>

<p>I'm reminded of this first case since my BPF tools are now appearing in observability products, and will grow to a scale much bigger than my DTrace tools. I'll write about it more in future posts, but my immediate advice to developers is this: Please try to build upon my BPF tools and the bcc libraries (either bcc Python or bcc libbpf-tool versions) instead of rewriting them, and fetch regular updates. This is because they are works-in-progress, and rewriting (forking) them divides engineering resources and may have your customers using out of date versions. I explain in more detail in <a href="https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-07-03/how-to-add-bpf-observability.html">How To Add eBPF Observability To Your Product</a>.
Note that I think my flame graph software is different: Since it is a simple and finished algorithm that doesn't need much maintenance, I don't see a big problem with people rewriting it. (It is nice to get some thanks, however, just as I <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph/blob/a258e78f17abdf2ce21c2515cfe8306a44774e2a/flamegraph.pl#L58">have</a> <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html#Origin">done</a> for those that inspired flame graphs.)</p>

<!-- We are better off with all the wood behind one arrow. -->

<p>As for the unbelievable demo: This wasn't the great DTrace product I imagined when hearing about a world tour. It was, in fact, my own tools. I suspect that it's not uncommon for an open source developer to discover, at some point, that their own code has been rebranded. But the circumstance in this case may be a little unusual. A US developer got a world tour for software he didn't write, which included giving a sales pitch and demo in Australia, unwittingly, to the author. I don't think he even said thank you.</p>

<p>Dear Duxbury Community,</p>
<p>This week brings sad news for our Duxbury Systems family. Our colleague, David Holladay, passed away in a hospital on Thursday, February 15th, following an accident at home that morning. David was a cancer survivor and valiantly battled multiple medical problems over his last five years.</p>
<p>David was an early innovator in braille software. Together, he and his wife, Caryn Navy, founded Raised Dot Computing (later Braille Planet) in 1981. David’s early work on Apple II computers was groundbreaking in support of accessibility for blind users through speech and production of braille and of print from braille input. He went on to support production of print math from Nemeth Code mathematics braille. Later work at Raised Dot Computing culminated in the introduction of MegaDots, an innovative product with unparalleled support for braille formats.</p>
<p>David and Caryn joined Duxbury Systems in 1999 and have been part of the family ever since. David’s work at Duxbury focused largely on extending the reach of DBT to many, many countries and languages around the world. Though confined to bed over the last several years of his life, David’s passion for braille wouldn’t allow him to rest. He was working until his very last day.</p>
<p>It is our belief that the larger braille world will miss David as much as we do here at Duxbury.</p>
<hr>
<p>David’s funeral will be at Congregation Shalom in Chelmsford Massachusetts at noon Eastern Standard Time on Monday, with burial at 1 PM at Beth El Cemetery in Chelmsford.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am responding to the devastating announcement about my dearest husband David Holladay’s passing, to add the information on streaming his funeral service.</p>
<p>Streaming of the service, scheduled for noon Eastern Standard Time on Monday, Feb. 19, will be available during or after the service at: <a href="https://congregationshalom.org/worship-2/">congregationshalom.org/worship-2/</a>.</p>
<p>Press the Play button just after the level 3 heading “Live streaming of services is now available!” Note that if your screen reader does not recognize that as a button, you can use an alternative, such as a simulated left click.</p>
<p>With warmest regards for the community that meant so much to David,<br>
Caryn</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>T</span>here’s a 2013 Black Mirror episode in which a young widow played by Hayley Atwell signs up to an online service that scrapes a person’s entire digital footprint to create a virtual simulation. She soon starts chatting online with her late husband (Domhnall Gleeson), before things inevitably get Black Mirror-y.</p><p>Laurie Anderson, the American avant garde artist, musician and thinker, hasn’t seen the episode but, in the last few years, has lived a version of it: growing hopelessly hooked on an AI text generator that emulates the vocabulary and style of her own longtime partner and collaborator, Velvet Underground co-founder Lou Reed, who died in 2013.</p><p>“People are like, ‘Wow, you were so prescient; I didn’t even know what you were <em>talking</em> about back then’,” she says on a video call from New York.</p><p>A new Anderson exhibition, I’ll Be Your Mirror, has just opened in Adelaide, where Anderson will be doing an <a href="https://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/events/2024-writers-week/in-conversation-with-laurie-anderson/" data-link-name="in body link">In Conversation event</a> via live stream on Wednesday 6 March.

Anderson won’t be making the trip this time but will dial in for a few talks – the steady ping of emails arriving throughout our conversation hint at the 76-year-old’s relentless schedule.</p><p>I wonder if, after being given a lifetime achievement award at the Grammys in February, the prospect of these algorithms continuing to make “Laurie Anderson” art beyond her own lifetime has caused her to reflect on her legacy.</p><p>“Oh, why not? I mean, that doesn’t bother me. I don’t feel that attached to time anyway, you know?</p><p>“When people die and you hear their words or hear their music or read their things, it’s like they’re alive, you know? In many ways, there they <em>are</em>. You can say that about Dostoevsky, Plato, you know, <em>the Buddha</em>. People leave things around, and so I feel fine about that. I mean, we’re just mayflies, really.”</p><p>When the ghost in the machine has finished thinking, it serves up some fresh Lou Reed-ish lyrics inspired by my bus stop:</p><blockquote>
 <p><em>The street and the sky<br>When you die<br>I’ll be sitting in an idling bus<br>On my way to work<br>And no more<br>Than ten minutes before<br>The last train of the day<br>Pulls into the city, the light<br>Dim, insubstantial at first<br>Then less than a sliver of that<br>In half a second it’s all<br>You’ve got to live it, as they used to say<br>So much can go wrong<br>But why did you think this<br>Was a good idea<br>Don’t you get paid enough<br>To pay taxes? Why not play<br>Some tennis or take up quilting<br>Or improve the sanitation<br>Of this vast and sordidized<br>Island from which you sail<br>Is it such a wonder you’re alive<br>After all this sugar-fied waste<br>One cigarette, a glass of wine<br>Tell me, do you like it<br>How does it make you feel<br>Do you like the bitter taste</em></p>
</blockquote><p>I ask if Reed referenced “quilting” a lot in his writing, and Anderson laughs with her usual mix of playful and profound:</p><p>“Hah, I think that might be the first time.”</p><ul>
 <li><p><em>I’ll Be Your Mirror runs until 17 March as part of Adelaide festival. Laurie Anderson will be speaking via live stream at <a href="https://www.adelaidefestival.com.au/events/2024-writers-week/in-conversation-with-laurie-anderson/" data-link-name="in body link">an In Conversation event</a> on Wednesday 6 March, as part of Adelaide writers’ week</em></p></li>

<p>I saw the <a href="https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/">One Billion Row Challenge</a> a couple of weeks ago, and it thoroughly <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> me, so I went to <em>Go</em> solve it.</p>

<p>I’m late to the party, as the original competition was in January. It was also in Java. I’m not particularly interested in Java, but I’ve been interested in <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/goawk/#improving-performance">optimising</a> <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/goawk-compiler-vm/">Go</a> <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/go-version-performance/">code</a> <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/#go">for a while</a>.</p>

<p>This challenge was particularly simple: process a text file of weather station names and temperatures, and for each weather station, print out the minimum, mean, and maximum. There are a few <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc?tab=readme-ov-file#rules-and-limits">other constraints</a> to make it simpler, though I ignored the Java-specific ones.</p>

<p>Here are a few lines of example input:</p>

<div><pre><code>Hamburg;12.0
Bulawayo;8.9
Palembang;38.8
St. John's;15.2
Cracow;12.6
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>The only catch: the input file has one billion rows (lines). That’s about 13GB of data. I’ve already figured out that <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck/">disk I/O is no longer the bottleneck</a> – it’s usually memory allocations and parsing that slow things down in a program like this.</p>

<p><strong>This article describes the nine solutions I wrote in Go, each faster than the previous.</strong> The first, a simple and idiomatic solution, runs in 1 minute 45 seconds on my machine, while the last one runs in about 4 seconds. As I go, I’ll show how I used Go’s profiler to see where the time was being spent.</p>

<p>The run-down of solutions is as follows, slowest to fastest:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r1.go">r1: simple and idiomatic</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r2.go">r2: map with pointer values</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r3.go">r3: parse temperatures by hand</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r4.go">r4: fixed point integers</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r5.go">r5: avoid <code>bytes.Cut</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r6.go">r6: avoid <code>bufio.Scanner</code></a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r7.go">r7: custom hash table</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r8.go">r8: parallelise r1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r9.go">r9: parallelise r7</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I wanted each of the solutions to be portable Go using only the standard library: no assembly, no <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/unsafe"><code>unsafe</code></a>, and no memory-mapped files. And 4 seconds, or 3.2GB/s, was fast enough for me. For comparison, the fastest, heavily-optimised Java solution runs in just under a second on my machine – not bad!</p>

<p>There are several other Go solutions out there already, and at least one <a href="https://www.bytesizego.com/blog/one-billion-row-challenge-go">nice write-up</a>. Mine is faster than some solutions, but slightly slower than the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/tree/main/src/main/go/AlexanderYastrebov">fastest one</a>. However, I didn’t look at any of these before writing mine – I wanted my solutions to be independent.</p>

<p>If you just care about the numbers, <a href="#table-of-results">skip down to the table of results</a>.</p>

<h2 id="baseline">Baseline</h2>

<p>Here are a few different baseline measurements to set the stage. First, how long does it take to just read 13GB of data, using <code>cat</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ time cat measurements.txt &gt;/dev/null
0m1.052s
</code></pre></div>

<p>Note that that’s a best-of-five measurement, so I’m allowing the file to be cached. Who knows whether Linux will allow all 13GB to be kept in disk cache, though presumably it does, because the first time it took closer to 6 seconds.</p>

<p>For comparison, to actually do something with the file is significantly slower: <code>wc</code> takes almost a minute:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ time wc measurements.txt 
 1000000000  1179173106 13795293380 measurements.txt
0m55.710s
</code></pre></div>

<p>For a simple solution to the actual problem, I’d probably start with AWK. <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/1brc.awk">This solution</a> uses Gawk, because sorting the output is easier with its <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Array-Sorting-Functions.html"><code>asorti</code> function</a>. I’m using the <code>-b</code> option to use “characters as bytes” mode, which makes things a bit faster:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ time gawk -b -f 1brc.awk measurements.txt &gt;measurements.out
7m35.567s
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’m sure I can beat 7 minutes with even a simple Go solution, so let’s start there.</p>

<p>I’m going to start by optimising the sequential, single-core version (solutions 1-7), and then parallelise it (solutions 8 and 9). All my results are done using Go 1.21.5 on a linux/amd64 laptop with a fast SSD drive and 32GB of RAM.</p>

<p>Many of my solutions, and most of the fastest solutions, assume valid input. For example, that the temperatures have exactly one decimal digit. Several of my solutions will cause a runtime panic, or produce incorrect output, if the input isn’t valid.</p>

<h2 id="solution-1-simple-and-idiomatic-go">Solution 1: simple and idiomatic Go</h2>

<p>I wanted my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r1.go">first version</a> to be simple, straight-forward code using the tools in the Go standard library: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/bufio#Scanner"><code>bufio.Scanner</code></a> to read the lines, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/strings#Cut"><code>strings.Cut</code></a> to split on the <code>';'</code>, <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/strconv#ParseFloat"><code>strconv.ParseFloat</code></a> to parse the temperatures, and an ordinary Go <code>map</code> to accumulate the results.</p>

<p>I’ll include this first solution in full (but after that, show only the interesting bits):</p>

<h2 id="solution-2-map-with-pointer-values">Solution 2: map with pointer values</h2>

<p>I’d learned doing my <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/#go">count-words</a> program that we’re doing a bunch more hashing than we need to. For each line, we’re hashing the string twice: once when we try to fetch the value from the map, and once when we update the map.</p>

<p>To avoid that, we can use a <code>map[string]*stats</code> (pointer values) and update the pointed-to struct, instead of a <code>map[string]stats</code> and updating the hash table itself.</p>

<p>However, I first wanted to confirm that using the Go profiler. It only takes a <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/f72b34cb31854ed50e73ac7f89adff0f422f42e5/main.go#L59-L67">few lines</a> to add CPU profiling to a Go program.</p>

<div><pre><code>$ ./go-1brc -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -revision=1 measurements-10000000.txt &gt;measurements-10000000.out
Processed 131.6MB in 965.888929ms
$ go tool pprof -http=: cpu.prof
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>Those commands produced the following profile of solution 1, run over a cut-down 10 million row input file:</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r1.png" alt="Profile of solution r1"></p>

<p>Map operations are taking a full 30% of the time: 12.24% for assign and 17.35% for lookup. We should be able to get rid of most of the map assign time by using a pointer value.</p>

<p>As a side note, this profile image also shows us where all the rest of the time is going:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scanning lines with <code>Scanner.Scan</code></li>
  <li>Finding the <code>';'</code> with <code>strings.Cut</code></li>
  <li>Parsing the temperature with <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code></li>
  <li>Calling <code>Scanner.Text</code>, which allocates a string for the line</li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r2.go">second solution</a> is just a small tweak to the map operations:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>stationStats</span> <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>map</span><span>[</span><span>string</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>stats</span><span>)</span>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In the common case where the station exists in the map, we now only do one map operation, <code>s := stationStats[station]</code>, so that hashing the station name and accessing the hash table only has to be done once. If it’s in the map already – the common case in one billion rows – we update the existing pointed-to struct.</p>

<p>It doesn’t help a ton, but it is something: <strong>using pointer values in the map takes our time down from 1 minute 45 seconds to 1 minute 31 seconds.</strong></p>

<h2 id="solution-3-avoid-strconvparsefloat">Solution 3: avoid strconv.ParseFloat</h2>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r3.go">third solution</a> is where things get a bit more hard-core: parse the temperature using custom code instead of <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code>. The standard library function handles a ton of edge cases we don’t need to support for the simple temperatures our input has: 2 or 3 digits in the format <code>1.2</code> or <code>34.5</code> (and some with a minus sign in front).</p>

<p>Also, <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code> took a <code>string</code> argument, and now that we’re no longer calling that, we can get away with using the byte slice directly from <code>Scanner.Bytes</code>, instead of allocating and copying a string with <code>Scanner.Text</code>.</p>

<p>Now we parse the temperature this way:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>negative</span> <span>:=</span> <span>false</span>
<span>index</span> <span>:=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>if</span> <span>tempBytes</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>'-'</span> <span>{</span>

<p>Not pretty, but not exactly rocket science either. <strong>This gets our time down from to 1 minute 31 seconds to under a minute: 55.8 seconds.</strong></p>

<h2 id="solution-4-fixed-point-integers">Solution 4: fixed point integers</h2>

<p>Back in the olden days, floating point instructions were a <em>lot</em> slower than integer ones. These days, they’re only a little slower, but it’s probably worth avoiding them if we can.</p>

<p>For this problem, each temperature has a single decimal digit, so it’s easy to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic">fixed point</a> integers to represent them. For example, we can represent 34.5 as the integer 345. Then at the end, just before we print out the results, we convert them back to floats.</p>

<p>So my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r4.go">fourth solution</a> is basically the same as solution 3, but with the <code>stats</code> struct field as follows:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>stats</span> <span>struct</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>min</span><span>,</span> <span>max</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span> <span>int32</span>
    <span>sum</span>             <span>int64</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then, when printing out the results, we need to divide by 10:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>mean</span> <span>:=</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>sum</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>10</span>
<span>fmt</span><span>.</span><span>Fprintf</span><span>(</span><span>output</span><span>,</span> <span>"%s=%.1f/%.1f/%.1f"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>station</span><span>,</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>min</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>,</span> <span>mean</span><span>,</span> <span>float64</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>)</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I’ve used 32-bit integers for minimum and maximum temperatures, as the highest we’ll probably have is about 500 (50 degrees Celsius). We could use <code>int16</code>, but from previous experience, modern 64-bit CPUs are slightly slower when handling 16-bit integers than 32-bit ones. In my tests just now it didn’t seem to make a measurable difference, but I opted for 32-bit anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Using integers cut the time down from 55.8 seconds to 51.0 seconds, a small win.</strong></p>

<h2 id="solution-5-avoid-bytescut">Solution 5: avoid bytes.Cut</h2>

<p>To make <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r5.go">solution 5</a> I recorded another profile (of solution 4):</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r4.png" alt="Profile of solution r4"></p>

<p>Okay, now it’s getting harder. The map operations dominate, and moving to a custom hash table will be a bit tricky. So will getting rid of the <code>bufio.Scanner</code>. Let’s procrastinate and get rid of the <code>bytes.Cut</code>.</p>

<p>I thought of a simple way to save time. If we look at a line, for example:</p>



<p>It’s going to be faster to parse the temperature from the end and find the <code>';'</code> there than to scan through the whole station name to look for the <code>';'</code>. This rather ugly code does just that:</p>

<h2 id="solution-6-avoid-bufioscanner">Solution 6: avoid bufio.Scanner</h2>

<p>Now we’re going to try to get rid of the <code>bufio.Scanner</code>. If you think about it, to find the end of each line, the scanner has to look through all the bytes to find the newline character. Then we process many of the bytes again to parse the temperature and find the <code>';'</code>. So let’s try to combine those steps and throw <code>bufio.Scanner</code> out the window.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r6.go">solution 6</a> we allocate a 1MB buffer to read the file in large chunks, look for the last newline in the chunk to ensure we’re not chopping a line in half, and then process each chunk. That looks like this:</p>

<p><strong>Removing <code>bufio.Scanner</code> and doing our own scanning cut down the time from 46.0 seconds to 41.3 seconds.</strong> Yet another small win, but I’ll take it.</p>

<h2 id="solution-7-custom-hash-table">Solution 7: custom hash table</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r7.go">Solution 7</a> is where we get real. We’re going to implement a custom hash table instead of using Go’s <code>map</code>. This has two advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>We can hash the station name as we look for the <code>';'</code>, avoiding processing bytes twice.</li>
  <li>We can store each key in our hash table as a byte slice, avoiding the need to convert each key to a <code>string</code> (which will allocate and copy for every line).</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve written about <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/hash-table-in-c/">how to implement a hash table in C</a>, but I’ve also implemented a custom <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/counter/blob/master/counter.go">“counter” hash table in Go</a>, which is where I pulled this implementation from.</p>

<p>It’s a simple implementation that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fowler%E2%80%93Noll%E2%80%93Vo_hash_function#FNV-1a_hash">FNV-1a</a> hash algorithm with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing">linear probing</a>: if there’s a collision, use the next empty slot.</p>

<p>To simplify, I just pre-allocate a large number of hash buckets (I’ve used 100,000), to avoid having to write logic to resize the table. My code will panic if the table gets more than half full. I measured that we get around 2% hash collisions.</p>

<p>It’s a bunch more code this time – hash table setup, the hashing itself, and the table probing and insertion:</p>

<h2 id="solution-8-process-chunks-in-parallel">Solution 8: process chunks in parallel</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r8.go">solution 8</a> I wanted to add some parallelism. However, I thought I’d go back to the simple and idiomatic code from my first solution, which uses <code>bufio.Scanner</code> and <code>strconv.ParseFloat</code>, and parallelise that. Then we can see whether optimising or parallelising gives better results – and in solution 9 we’ll do both.</p>

<p>It’s straight-forward to parallelise a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">map-reduce</a> problem like this: split the file into similar-sized chunks (one for each CPU core), fire up a thread (in Go, a goroutine) to process each chunk, and then merge the results at the end.</p>

<p>Here’s what that looks like at a high level:</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/fafba3256ea28631f6b3739f6d3b711a91199861/r8.go#L124"><code>splitFile</code></a> function is a bit tedious, so I won’t include it here. It looks at the size of the file, divides that by the number of parts we want, and then seeks to each part, reading 100 bytes before the end and looking for the last newline to ensure each part ends with a full line.</p>

<p>The <code>r8ProcessPart</code> function is basically the same as the r1 solution, but it starts by seeking to the part offset and limiting the length to the part size (using <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/io#LimitedReader"><code>io.LimitedReader</code></a>). When it’s done, it sends its own stats map back on the channel:</p>

<p><strong>Processing the input file in parallel provides a huge win over r1, taking the time from 1 minute 45 seconds to 24.3 seconds.</strong> For comparison, the previous “optimised non-parallel” version, solution 7, took 25.8 seconds. So for this case, parallelisation is a bit faster than optimisation – and quite a bit simpler.</p>

<h2 id="solution-9-all-optimisations-plus-parallelisation">Solution 9: all optimisations plus parallelisation</h2>

<p>For <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/go-1brc/blob/master/r8.go">solution 9</a>, our last attempt, we’ll simply combine all the previous optimisations from r1 through r7 with the parallelisation we did in r8.</p>

<p>I’ve used the same <code>splitFile</code> function from r8, and the rest of the code is just copied from r7, so there’s nothing new to show here. Except the results … <strong>this final version cut down the time from 24.3 seconds to 3.99 seconds, a huge win.</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, because all the real processing is now in one big function, <code>r9ProcessPart</code>, the profile graph is no longer particularly helpful. Here’s what it looks like now:</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r9.png" alt="Profile of solution r9"></p>

<p>As you can see, 82% of the time is being spent in <code>r9ProcessPart</code>, with <code>bytes.Equal</code> taking 13%, and the file reading taking the remaining 5%.</p>

<p>If we want to profile further, we have to dive deeper than the function level that the graph view gives us, and use the source view. Here’s the inner loop:</p>

<p><img src="https://benhoyt.com/images/go-1brc-profile-r9-source.png" alt="Profile of solution r9 - source view"></p>

<p>I find this report confusing. Why does <code>if items[hashIndex].key == nil</code> show as taking 5.01s, but the call to <code>bytes.Equal</code> shows as only 390ms. Surely a slice lookup is much cheaper than a function call? If you are a Go performance expert and can help me interpret it, I’m all ears!</p>

<p>In any case, I’m sure there are crazier optimisations I could do, but I decided I’d leave it there. Processing a billion rows in 4 seconds, or 250 million rows per second, was good enough for me.</p>

<p>Below is a table of all my Go solutions in one place, in addition to the fastest Go and fastest Java solutions. Each result is the best-of-five time for running the solution against the same billion-row input.</p>

<p>I’m in the same ballpark as <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/src/main/go/AlexanderYastrebov/calc.go">Alexander Yastrebov’s Go version</a>. His solution looks similar to mine: break the file into chunks, use a custom hash table (he even uses FNV hashing), and parse temperatures as integers. However, he uses memory-mapped files, which I’d ruled out for portability reasons – I’m guessing that’s why his is a bit faster.</p>

<p>Thomas Wuerthinger (with <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/c92346790e8548f52e81254227efc935356e5e53/src/main/java/dev/morling/onebrc/CalculateAverage_thomaswue.java#L32-L37">credit to others</a>) created the <a href="https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc/blob/main/src/main/java/dev/morling/onebrc/CalculateAverage_thomaswue.java">fastest overall solution</a> to the original challenge in Java. His runs in under a second on my machine, 4x as fast as my Go version. In addition to parallel processing and memory-mapped files, it looks like he’s using unrolled loops, non-branching parsing code, and other low-level tricks.</p>

<p>It looks like Thomas is the founder of and a <a href="https://github.com/oracle/graal/commits?author=thomaswue">significant contributor</a> to <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>, a faster Java Virtual Machine with ahead-of-time compilation. So he’s definitely an expert in his field. Nice work Thomas and co!</p>



<p>Does any of this matter?</p>

<p>For the majority of day-to-day programming tasks, simple and idiomatic code is usually the best place to start. If you’re calculating statistics over a billion temperatures, and you just need the answer once, 1 minute 45 seconds is probably fine.</p>

<p>But if you’re building a data processing pipeline, if you can make your code 4 times as fast, or even 26 times as fast, you’ll not only make users happier, you’ll save a lot on compute costs – if the system is being well loaded, your compute costs could be 1/4 or 1/26 of the original!</p>

<p>Or, if you’re building a runtime like GraalVM, or an interpreter like my <a href="https://github.com/benhoyt/goawk">GoAWK</a>, this level of performance really does matter: if you speed up the interpreter, all your users’ programs run that much faster too.</p>

<p>Plus, it’s just fun writing code that gets the most out of your machine.</p>

<p>I’d love it if you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/benhoyt/">sponsored me on GitHub</a> – it will motivate me to work on my open source projects and write more good content. Thanks!</p>

<p>Nine days after a Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate took down the biggest US health care payment processor, pharmacies, health care providers, and patients were still scrambling to fill prescriptions for medicines, many of which are lifesaving.</p>
<p>On Thursday, UnitedHealth Group accused a notorious ransomware gang known both as AlphV and Black Cat of hacking its subsidiary Optum. Optum provides a nationwide network called Change Healthcare, which allows health care providers to manage customer payments and insurance claims. With no easy way for pharmacies to calculate what costs were covered by insurance companies, many had to turn to alternative services or offline methods.</p>
<h2>The most serious incident of its kind</h2>
<p>Optum first disclosed on February 21 that its services were down as a result of a “cyber security issue.” Its service has been hamstrung ever since. Shortly before this post went live on Ars, Optum said it had restored Change Healthcare services.</p>
<p>“Working with technology and business partners, we have successfully completed testing with vendors and multiple retail pharmacy partners for the impacted transaction types,” an <a href="https://status.changehealthcare.com/incidents/hqpjz25fn3n7">update</a> said. “As a result, we have enabled this service for all customers effective 1 pm CT, Friday, March 1, 2024.”</p>
<p>AlphV is one of many syndicates that operates under a ransomware-as-a-service model, meaning affiliates do the actual hacking of victims and then use the AlphV ransomware and infrastructure to encrypt files and negotiate a ransom. The parties then share the proceeds.</p>
<p>In December, the FBI and its equivalent in partner countries announced they had seized much of the AlphV infrastructure in a move that was intended to disrupt the group. AlphV promptly asserted it had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/alphv-ransomware-site-is-seized-by-the-fbi-then-its-unseized-and-so-on/">unseized its site</a>, leading to a tug-of-war between law enforcement and the group. The crippling of Change Healthcare is a clear sign that AlphV continues to pose a threat to critical parts of the US infrastructure.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“The cyberattack against Change Healthcare that began on Feb. 21 is the most serious incident of its kind leveled against a US health care organization,” <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/perspective/2024-02-29-supporting-hospitals-and-patients-after-cyberattack-change-healthcare">said</a> Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association. Citing Change Healthcare data, Pollack said that the service processes 15 billion transactions involving eligibility verifications, pharmacy operations, and claims transmittals and payments. “All of these have been disrupted to varying degrees over the past several days and the full impact is still not known.”</p>
<p>Optum estimated that as of Monday, more than 90 percent of roughly 70,000 pharmacies in the US had changed how they processed electronic claims as a result of the outage. The company went on to say that only a small number of patients have been unable to get their prescriptions filled.</p>
<p>The scale and length of the Change Healthcare outage underscore the devastating effects ransomware has on critical infrastructure. Three years ago, members affiliated with a different ransomware group known as Darkside caused a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/colonial-pipeline-resumes-operations-after-ransomware-prompted-closure/">five-day outage of Colonial Pipeline</a>, which delivered roughly 45 percent of the East Coast's petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, and jet fuel. The interruption caused fuel shortages that sent airlines, consumers, and filling stations scrambling.
</p><p>Numerous ransomware groups have also taken down entire hospital networks in outages that in some cases have threatened patient care.</p>
<p>AlphV has been a key contributor to the ransomware menace. The FBI said in December the group had collected more than $300 million in ransoms. One of the better-known victims of AlphV ransomware was Caesars Entertainment and casinos owned by MGM, which brought operations in many Las Vegas casinos to a halt. A group of mostly teenagers is suspected of orchestrating that breach.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>"Algorithmic Thinking</em>&nbsp;provides the theoretical background and detailed problem explanations required to stay ahead of our human and robotic competitors."<br>
<strong>—Duncan Smith, Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>"Now a fully updated and expanded second edition, Daniel Zingaro's <em>Algorithmic Thinking: Unlock Your Programming Potential</em> from No Starch Press is an ideal, comprehensive, and thoroughly 'user friendly' instructional resource for C Programming Language students and software development professionals alike."<br>
<strong>—Midwest Book Review</strong></p>
<p>"In this newly revised edition, Daniel presents a carefully curated collection of challenging programming problems. By deconstructing the problems alongside clear, practical presentations of algorithms and data structures, <em>Algorithmic Thinking</em> will empower you–whether you're looking to get a leg up on technical interviews, enter the world of competitive programming, or just want to sharpen your skills."<br>
<strong>—Josh Lospinoso, Ph.D., author of <em>C++ Crash Course</em></strong></p>
<p>"As someone who learnt algorithms from similar problems-oriented books in the early 00s, I believe an updated yet beginner-friendly exposition is long overdue. This book provides implementation-friendly introductions to most building blocks of combinatorial algorithms . . . It's by far the quickest way to get hands-on experience with algorithms, and is also a great supplement to more theoretical expositions."<br>
<strong>—Richard Peng, Associate Professor at the University of Waterloo’s Cheriton School of Computer Science</strong></p>
<p>"Not only does <em>Algorithmic Thinking</em> guide readers on how to approach tackling problems, but Zingaro also helps them understand why these approaches work. With an engaging selection of problems drawn from programming competitions, the book is an excellent guide and an engaging companion for the readers on their learning journey."<br>
—<strong>Sushant Sachdeva, Ph.D., Algorithms Professor at the University of Toronto</strong></p>
<p>"The step-by-step solution explanations are so detailed that it feels like Daniel is directly teaching us, his readers. This Second Edition is a worthy update to an already excellent text. I particularly like the new chapter on the rarely discussed randomized algorithms. I believe Computer Science students will enjoy reading it as I do."<br>
<strong>—Dr Steven Halim, Senior Lecturer at National University of Singapore</strong></p>
<p>"The book discusses many interesting problems from programming contests and presents useful techniques that are not often included in algorithm textbooks."<br>
<strong>—Antti Laaksonen, University of Helsinki</strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>Reviews for the 1st edition:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"A good choice for anyone who needs to understand and implement algorithms."</span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span><strong>—</strong></span></span></span><a href="https://www.redgreencode.com/book-review-algorithmic-thinking-a-problem-based-introduction/"><span><span><span><strong>RedGreenCode</strong></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>“With Zingaro as a tutor by your side, you'll learn, through practice on challenging competition problems, a repeatable process for figuring out and deftly applying the most appropriate algorithmic tools for the job. You'll learn it all from a book that exudes clarity, humor, and just the right dose of Canadian pride. Happy problem-solving!”</span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span>—</span></span></span><span><span><span><strong>Dr. Tim Roughgarden, Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>"A clear and engaging text . . . By presenting problems first and their algorithm/data structure solutions later, it shows us exactly why those solutions are useful and how they fit into the big picture. . . . Far too many textbooks present solutions fully-formed with no mention of the dead ends and too-complicated solutions you’d hit along the way. But </span></span></span><span><span><span><em>Algorithmic Thinking</em></span></span></span><span><span><span> takes you from the initial idea to the final breakthrough, setbacks and all. Problem solving is a raw, real journey, and this book captures its spirit perfectly. I highly recommend it."</span></span></span><br>

A few months ago I introduced you to one of the more notable Apple pre-production units in my collection, <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">a late prototype Macintosh Portable</a>. But it turns out it's not merely notable for what it is than what it has on it: a beta version of System 6.0.6 (the doomed release that Apple pulled due to bugs), Apple sales databases, two online services — the maligned Mac <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigy_%28online_service%29">Prodigy</a> client, along with classic AppleLink as used by Apple staff — and two presentations, one on Apple's current Macintosh line and one on the upcoming System 7. Now that I've got the infamous Conner hard drive it came with safely copied over, it's time to explore its contents some more.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitMPsOX_6ygMIT0rwXlp1obnIOpqMOCMdtZAZTjgCvcuHBswcXbPce1vizDNTiTrrvIRmMqNQMCt1SJqqFfW10n_enq3TsDx3qF8mqQOofy0yTiNoSPFVijVIrJ_k7MECodWdZJ9hZ2PPm_zslc673g1GfstZGT9oPTukBpICzBSRR8swOIos4LUUftJA/s511/037.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="342" data-original-width="511" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEitMPsOX_6ygMIT0rwXlp1obnIOpqMOCMdtZAZTjgCvcuHBswcXbPce1vizDNTiTrrvIRmMqNQMCt1SJqqFfW10n_enq3TsDx3qF8mqQOofy0yTiNoSPFVijVIrJ_k7MECodWdZJ9hZ2PPm_zslc673g1GfstZGT9oPTukBpICzBSRR8swOIos4LUUftJA/s320/037.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

We'll start with this Macintosh Portable itself and Apple's sales channel applications, moving from there to a brief presentation of Apple's Macintosh product line as Apple's own marketing staff would have presented it, at a distinct point in the company's history.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvO5adw1GLQJCBfY9ETmCMPfCd4MXxdBg2Cb4jiLnza6eenBAop77BBhf88DA2QWliBZrdRNeZpG9KXJ4JVlQHtG_FktlDGLhsFg9HohHKneE2j4hNri9SNI-Sl-moPvMp36WC8tpJlLQMdq5nIoV5WrdEd4W5XClpEtsHmUau4iWeomJ5Z-0YqH2-z90/s640/004.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvO5adw1GLQJCBfY9ETmCMPfCd4MXxdBg2Cb4jiLnza6eenBAop77BBhf88DA2QWliBZrdRNeZpG9KXJ4JVlQHtG_FktlDGLhsFg9HohHKneE2j4hNri9SNI-Sl-moPvMp36WC8tpJlLQMdq5nIoV5WrdEd4W5XClpEtsHmUau4iWeomJ5Z-0YqH2-z90/s320/004.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

After that, we'll also look at the upcoming System 7.0 circa 1989-90 and a couple very different views of the operating system during its alpha phase.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiowOJEg3OK4yKq6_4v-in13CjB1IDOuFrGHNljiep9Q6oSSOLL53etXwrgKFD1VmZsSuIQGWY_5wKIlCLqQPAY_e1u18QFNc2gPO59amZWVdzrk1YC8VCRLa887voJVJoI7SaO10IA8u-cI_bZ8iR6CmEvFebPoBTVzJ5wLHeSosOTPuD-1AbkWEQG0yc/s512/Picture%204.PNG"><img alt="" data-original-height="384" data-original-width="512" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiowOJEg3OK4yKq6_4v-in13CjB1IDOuFrGHNljiep9Q6oSSOLL53etXwrgKFD1VmZsSuIQGWY_5wKIlCLqQPAY_e1u18QFNc2gPO59amZWVdzrk1YC8VCRLa887voJVJoI7SaO10IA8u-cI_bZ8iR6CmEvFebPoBTVzJ5wLHeSosOTPuD-1AbkWEQG0yc/s320/Picture%204.PNG" width="320"></a></p><p>

Finally, after a brief glance at Mac Prodigy, we'll explore a little taste of AppleLink in its classic incarnation on General Electric's Mark III network — and spoof it enough to actually get it to log in.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQq7-PbrQwFzBgV18TgkWXUf6ZqKHorTWVo33hI00XAZcAGyyq61U596d42N-JCfXdw5JhltvJoK6fZvjl4DqZlfhP_SAqqtRyJCS5l6pYHATJZfQ1YpEg8yEafm0HEzS8hevnJZtJaBdZ9qdy49qgSnSjdIuoW-oRPnOebTuxucdgdtRRSBJLLPSgp5o/s511/039.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="342" data-original-width="511" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQq7-PbrQwFzBgV18TgkWXUf6ZqKHorTWVo33hI00XAZcAGyyq61U596d42N-JCfXdw5JhltvJoK6fZvjl4DqZlfhP_SAqqtRyJCS5l6pYHATJZfQ1YpEg8yEafm0HEzS8hevnJZtJaBdZ9qdy49qgSnSjdIuoW-oRPnOebTuxucdgdtRRSBJLLPSgp5o/s320/039.png" width="320"></a></p>

This unit lacks U.S. Federal Communications Commission clearance, complete with a warning applique that says "ATTENTION! This unit is a demonstration unit only. It is not for sale or resale. Production units will comply with all applicable Federal Rules and Regulations." That last sentence would imply it isn't a production unit, meaning it's not at PVT stage, but it is clearly more developed than an EVT prototype would be. Since FCC certification usually occurs after hardware development is complete but before mass production begins, this makes it most likely a DVT unit. The only thing that doesn't work properly on this machine is the audio, which even after capacitor replacement remained unusually quiet, though I don't recall that it ever worked during its time in my possession.
</p><p>
I know of a couple other Macintosh Portable prototypes out there in collector's hands, though if you've got a Mac Portable yourself of any age, they all hail from that unpleasant turn-of-the-decade era where virtually all period Apple hardware will require new capacitors (everything in this one has been completely replaced). The Portable was not officially released until September 1989 simultaneously with the Macintosh IIci, where the base 1MB/floppy configuration started at $5799, or $6499 with one of those loathsome Conner hard disks (approximately $14,400 and $16,150 respectively in 2024 dollars). That puts this serial-less unit's manufacture likely somewhere around spring '89.
</p><p>
In architectural terms Apple described the Portable as an evolved Macintosh SE. Though high performance and with some innovative features, the Portable's biggest drawbacks — literally — were its size and its heavy lead-acid battery, and it sold barely a fifth of what it was expected to. Apple cancelled it in October 1991.

Naturally, being a pre-production prototype it's also not a backlit model — that of course came later — but the 640x400 screen remains excellent, an early example of an active matrix LCD that Apple boasted had an individual transistor for every pixel and one of the best displays on any portable machine from the period. (Sometime in the near future I'll dig out my Data General One, a fine example of the <em>opposite</em> extreme.) It has an Androda 7MB expansion card <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/06/new-ram-card-prototype-mac-portable.html">to give it 8MB of RAM</a>, just shy of the 9MB maximum it was capable of addressing, though no card sold for the Portable back in the day could achieve this and even the 9MB RAM cap is problematic. This is possibly due to the lowest motherboard 1MB being shared between ROM and RAM (ROM overlays it at reset to allow the machine to start even with RAM in a non-deterministic state), as well as at least one ROM bug that makes heavily expanded units sluggish when exiting sleep. On the Portable, which is all about being able to sleep on demand, the phenomenon becomes most obnoxious with "large" amounts of RAM like this.

We'll switch at this point to screengrabs instead of photos. Neither are ideal for our purposes, but although the Portable does have an external video-out port, that port don't hunt. Despite being a DE-15 VGA-style connector instead of the expected classic Mac DA-15, you'll actually damage it plugging in a VGA display; the lines it exposes are more or less the same as the LCD drive lines and require conversion. No presentation module came with this unit and despite Apple's promises and various rumours, there is no clear evidence any such adapter was ever produced for sale by anyone. We can't get every snapshot since the old Shift-Command-3 salute only runs when apps yield to the system, but it's better than trying to hover over the screen with my Pixel 7 Pro. (System 6 takes screenshots in MacPaint 576x720 format, which I have obviously reformatted and rotated.)

The specific version of classic Mac OS this machine is running is also unusual: it's a beta 12 release of System 6.0.6 (with a beta 6.1.6 Finder), which came out simultaneously with 6.0.5 in March 1990 for early Macintosh Classic, IIsi and LC machines, but was pulled from release and replaced with 6.0.7 in September. The problems were discovered so late in production that it even forced Apple to yank and reissue the system disk packs shipped with the computers, slapping "6.0.7" stickers on the label.

6.0.6 had two major problems, one where AppleTalk was sometimes not detected when present due to a bug in <tt>Gestalt</tt>, causing connectivity issues with servers and printers, and another with timing problems between the LC and IIsi and the ADB Apple Keyboard II, where the keyboard would intermittently freeze up until the mouse was moved. However, neither of those problems have manifested on this Portable so far, and 6.0.6 additionally fixed issues with the Portable's modem and reading 800K floppy disks, so you really should run at least 6.0.7 or 6.0.8 (it originally shipped with 6.0.4, also the same as the IIci).

The machine was clearly used for both business and pleasure, at least through 1991 which was the latest file I could cursorily find. A fair bit is personal and not generally interesting (and as such I've redacted or put off-screen a few things in these grabs), but it's proof it clearly got substantial use, and why not? Slung on a desk, it was a perfectly cromulent Macintosh with a 16MHz 68000, double that of the Plus, with a big sharp screen, a high quality keyboard and a nice trackball. You definitely wouldn't be using it on your lap, but you could certainly lug it to and from work.

That said, I'm not exactly certain where "work" in fact was located. Interestingly, one application on the hard disk suggests <em>Cleveland, Ohio</em>, of all places,

... but this might just be who held the site license, and when we get to AppleLink there's good evidence that the unit spent most of its time in Silicon Valley. I know the prior user was an Apple district manager from other credentials on the disk and a little bit of Googling. For obvious reasons I won't show those.

A related point is its network configuration: the Macintosh network volume mounted in these shots is my little NetBSD Macintosh IIci (for moving the grabs off), but it doesn't seem like it was ever connected to a network before because the username was originally blank in the Chooser. After all, it would be odd that other personal stuff and credentials weren't removed while the AppleTalk username specifically had been, so more likely it was never populated in the first place.

Other relics persist on the hard disk. For example, the HyperCard stacks introducing users to the Macintosh Portable are also still here, though they seem to be slightly earlier versions than what got shipped with production models and have different wording, and the Tour of the Macintosh Portable app isn't present. This unit may have predated it.

I picked two grabs out of it for example's sake, including the active matrix display (again, as you saw, it's really good especially for 1989) and its CMOS 68HC000 CPU, which was designed by Hitachi and introduced jointly with Motorola in 1985. Besides reducing power consumption from 1.35W down to about 300mW, it ran at 16MHz in the Portable compared to its usual Mac speed of around 8MHz (and the part could run as high as 20MHz). Despite the Portable's substantial development delays it was nevertheless one of the earliest computers to use it, along with the original PowerBook 100 which in nearly every respect is a miniaturized Portable.

There were a lot of products advertised. Spoiler alert: the Portable's underwhelming market performance mostly sealed their fates.

For example, this (and a similar image in the <i>Inside</i> stack) are the only pictures I could find of the video adapter. I don't know if this is a mockup or a prototype. There are a couple switches along with a Mac DA-15 monitor jack and an RCA jack, presumably for composite output. This device doesn't seem related at all to the separate and duly sold Apple Presentation System which was made by Focus and rebadged by Apple.

One other gotcha with the Portable, besides the weight, the huge lead acid battery wired in series and (nowadays) the capacitor issue, was its prodigious need for sleep. If you check the box to <i>Stay awake when plugged in</i> ...

That said, it's the work stuff that we're here for. This machine unsurprisingly has a full complement of office applications, including Aldus PageMaker and Aldus Persuasion (pre-Adobe), MacWrite II, MacDraw, HyperCard, and early versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Works.

But what also caught my eye going through the applications folder was a suite named POS•IM. The name alone implies this is a point-of-sale system, divided into applications for accounts receivable, inventory and sales. I won't show any real customer records here and I don't know how widely deployed this was within the Apple sales channel at that time, but it probably wouldn't have been installed at all if there weren't some expectation it would be used.

The apps were produced by a Utah company called AnaMatrix. I can't find much information on this company and the suite appears to have been its only product. In <i>MacUser</i> February 1990, it listed for $2500 single-user and $4000 multiuser (in 2024 about $5800 and $9300 respectively), though it was called "POS/IM" with a slash instead of the interpunct. This installation is the single-user standalone release, starting here with the accounts receivable application.

We'll use this record "Bill Jones" since it's almost certainly an example (for one thing, that street address doesn't exist in the real Riverton, UT, and the zip code 87444 isn't currently valid). Each record tied back to an invoice.

The inventory application tracked nearly every single SKU Apple manufactured or sold at that time, even T-shirts and pens, though I think at least one of these is phony.

This is what I suspect is the phony entry, for an XL Apple T-shirt in blue, made by "Ned the Knitter" and sold for $17.95. The reason I suspect this is a demo row is because this exact item appears in AnaMatrix's few promotional screenshots of the time, like this one in that same issue of <i>MacUser</i>:

Or get out your wallet and spring for the big one. The most expensive unit I could find in the Apple price list was this Macintosh II with a 40MB hard disk for $5498 (M7003/A); in 2024 that would be nearly $15,000. This also suggests the price list here wasn't particularly current since it didn't include the IIx (September 1998), but it does have the SE (March 1987, with the II), dating it likely to the same year.

The actual invoices themselves were in the third application, Sales•Point. Parenthetically, a separate menu option for "Transfer" allowed you to jump between the three apps in the suite if you didn't have enough memory to run them simultaneously in MultiFinder, or didn't use MultiFinder at all (which would give you all the machine's available RAM minus the operating system, as these about boxes show).

Here's that invoice "Bill Jones" bought: an ImageWriter II (A9M0320, $595) and a Macintosh SE with an Extended Keyboard (M5085/A, $2998); the other SE SKU would be for the smaller Apple Keyboard.

You could also run a sales report, but only two came up, "Bill Jones"' big cash splash included (I'm not sure if there were archives maintained off-machine).

That covers billing, inventory and sales, so how about advertising? For this next part we're going to spend some time with its copy of Aldus Persuasion 1.0. Interestingly, PowerPoint beat Persuasion to the Macintosh by about a year (1987 vs 1988), but Persuasion was for a time considered the superior product due to its interface, graphing capabilities and popular outline mode.

Two Aldus Persuasion 1.0 presentations stand out in particular (this is the copy which I've mounted on my Mystic Colour Classic for reasons I'll relate in a moment), both of which were official Apple marketing material at the time. The first is Apple's then-current product line, and the second is an early glimpse at the upcoming System 7. Neither file was apparently Apple-internal or confidential and both seem to have been regularly presented to potential customers and users.

The Macintosh Product Overview slides have a collective creation and modification date of October 8, 1989, consistent with the 1989 copyright the presentation displays. However, its actual origination can be no <em>later</em> than March 1989 due to the models that it completely lacks.

No unreleased or upcoming computers are demonstrated or referenced in this presentation, dividing the existing models simply into two small "Compact" and "Modular" families. This appears to have been the manifestation of Macintosh manager Jean-Louis Gassée's "high-right" goal which tried to sell high-margin, high-performance machines at the expense of the "low-left" budget market. Unfortunately for Apple, the strategy permitted cheaper XT-class PCs to proliferate in Apple's relative absence while failing to compete effectively with Unix workstations at the top. In December 1989 Apple's stock tanked 20 percent after a dismal holiday sales season and Gassée departed a month later, but this presentation doesn't reflect the subsequent product shakeup that birthed the deliberately low-end Mac Classic and LC.

The long-running Macintosh Plus was still in Apple's sales list but got one measly slide, strongly suggesting it was on its way out. The 2MB and 4MB versions were also completely absent from the presentation so as not to compete with the SE. Instead, the presenter talked up the SE and especially the SE/30, putting them head to head and otherwise ignoring the Plus completely. "Memory Management" refers to the Motorola 68851 MMU, available as an option for the 68020 (but not the 68000), which was built-in to the SE/30's 68030 and also slightly faster. The SE/30 came out in January 1989, so the presentation can't be any older than that.

The Modular family, however, only lists two members: the II and the IIx. This is where the maximum <em>late</em> date of March 1989 comes in, being when the IIcx was first introduced, the first three-slot II and the next one in the series. Since it doesn't appear here, the presentation can't be any (or at least much) later than the IIcx's formal introduction.

Still, the SE/30 and the IIx were indisputably the stars of this show, and the most obvious members of the "high-right" family at that time (early 1989). Other than the slots and form factor, the two systems were very similar, with the same CPU (with FPU and MMU), same clock speed and same RAM ceiling.

The Macintosh Product Overview slideshow was entirely 1-bit black and white, so I rendered it out to PICTs from the Portable itself for the most authentic result. However, the System 7 presentation has colour elements and the Portable doesn't support Color QuickDraw. For this section we'll go back to the Color Classic to render this slide deck, which I've tweaked slightly due to minor differences in font rendering. (I'm not sure how this particular presentation would have even displayed properly on the Portable.)

This presentation has a modification and creation date of February 3, 1991. Recall that around March 1988 Apple technical staff made the first cut of what was planned for System 7 as Blue, with the remainder becoming Pink (and later Taligent) and Red. This particular presentation is oriented around Blue's modest goals ("System 6, corrected," as Wikipedia puts it) and doesn't even mention Pink. However, the presentation shows a few more primitive or speculative features than what emerged with System 7.0 in May 1991, one technology in particular (we'll discuss) can't have appeared under that name any later than May 1990, and several 1990 models don't appear in the support matrix, putting an upper bound of around March 1990 on when the deck could have been made or updated. The presentation itself carries a 1989 copyright on the final slide.

Assuming this wasn't just a mockup screenshot, the Finder and general user interface had a number of noticeable differences from the released version of 7.0. The menu bar has slightly different options in slightly different order; this earlier version used Color instead of Label, and the Special menu came before it. System 7's help icon was also part of the "menu mass" like Mac OS 8, just with a help diamond, instead of being an icon off to the side as with Balloon Help.
</p><p>
Individual Finder windows also appeared differently: the window title bar is fatter and the detail row is slightly skewed down, not vertically centred. There are also different icons, including a schematic of the desktop for the Finder instead of the stylised compact Mac icon used in System 6 and (with revisions) 7.0, and the Startup Items folder is just called the Startup Folder with what looks like a placeholder graphic. As with the final release, the System file remains a suitcase.

System 7 was additionally the début of TrueType, Apple's outline font technology and still the dominant font format on most PCs and Macs (especially given that OpenType is more or less a superset), but the actual <em>name</em> TrueType appears nowhere in this presentation, nor do its known codenames Royal and Bass. That doesn't mean Apple wasn't proud of it. Indeed, it was such a big advance over font handling in System 6 that TrueType was subsequently backported to it, and Apple granted a license to Microsoft for free to ensure TrueType's success. Ironically this was one of the slides I had to tweak on the Color Classic because the font size of the blurb on the right came out too large.

System 7 also made MultiFinder mandatory. This screenshot cannot be contemporary with the Finder screenshot above because the small icon for the Finder is still System 6's; that makes this screenshot almost certainly older, which also explains why the MultiFinder application list is still in the Apple menu. On the other hand, no desk accessories are shown in the Apple menu either like one would expect with System 6 MultiFinder, so this is probably truly an early System 7 build assuming it's also not a mockup shot.

Newly introduced was a varied class of technologies related to message passing between applications, which is foundational for higher-level features like scripting and embedding. Apple subsumed these various features under the umbrella of the Inter-Application Communications Architecture, or the IAC. These messages could be passed between applications on the local machine or over a network, using AppleTalk as the transport. Today we call those messages Apple events, and the fundamental technology remains part of modern macOS today.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx2UOfgiNue2s7TbZe180cz5M_awtBW_3otVuOxKMfStxPkI3lmQ9r1kWu1sA4vdiL-_ohkdRaQ8FKd8oKY42FsW0CphY-hI2oaynhyphenhyphenwI1AfpWVLzpqNAV5ewETsAcleE_v5O678yvlBtkfSlk26ijHpuiOD470MB0aS98-NgUmG0jy2EoyEf5gK4_scc/s640/014.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx2UOfgiNue2s7TbZe180cz5M_awtBW_3otVuOxKMfStxPkI3lmQ9r1kWu1sA4vdiL-_ohkdRaQ8FKd8oKY42FsW0CphY-hI2oaynhyphenhyphenwI1AfpWVLzpqNAV5ewETsAcleE_v5O678yvlBtkfSlk26ijHpuiOD470MB0aS98-NgUmG0jy2EoyEf5gK4_scc/s320/014.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

However, one of the IAC features that <em>didn't</em> succeed was the Editions Manager, later redacted to the Edition Manager and surfaced to the user as "Publish and Subscribe." In this scheme an application could "publish" part or all of a file that another application could "subscribe" to (more precisely, a document could have sections in it called "publishers" connected to "subscriber" sections in other documents). If this sounds like Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), it's deliberate, as Publish and Subscribe was supposed to be the OLE killer with non-rectangular regions and update notifications that could even go over a network — because the notifications were just Apple events. This has nothing to do <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">with OpenDoc</a>, by the way, which was Apple's second failed attempt at an OLE-like technology and uses a completely different internal architecture.
</p><p>
The Edition Manager ended up being complicated for developers and obnoxious for users. Since publication occurred at the section level, compliant applications had to define what sections existed in a document, and for those sections that were published write their contents (termed <i>editions</i>) to an escrow-like repository called an <i>edition container</i>. On the user end, this felt like doing a special "cut and paste" from a source into a client document to create a new section and link it. When the Edition Manager saw updates happen, it would fire off Apple events to signal subscribers to read that data from the edition container into their own sections; conversely, when the Edition Manager saw a subscriber try to read or scroll a section, it would fire off other Apple events to <em>publishers</em> to remind them to update.
</p><p>
None of this work was automatically done by the individual applications, though, so it wasn't unusual for publishers to fail to update their editions or subscribers to fail to retrieve them, or sometimes for the link to just break completely. I personally remember screaming at CricketGraph in 1996 trying to get charts in my undergraduate cognitive science paper within Microsoft Word to actually show anything, but to this day I still have no idea whose fault that was (except that it wasn't mine, dammit). Since the feature was rickety even in those applications that tried to support it and the level of developer headache was high, it ended up little used, and when OpenDoc eclipsed P&amp;S and then fizzled itself, the Edition Manager was "edited out" (heh heh) of Rhapsody and never implemented for Carbon.

But the part of the IAC that allowed applications to send events to other applications and manipulate them became a lasting feature. This is the basic functionality that AppleScript still uses, which is pretty much all about sending events to apps, and was the basis for the Program-to-Program Communications Toolbox (PPC Toolbox, unrelated to PowerPC, which didn't exist at this point) that underlaid program linking in System 7 as well. Program linking, in this case, specifically refers to allowing programs on remote Macs to send events to programs on yours. This was how you could remotely manipulate server programs running on other Macs, and was <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">ported to AIX for the Apple Network Server so that "symbiotic applications"</a> could use the ANS for backend processing: the ANS looked like just another remote Mac you could send events to via AppleTalk, which the application on the local Mac could task with jobs and then asynchronously display their results. In Mac OS 9 TCP/IP became a supported transport for network Apple events and this capability <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/allow-remote-application-scripting-mchlp1398/mac">remains part of modern macOS</a> as well.

On the other hand, for sheer obscurity you couldn't beat CL/1. CL/1 was short for "Connection Language One" and originally developed by Network Innovations (unrelated to the current business bearing the name), a small company founded in 1984 and also based in Cupertino. Based around SQL but adding control structures for cursors, program logic and looping, CL/1 was intended for writing desktop-to-host applications to query remote databases on mainframes and large systems, transforming CL/1 programs into various SQL subqueries which were collected and returned. Unlike the later ODBC, most of this processing happened on the server, reducing network bandwidth but increasing server load and requiring an "adapter" program specific to the database engine in use. However, this also meant that client applications could be straightforward, simply shipping CL/1 programs to the remote server for execution and not requiring local processing other than the data that came back.
</p><p>
As both a practical demonstration and a sellable product, the company's first CL/1-based package, appropriately called Mac-to-VAX, allowed Mac applications to remotely access databases, files and applications on a DEC VAX server. Released in January 1988, CL/1 could use AppleTalk, DECnet, X.25, IBM 3270 and Apple’s implementation of IBM APPC/LU6.2 as transports. Apple was immediately attracted to the technology, seeing it as both advantageous for the Mac and as a possible standard they could control, and acquired the company in March as a subsidiary (its first acquisition of another technology company, as it happens). <!-- https://techmonitor.ai/technology/apple_extends_mac_to_host_focus_with_network_innovations_buy -->

The name CL/1 didn't last very long after the merger and the last reference I can find to it in industry sources is around May 1990 when its new name, Data Access Language (DAL), started appearing. Apple also scotched Network Innovations' originally planned ports to PC in 1990, determining to make DAL at least initially an Apple-exclusive technology. That said, while this slide implies Apple intended to include some portion of DAL-née-CL/1 with System 7, only the Data Access Manager (DAM) API became a built-in part of the operating system; the extension(s) implementing DAL proper for a given platform seem to have been a separate install and aren't on any of my System 7 disk sets. This is important to distinguish because the DAM just moves prefabricated DAL queries and replies back and forth and doesn't implement DAL itself.

Post-System 7, DAL suffered from the intermittent attention span 1990s Apple exhibited with many of its projects. Its most impressive application was as an extension for HyperCard, where it facilitated some remarkable live demos and some of the earliest data-driven fat clients with full GUIs, causing a scramble by database vendors — notably Oracle — to implement their own toolkits. (This toolkit started as Format Verlag's Plus, became Oracle Card after Oracle's acquisition, and later became Oracle Media Objects, best known for the Mac version that ran on <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/07/apples-interactive-television-box.html">the Apple Interactive Television Box prototype</a>.) While the client side remained Apple-specific, the server side became impressively cross-platform, growing to support IBM (VM/CMS, MVS/TSO, MVS/VTAM, DOS/VSE), DEC (VMS, Ultrix), SVR4, DG/UX, HP-UX, AIX, SunOS, Stratus AOS/VS II and Tandem Guardian C-30, running databases such as SQL/DS, IBM DB2, Teradata DBC/1012, CA-Datacom, CA-IDMS, Ingres, Informix (the database I had my first job out of college on), Oracle, Sybase, DEC Rdb, CA-DB, INFOS II, DG/SQL and Tandem NonStop/SQL. Apple also expanded the network transport options to include TCP/IP with the growing reach of the Internet.
</p><p>
Unfortunately for Apple, development for all these server permutations was expensive, reflected in very high prices for the adapter component, and the adapters also tended to incur performance problems largely from the overhead of translating and running DAL queries which were difficult to cache. While the concept of shared <i>query documents</i> in the Data Access Manager was at least in part intended to reduce this impact, few client applications ended up having much DAL code in common. Although EveryWare's ButlerSQL tried to rectify the translation issue by using DAL as its <em>native</em> language, the most notable of the few that attempted to do so, it ran on the classic Mac OS and its performance was instead limited by Mac OS's poor multitasking and throughput. (Apple was <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">well aware of this problem</a>.) Developers also complained about DAL's lack of BLOB and cross-platform support, neither of which Apple did much to address. Apple did license DAL to Blyth Software to develop a Windows client but it got little traction or interest.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, ODBC grew dominant both due to DAL's technical stagnation and ODBC's greater throughput, especially as network bandwidth was dramatically increasing. Apple licensed DAL to Independence Technologies (ITI) in February 1994, who intended to release DAL 2.0 supporting blobs and to take over Windows development, while Apple maintained control of DAM in Mac OS. ITI got bought itself in 1995 by BEA Systems and sold again to UniPrise in 1996, but the promised update never emerged before UniPrise went out of business in 1998. The Data Access Manager, like the Edition Manager, faded from disuse and was never ported to Rhapsody or Carbon, and ODBC became the primary database access method even in the classic Mac OS. However, the TCP port used by DAL — port 172 — remains as <tt>cl/1</tt> in <tt>/etc/services</tt> to this day.

The other piece enabling us to more precisely date this presentation is its model support list: the latest models shown are the Macintosh IIci and the Portable itself, which both came out in September 1989. The next model in the chronology would have been the IIfx in March 1990, which doesn't appear here, so the presentation can't be later than that. Notice that the original Macintosh 128K, 512K and 512Ke are listed as "supported" — but only if you effectively make them into Macintosh Pluses first.

All this was an "alpha" view of the operating system. The mention of developer seeding is prominent and intentional; Apple remembered the incompatibilities that resulted from failing to widely disseminate System 6 to developers and was determined not to make the same mistake. This slide anticipated customer availability in "Summer 1990" but System 7.0 was not released until May 1991.

So let's say we're out in the field with these presentations, doing our thing, selling our wares, hyping our master. How did we call back to the mothership?

One of the online services on this Portable was the Macintosh client for <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/932">Prodigy</a>, the famous graphical service that used modified NAPLPS graphics as its user interface. However, I didn't find any screens in its cache, suggesting it got hardly any use. Additionally, while Prodigy used Tymnet's X.25 dial-in network for its nationwide access, neither of these numbers appears in <a href="https://github.com/TYMNET/docs/blob/master/tymnet.txt">the 1990 Tymnet dial-in number list</a>. The main telephone number lacks an area code, though area code 614 was one of Ohio's original four area codes in the North American Numbering Plan encompassing Columbus and most of the state's southeast quadrant (Cleveland, for the record, was area code 216). 614 didn't split until 1998 when most of it became new area code 740.
</p><p>
These screenshots were done on the Mystic Color Classic in anticipation of being able to render out some of its <tt>STAGE.DAT</tt> contents, but there appears to be much less interest and support in the Prodigy retro-community for the Mac client, and I wasn't able to get anything recognizeable out of it. (The different endianness may be only one of many reasons why.) The low interest is somewhat understandable since the Mac client wasn't used much, and the Prodigy interface wasn't very Mac-like nor very popular with Macintosh users. Since it doesn't look like this person used it much either, we won't do anything further with it in this article.

But what our district manager did appear to use is AppleLink, and that's where we'll spend the remainder of our time.
</p><p>
AppleLink was a client-server service for Apple employees and dealers, and later developers, established in 1985 running over the General Electric Information Services (GEIS) nationwide Mark III network. (It is distinct from the later consumer-oriented but technically unrelated AppleLink Personal Edition, which later turned into America Online; we'll talk more about that and eWorld, AppleLink's intended successor, at the end.)

AppleLink's front-end was a fat GUI client to show remote resources as folders and files, and send and receive both public (i.e., bulletin-board) and private messages. This screenshot of a typical session in System 7 is from <i>Apple Confidential</i>.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8ahAkLFLco-lOYxTg1cPXL8rTlDPxwxftDf1vPwGgnIiGzNB7V1q-4AH2XrX7-1_tXvHbXH3fdWgL0eWyi9OSPBSqyN5hZIPvTSqRGTLJx2h7P9YzbsGQMRmG9mpxQZsYyycjL6OGWIS1Y73JCgLx-PeWmRFldIyK2aCU-HZU82Pk8tCSPXTCrTMwJMM/s640/Screen%204.PNG"><img alt="" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8ahAkLFLco-lOYxTg1cPXL8rTlDPxwxftDf1vPwGgnIiGzNB7V1q-4AH2XrX7-1_tXvHbXH3fdWgL0eWyi9OSPBSqyN5hZIPvTSqRGTLJx2h7P9YzbsGQMRmG9mpxQZsYyycjL6OGWIS1Y73JCgLx-PeWmRFldIyK2aCU-HZU82Pk8tCSPXTCrTMwJMM/s320/Screen%204.PNG" width="320"></a></p><p>

The front end allows you to work offline, which is handy since of course there's no AppleLink server to connect to anymore, along with an extensive built-in help library to reference regardless of connection status. Unfortunately relatively few tasks could be completed without a network connection.

There wasn't any mail in the outbasket (darn), but we can fake some, and you could write messages for transmission later. There was no other mail on the system I could find.

E-mail — at least within the network itself — became one of the most well-known features of AppleLink, including the first E-mail message sent from space. These are pictures of mission specialists James C. Adamson and Shannon Lucid with an original non-backlit Macintosh Portable on <a href="https://www.wikiarchives.space/index.php?/category/837">NASA Space Shuttle Mission STS-43</a>, <i>Atlantis</i>' ninth mission from August 2 to August 11, 1991. It had been lightly modified with a circuit breaker on the battery charging system for safety but was otherwise stock except for some bushings under the trackball to take up slack.
</p><p>
The Portable was ostensibly transported into space for the purposes of Development Test Objective (DTO) 1208, Space Station Cursor Control Device Evaluation II and Advanced Applications, which tested the in-flight ergonomics of the Portable's onboard trackball, a 2-inch external ADB trackball, an ADB optical mouse and a modified aircraft control stick with a thumb ball hat. While most of the Space Shuttle laptops were PCs such as ThinkPads (with the notable exception of the <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/solbournes-in-space.html">SPARC-based Solbourne PILOT</a>), the Portable was selected for this objective because it had a larger variety of commercially available input devices. The Portable was also used to record data from the Lower Body Negative Pressure experiment (LBNP, DSO 478), in which the astronauts evaluated use of the LBNP unit for drawing body fluids down to their legs to reverse counterflow under weightlessness, as well as shuttle flight path tracking using a custom application called MacSPoC ("SPoC" being short for "Shuttle Portable Computer") and acting as an alarm clock and scheduler. This latter function was assisted by a <a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/huh-a-seiko-apple-smart-watch-is-set-to-hit-the-auction-block">Seiko WristMac</a> "databank" watch which downloaded reminders from the Portable to its 2K memory.
</p><p>
It's not clear whose idea the "space E-mail" was, but it was publicized by Apple as early <a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/07/29/applelink-in-space/">as July 1991</a> as a means for astronauts to communicate with family and exchange files and data. The Earthbound side was GEIS's regular packet-switched network (more about that in a moment) fed into a ROLM telephone switch, terminating in a data linkup to a ground-based Mac Portable via the printer port at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Apple wrote a "forwarder" which took those packets and sent them back out through the modem port to an actual modem whose signal was then digitized, bounced off a commercial satellite to the White Sands (New Mexico) Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, and finally sent to a TDRSS satellite geosynchronous with Shuttle Atlantis. On the Shuttle side, the spacecraft received the signal as digital data and fed it as an analogue signal into an onboard modem connected to the Mac Portable. The same convoluted process in reverse handled injecting packets from the spacebound Mac Portable back into the GEIS network. From the point of view of the Mark III, this was just another packet-switched remote node, albeit one with an incredible amount of latency. Latency wasn't something that the stock AppleLink <em>client</em> handled well, however, so a modified version of AppleLink 6.0.2 went up with the Portable that had been tweaked to tolerate transmission delays.
</p><p>
The connection took several tries but Adamson and Lucid were able to successfully sent the first E-mail from space on August 9, to shuttle communicator Marcia Ivins at the JSC. The exact message contents <a href="https://tidbits.com/1991/08/19/mac-in-space-ii/">vary</a> between <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140216055859/https://support.apple.com/kb/TA30635">sources</a>, but in general the message read, in its entirety,
</p><p>
Hello Earth ! Greetings from the STS-43 Crew. This is the first AppleLink from space. Having a __GREAT__ time, wish you were here,... send cry[o], and [R]CS! Have a nice day...... Haste la vista, baby,... we'll be back!
</p>
<p>
where "cry" or "cryo" refers to cryogenics (in this case, liquid oxygen for breathing), and "CS" or "RCS" refers to the Reaction Control System, i.e., fuel for thruster manoeuvres. The shuttle was able to receive E-mail as well but this address was kept secret from the public (and various obvious honeypots also set up) to prevent the astronauts from being deluged. 
</p><p>
That brings us to attempting to log in ourselves, and for that we should talk briefly about the backend this time. GEIS' roots extend to the 1962 Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS), a proposal by Dartmouth College professors John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz to develop a free, open timesharing system for students. Kemeny and Kurtz established a partnership with General Electric in 1963 and got funding from the National Science Foundation to deploy a 1961 GE-225 mainframe for processing, a 20-bit system with a typical eight kilowords of core memory, paired with an 18-bit GE DATANET-30 ("DN-30") connected via DMA functioning as a terminal server. The DN-30 was itself a full general purpose computer but in this application it was fully dedicated to the task of scheduling jobs on the mainframe and servicing terminals, of which it could support up to 128. This double-system concept was considered unusual and even wasteful for the time, but by the autumn of 1964 the system was operating twenty terminals serving hundreds of users and upgraded seamlessly to a larger GE-235 with triple the memory speed. This first incarnation of DTSS was the system Kemeny and Kurtz developed BASIC on in 1963.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj15rYjjnkrnKOuRLCHYQGL5_EK47TnhBHaX4_CDltGeCqxd_E2hfU_MkmVmtHMuTnzI1Dke818N1zxTixecQkdjsmebee1kUALEWMuRZlC-YLwN1ZibUnZYagR0adZHOPdRvJzZfEYdbkvIGOpHkvGFgZY1N4uONgdhBZfrbYNrI8XMgl_PF-cMajP8ZE/s2906/ge645.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="1524" data-original-width="2906" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj15rYjjnkrnKOuRLCHYQGL5_EK47TnhBHaX4_CDltGeCqxd_E2hfU_MkmVmtHMuTnzI1Dke818N1zxTixecQkdjsmebee1kUALEWMuRZlC-YLwN1ZibUnZYagR0adZHOPdRvJzZfEYdbkvIGOpHkvGFgZY1N4uONgdhBZfrbYNrI8XMgl_PF-cMajP8ZE/s320/ge645.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

Kemeny and Kurtz had initially wanted GE to enter into a research arrangement, but GE declined their proposal, and the original partnership was structed purely as a commercial sale. However, as DTSS grew successful GE became impressed with the flexibility of the architecture and decided to take a more active role in its development. Explicitly combining the GE-235 and DN-30 as the GE-265, GE started advertising timesharing services on their own systems in 1965 and building out a national network to allow access over dedicated lines. 
</p><p>
At the same time GE had developed a new 36-bit mainframe architecture supporting up to four CPUs and as much as 4MW of memory as a way to reduce their own dependence on IBM. The GE 600 series started with the GE-635 in 1963 (the above picture is a GE-645, a larger version with hardware support for Multics and virtual memory) which ran GE's GECOS "GE Comprehensive Operating Supervisor" batch processing system. By 1967 DTSS had been ported to the GE-635/DN-30 and GE adopted it as their "Mark II" network, retroactively dubbing their original GE-265 implementation as "Mark I." By 1968 GE controlled somewhere between a third and forty percent of the timesharing market, serving tens of thousands of users, and the timesharing unit became its own division in 1969.
</p><p>
In 1970 GE decided to exit the computing hardware business and offloaded the GE 600 series to Honeywell, who renamed it the Honeywell 6000 family. The Honeywell 6000s still used the same basic architecture and still ran GECOS, merely renaming it to GCOS ("<em>General</em> Comprehensive Operating <em>System</em>"), and GE started using their hardware instead. However, GE retained their profitable timesharing service, now transitioning to Honeywell hardware, developing a means for Mark II systems to submit batch jobs to GCOS in a seamless and nearly interactive fashion. This became the Mark III network in 1972.
</p><p>
GE's dominance of commercial timesharing grew even stronger in the 1970s with its high availability, facilitated by specialized clustering hardware allowing users to be spread over up to six mainframes and have the same view of the Mark II machines' filesystem, and three redundant international data centers equally accessible from anywhere in the world. GE also evolved their remote access operations into a packet-switched, telephone-accessible extended X.25 international network that was included with their services. In 1979 GE spun off their services division into the joint venture GEISCO (GE Information Services Company) with Honeywell but bought back Honeywell's portion in 1982, later renaming it to General Electric Information Services (GEIS). By the mid-1980s the Mark III network had local access numbers in over 750 cities and 31 countries, handling as many as five thousand simultaneous users. GE eventually added other network types such as IBM SNA and by the 1990s had four worldwide networks running on the same backbone.

In 1984 the original Macintosh was a hit for Apple but came with new costs of its own as the expense of maintaining its traditional dealer network was skyrocketing. Interminable games of "telephone tag" had already been a problem during the Apple II days and Apple was spending half a million dollars a year — in 1984 dollars — just to print price lists. Apple management reasoned that while setting up an electronic dealer network would itself be pricey, it would enable them to contain many of their distribution expenses, facilitate better communication, and allow them to outsource their existing timesharing system used for staff E-mail. Head of support John Ebbs, formerly a senior executive at General Electric, suggested his former company could help develop a useful service that could also show off the Mac at the same time.
</p><p>
Apple approached GEISCO in 1984, making a key requirement to use the Macintosh's graphical interface instead of the text-based terminal access GEISCO currently afforded users. For this GE engineers developed a GCOS backend called EF3 ("Error-Free") which the Macintosh client would act as an asynchronous interface for, and Apple contracted with Central Coast Software to write the front end, who developed it in Pascal. To encourage dealer adoption Apple subsidized the network somewhat by giving them a free hour of connect time per month and $15 an hour (in 2024 about $43) thereafter, though this rate was higher outside the United States. Unlike <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">services such as The Source</a>, Apple's service didn't run on leftover after-hours capacity and dealers were unlikely to connect when their shops were closed, so the rate didn't vary on the time of day. The first release and availability of the new AppleLink network was in fall 1985.

The AppleLink client version on this Macintosh Portable is 5.1. The original AppleLink 1.0 client for the first generation Macintosh was quickly upgraded for the Macintosh Plus in 1986 and I have one of these floppies with "Macintosh Plus Version" prominently stamped on it. Versions through at least 6.1 are known, with additional work done on the client by Bear River Associates, then in Berkeley and <a href="https://www.bearriver.com/about/">still in business</a> in Oakland. Later versions of the client upgrade to GE's later EFX "Error-Free eXtended" protocol which replaced EF3.
</p><p>
We know our Apple district manager used this because their credentials are in the dialogue box (which I've suppressed). I haven't suppressed the rest, though, because they're germane to understanding how the Mark III network operated. And where we can learn the most about it is from a much more famous online service that used it too: GEnie.

Separate from its work on AppleLink and related products we'll discuss at the end, GEIS had noted the rise of nascent consumer-oriented online services like <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/04/tonight-were-gonna-log-on-like-its-1979.html">The Source</a> (then owned by Reader's Digest in partnership with Control Data Corporation) and CompuServe (a subsidiary of H&amp;R Block), and decided they could compete in the same market — but with less overhead and presumably more profitably, because they already had their own nationwide local access network, their own hardware and their own data centres. The job was tasked to <a href="http://www.billlouden.com/bio.html">Bill Louden</a>, CompuServe's former director of communications and one of history's candidates for coining the term "email," who transplanted facsimiles of CompuServe's most popular features to the new platform along with new content while carefully concealing its GCOS underpinnings. Reportedly the name "GEnie" came from Louden's wife after a $50,000 consultant disastrously proposed calling it "Albert" (Einstein), to which they added the backronym "General Electric Network for Information Exchange."
</p><p>
The new GEnie service launched in October 1985 with both 300bps and 1200bps access. Criticially, although GEnie did have on-peak and off-peak rates at a startling differential (launching at $35/hr prime-time 8am-6pm on weekdays but $5/hr otherwise, or in 2024 dollars about $100/hr and $14/hr respectively), GEnie undercut CompuServe by not charging a premium for 1200 baud connections, offsetting any additional cost from higher speed users against its excess unused computing time. Eventually 2400bps access was added as well, also at the same "flat" rates.

A typical user would dial their local access number (8N1, local echo-half duplex preferred) and after successful connection send a series of </p><tt>H</tt><p> characters to get the network gateway's attention (contemporary sources said </p><tt>HHH</tt><p> and press RETURN, but really any sequence of at least two would be enough). The local gateway would then open an X.25 link to one of GE's datacentres, which responded with a famously terse login prompt. The initial dance looked a little like this (<b>bold</b> is what we type):
</p><div><pre><b>ATDT5551234</b>

CONNECT 1200
<b>HHH</b>

U#=
</pre></div>
<p>
Signons to the Mark III network were of the general form <tt>XXX#####</tt>, <tt>X</tt> being a letter and <tt>#</tt> a number. The signons for creating a GEnie account (credit card required) often literally started with <tt>X</tt>, such as <tt>XJM11878</tt> or <tt>XTX99437</tt> — these were real signons that were in use at various times. It was then followed by a comma and the password, which was frequently <tt>GENIE</tt> or some such for the signup logins. If the login was accepted, they would proceed to the main menu, which in 1986 looked like this (from the manual):
</p><div><pre>U#=<b>XXX12345,PASSWORD</b>

The menus provided a guided way to access GEnie services, but under the hood everything was organized into numerical pages using the ubiquitous <tt>MOVE</tt> (<tt>M</tt> for short) command. The main "top" menu was always on page 1. While less-opaque word mnemonics also existed for many services (printed at the top centre, so the top menu's mnemonic was <tt>TOP</tt>), if you knew the number for a particular area or application, you could jump straight to it. Many users used GEnie exclusively for games such as Kesmai's Air Warrior and Simutronics' GemStone, which offered massively multiplayer experiences decades before modern MMOs, and had scripts in their terminal programs or clients to check messages and then start their favourite game immediately. (Like GEnie's competitors, popular services like these often had surcharges, which could sometimes be sizeable.) GemStone III, for example, was 1335, E-mail was on 200, and the LiveWire "CB Simulator" chat system was on 400.
</p><p>
In fact, the login sequence itself could even facilitate doing so immediately upon signon, saving valuable connect time. If you logged in as, say, <tt>XTX12345,password,625;1</tt> — remember this format, it will be relevant later — which followed the login and password with another comma, the page number, a semicolon, and an item number, this would immediately move to page 625 (this was the Commodore 8-bit "Flagship" RoundTable, GEnie jargon for a bulletin board) and select option 1 from its menu (in this case showing you a list of categories). The Commodore 8-bit community was especially concentrated on GEnie during its final years after the shutdown of QuantumLink in 1993, featuring <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/index.php">a large filebase</a> and roundtable roster, and login scripts like <a href="https://cbmfiles.com/genie/geniefiles/C128Telecom/GENIE-II">this one for DesTerm 128</a> relied precisely on this capability (warning: PETSCII). On the Apple side, a separate GEnie roundtable for Macintosh users existed outside of AppleLink on page 605. Fortunately for user-to-user communication services like these, most of the system used friendlier alias names for accounts and generally relegated the network login to authentication and billing.

With GEnie's operation as context, we should be able to see all the pieces in the setup dialogue necessary to start reverse-engineering the AppleLink signon process. The phone number has no area code, but 362-XXXX is one of the prefixes for nearby San Jose in Apple's home area code 408 (and since this user was dialing without an area code at the time, this system must have been local to the gateway). Although GEIS never published a comprehensive printed list of its access numbers that I could find, it's most likely that the machine on the other end was an Apple-provided gateway with a leased line into the GE network (though for the record Apple's telephone exchange in Cupertino generally looks like 408-996-XXXX). This Portable is fitted with an Apple internal 1200bps modem which was what this system was originally configured to call out through. However, you can also route the call via (using the Portable CDEV) the modem port or (this screen) the printer port to an external modem or other serial link.
</p><p>
As for the signon, we can see a Mark III login of the standard format in this window, here called the "System number." Knowing what we know about GEnie, that means the signon to access (at least this instance of) AppleLink was <tt>NJL37300</tt> and the password was <tt>Apple</tt> (note the comma between them), but this clearly couldn't be an individual user's identifier. The AppleLink ID <em>is</em> populated (I've only censored it), so it must transmit it somehow.
</p><p>
The way we find out is by looking at AppleLink's CCL scripts. CCL stands for Communications Control Language, a simple domain-specific scripting language that originated with the AppleLink client as a means of adding and adjusting connection methods without having to constantly update the main application. They work essentially by emitting strings, or, for control flow, branching on a matched string to a specified numeric label, along with a small set of register variables and special keywords to manipulate the serial port. CCL outlasted its original purpose: an updated form became the modem scripting language for Apple Remote Access, was updated again for Mac OS X through 10.4 Tiger to remove its dependency on string resources, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/HardwareDrivers/Reference/CCLScriptingRef/CCLCommands/CCLCommands.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40005464-CH4-SW1">was updated a final time in 10.5 Leopard</a> to support strings in property lists. While most people no longer use modems and Macs haven't included them in years, the infrastructure remains supported in modern macOS for things like external USB modems and serial ports, and you can still find your Mac's available CCLs in <tt>/Library/Modem Scripts</tt>.
</p><p>
It will be easiest for us to spoof AppleLink by pretending to be a regular Hayes-compatible modem, and AppleLink has a CCL for that called <tt>USAModem.CCL</tt>. Happily, these scripts are regular MacRoman and readable with a text editor. Here are some extracts.

<p>
The string "Signalling the modem" emitted by the keyword <tt>DsplyMsg</tt> is the current connection status, and is displayed within the connection dialogue box like so:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMnqBvXeXRzYQu8DHR3ZI-_bEprjiIaHd8ayJj-0eQ5u6jPyU1bpPrQoqAGwfC7I_ALIrP0uu0STcSjKjGJeP6pIqgmE_LHKs5WP9EPZD5kl9cQmgkdXwAmwV0mA8yjnYOe5cqR1U_dQYeNGwcNxSINSNXVhtKy7ftPhIHOzJ2FNEYf14KC0aunTHIoDs/s640/Screen%200.PNG"><img alt="" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMnqBvXeXRzYQu8DHR3ZI-_bEprjiIaHd8ayJj-0eQ5u6jPyU1bpPrQoqAGwfC7I_ALIrP0uu0STcSjKjGJeP6pIqgmE_LHKs5WP9EPZD5kl9cQmgkdXwAmwV0mA8yjnYOe5cqR1U_dQYeNGwcNxSINSNXVhtKy7ftPhIHOzJ2FNEYf14KC0aunTHIoDs/s320/Screen%200.PNG" width="320"></a></p><p>

This segment then goes on to set the strings it intends to respond to. The </p><tt>MatchStr</tt><p> keyword takes three arguments, a string slot (only a fixed number of strings can be searched for at once), a label to branch to if the string is matched, and then the string itself. Matching occurs automatically as text is received and matches do not (indeed usually don't) need to match the entire received string. It next sends an AT command </p><tt>ATS0=0E0X4V1</tt><p> followed by a carriage return, which sets modem register 0 to 0 (never auto-answer), turns off echo, turns on busy signal and dial tone detection, and requests verbose English responses. If the pause of 180 tenths of a second expires without a matching string being received, it increments a variable and tries again, branching after three tries to label 47 which aborts with a timeout error. We'll assume the modem replied with </p><tt>OK</tt><p>, which will move us to label 2.

(Comment lines start with <tt>!</tt>, or could be appended with whitespace after a valid statement.) The <tt>DsplyPic</tt> keyword lights up one of the icons in the connection dialogue, in this case the first one, and then the next string is shown, which interpolates the built-in variable <tt>FONE</tt> to show the user the telephone number:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_KwM6umXOmGZ_fuzdedvEhxn2V9hGaHOHaWnyN6KT6AODprf1T5w94zRUNrbjjlLtCw9ru65vpxbv_ypxg6Y_5b9VC2qJEYQ4of2j87CqXA1QlkOEpQYqNt0ufPB7kPMWEDVF6M9R-G0UErgdltce6JfdOMbMqWuLJKnx8YnamzoCkKA_8eXL1rtHWZM/s640/Screen%201.PNG"><img alt="" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_KwM6umXOmGZ_fuzdedvEhxn2V9hGaHOHaWnyN6KT6AODprf1T5w94zRUNrbjjlLtCw9ru65vpxbv_ypxg6Y_5b9VC2qJEYQ4of2j87CqXA1QlkOEpQYqNt0ufPB7kPMWEDVF6M9R-G0UErgdltce6JfdOMbMqWuLJKnx8YnamzoCkKA_8eXL1rtHWZM/s320/Screen%201.PNG" width="320"></a></p><p>

The dial string is then constructed from the Hayes </p><tt>ATD</tt><p> command, whether tone or pulse dialing in the built-in variable </p><tt>TONE</tt><p>, and then the phone number. If it successfully gets any unambiguous part of the string </p><tt>CONNECT</tt><p>, it will assume success and move on to label 4. Strings like </p><tt>BUSY</tt><p> and </p><tt>CARRIER</tt><p> (as in </p><tt>NO CARRIER</tt><p>) branch to their own handlers. If the connection doesn't go through and isn't otherwise handled, the </p><tt>JSR 20</tt><p> calls a subroutine at label 20 which tries to hang up and reset the modem before dialing again.

<p><em>Now</em> we see the structure of the logon string it's sending: the AppleLink ID and its password (separately prompted for) are appended as a parameters, apparently twice and followed by several other keywords and variables, though we don't know the exact content of all these variables yet. We can also see all the possible messages GCOS could send back, most of which are errors, like (</p><tt>SER</tt><p>)</p><tt>VICE INTERRUPTED</tt><p> or (</p><tt>SY</tt><p>)SYEM UNAVAIL(</p><tt>ABLE</tt><p>). Only one of these, what looks like </p><tt>SYSTEM REA</tt><p>(</p><tt>DY</tt><p>), actually leads to a success state, and that's label 36:

This starts the client's EFX handler and then exits back into the application with return code 0, indicating success. The failure labels all return with -1.
</p><p>
Now that we know what the connection script is looking for, we can type the responses it's expecting back to it. To avoid any potential conflicts with the internal modem, I'll configure AppleLink to communicate via the printer port to a null modem connected with my Raptor Talos II. (Impressively, this client version supports up to 19.2kbps, which would have been quite something in 1991. Those speeds may have been intended for direct serial connections.) You'll note the script is explicitly terminating everything it sends with a carriage return, so for display purposes we'll have <tt>picocom</tt> translate those to line feeds. Again, <b>bold</b> is what I typed back.

I'm not sure why the exact same user string is sent twice except with an exclamation point, but the rest includes the client version and presumably an encoded date of revision instead of today's date. This seems to be everything the mainframe would need to fire up EFX and start communicating with the client. 

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOm7d5U3nW-xyxI75xos9hmMY8NZaqnmgszGPZ5qJ6_V03JqXYHQGxbCJwkd6Cri4u_KxhptJmaD4Pvh9K-wjLY0VsC2PwFizavt645EdWVzyOJwGpQQz788kt6EVkw5AmUYHpb0r3gASB5bK2BuCZE0v3lCOU9KuQD94WQtIVNORma4vynk2UIG4uvPw/s640/Screen%205.PNG"><img alt="" data-original-height="400" data-original-width="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhOm7d5U3nW-xyxI75xos9hmMY8NZaqnmgszGPZ5qJ6_V03JqXYHQGxbCJwkd6Cri4u_KxhptJmaD4Pvh9K-wjLY0VsC2PwFizavt645EdWVzyOJwGpQQz788kt6EVkw5AmUYHpb0r3gASB5bK2BuCZE0v3lCOU9KuQD94WQtIVNORma4vynk2UIG4uvPw/s320/Screen%205.PNG" width="320"></a></p><p>

Indeed, all of the preceding screenshots were generated with that very sequence, demonstrating the client will accept our responses. But unfortunately I don't know anything about EFX, so we can't currently fake anything further. I don't see any activity on the serial port despite this message and we inevitably time out.

That then gives us this message ...

... and then this final message before the client gives up completely, which I suspect our intrepid astronauts on Space Shuttle Atlantis also got a few times, though for a completely different reason.
</p><p>
Let's finish the AppleLink story before we close. By the end of 1985 AppleLink was a roaring success, at least in user terms, handling over 4,000 calls a day. This demonstrated to GE the concept could have some utility to other corporations besides Apple, and in December 1985 GE decided to use the same technology as AppleLink in their own product, Businesstalk. Businesstalk was envisioned for any company with a large dealer network, not just computer companies, many of which would have been battling the same problems and expenses. The client was also Mac-specific and built with the same codebase, at least initially, but GEISCO's charges were heftier at $35/hr prime time and $18/hr off, presumably with the assumption that (like Apple) interested companies would partially subsidize the rate. To GE's dismay few seemed interested, so in February 1986 GE relaunched Businesstalk as Dealertalk, using the same Mac client but instead at an introductory price of $9900 that included a site license, 15 days of training and 100 hours of free connect time. The price was intended to stoke interest since GE threatened it would rise to $20,000 after July 31. It was similarly unsuccessful.

<!-- IW 12/86--><p>In December 1986 GE tried once more under the BusinessTalk name again (but note the camel case), unveiling a PC client alongside the Mac version and marketing the service more as a corporate private bulletin board. It was still $20,000 and the rate crept up to $36/hour, but there was no limit on the number of clients that could connect. Possibly it was the unlimited number of machines or maybe eliminating the requirement to buy Macintoshes, but either way the third time was finally a charm. By 1989 (the screenshot is from Infoworld showing the MS-DOS version of Business Talk 5.0) users could communicate with other corporate E-mail systems like Wang Office, DEC All-in-1 and IBM DISOSS and could even send messages by fax. While it was still $20,000 to start, GE had enough business that the connect rates were a more modest $23/hr prime and $15/hr off by then, and Business Talk became used by diverse companies such as financial company Charles Schwab to form SchwabLink. Despite being notionally separate universes, Business Talk instances and AppleLink nevertheless all ran on the same platform, and messages could be sent and received between each other as well. (These later software clients likely used a form of EFX also, so it may be possible to figure out how it worked from them, but probably even fewer examples of those still survive.)
</p><p>
Meanwhile, although allegedly saving them more than they spent, Apple was chafing under the substantial amount of money they paid GE to keep AppleLink operational. As more dealers and developers joined the system, the more expensive it got (<i>Apple Confidential</i> cited a ballpark fee of $30 million annually), and GE was unwilling to renegotiate. It even got bad enough that Apple later sold CD-ROMs with AppleLink content on them as a cheaper "offline" version to dampen interest.
</p><p>
In 1987 Apple approached Steve Case, then running Quantum Computer Services and the very successful QuantumLink online service for the Commodore 64, to develop a cheaper alternative to which AppleLink content could eventually be transferred. AppleLink Personal Edition ran atop Quantum's Stratus-based platform via Telenet and débuted first on the Apple II in May 1988, but Apple and Quantum squabbled over the future direction of the service and users complained about missing features that the "real" AppleLink had. (In addition, some of GE's code and protocols were allegedly used without permission, further souring the relationship.) Apple eventually paid off Quantum to get out of the contract and the Mac version as such was never released. Instead, Quantum used that money to finish the Mac client without the Apple branding but using the same underlying infrastructure, and in 1991 that client became part of Quantum's new America Online.

Although Apple had managed to cut AppleLink costs somewhat in the meantime, continued high expenditures eventually caused the company to open a new request for proposals, and in 1992 they went back to Quantum again which was now also called America Online. In return for Apple paying AOL royalties, Apple would receive a stake in the company and layer an AppleLink replacement on top of AOL's infrastructure that would additionally be offered to consumers. Due to Apple corporate turmoil the new online service, christened eWorld, didn't launch until June 1994 and ended up directly competing with other new and established ones like AOL itself, Delphi, CompuServe, Prodigy and, yes, GEnie. Apple had priced its hourly rates high to temper demand, but that ended up working too well, and they failed to even include it consistently with new Macs they sold. Apple eventually forced the issue by moving employees from AppleLink to eWorld to beef up traffic and, after Gil Amelio cancelled eWorld in March 1996, started migrating to Web-based intranet alternatives rather than move people back. AppleLink was finally shut down on March 31, 1997.

As it happens, a similar process happened with GEIS. In April 1992 GE announced plans for BusinessTalk 2000, a repackaging of the service adding a Windows client to its Mac and DOS support, X.400 and X.500 message exchange, more online databases for access, and single seats starting as low as $279 (the site license increased to $30,000). By then, however, the growing Internet had started to erode customer interest in proprietary network products, especially GEIS' core Electronic Data Interchange services. GEnie, though still successful, suffered from a lack of expansion because it was only ever intended to use up excess computing capacity and GEIS' weakening revenue couldn't justify additional hardware. GEIS sold it off in 1996 as other clients started moving away from GE's proprietary services to Web-based alternatives (the screenshot above of the historical GEIS website comes from <a href="https://www.ammannato.it/geis-alumni/">this remembrance</a>). Both GEnie (under new owners Yovelle and later telecom IDT) and the Mark III network eventually succumbed to Y2K, as the GCOS version in use didn't handle it and it would have been too costly to move them to new platforms, and both shut down in December 1999. The majority of GEIS was reorganized as GXS (GE Global Exchange Services) in 2000, spun off in 2002, and subsequently bought out by OpenText in 2014.

<h2 id="cs-6120-advanced-compilers-the-self-guided-online-course">CS 6120: Advanced Compilers: The Self-Guided Online Course</h2>
<p>CS 6120 is a PhD-level <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Cornell CS</a> course by <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/">Adrian Sampson</a> on programming language implementation.
It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection.
The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> and <a href="https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/bril/">an educational IR invented just for this class</a>.</p>
<p>This page lists the curriculum for following this course at the university of your imagination, for four imagination credits (ungraded).
There’s a linear timeline of lessons interspersed with papers to read.
Each lesson has videos and written notes, and some have <em>implementation tasks</em> for you to complete.
Tasks are all open-ended, to one degree or another, and are meant to solidify your understanding of the abstract concepts by turning them into real code.
The order represents a suggested interleaving of video-watching and paper-reading.</p>
<p>Some differences with the “real” CS 6120 are that you can ignore the task deadlines and you can’t participate in our discussion threads on Zulip.
Real 6120 also has an end-of-semester course project—in the self-guided version, your end-of-semester assignment is to change the world through the magic of compilers.</p>
<p>The instructor is a video production neophyte, so please excuse the production values, especially in the early lessons.
CS 6120 is <a href="https://github.com/sampsyo/cs6120">open source and on GitHub</a>, so please file bugs if you find problems.</p>
<p>When you finish the course, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/GuRiMa728DUvTbZQ7">this feedback form</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a WIP extension for SD WebUI <a href="https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge">(via Forge)</a> to generate transparent images and layers.</p>
<p dir="auto">The image generating and basic layer functionality is working now, but <strong>the transparent img2img is not finished yet (will finish in about one week)</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This code base is highly dynamic and may change a lot in the next month. If you are from professional content creation studio and need all previous results to be strictly reproduced, you may consider backup files during each update.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can see that the native transparent diffusion can process transparent glass, semi-transparent glowing effects, etc, that are not possible with simple background removal methods. Native transparent diffusion also gives you detailed fur, hair, whiskers, and detailed structure like that skeleton.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Model Notes</h2><a id="user-content-model-notes" aria-label="Permalink: Model Notes" href="#model-notes"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Note that all currently released models are for SDXL. Models for SD1.5 may be provided later if demanded.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note that in this extension, all model downloads/selections are fully automatic. In fact most users can just skip this section.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Below models are released:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>layer_xl_transparent_attn.safetensors</code> This is a rank-256 LoRA to turn a SDXL into a transparent image generator. It will change the latent distribution of the model to a "transparent latent space" that can be decoded by the special VAE pipeline.</li>
<li><code>layer_xl_transparent_conv.safetensors</code> This is an alternative model to turn your SDXL into a transparent image generator. This safetensors file includes an offset of all conv layers (and actually, all layers that are not q,k,v of any attention layers). These offsets can be merged to any XL model to change the latent distribution to transparent images. Because we excluded the offset training of any q,k,v layers, the prompt understanding of SDXL should be perfectly preserved. However, in practice, I find the <code>layer_xl_transparent_attn.safetensors</code> will lead to better results. This <code>layer_xl_transparent_conv.safetensors</code> is still included for some special use cases that needs special prompt understanding. Also, this model may introduce a strong style influence to the base model.</li>
<li><code>layer_xl_fg2ble.safetensors</code> This is a safetensors file includes offsets to turn a SDXL into a layer generating model, that is conditioned on foregrounds, and generates blended compositions.</li>
<li><code>layer_xl_fgble2bg.safetensors</code> This is a safetensors file includes offsets to turn a SDXL into a layer generating model, that is conditioned on foregrounds and blended compositions, and generates backgrounds.</li>
<li><code>layer_xl_bg2ble.safetensors</code> This is a safetensors file includes offsets to turn a SDXL into a layer generating model, that is conditioned on backgrounds, and generates blended compositions.</li>
<li><code>layer_xl_bgble2fg.safetensors</code> This is a safetensors file includes offsets to turn a SDXL into a layer generating model, that is conditioned on backgrounds and blended compositions, and generates foregrounds.</li>
<li><code>vae_transparent_encoder.safetensors</code> This is an image encoder to extract a latent offset from pixel space. The offset can be added to latent images to help the diffusion of transparency. Note that in the paper we used a relatively heavy model with exactly same amount of parameters as the SD VAE. The released model is more light weighted, requires much less vram, and does not influence result quality in my tests.</li>
<li><code>vae_transparent_decoder.safetensors</code> This is an image decoder that takes SD VAE outputs and latent image as inputs, and outputs a real PNG image. The model architecture is also more lightweight than the paper version to reduce VRAM requirement. I have made sure that the reduced parameters does not influence result quality.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Below models may be released soon (if necessary):</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>A model that can generate foreground and background together (using attention sharing similar to AnimateDiff). I put this model on hold because of these reasons: (1) the other released models can already achieve all functionalities and this model does not bring more functionalities. (2) the inference speed of this model is 3x slower than others and requires 4x more VRAM than other released model, and I am working on reducing the VRAM of this model if necessary. (3) This model will involve more hyperparameters and if demanded, I will investigate the best practice for inference/training before release it. <strong>this model is confirmed to be released soon with joint layer generating and one-step bg/fg-condition, after we finish the final VRAM optimization</strong></li>
<li>The current background-conditioned foreground model may be a bit too lightweight. I will probably release a heavier one with more parameters and different behaviors (see also the discussions later).</li>
<li>Because the difference between diffusers training and k-diffusion inference, I can observe some mystical problems like sometimes DPM++ will give artifacts but Euler A will fix it. I am looking into it and may provide some revised model that works better with all A1111 samplers.</li>

<p dir="auto">FAQ:</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>OK. But how can I get a background image like this?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the Foreground Condition to get a background like this. We will describe it in the next section.</p>
<p dir="auto">Or you can use old inpainting tech to perform foreground removal on any image to get a background like this.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Wait. Why you generate it with two steps? Can I generate it with one pass?</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Two steps allows for more flexible editing. We will release the one-step model soon if necessary, but that model is 2x larger and requires 4x larger VRAM, and we are still working on reducing the computation requirement of that model. (But in my tests, the current solution is better than that model in most cases.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Also you can see that the current model is about 680MB and in particular I think it is a bit too lightweight and will soon release a relatively heavier model for potential stronger structure understanding (but that is still under experiments).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Last week, someone leaked a spreadsheet of SoundThinking sensors to
<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/shotspotter-secret-sensor-locations-leak/">Wired</a>.
You are probably asking "What is SoundThinking," because the company rebranded
last year. They used to be called ShotSpotter, and their outdoor acoustic
gunfire detection system still goes by the ShotSpotter name.</p>
<p>ShotSpotter has attracted a lot of press and plenty of criticism for the
gunfire detection service they provide to many law enforcement agencies in the
US. The system involves installing acoustic sensors throughout a city, which
use some sort of signature matching to detect gunfire and then use time of
flight to determine the likely source.</p>
<p>One of the principle topics of criticism is the immense secrecy with which they
operate: ShotSpotter protects information on the location of its sensors as if
it were state secret, and does not disclose them even to the law enforcement
agencies that are its customers. This secrecy attracts accusations that
ShotSpotter's claims of efficacy cannot be independently validated, and that
ShotSpotter is attempting to suppress research into the civil rights impacts of
its product.</p>
<p>I have encountered this topic before: the Albuquerque Police Department is a
ShotSpotter customer, and during my involvement in police oversight was evasive
in response to any questions about the system and resisted efforts to subject
its surveillance technology purchases to more outside scrutiny. Many assumed
that ShotSpotter coverage was concentrated in disadvantaged parts of the city,
an unsurprising outcome but one that could contribute to systemic overpolicing.
APD would not comment.</p>
<p>I have always assumed that it would not really be that difficult to find the
ShotSpotter sensors, at least if you have my inclination to examine telephone
poles. While the Wired article focuses heavily on sensors installed on
buildings, it seems likely that in environments like Albuquerque with
city-operated lighting and a single electrical utility, they would be installed
on street lights. That's where you find most of the technology the city fields.</p>
<p>The thing is, I didn't really know what the sensors looked like. I've seen
pictures, but I know they were quite old, and I assumed the design had gotten
more compact over time. Indeed it has.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor on light pole" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/1.jpg"></p>
<p>An interesting thing about the Wired article is that it contains a map, but
the MapBox embed produced with Flourish Studio had a surprisingly high maximum
zoom level. That made it more or less impossible to interpret the locations of
the sensors exactly. I'm concerned that this was an intentional decision by
Wired to partially obfuscate the data, because it is not an effective one. It
was a simple matter to find the JSON payload the map viewer was using for the
PoI overlay and then convert it to KML.</p>
<p>I worried that the underlying data would be obscured; it was not. The
coordinates are exact. So, I took the opportunity to enjoy a nice day and went
on an expedition.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/2.jpg"></p>
<p>The sensors are pretty much what I imagined, innocuous beige boxes clamped to
street light arms. There are a number of these boxes to be found in modern
cities. Some are smart meter nodes, some are base stations for municipal data
networks, others collect environmental data. Some are the police, listening in
on your activities.</p>
<p>This is not as hypothetical of a concern as it might sound. Conversations
recorded by ShotSpotter sensors have twice been introduced as evidence in
criminal trials. In <a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-v-johnson-5116">one case</a>
the court allowed it, in
<a href="https://www.mass.gov/files/documents/2018/01/08/CRIMINAL%20ESI%20DEC%202017.pdf">another</a>
the court did not.  The possibility clearly exists, and depending on
interpretation of state law, it may be permissible for ShotSpotter to record
conversations on the street for future use as evidence.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/3.jpg"></p>
<p>This ought to give us pause, as should the fact that ShotSpotter has been
compellingly demonstrated to
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8xbq/police-are-telling-shotspotter-to-alter-evidence-from-gunshot-detecting-ai">manipulate</a>
their "interpretation" of evidence to fit a prosecutor's narrative---even when
ShotSpotter's original analysis contradicted it.</p>
<p>But pervasive surveillance of urban areas and troubling use of that evidence
is nothing new. Albuquerque already has an expansive police-operated video
surveillance network connected to the Real-Time Crime Center. APD has long
used portable automated license plate readers (ALPR) under cover of "your
speed is" trailers, and more recently has installed permanent ALPR at major
intersections in the city.</p>
<p>All of this occurs with virtually no public oversight or even public awareness.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/4.jpg"></p>
<p>What most surprised me is the density of ShotSpotter sensors. In my head, I
assumed they were fairly sparse. A Chicago report on the system says there are
20 to 25 per square mile. Density in Albuquerque is lower, probably reflecting
the wide streets and relative lack of high rises. Still, there are a lot of
them. 721 in Albuquerque, a city of about 190 square miles. At present, only
parts of the city are covered.</p>
<p><img alt="Map of ShotSpotter sensors in Albuquerque" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/map.jpg"></p>
<p>And those coverage decisions are interesting. The valley (what of it is in city
limits) is well covered, as is the west side outside of Coors/Old Coors. The
International District, of course, is dense with sensors, as is inner NE
bounded by roughly by the freeways to Louisiana and Montgomery.</p>
<p>Conspicuously empty is the rest of the northeast, from UNM's north campus
area to the foothills. Indian School Road makes almost its entire east side
length without any sensors. </p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/5.jpg"></p>
<p>The reader can probably infer how this coverage pattern relates to race and
class in Albuquerque. It's not perfect, but the distance from your house to a
ShotSpotter sensor correlates fairly well with your household income. The
wealthier you are, the less surveilled you are.</p>
<p>The "pocket of poverty" south of Downtown where I live, the historically
Spanish Barelas and historically Black South Broadway, are predictably
well covered. All of the photos here were taken within a mile, and I did not
come even close to visiting all of the sensors. Within a one mile radius of
the center of Barelas, there are 31 sensors.</p>
<p><img alt="ShotSpotter sensor in a neighborhood" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/6.jpg"></p>
<p>Some are conspicuous. Washington Middle School, where 13-year-old Bennie
Hargrove was shot by another student, has a sensor mounted at its front
entrance. Another sensor is in the cul de sac behind the Coors and I-40
Walmart, where a body was found in a burned-out car. Perhaps the deep gulch of
the freeway poses a coverage challenge, there are two more less than a thousand
feet away.</p>
<p>In the Downtown Core, buildings were preferred to light poles. The
PNM building, the Anasazi condos, and the Banque building are all feeding data
into the city's failing scheme of federal prosecutions for downtown gun crime.</p>
<p>The closest sensor to the wealthy Heights is at Embudo Canyon, and coverage
stops north of Central in the affluent Nob Hill residential area. Old Town is
almost completely uncovered, as is the isolationist Four Hills.</p>
<p>Highland High School has a sensor on its swimming pool building. The data says
there are two at the intersection of Gibson and Chavez, probably an error, it
also says there are two sensors on "Null Island." Don't worry about coverage in
the south campus area, though. There are 16 in the area bounded by I-25 to Yale
and Gibson to Coal.</p>
<p><img alt="Detail of a ShotSpotter sensor" src="https://computer.rip/f/soundthinking/7.jpg"></p>
<p>KOB <a href="https://www.kob.com/new-mexico/leaked-data-shows-shotspotter-locations-in-albuquerque/">quotes</a>
APD PIO Gallegos saying "We don't know, technically, where all the sensors are."
Well, I suppose they do now, the leak has been widely reported on. APD received
about 14,000 ShotSpotter reports last year. The accuracy of these reports, in
terms of their correctly identifying gunfire, is contested. SoundThinking
claims impressive statistics, but has actively resisted independent
evaluation. A Chicago report found that only 11.3% of ShotSpotter reports could
be confirmed as gunfire. APD, for its part, reports a few hundred suspects or
victims identified as a result of ShotSpotter reports.</p>
<p>APD has used a local firearms training business, Calibers, to fire blanks
around the city to verify detection. They say the system performed well.</p>
<p>But, if asked, they provide a form letter written by ShotSpotter. Their
contract prohibits the disclosure of any actual data.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><em>In February 1983, Chris Morgan, Gregg Williams (Senior Editor), and Phil Lemmons (West Coast Editor) met with Wayne Rosing, Bruce Daniels, and Larry Tesler from Apple’s Lisa project to discuss the upcoming system. While the Lisa was not hugely successfully (mainly because of the high price), it did lay the ground work for the much more successfuly Macintosh, which was related the following year. Enjoy!</em></p><p><em>Of the more than 90 members of the Apple engineering staff who participated in the Lisa project, Wayne Rosing, Bruce Daniels, and Larry Tesler are three of those who were most responsible for its final form. Rosing, formerly of the Digital Equipment Company, oversaw hardware development until Lisa went into pilot manufacture and then assumed responsibility for technical management of the entire Lisa project. Daniels and Tesler were responsible for Lisa's systems software and applications software, respectively. Chris Morgan, senior editor Gregg Williams, and West Coast editor Phil Lemmons interviewed the three at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino, California, last October.</em><span> </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> Tell us how you staffed the Lisa project. </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> In software, we drew mostly experienced people from other companies and very few people straight out of school. Even the ones we took out of school generally had lots of job experience. In fact, one time I surveyed the applications group and found an average of nine years' work experience in software. When we looked at resumes, we tried to find people with several years of experience in development. We made exceptions if someone had specialized in something we were interested in or was a top student who also had good summer experience. We wanted an experienced team because what we've been doing is a very major software effort. It's very complex, and there's such a large body of software to crank out and make reliable that it takes experienced people. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> When did you do the hiring? </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> The project went through phases. There was some design and some implementation when the project first started two and a half years ago, but we hired most of our software people about two years ago. In three months, we hired most of the software staff, and then they spent several months learning about the machine and designing their particular parts of the software. The bulk of the programming started about a year and a half ago. </span></p><p>We had to spend quite a long time just building a team — people who had a common view and could work together. We drew people from different companies with completely different backgrounds and tried to do something that nobody in this group had ever done. Some of us had done parts of it before. We were developing everything in parallel: the hardware, the operating system, the applications, the manuals, the details of the user interface. We did have a sort of fundamental philosophy, but having to do everything at once means you're never sure when you're going to get what you need from the person who does whatever you need next. </p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> I think communication is the key there. If you have that many things going in parallel, you spend a lot of time communicating so each of you knows what the other's doing and can depend on each other. </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> It took a while to work out those channels. It was rough at the beginning, but it's pretty easy now. Our progress was gradual. I think I'd call it team-building. Some of the things were hard to do in an organization that's thrown together like this. But once you've got a team built, it's a valuable asset. Of course, we were doing technical work all along, but in a sense we spent a year building the team and a year building the product. Now when we build something else, we can do it without the teambuilding step. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> What about project security? </span></p><p><strong>Rosing:</strong><span> We tried to be as secure as we could without creating a discouraging atmosphere for people to work in. Within the group there has always been total information transfer, and we've kept lots of machines available. People have been able to take machines home with them. There was always the risk of losing a Lisa in a burglary, but we had a rule that the floppy disk had to be kept separate from the machine. We felt it was worth risking a theft to gain the increased productivity of people working at home. We've been very fortunate; we haven't lost one machine. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> How did you schedule the project? </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> People made estimates, but it was difficult. All the estimates were conditional — "If the hardware is here by a certain date and the operating system is frozen and I have the user-interface definition and I can get some assistance from people who have the right sort of experience, then I can do it in this many months." But none of the ifs were ever really possible. People were really hesitant to make a firm date because there were so many contingencies. We did come up with schedules all the time, but they were myths. </span></p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> Getting Lisa to market has been a dream, a goal that we all have. Although we're willing to make compromises to get Lisa out expeditiously, the dream of what we're trying to achieve is the major thing. </span></p><p><strong>Rosing:</strong><span> We had this dream of what we wanted to do, and I think over time we recognized that we couldn't achieve some of the goals. Well have to take care of them later. We've taken the attitude that Lisa is going to be good and we're not going to sacrifice the integrity of the product for scheduling. We wanted to make a very balanced set of decisions, and so everything, as I say, just started to come together. The floppy disk works well, the mouse works well, the hardware works well, the software is beginning to come, and now we're cranking to get this first release out. But we won't let it be compromised because of scheduling. </span></p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> Part of the difficulty was that both the user interface and the internals — the architecture — of the software are revolutionary. Getting that architecture designed and built was a big scheduling problem. Once we'd done that, we'd built the foundation. Now building the applications is much smoother and has been much easier for us to predict. </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> We didn't know if some of the things we started would work at all, like the way the dot-matrix printer is used and even the way the letter-quality printer is used to print the graphics. </span></p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> No one had ever done that before. </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> Theoretically, it ought to be possible, but it had never been done, and the manufacturer of the printer didn't believe it could be done. It had to be possible in order for this product to do what we wanted, but no one could predict how long it was going to take. When we hired the printer people we told them to do it in two months. It took them a year and a half, but they did it. And then the high-density disk drives are new technology to Apple. A lot of the concepts in there had never been tried before. That was one of the biggest risks. And Apple not only built disk drives for the first time but built revolutionary disk drives. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> What makes them revolutionary? </span></p><p><strong>Rosing:</strong><span> One of the major things we did was to vary the speed of the disk as you change the track position, so the drives keep constant area density, and that gives them a greater capacity. Second, we used microstepping algorithms on the stepper motor so that if a head gets off track because of changes in humidity and temperature, the intelligent controller can hunt and find the track. So we have much better interchangeability, with much higher density, and we're getting approximately 50 to 60 percent more data on that disk by good systems engineering. Some of the competitive units have a greater capacity, but we think the error rate ultimately suffers. We wouldn't tolerate a serious error-rate problem. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> How does the error rate compare with double-sided double-density disks? </span></p><p><strong>Rosing:</strong><span> As for hard-error rates, we're talking about 10" 12 , and that occurs after so many bits that it's hard to measure. But we're quite delighted that the measurements are impossible to take. Basically that means the errors are low. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> Did you work more than 40-hour weeks? </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> Each engineer set his or her own schedule. Some engineers work something like Monday through Friday from nine to five. Others work all day at the office, then go home and work all night there. And what an individual engineer does may vary from time to time. </span></p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> These people have pride. They set their own milestones and they want to meet them, so they'll put in extra work to do that. </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> We decided a long time ago that since the project would obviously go on for more than a few months — a couple of years — we couldn't have this constant pressure on everybody, because people would just crack. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> As individual designers, do you feel that your signature is on that machine? </span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> I think that's true of everybody in the group. Even people who have been with us for only a few months have something in the Lisa that they can look at and say, "That was my idea; that's my code." It's really a group effort. Even marketing got involved in the design effort in various ways, particularly in user-interface issues, product design, packaging, and the style of the manuals. The whole division really got involved. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> When did you decide to incorporate all the fundamental applications into the system software? </span></p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> At the very beginning. Some applications weren't decided until later, but the integration, the way it all fit together, was a goal from the very beginning. </span></p><p><strong>Rosing:</strong><span> As a matter of fact, we cut out a few more things because we just didn't feel we could manage a project that large. Then we added a couple things back in as we became more comfortable with the development cycle. But we've basically been operating on the same goal for the past two years, with very little change of direction. </span></p><p><strong>BYTE:</strong><span> What was the sequence in the early days? Did you decide what the project had to look like to the end user, and then what software was required, and then. . . </span></p><p><strong>Daniels:</strong><span> Then hardware. In fact, we spent the first six months hammering out the user-interface docket. We had that completely specified before we really started the applications. I think the key to success here is to know where you're going before you start.</span></p><p><strong>Tesler:</strong><span> The hardware, the operating system, and the applications were all developed somewhat in parallel, but there was a definite cause and effect. The people who designed the hardware had to make decisions, for example, about whether the disk drive should have a door that you flip open or a button to push, that kind of thing. The designers focused on that aspect of the user interface even before the rest of the user interface. They didn't want the user to be able to accidentally pull out a disk when it was being written on or something. So some decisions were made even before the hardware was designed. There have also been hardware revisions. The first Lisa hardware was here when I came, over two years ago. It's gone through several. . . how many revisions since then? </span></p><p><strong>Rosing:</strong><span> About four. Each one's been an iteration. We discovered a few things in the early hardware that wouldn't work well. We just took them out because we couldn't do them properly. The rest has mostly been a matter of fine-tuning Lisa so that it's very manufacturable and very reliable. </span></p><p>Tesler: Each time they go through a cycle, the people working on user interface get another crack at it — "Since you're going to revise the hardware anyway, why don't you. . . ?" Or the people doing the operating system say, 'The memory-management unit needs to be more general, and since you're redesigning the hardware anyway. . . " So we were able to get in some hardware revisions. Also, that keyboard you saw yesterday is not the final one. After user testing, and because of needing to support the European market, we determined that we really needed a couple more keys on the keyboard, so we made a major change in the keyboard layout. </p><p>Rosing: One of the things about this project that's different is that, more than any other I've been associated with, there's a continuous loop for dealing with user issues. We've gone to the software and that has implied a hardware change. We synthesized a lot of different disciplines. The power-off button used to be a traditional button on the back of the machine, but we didn't want to encourage users to turn off their machines that way because if they left a document open, they would lose it. </p><p>BYTE: Do you expect to find a little initial resistance to the fact that the machine doesn't actually turn off when you push a button? Do you think people are going to say, "Well, I know I can leave it alone now, but I want to make sure it turns off"? </p><p>Rosing: Right. It does feel a little funny at first, but after a few times you begin to have confidence that the thing does turn itself off. </p><p>BYTE: When you finally got the user-interface specified, did you have a brief description of it that everybody knew by heart? </p><p>Daniels: It was about a 35-page document. </p><p>BYTE: Thirty-five pages of specifications? </p><p>Tesler: We have something called the User-Interface Standard, and it consisted of those things which would be common to all applications. Also, the year after that document was published some revisions and some changes were made, and as we built applications we found that they had even more in common than we envisioned. Then we would adopt those things as part of the standard.</p><p>Daniels: Another thing we've done is user tests — taking our ideas and bringing in naive users and sitting them down and seeing what their impressions are. That has caused some changes, and I think that's all shown in the quality. </p><p>BYTE: Where did you get your naive users? </p><p>Tesler: Various places — the bulk of them were new Apple employees. We had a screening process. New Apple employees go through an orientation the first Monday morning they're here. We handed out a questionnaire to the new employees about their previous experience with computers, word processors, video games, and that sort of thing, and then what kind of work they did. Someone in our training department screened all those vitae. I'd go in and say I needed three user test subjects this week who have no word-processing experience but who are secretaries or accounting people to test out our Lisa Calc. She'd go through and pick out some candidates and I'd pick the ones I wanted, based on their experience for whatever test I was trying to run. We had about 50 tests this year in engineering to test out the software. </p><p>BYTE: The fact that you responded to the tests speaks well for the end product. The changes in the keyboard, for instance. How recently did you decide to change the keyboard for the final time? </p><p>Tesler: There were several changes. Those from the user tests had to do with changing the numeric pad so it had the arrow keys on it so you could move around in the Lisa Calc table. Those tests were run around January [1982], I think. </p><p>Rosing: January, and in March we decided to make the change. </p><p>Tesler: That was just key-cap legends that had changed. The other change has to do with the number of keys on the keyboard and was primarily for the benefit of international sales, although it did improve the user interface in terms of the positioning of the Enter key and the Extended Character option key, which gives you extended character sets. Those were all done around the same time. </p><p>Rosing: The interesting thing is that we were at the stage in the program where the decision to make even what sounds like a simple change takes six months to percolate through because it's not a simple engineering change — it's manufacturing, tooling, documentation. </p><p>Daniels: We made one legend change in June or July — the Apple key. When was that? </p><p>Tesler: July, and it's just now showing up. </p><p>BYTE: A legend change? </p><p>Tesler: You saw two keys that said Command on them. The new version has only one, and instead of saying Command it has a picture of an apple on it. The reason is that the key's used as a shortcut to choose a menu command. If you look at a menu, on the right you'll see this little apple symbol and a letter. If you hold down the Apple key and the letter, you get the command. We couldn't find any way to symbolize the Command key that would fit nicely in a menu and be recognizable to people. We tried and tried. Finally we decided that the apple looked nice and had a nice sound to it — "Apple X," "Apple R" — and it keeps Apple in the mind of the user instead of "control" or something else. It's a symbol that everybody using this machine will recognize instantly, so we decided to put it on the key as well as on the screen. To finish the artwork in time to get the machines to test users in time to get responses, and so on, the change had to be in by a certain date. The decision was made only hours before the deadline. </p><p>BYTE: Are there going to be two Command keys without legends on them? </p><p>Tesler: No, only one. We studied IBM and DEC and other keyboards and found that they all have just a single Command or Control key on the left-hand side. We also really wanted to put an Enter key on the main keyboard because we would like to be able to offer a configuration in which an alphabetic keyboard and a numeric keyboard are independent—for, say, a company that does only word processing. Word processors don't need the Clear function, but they do need the Enter function, so we wanted to be able to have the Enter key on the main keyboard; that way, even people without a numeric keypad can hit Enter. Again, on IBM and DEC keyboards the Enter key is standard; on many of those keyboards, that's the standard position for the Enter key. So we decided to be more like other companies. The Enter key also gives us the option of removing the numeric keypad without losing an important function. And then the option keys were put on the side of those, and there we decided we did need two option keys, left and right, because they're used very much like shift keys for typing, and in Europe it would be very important to be able to touch-type foreign alphabets for international correspondence, mathematical symbols, and other special characters. So there were some trade-offs. We didn't want to just keep jamming two of every key on the keyboard, so we decided what the priorities were and ended up being fairly close to the industry standard. We have one Apple key, one Enter key, and two Option keys. </p><p>BYTE: The user-interface design seems to have been difficult. </p><p>Tesler: That was the hard thing that affected the most people. A lot of software and hardware engineering issues were very difficult, but they affected only a few people. Interface issues affected half the division because Training, Publications, Marketing, and the software person implementing the application all had an opinion. People like us who were overviewing all the applications had opinions, in-between managers had opinions, kibitzers on the side had opinions, too. Not everybody can talk about what gate to use in some circuit or what routine to use in some program, but everybody can talk about the user interface. So we had to accommodate all of these things. And it turned out that good ideas and good criticisms came from everywhere. We had to come up with some objective way to decide. That's why we established the methodology which involved user testing. We had a procedure for proposing changes, reviewing the changes, narrowing it down to a few choices, with certain criteria like consistency and parsimony. And then we actually implemented two or three of the various ways and tested them on users, and that's how we made the decisions. Sometimes we found that everybody was wrong. We had a couple of real beauties where the users couldn't use any of the versions that were given to them and they would immediately say, "Why don't you just do it this way?" and that was obviously the way to do it. So sometimes we got the ideas from our user tests, and as soon as we heard the idea we all thought, "Why didn't we think of that?" Then we did it that way. </p><p>BYTE: Bruce, could you say something about the software architecture? </p><p>Daniels: There's an operating system underneath that we built ourselves because we felt that the ones that were out there didn't quite meet our needs. </p><p>BYTE: What does yours do that others don't? </p><p>Daniels: It's not just what it does, but what it doesn't do. Some other operating systems are basically timesharing systems like Unix that have a lot of features that we don't need, and why take up extra space for that? We wanted a system that the user didn't have to be experienced to understand, and it had to be very reliable. It had to maintain the user's data and keep it there. It also had to support things like graphics, the windows that we have on the screen, the mouse, and so forth. We didn't really find an operating system that met our needs, so we felt we had to go build our own. We built the other features on top of this — the support for the windows, the support for graphics, the support for multiple fonts, the support for printing. It's really quite a rich architecture. At least half of the software is in this foundation software. </p><p>BYTE: How large is that in bytes? How much code is in that foundation software? </p><p>Daniels: Well, source code is something like 10 megabytes. </p><p>Tesler: Object code is about half a megabyte. </p><p>BYTE: That's what's there before you put the application programs in — half a megabyte? </p><p>Daniels: Yes. </p><p>BYTE: After you specified the user interface, what list of hardware requirements did you come up with? </p><p>Rosing: Well, the main list that was specifically user interface would be the bit-mapped graphics display and the resolution of approximately 700 pixels across in the horizontal dimension, the mouse, and the doorless disk drives with the eject button rather than an eject handle. They determined a lot of the hardware design. We had other user-interface considerations, though. We wanted to make the system very easy for its users to service — I presume you've seen it break apart. Servicing really is simple. It took a moderate amount of extra product cost to get that feature in there. And that's a part of the even more global user interface, how people perceive the whole system. </p><p>BYTE: Why did you choose the 68000 microprocessor and what alternatives did you consider? </p><p>Daniels: We thought its architecture was very broad and strong and would take us through the '80s, and we wanted that. We wanted something to support the graphics, and we thought that processor gave us what we needed then. The 68000 was a bit of a gamble because it was very young when we got on it. We were getting one sample at a time from the local Motorola engineer here. </p><p>BYTE: Do you think the 68000 will be the dominant processor in the next few years? Is it going to overcome the 8088, the 8086? </p><p>Rosing: I would speculate that for high-end applications with very computer-intensive, graphics-intensive needs, the 68000 will become dominant. </p><p>Daniels: But the 8086 has such an installed base going already, I think that alone would carry it. . . </p><p>Tesler: You mean numbers of actual units with the 68000 in it, or the number of different products? </p><p>BYTE: Both of those questions. </p><p>Tesler: Well, we're putting 68000s in the units well sell, so that will mean more units with 68000s. We expect to sell a lot of machines. </p><p>BYTE: You've got a 68000 machine with a lot of memory in there, and not too much special-purpose hardware. Why did you decide to do it that way instead of using some versatile hardware chips, like the NEC 7220, for video display? </p><p>Daniels: We're very much boosters of bit-mapped graphics, and in fact hardware support for bit-mapped graphics is pretty small. All you need is sort of a shift register. We thought the flexibility that would give us in graphics and the things we could do in user interface with bit-mapped graphics was well worth the price. </p><p>BYTE: But doesn't the 7220 have bitmapped graphics itself? </p><p>Rosing: Well, there were a couple of practical considerations. The NEC 7220 didn't exist when we designed Lisa, although we knew it was planned. The second consideration was that the 7220 cost more than the TTL [transistor-transistor logic] hardware needed to implement the equivalent functions. And the third consideration was this: because we were able to interleave the memory and display cycles, we were able to essentially get data out of the memory at very little penalty. Using a 7220 would actually cost considerably more in terms of system performance. And there was one more consideration: with the 7220, you can't access the display memory bank when the chip is refreshing the CRT, and that limits the time you can access it to about 10 percent of what we have, which would drastically affect performance. We can access memory any time. For equivalent performance, we would have to use two 7220s, and that would push the cost and the "real estate" beyond what we have. </p><p>BYTE: On the other hand, software doesn't get written overnight. . . there's a certain cost to that. You know, this is very software-intensive. </p><p>Rosing: Most of the software that supports the graphics took three years to write, but no hardware in the world can duplicate what that software does. </p><p>BYTE: Really? The software is faster than the hardware? </p><p>Rosing: No, not always faster. </p><p>BYTE: Its functionality is greater? </p><p>Tesler: Yes. The graphics package lets us draw circles, rectangles, ovals, and rectangles with rounded corners. It also automatically handles clipping on nonrectangular boundaries. If you have one object over another, you can draw the one behind without splashing the pixels on top of the one that's in front. That's a . . . </p><p>BYTE: A software revolution? </p><p>Tesler: A very unusual capability, which no one else has in that general form. The other implementations are all either very, very expensive hardware—the $100,000 class — or in software, which isn't really that general and performs much much worse. There's nothing in the same class as our software as far as capability and speed. Of course, there is graphics software that's faster and hardware that's faster, but it doesn't have anywhere near this capability. </p><p>BYTE: Do you have a Xerox Star here that you work with? </p><p>Tesler: No, we didn't have one here We went to the NCC when the Star was announced and looked at it. And in fact it did have an immediate impact. A few months after looking at it we made some changes to our user interface based on ideas that we got from it. For example, the desktop manager we had before was completely different; it didn't use icons at all, and we never liked it very much. We decided to change ours to the icon base. That was probably the only thing we got from the Star, I think. Most of our Xerox inspiration was Smalltalk rather than Star. </p><p>BYTE: What does Lisa have that theStar doesn't have? </p><p>Tesler: We're talking about graphics capability. You originally asked why we didn't use graphics hardware. Our graphics primitives in software are more general than the Star's, so they perform better. We have a faster and more general ability to draw on the screen a picture of multiple graphical objects in different shapes, to have one window that uncovers another, and to repaint just the parts that are uncovered. </p><p>Daniels: Look at the desktop managers of the Star and Lisa. With the Star, you can only put them at fixed places on the screen so you know they don't ever overlap. On ours, you can put them any place you want. It's that generality that allows us to have arbitrarily shaped things and covering each other up and . . . </p><p>BYTE: Documents or forms, shapes, or anything. . . </p><p>Daniels: Yes. </p><p>Tesler: Right. We have curves in it. Everything in the Star, you'll notice, is really rectangular, and our things can have curved edges and that sort of thing. </p><p>BYTE: Another hardware question: How many microprocessors are in the machine, what are they, and what do they do? </p><p>Rosing: Let's see. One to scan the keyboard, in the keyboard housing proper; a second one that receives the keyboard commands and keys up mouse events; the 6504 that controls two floppy disks; a Z8 microprocessor in the hard-disk controller — it's an intelligent controller; and then, of course, the 68000. That's five. </p><p>Tesler: Almost every major chip manufacturer except for one. </p><p>Rosing: And with only one exception all our I/O (input/output) cards have microprocessors. </p><p>BYTE: You say that the magnetic read/write head in the disk drive is microprocessor-controlled in order to let it be more sensitive to variations in the alignment. Is that the 6504? </p><p>Rosing: Yes. </p><p>BYTE: What is the microprocessor that handles the keyboard and the mouse? </p><p>Rosing: That's a National COPS. We tried to pick the processor that we felt was best for each particular job. </p><p>BYTE: The memory is 64K-byte chips? </p><p>Rosing: Yes, 64K chips. </p><p>Tesler: On the memory we have parity and. . . </p><p>BYTE: What part of the memory is video memory? </p><p>Daniels: Some area in the main memory can be the video. </p><p>Tesler: Any area at all. In fact, if you noticed yesterday in the demonstration, when we're developing software, we need debugging information to be displayed for the programmer, but we don't want it to come out on the same screen that the user is seeing, so we had this magic toggle we were hitting that flipped between two screens. There are really two different areas of memory with a bit map in each. The software can switch between the two to display each in turn. </p><p>BYTE: But they're within the main memory? </p><p>Tesler: Yes, absolutely. Anywhere in memory. Take any number of consecutive bytes and say that's the bit map. </p><p>BYTE: Is anything else in main memory, or is the rest of it all available to the user? Is anything else mapped to the memory? </p><p>Tesler: Oh, I see what you're saying—the shared memory. Shared memory with I/O is not main memory. The I/O memory is in the I/O cards. </p><p>Rosing: It's not in the memory, but it's accessed like main memory, from the 68000 bus. </p><p>Tesler: It's in the address space, but it's not in those 64K chips. </p><p>BYTE: A certain address is really an I/O port, is that right? </p><p>Rosing: Yes; it's the top physical address of the 68000. </p><p>BYTE: Did you consider voice as part of the user interface? </p><p>Rosing: Yes. We looked at it pretty hard and at one time in the early system we actually had a CVSD-based voice subsystem in the computer, and we took it out because we didn't feel it achieved the quality we wanted to have associated with this system. </p><p>BYTE: What does CVSD mean? </p><p>Rosing: Continuously Variable Slope Delta modulation. It's much easier to say alphabet soup. We've thought about voice; it's part of our network architecture and will appear in the future, but only when we feel the technology's right so we can be proud of what we offer. </p><p>BYTE: That's both input and output? </p><p>Rosing: Right. We look at voice as being three problems. There's store and forward, which is just moving voice messages around, like a glorified answering machine. Second is text to voice; and third, of course, is voice recognition, or voice to text. The last one's the hardest of all, but we look at voice technology as something we have to approach in a unified way. </p><p>BYTE: What about the programmable serial ports? What chip is used there? </p><p>Rosing: They use the Zilog SIO. That was one of the last major changes we made in the hardware design. We did it because we had two high-speed ports with less board space, and the Zilog SIO chip supports asynchronous as well as byte-sync and bit-sync protocols. We felt that made a heck of a lot more sense for the customer as the world evolves toward X25-type packet transmission. We didn't want to make the customer buy an I/O card to upgrade from async to bit-sync. We have only three I/O slots, so we're careful not to waste them on things we can put in the main machine. </p><p>BYTE: Both serial ports can be bisynchronous? </p><p>Rosing: Yes; they can be programmed any way. </p><p>BYTE: And can this SIO function as a UART? </p><p>Rosing: Yes. A UART/USART combination. </p><p>BYTE: When did you know that you were going to have half a megabyte as standard memory? When did you know how much you were going to need? </p><p>Daniels: It's always been a backward sort of thing. We had the capability for a full megabyte in the machine, and it was more a case of how much memory we needed to achieve our goal. </p><p>Tesler: The sales force wanted it to be 128K; the programmers wanted a megabyte. We negotiated. </p><p>Rosing: Since we were writing the code we got the megabyte. </p><p>Tesler: So the hardware people made it as big as they could in the address space, and then after some testing of the system we determined that half a megabyte was a reasonable compromise of cost and performance. </p><p>BYTE: Do you expect the standard memory on other manufacturers' machines to jump dramatically after the appearance of Lisa? </p><p>Tesler: Well, apart from its impact on cost, I don't think the amount of memory is a critical factor in deciding what machine you want to buy. If you're an end user, you should be buying a machine based on what it does for you, how easy it is for you to learn, how easy it is to use. Whether it has 12 bytes or it has 12 megabytes doesn't really matter to the end user, which is our marketplace. We're not selling the machine primarily to programmers who might care about that. End users have no idea which systems have more memory or less memory or one megabyte or one hundred thousand bytes. If other manufacturers are trying to match Apple, they should try to match us on ease of use and functionality and things like that. If they can do it in a small amount of memory, more power to them. </p><p>BYTE: Doesn't it matter when you're doing something like dictionary software or when you want to read a dictionary into memory fast and proofread a document very fast? </p><p>Tesler: Yes, there are certain functions where it definitely makes a difference. We have that in our Lisa Calc. In order to do rapid recalculation, the whole matrix really should be in resident memory, so we spent a lot of time coming up with a data structure that packed that data as tight as possible so that it would get as many cells as possible into memory, no matter what size memory there was. </p><p>BYTE: Your version of BASIC will use more than 64K? </p><p>Daniels: Oh, yes. We could have put less memory in it, but the performance would have been unacceptable. Unfortunately, some companies advertise machines that have less memory than anyone would ever reasonably buy. We haven't tried to do that here. </p><p>BYTE: You didn't use less memory and fewer disk drives than would really be effective, and so on? </p><p>Daniels: Yes, and I think when you look at the typical configurations that people buy of other machines, the cost is really not that different from the kind of costs we're talking about for Lisa. If the other machines get loaded up with disks and memory and the other kinds of things you want to run, then their prices will be comparable. </p><p>BYTE: When you decided you had to have hard-copy graphic output that accurately represented the quality of the screen graphics, what choices did you consider before you did this amazing adaptation of a $600-5700 printer? </p><p>Rosing: A wide range of options were being discussed, all the way from thermal printers to laser printers. We tried to identify what's critical in the marketplace. We thought there were two printers of first priority: a personal printer and one with letter quality. At the same time our sister division, the Apple II— III division, was evaluating the same two sets of printers. So we teamed up and did a survey of virtually all the printers that were available from every manufacturer who would have the volume capability to serve our needs. We did an extensive test and put about eight dot-matrix printers through their paces with really tough software. Quite a few of them just fell right off the table — it was clear that the quality wasn't there. Certain vendors were also much more responsive to fixing problems. So it really boiled down to two printers. Then, as we developed our printer software, the one we're using now — the C. Itoh — just far and away stood out as having the best mechanical design. You could put the dots where you wanted them repeatedly, and that's what we needed more than anything else in the world — good mechanical design. </p><p>Rosing: And a good price. Same for the letter-quality printer. </p><p>BYTE: The printer you are using is from C. Itoh, but it's your own ROM and your own systems software that drives the printer through the ROM. </p><p>Rosing: Correct. </p><p>BYTE: What else can you tell us about the printer, especially the dot-matrix? </p><p>Daniels: Mechanically it's just a raster device. </p><p>Tesler: A character generator is built into it; it has some capabilities. It has a single type style that can be stretched horizontally and vertically as it's printed, and it has what they call a graphics mode. They thought that would be used lightly, but it's what we use almost exclusively. And even within the graphics mode, there are two resolutions, low and high. High resolution is a lot slower. We wanted to offer the user all these choices. </p><p>BYTE: So this is a custom design for you. . . custom changes? </p><p>Tesler: Custom changes I would say, yes. </p><p>BYTE: Did you say it sometimes prints out in character mode? I thought all of its printing when you were controlling it was using the highest resolution. </p><p>Daniels: I think all the stuff you saw was done at high resolution. </p><p>BYTE: For speed you can go to a different mode? </p><p>Tesler: Yes; we're planning to offer the customer a way to get a quick draft using the character generator. Characters won't look quite the way they will in the final version, but you can get output in a hurry. </p><p>Rosing: The printer will have three different speeds and three different quality levels. </p><p>BYTE: Do you have an idea where you're going next? </p><p>Rosing: We have what feels like ten years' worth of backlog. We have a pretty good idea what we're going to do for the next few years. </p><p>BYTE: What's that? </p><p>Rosing: The thrust is to expand the level of integration within the applications and to add facilities to make it easier for more applications to be written outside of Apple. </p><p>BYTE: Those facilities are the development toolkit? </p><p>Rosing: Yes. The development toolkit is a key thing. And for a large part of the marketplace, adding network applications and data communications is very important. Last but not least is adding really serious database functionality to the system. If you add all that up, it's as big a task or bigger than what we've just done. </p><p>Daniels: In fact, almost as important as the team building that we've gone through is building up this foundation that we've used to create the six applications we've now built. The foundation is an amazing application machine. We and others outside Apple can build applications that are just amazing now, because no one has to rebuild the foundation. It's already there, in place, and we really hope to leverage off that in the future.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://computeradsfromthepast.substack.com/p/byte-interviews-the-apple-lisa-dev?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://computeradsfromthepast.substack.com/p/byte-interviews-the-apple-lisa-dev?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://computeradsfromthepast.substack.com/p/byte-interviews-the-apple-lisa-dev/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://computeradsfromthepast.substack.com/p/byte-interviews-the-apple-lisa-dev/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/johnpaulw" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png" width="260" height="40.7183908045977" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:218,&quot;width&quot;:1392,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:260,&quot;bytes&quot;:22323,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://ko-fi.com/johnpaulw&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9b9377ef-eba8-4fce-91f2-b71656204cb3_1392x218.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>What computer ads would you like to see in the future?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Landlords and property managers can’t collude on rental pricing. Using new technology to do it doesn’t change that antitrust fundamental. Regardless of the industry you’re in, if your business uses an algorithm to determine prices, a brief filed by the FTC and the Department of Justice offers a helpful guideline for antitrust compliance: your algorithm can’t do anything that would be illegal if done by a real person.</p><p>Today, the FTC and Department of Justice took action to fight algorithmic collusion in the residential housing market. The agencies filed a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/YardiSOI-filed%28withattachments%29_0.pdf">joint legal brief</a> explaining that price fixing through an algorithm is still price fixing. The brief highlights key aspects of competition law important for businesses in every industry: (1) you can’t use an algorithm to evade the law banning price-fixing agreements, and (2) an agreement to use shared pricing recommendations, lists, calculations, or algorithms can still be unlawful even where co-conspirators retain some pricing discretion or cheat on the agreement.</p><p>The agencies’ work in this space is especially important given rising residential housing rental prices. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUUR0000SEHA">Rent is up</a> nearly 20% since 2020, with the largest increases&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2024.pdf">concentrated</a> on lower- and middle-tier apartments rented by lower-income consumers. About&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2024.pdf">half</a> of renters now pay more than 30% of their income in rent and utilities, and rising shelter costs were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-more-than-expected-january-2024-02-13/">responsible</a> for over two-thirds of January inflation.</p><p>Meanwhile, landlords increasingly use algorithms to determine their prices, with landlords reportedly using software like “RENTMaximizer” and similar products to determine rents for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent">tens of millions</a> of apartments across the country. Efforts to fight collusion are even more critical given&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/when-private-equity-becomes-your-landlord">private equity-backed consolidation</a> among landlords and property management companies. The considerable leverage these firms already have over their renters is only exacerbated by potential algorithmic price collusion. Algorithms that recommend prices to numerous competing landlords threaten to remove renters’ ability to vote with their feet and comparison-shop for the best apartment deal around.</p><p>What’s the message for other businesses?</p><p><strong>Agreeing to use an algorithm is an agreement</strong>. In algorithmic collusion, a pricing algorithm combines competitor data and spits out the suggested “maximized” rent for a unit given local conditions. Such software can allow landlords to collude on pricing by using an algorithm—something the law doesn’t allow IRL. When you replace once-independent pricing decisions with a shared algorithm, expect trouble. Competitors using a shared human agent to fix prices? Illegal. Doing the same thing but with an agreed upon, shared algorithm? Still illegal. It’s also irrelevant that the algorithm maker isn’t a direct competitor if you and your competitors each agree to use their product knowing the others are doing the same in concert.</p><p><strong>Price deviations don’t immunize conspirators</strong>. Some things in life might require perfection, but price-fixing arrangements aren’t one of them. Just because a software recommends rather than determines a price doesn’t mean it’s legal. Setting initial starting prices or recommending initial starting prices can be illegal, even if conspirators deviate from recommended prices. And even if some of the conspirators cheat by starting with lower prices than those the algorithm recommended, that doesn’t necessarily change things. Being bad at breaking the law isn’t a defense.</p><p>The housing industry isn’t alone in using potentially illegal collusive algorithms. The Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/online-retailer-pleads-guilty-fixing-prices-wall-posters">previously secured a guilty plea</a> related to the use of pricing algorithms to fix prices in online resales, and has an ongoing case against sharing of price-related and other sensitive information among&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-agri-stats-operating-extensive-information-exchanges-among-meat">meat processing</a> competitors. Other private cases have been recently brought against&nbsp;<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costar-faces-lawsuit-alleging-helped-214208313.html">hotels</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/las-vegas-hotels-accused-rental-price-conspiracy-class-action-2023-01-26/">casinos</a>.</p><p>Technology is a promise. Used correctly, it can make our lives healthier, safer, and more efficient. But its efficiency can also be used by bad actors to crush competition or bilk consumers in novel ways. No matter the tool law violators use, the FTC and the Department of Justice stand vigilant on the side of consumers and competition.</p><p><em>Hannah Garden-Monheit is Director of the FTC’s Office of Policy Planning and Ken Merber is Deputy Assistant Director of the FTC’s Anticompetitive Practices II Division.&nbsp;</em><br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

His desire to understand how the world works led him to the rapidly developing field of microchips.</p><p>“There are still a lot of mysteries,” says Cao, whose work on chip performance continues to push the limits of physics. “It’s getting harder, but it doesn’t mean we are going to stop.”</p><p>Only three companies in the world — Intel, Samsung and TSMC — are capable of mass producing chips powerful and small enough for today’s advanced mobile technologies.</p><p>With parts of transistors reaching atomic levels of scale, engineers are having to come up with increasingly innovative ways of ensuring progress, such as vertical, tower-like construction and rethinking the way chips are packaged. Many believe bundling together chips with different functions is where future semiconductor battle lines will be drawn.</p><p>Some of the newest smartphone chips, such as those in the iPhone 15 Pro, are manufactured with what is called a “3 nanometre” process — a name given to a generation of processors with the smallest transistors. Although this no longer references their physical dimensions, it does allude to the shrinking scale of their components. These tiny switches, which control the flow of electrical signals inside every digital device, are the workhorses of microprocessors and the basic building blocks of modern electronics.</p></div><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><p>Driven by demand for increased computing power, the scaling of chips over time has for decades followed Moore’s Law, the observation by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double every two years. But progress has slowed, with doubling now closer to every three years.</p><p>The current 3nm process has suffered from poor yield rates — the proportion of chips produced that can be sold to customers — and only marginal improvements in efficiency.</p></div><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><p>But far from being at the end of the transistor innovation journey, Intel’s Ben Sell, vice-president of technology development, suggests we are right “in the middle” of it. What is particularly exciting, he says, is that chip innovations discussed “for decades” are now being seen in devices on the market.</p><p>But success is not guaranteed — and the stakes are high. Global chip sales <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e9be182f-ec9e-4426-9cd2-d5181fd64778" target="_blank">hit well over $500bn last year</a> and semiconductors could become a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/semiconductors/our-insights/the-semiconductor-decade-a-trillion-dollar-industry" target="_blank">trillion-dollar industry</a> by the end of this decade, according to consultants McKinsey.</p><p>“That’s like getting to GDP scales of things that the companies are competing over,” says Jeff Koch, analyst at SemiAnalysis, an independent research company specialising in semiconductors and AI.</p><p>The technological reputation and financial standing of companies and governments depends on the right bets being made.</p><p>TSMC, with its market capitalisation of $575bn, dominates Taiwan’s economy and the global market for the world’s very smallest cutting-edge chips.</p><p>That is something the Biden administration hopes to change with its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d1e5bb5d-da09-488b-8430-a05d8016a95f" target="_blank">Chips Act</a>, pledging $52bn of incentives to encourage companies to base fabrication plants on US soil. But many experts believe the erosion of US chip manufacturing over a number of decades has made it hard for the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f108567d-4e8f-4561-9486-d80bb164812a" target="_blank">country to regain global competitiveness</a>.</p><p>China is also entering the race, with the country’s biggest chipmaker SMIC expected to make next-generation smartphone processors <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5e0dba3-689f-4d0e-88f6-673ff4452977" target="_blank">as early as this year</a> — despite US efforts to restrict Beijing’s chip advances through export restrictions on specialist equipment.</p><p>Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are also <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/01/31/could-amd-break-nvidias-chokehold-on-chips" target="_blank">battling for technical supremacy and market share in the field of AI chips</a>, given the soaring demand for the processors that power OpenAI’s ChatGPT and similar apps.</p><p>AMD revealed a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa0c97af-c20f-461e-96c9-f2357496c599" target="_blank">raft of technical advances in December</a>, including packing 153bn transistors and 192 gigabytes of memory into its new MI300 chip, in a bid to take on the world’s most valuable chip company, Nvidia. Last week, Nvidia’s market value soared to $2tn, leapfrogging Amazon and Alphabet to become the third most valuable US-listed company, behind Microsoft and Apple.</p><p>AMD, meanwhile, brought in revenues of $23bn in 2023 and expects to sell $3.5bn-worth of its latest chips this year. It is the second-most-valuable semiconductor company in the US — overtaking Intel in 2022. Intel is also bidding for a place in the AI landscape, announcing it will be building Microsoft’s high-end chips.</p><h2>Chip construction</h2><p>A diminishing number of companies have been able to keep pace in the race to build the most advanced smartphone chips in recent years. The design and manufacturing processes have become extremely long, complex and costly, requiring ever more specialist equipment and knowledge.</p></div><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><p>Advances take years of experimentation and require staggering levels of R&amp;D spending.</p><p>Working at nanoscale is also full of jeopardy. Precision, repeatability and cleanliness are some of the biggest challenges, says Sell, explaining that any particle, even those smaller than a bacterium, could “kill” a chip on contact.</p></div><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><p>Inside chip fabrication plants, more than a thousand precisely controlled steps create each integrated circuit, layer by layer. Every time a new generation of chips is developed, these stages all need to be reviewed, says Chris Auth, director of advanced transistor development at Intel. “You have to be pretty fearless about trying new things and saying, ‘Hey, let’s just see what happens’,” he adds.</p><p>A new chip generation also requires new tools and processes, says TSMC’s Cao. The transistor advances in the next 2nm chips mean some elements need to be built laterally, rather than vertically, bringing extra challenges, he adds.</p><p>“There are a lot of things happening in the same node [generation], even though we give them just a simple number, like 2nm.”</p><p>But before any of these complex steps of fabrication begin, the base of the chip is still made with a simple, common substance called silicon, extracted from sand or quartz.</p></div><div aria-label="A graphic with 8 sections showing the chip manufacturing process, from silicon purification to wiring"><div><ol><li><figure><picture><source media="screen and (max-width: 490px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=640 640w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1080 1080w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1520 1520w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1960 1960w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-s-ingots.cd85c369.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 740px) 25vw, 50vw"><source media="screen and (min-width: 980px)" srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=640 640w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1080 1080w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1520 1520w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1960 1960w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 740px) 25vw, 50vw"><img srcset="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=640 640w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1080 1080w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1520 1520w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=1960 1960w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fmicrochips%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2F01-ingots.1de0937f.png?source=ig&amp;quality=highest&amp;width=2400 2400w" src="https://ig.ft.com/microchips/assets/static/01-ingots.1de0937f.png" alt="" sizes="(min-width: 740px) 25vw, 50vw"></picture></figure><p><span>1</span>Silicon is extracted from sand and purified.

The machines are the size of a bus, but so accurate they could direct a laser to hit a golf ball as far away as the Moon.</p><p>Every stage of this process requires “PhD thesis level of knowledge”, says Koch.</p><p>A wafer full of chips can be worth thousands of pounds when it leaves a top fabrication plant.</p><h2>Rethinking power and packaging</h2><p>While leading manufacturers are hoping the 2nm chip will solve many of the 3nm generation’s problems, the limits of scaling mean engineers are already developing alternative ways of getting more power and efficiency out of the same space.</p><p>Building on current 3D designs, engineers plan to stack transistors on top of each other, rather than cramming them in side-by-side.</p><p>“You’re really starting to expand that third dimension, which is something that hasn’t been used in the first 60 years of transistor technology,” says Intel’s Auth. “[When] you build skyscrapers, you start to run out of the ability to shrink things laterally, so you start to build up and that’s what we’re doing.”</p><p>The way chips are packaged is also going upwards. The growing field of “advanced packaging” — how chips are bundled together to boost capability as well as reduce cost — is moving towards stacking chips to improve performance and better use available space.</p><p>This pivot to vertical design and development is “kind of a big deal”, says Koch of SemiAnalysis, because it is the first time the industry has acknowledged that it’s running out of horizontal options. “We’re slowing down in one direction, but speeding up in another,” he says.</p><p>Cao says advanced packaging is where major progress can be made — a field in which TSMC is heavily invested. “There are a lot of different configurations that can be used . . .  a lot of things are happening in this field.”</p><p>Packaging developments have paved the way for another shift in semiconductor architecture: “chiplets”.</p><p>Engineers are moving away from building an entire microprocessor on a single piece of silicon — the monolithic “system on a chip” — and towards multi-chip modules (MCMs). These MCMs see groups of chips with different functions built on separate pieces of silicon and then bundled together to work like a single electronic brain.</p></div><div data-o-grid-colspan="12 S11 Scenter M9 L8 XL7"><p>Many believe chiplet manufacturing is the only way to keep Moore’s Law alive in the longer term. Intel, AMD and Apple have already launched products, while others, like Nvidia, have indicated they have them in development. AMD’s latest MI300 employs modular architecture.</p><p>The companies investing in MCMs say one of their key advantages is flexibility —&nbsp;they can be adapted for different customers because makers can swap in chiplets depending on requirements. They also offer manufacturers the option of mixing older and newer designs and upgrading elements incrementally, rather than overhauling a chip’s entire system at once.</p><p>This means companies can “react quickly”,  says Auth. “If the market wants more of one thing or another, you don’t necessarily have to change the GPU [graphics processing unit] or the CPU [central processing unit], you can just change one component.”</p><p>This can lead to improved performance overall, he says, because you can “pick and choose what provides the best outcome for the end customer”.</p><p>One of the things that has been holding back the wider adoption of chiplets is the lack of standard rules for interfaces, which means it is not yet possible to mix and match products from manufacturers. But this remains the long-term goal for many companies, including TSMC, Intel, Samsung, AMD and Google, who have formed a consortium in the hope of doing so.</p><p>A number of chipmakers are hoping further performance gains can be made through a major rethink of how chips get their power.</p><p>Upcoming 2nm designs include separating the metal wiring that joins a chip’s elements from those that bring in power — something never done before. Power wires will move from the top (front), to the bottom (back side) of the chip, sitting below the transistor layer, rather than above. The interconnects will stay put. Early tests show this direct route for power and reduced tangle of wires results in greater efficiency.</p></div><div aria-label="A graphic showing the major differences between traditional and new,
