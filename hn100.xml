					<h3>The Rise of Batteries in Six Charts and Not Too Many Numbers</h3>
					<h6>The unstoppable rise of batteries is leading to a domino effect that puts half of global fossil fuel demand at risk.</h6>
					
											<p>Battery demand is growing exponentially, driven by a domino effect of adoption that cascades from country to country and from sector to sector. This battery domino effect is set to enable the rapid phaseout of half of global fossil fuel demand and be instrumental in abating transport and power emissions. This is the conclusion of RMI’s recently published report <em><a href="https://rmi.org/insight/x-change-batteries/">X-Change: Batteries</a></em>. In this article, we highlight six of the key messages from the report.</p>
<h5>1. Battery sales are growing exponentially up S-curves</h5>
<p>Battery sales are growing exponentially up classic <a href="https://rmi.org/insight/harnessing-the-power-of-s-curves/">S-curves</a> that characterize the growth of disruptive new technologies. For thirty years, sales have been doubling every two to three years, enjoying a 33 percent average growth rate. In the past decade, as electric cars have taken off, it has been closer to 40 percent.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 1: Global battery sales by sector, GWh/y</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://rockymntstage.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/slide-1-battery-charts.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://rockymntstage.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/slide-1-battery-charts-1024x576.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></a><br>

<h5>2. Battery costs keep falling while quality rises</h5>
<p>As volumes increased, battery costs plummeted and energy density — a key metric of a battery’s quality — rose steadily. Over the past 30 years, battery costs have fallen by a dramatic 99 percent; meanwhile, the density of top-tier cells has risen fivefold. As is the case for many modular technologies, the more batteries we deploy, the cheaper they get, which in turn fuels more deployment. For every doubling of deployment, battery costs have fallen by 19 percent. Couple these cost declines with density gains of 7 percent for every deployment doubling and batteries are the fastest-improving clean energy technology.</p>

<h5>3. Creating a battery domino effect</h5>
<p>As battery costs fall and energy density improves, one application after another opens up. We call this the battery domino effect: the act of one market going battery-electric brings the scale and technological improvements to tip the next. Battery technology first tipped in consumer electronics, then two- and three-wheelers and cars. Now trucks and battery storage are set to follow. By 2030, batteries will likely be taking market share in shipping and aviation too.</p>

Trains, ships, and airplane total addressable market sizes illustrative.</small></p>
<h5>4. Incumbent modelers remain behind the curve</h5>
<p>How fast will batteries continue to grow and improve? The answer is a lot faster than today’s consensus view. When it comes to the growth of small modular technologies, there are two rules of thumb: the first is that superior technologies undergoing rapid cost decline tend to grow exponentially; the second is that most analysts miss the first. Batteries have been no exception to this rule, having been consistently underestimated by modelers.</p>
<p>Over the past years, many battery forecasts have effectively projected linear growth. As Exhibit 4 illustrates, actual sales keep outrunning such forecasts and as a result analysts keep revising their projections upward. The caution of such linear thinking may, on the surface, seem reasonable, but in reality, it is simply wrong.</p>

<p><small>Source: IEA <em>Global EV Outlook </em>(2018-2023) current policy scenarios and actuals; BNEF <em>Long-Term Electric Vehicle Outlook</em> (2023) for 2023 estimate.</small></p>
<h5>5. The drivers of change will strengthen</h5>
<p>If we look forward to the next seven years, we see the drivers of change strengthening. Notably, we see costs continuing to fall, policy support continuing to rise, and competition between economic blocs continuing to drive a race to the top. And while there are barriers to battery adoption on the horizon, humanity’s wit, will, and capital are scaling proportionally faster. Thus, we do not see a scenario of slow adoption as credible; instead, we model two futures: fast or faster. Reality is likely to lie somewhere between the two.</p>
<p>RMI forecasts that in 2030, top-tier density will be between 600 and 800 Wh/kg, costs will fall to $32–$54 per kWh, and battery sales will rise to between 5.5–8 TWh per year. To get a sense of this speed of change, the lower-bound (or the “fast” scenario) is running in line with BNEF’s Net Zero scenario. The faster S-curve scenario exceeds it.</p>

<h5>6. Enabling the phase-out of fossil fuels</h5>
<p>The best strategy to rapidly phase out fossil fuels is to accelerate the deployment of technologies that reduce fossil fuel <em>demand</em>. Batteries are on the path to displace 86 exajoules (EJ) of fossil fuels from road transport (emitting 6 GtCO<sub>2 </sub>per year) and to put at risk another 23 EJ (or 1.6 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y) from shipping and aviation. In the electricity sector, as batteries synchronize the natural rhythms of the sun and the wind with the timing of electricity demand, they help enable the reduction of a further 175 EJ of fossil fuel demand (or almost 15 GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 6: CO<sub>2</sub> emissions abatement enabled by batteries, GtCO<sub>2</sub>/y abatement versus emissions today</strong></p>

<p><small>Source: IEA NZE scenario (other transport); RMI analysis (power and road transport)</small></p>
<p>Batteries are growing fast, but that’s no reason to rest on our laurels. Continued growth will require continued effort. Batteries got this far through tireless, concerted efforts of companies, governments, researchers, and climate advocates. And whether the motivation is lower prices, geopolitical advantage, or climate, it is essential to make this fast transition faster.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Google Pixel 7" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/01/24/google-pixel-7.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Google Pixel smartphone&nbsp;owners report problems after installing the January 2024 Google Play system update, being unable to access their devices internal storage, open the camera, take screenshots, or even open apps.</p>
<p>The issue is being&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/19c14at/upixelcommunity_please_help_internal_storage/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;by owners of numerous Pixel models, including the Google Pixel 5, 6, 6a, 7, 7a, 8, and 8 Pro, suggesting that it isn't confined to a particular hardware architecture.</p>
<p>The root cause is unknown but is likely a software issue with the January 2024 Play system update that Google hasn't pinpointed or fixed yet.</p>
<p>Most proposed solutions coming from affected users don't address the problem, with some reporting solving it by performing a factory reset, in which case, all data is lost.</p>
<p>However, these recommendations are coming from impacted Google Pixel owners rather than Google themselves, who&nbsp;<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/19c14at/comment/kj83bb0/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">simply acknowledged</a>&nbsp;they are aware of and looking into the issue.</p>
<p>"I wonder why this is not something that's getting blown up forcing Google for a fix. Spending so much money on a phone just to be made unusable by an update is very aggravating,"&nbsp;<a href="http://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/254021673?hl=en&amp;msgid=254925930" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an affected owner posted</a>&nbsp;in Google's Pixel Phone support forums.</p>
<p>Google Play system updates are separate from the monthly security patches, both accessible via Settings &gt; Security &amp; privacy &gt; System &amp; updates.</p>
<p><img alt="Update menu" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Android/play-update.png" width="360"></p>
<p>Google introduced Play system updates in Android 10 as a way to deliver crucial security updates and system component enhancements and protections in devices not running the latest patch level and those that have reached the end of support by the OEM.</p>
<p>They are served directly by Google, bypassing the OEM update channels, and are effective in keeping older Android versions compatible with modern apps and Google services, and also relatively safe.</p>
<p>In the case of Pixels, it appears that Google performed a staged roll-out of the January 2024 Play system updates, so not every Pixel owner has received the problematic update yet.</p>
<p>If you are still on an older update (last was November 1, 2023), it is recommended to stay on it and postpone applying the January 2024 update until the situation clears up.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Google for a comment on the reported problems and their plans to address them, and a member of the firm's press team has sent us the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are aware of this issue, and are looking into it. - Google</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Same thing happened a few months back</h2>
<p>Although the nature of the current problem has not been confirmed yet, memory bugs introduced by a Play system update previously rendered Pixel devices completely unusable in October 2023.</p>
<p>Google eventually&nbsp;<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/241474288/issues-accessing-storage-after-updating-to-android-14?hl=en&amp;sjid=15384693003212063525-EU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">addressed</a>&nbsp;the media storage access and repeated rebooting problems by releasing an update on November 7, 2023. However, by then, many users had already resorted to performing a factory reset, losing their data as a result.</p>
<p>The recurrence of this type of issue in such a short timeframe is quite concerning for Pixel device users, who cannot use the features of their phones.</p>
<p>The situation undermines the trust in Google's quality assurance processes and raises concerns about the rigor of the tech giant's validation and testing protocols before deploying a system update.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="what">What</h2><p>Late last year, I had an idea that’s been steadily brewing in my head. I’ve found myself with some free time recently (it coincided with vacation, go figure), and I’ve hacked together some proof-of-concept code. Whether or not it is actually proving the concept I’m not sure, but the results are somewhat interesting, and I believe the idea is novel (I haven’t found any other implementation in the wild). So it’s at least worthy of a blog post.</p><p>I wrote <code>cssfact</code>, a lossy CSS compressor. That is, a program that takes some CSS and outputs back some other CSS that hopefully retains some (most) of the information in the input, but contains fewer rules than the original. Exactly how many rules it produces is configurable, and the loss depends on that number.</p><p>The program only works on style rules (which make up the majority of a typical CSS). It leaves the non-style rules unchanged.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/nathell/cssfact">Here’s the source</a>. It’s not exactly straightforward to get it running, but it shouldn’t be very hard, either. It’s very simple – the program itself doesn’t contain any fancy logic; the actual decisions on what the output will contain are made by an external program.</p><p>If you just want to see some results, here is a sample with <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/">my homepage</a> serving as a patient etherized upon a table. Its CSS is quite small – 55 style rules that cssfact can work on – and here’s how the page looks with various settings:</p><ul><li><span>Original: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp.css">CSS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nathell/nhp/blob/master/src/sass/nhp.sass">source SASS</a></span></li><li><span>1 style rule: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index1.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp1.css">CSS</a> (93% information loss)</span></li><li><span>5 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index5.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp5.css">CSS</a> (74% information loss)</span></li><li><span>10 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index10.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp10.css">CSS</a> (55% information loss)</span></li><li><span>20 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index20.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp20.css">CSS</a> (31% information loss)</span></li><li><span>30 style rules: <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/index30.html">page</a>, <a href="https://danieljanus.pl/css/nhp30.css">CSS</a> (17% information loss)</span></li></ul><p>My homepage and both of my blogs all use the same CSS, so you can try to replace the CSS in your browser’s devtools elsewhere on the site and see how it looks.</p><h2 id="how">How</h2><p>Three words: <a href="https://cs.uef.fi/~pauli/bmf_tutorial/material.html">binary matrix factorization</a> (BMF, in the Boolean algebra).</p><p>I guess I could just stop here, but I’ll elaborate just in case it isn’t clear.</p><p>Consider a simple CSS snippet:</p><pre><code><span>h1</span>, <span>h2</span> {
   <span>padding</span>: <span>0</span>;
   <span>margin-bottom</span>: <span>0.5em</span>;
}

<span>h1</span> {
   <span>font-size</span>: <span>32px</span>;
   <span>font-weight</span>: bold;
}

<span>h2</span> {
   <span>font-size</span>: <span>24px</span>;
   <span>font-weight</span>: bold;
}
</code></pre><p>The first rule tells you that for all elements that match either the <code>h1</code> or <code>h2</code> selectors, the two declarations should apply.</p><p>You could visualize this CSS as a 5x2 binary matrix <i>A<sup>T</sup></i> where the <em>n</em> columns correspond to simple selectors (i.e., without commas in them) and the <em>m</em> rows correspond to declarations:</p>
<table>
        <tbody><tr><th></th><th><code>h1</code></th><th><code>h2</code></th></tr>
        <tr><th><code>padding: 0</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>margin-bottom: 0.5em</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-size: 32px</code></th><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-size: 24px</code></th><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
        <tr><th><code>font-weight: bold</code></th><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>You could also transpose the matrix, yielding <em>A</em> with <em>m</em> rows denoting selectors and <em>n</em> columns denoting declarations. For my homepage’s CSS, <em>m</em> = 60 and <em>n</em> = 81; for bigger stylesheets, several thousand in either direction is not uncommon.</p><p>Now, linear algebra gives us algorithms to find a matrix <em>A′ ≈ A</em> such that there exists a decomposition <em>A′ = B × C</em>, where <em>B</em> has dimensions <em>m × r</em>, <em>C</em> has dimensions <em>r × n</em>, and <em>r</em> is small – typically much smaller than <em>m</em> or <em>n</em>. So this is a way of dimensionality reduction.</p><p>In the usual algebra of real numbers, there’s no guarantee that <em>B</em> or <em>C</em> will themselves be binary matrices – in fact, most likely they won’t. But if we operate in Boolean algebra instead (i.e. one where 1 + 1 = 1), then both <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> will be binary. The flip side is that the Boolean BMF problem is NP-hard, so the algorithms found in the wild perform approximate decompositions, not guaranteed to be optimal.</p><p>But that’s okay, because lossiness is inherent in what we’re doing anyway, and it turns the binary matrices <em>B</em> and <em>C</em> are readily interpretable. Look again at the CSS matrix above: why is there a 1 in the top-left cell? Because at least one of the CSS rules stipulates the declaration <code>padding: 0</code> for the selector <code>h1</code>.</p><p>This is exactly the definition of matrix multiplication in the Boolean algebra. The matrix <em>A′</em> will have a 1 at coordinates [<em>i, j</em>] iff there is at least one <em>k</em> ∈ {1, …, <em>r</em>} such that <em>B</em>[<em>i</em>, <em>k</em>] = 1 and <em>C</em>[<em>k</em>, <em>j</em>] = 1. So the columns of <em>B</em> and rows of <em>C</em> actually correspond to CSS rules! Every time you write CSS, you’re actually writing out binary matrices – and the browser is multiplying them to get at the actual behaviour.</p><p>Well, not really, but it’s one way to think about it. It’s not perfect – it completely glosses over rules overlapping each other and having precedence, and treats them as equally important – but it somewhat works!</p><p>You could plug in any BMF algorithm to this approach. For cssfact, I’ve picked the code by <a href="https://github.com/IBM/binary-matrix-factorization/">Barahona and Goncalves 2019</a> – sadly, I wasn’t able to find the actual paper – not because it performs spectacularly well (it’s actually dog-slow on larger stylesheets), but because I was easily able to make it work and interface with it.</p><h2 id="why">Why</h2><p>Why not?</p><p>The sheer joy of exploration is reason enough, but I believe there are potential practical applications. CSS codebases have the tendency to grow organically and eventually start collapsing under their own weight, and they have to be maintained very thoughtfully to prevent that. In many CSS monstrosities found in the wild, there are much cleaner, leaner, essence-capturing cores struggling to get out.</p><p>This tool probably won’t automatically extract them for you – so don’t put it in your CI pipeline – but by perusing the CSS that it produces and cross-checking it with the input, you could encounter hints on what redundancy there is in your styles. Things like “these components are actually very similar, so maybe should be united” may become more apparent.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/pull/577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WASI Preview 2 officially launched!</a> After a vote in the WASI Subgroup of the W3C WebAssembly Community Group, the standard set of interfaces included in the launch of Preview 2, aka WASI 0.2.0, is ready for use by library implementers. We've been closely tracking the different release candidates of WASI 0.2.0 over the last 6 months, and wasmCloud will update its runtime WIT definitions to the pinned versions in just a few days.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>If you look in our <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/docs/tour/hello-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickstart</a> now you'll notice that we now provide documentation for building WebAssembly components, starting with Rust and TinyGo. As seen in previous <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community calls</a>, JavaScript and Python are also supported thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentizejs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ComponentizeJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">componentize-py</a> projects. I worked on getting examples up-and-running for components, and there are upsides and downsides to the initial approach we're taking. This post will focus on what current component support looks like and what WASI 0.2.0 means for wasmCloud.</p>
<h2 id="the-hello-world-of-wasi">The Hello World of WASI<!-- -->:HTTP<a href="#the-hello-world-of-wasi" aria-label="Direct link to the-hello-world-of-wasi" title="Direct link to the-hello-world-of-wasi">​</a></h2>
<p>A WebAssembly component is a reactive unit of compute that has to be loaded, instantiated, and then a function that the component <strong>export</strong>s needs to be <strong>import</strong>ed by the host runtime. Like so many applications, the entrypoint for many of our examples is an HTTP endpoint as it provides a common abstraction that's easy to work with and test using <code>curl</code> on the CLI.</p>
<p>The simplest “hello world” example looks like this using the <code>wasi:http</code> interface:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># </span><span>Rust</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>wit_bindgen</span><span>::</span><span>generate!</span><span>(</span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    world</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"hello"</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    exports</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>"wasi:http/incoming-handler"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>exports</span><span>::</span><span>wasi</span><span>::</span><span>http</span><span>::</span><span>incoming_handler</span><span>::</span><span>Guest</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>use</span><span> </span><span>wasi</span><span>::</span><span>http</span><span>::</span><span>types</span><span>::</span><span>*</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>impl</span><span> </span><span>Guest</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>HttpServer</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>handle</span><span>(</span><span>_request</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>IncomingRequest</span><span>,</span><span> response_out</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OutgoingResponse</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Fields</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        response</span><span>.</span><span>set_status_code</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>let</span><span> response_body </span><span>=</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        response_body</span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>blocking_write_and_flush</span><span>(</span><span>b"Hello from Rust!\n"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>            </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>OutgoingBody</span><span>::</span><span>finish</span><span>(</span><span>response_body</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to finish response body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>        </span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>::</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>response_out</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In our <code>Cargo.toml</code>, the only dependency here is <code>wit-bindgen</code> to generate the Rust types for us to refer to from <code>wasi::http::*</code>. This is lower level than the Smithy module abstraction, which provides a simple model of receiving an HTTP request struct and returning a response struct:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>async</span><span> </span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>handle_request</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>self</span><span>,</span><span> _ctx</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>Context</span><span>,</span><span> _req</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>HttpRequest</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>RpcResult</span><span>&lt;</span><span>HttpResponse</span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>HttpResponse</span><span>::</span><span>ok</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>At this point, looking at the above examples, you may consider the component experience to be more WebAssembly-specific than code you'd ideally like to write. This is true, as the base level of support for Wasm components starts with using the <code>wit-bindgen</code> generated types and functions to implement business logic. So, what's the path forward?</p>
<h2 id="why-wasi-020-is-important">Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important<a href="#why-wasi-020-is-important" aria-label="Direct link to Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important" title="Direct link to Why WASI 0.2.0 is Important">​</a></h2>
<p>Working with the standard set of WASI interfaces isn't meant for application developers. They are fundamentally lower levels of abstraction meant for library developers and implementers. WASI 0.2.0 is important not because it gives application developers the ability to write real things with WebAssembly (we've been doing that for four years!), but because it provides a stable definition of common interfaces for library developers in each language to build on top of.</p>
<p>Taking the example above, we're not working towards a world where developers need to work with WebAssembly interfaces, we're working towards a world where the capabilities of standard libraries of language ecosystems will support WASI interfaces. Developers using language standard libraries and popular libraries will likely not code directly to WASI API's and will instead use idiomatic abstractions. As WASI grows on the 0.2 foundation, higher-level interfaces like wasi-keyvalue may be at the forefront. Let me show you an example of the ideal Wasm hello world application to tie what I'm saying together in a concrete way:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>#[macro_use]</span><span> </span><span>extern</span><span> </span><span>crate</span><span> </span><span>rocket</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>#[get(</span><span>"/hello/&lt;name&gt;"</span><span>)]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>hello</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>format!</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, {name}!"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>#[launch]</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>rocket</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> _ </span><span>{</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>rocket</span><span>::</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>mount</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>routes!</span><span>[</span><span>hello</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>}</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Note that there are no Wasm interfaces here! This is actually copy/pasted from the <a href="https://rocket.rs/v0.4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocket homepage</a>. The ideal experience is that developers can use idiomatic community and standard libraries to write their code, then simply compile to a Wasm binary. We're not quite at this point yet, but WASI 0.2.0 is the first step in this direction because it provides a common standard set of interfaces for library developers to build on top of.</p>

<p>If you take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">examples in the wasmCloud/wasmCloud repository</a> you'll see we've added Rust, TinyGo and TypeScript/JavaScript examples, with Python coming soon. The above snippet of code, where a developer can use just a language library out-of-the-box and compile to WASI, is likely a few months away. The important thing to keep in mind is that WASI 0.2.0 enables this in the first place and, looking forward, here's what you can expect from the wasmCloud developer experience.</p>
<p>As language toolchains evolve to better and better support WASI, what you can expect to see is Wasm-first frameworks for developing applications using standard interfaces. One of these such frameworks will be the <a href="https://github.com/wasmCloud/wasmCloud/tree/main/crates/actor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasmcloud-actor</a> crate, which will provide both access to a stable set of WASI interfaces and nicer abstractions around specific functionality. Take the above HTTP request handler code and how we respond with an HTTP response of “Hello from Rust”:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>let</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>OutgoingResponse</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Fields</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>set_status_code</span><span>(</span><span>200</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>let</span><span> response_body </span><span>=</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>body</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>response_body</span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>blocking_write_and_flush</span><span>(</span><span>b"Hello from Rust!\n"</span><span>)</span><span></span><br></span><span><span>    </span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>OutgoingBody</span><span>::</span><span>finish</span><span>(</span><span>response_body</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>None</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>"failed to finish response body"</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span><br></span><span><span></span><span>ResponseOutparam</span><span>::</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>response_out</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>response</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The code I personally would want to write is something like the original abstraction. Avoiding modifying traits and the standard way to define exports, we may have an abstraction like:</p>

<p>Check it out! A much nicer abstraction around returning an HTTP request, and all we had to do was pull the generated WASI structures behind a more idiomatic API. The above is just sample code I wrote for this blog, so our actual implementation might be different at the end of the day (and even better). This should, however, gives a sense of how library developers will use WASI APIs when the target architecture is Wasm. Even better, the <code>wasmcloud-actor</code> crate will still work out-of-the-box with tools like <code>wasmtime-serve</code>, as there are zero wasmCloud specific APIs used. That being said, this kind of library belongs in an upstream location like the Bytecode Alliance or in the language itself, and this is an intermediate solution unless we see evidence that we should keep the library around for good.</p>
<p>We will see libraries emerge in each language that demonstrates good Wasm component support, and I expect to see something like this for Rust, TinyGo, Python, JavaScript, C/C++, and C# in the near future. We may even see this support built into the standard libraries of these languages. Go for, example, <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">just resurfaced support for the wasmexport directive</a>, enabling libraries like <code>net/http</code> to have WASI implementations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>We are, arguably, reaching the most exciting period of the wasmCloud project to-date. The stabilization of WASI 0.2.0, alongside native support for components in wasmCloud, lets us support every Wasm component language that uses the same WIT definitions. Even as WASI proposals continue to evolve, we now have a stable base to adapt those interfaces to ensure future stability. I firmly believe that this enables the community to truly collaborate on furthering language support, and writing real applications with WebAssembly, and I look forward to being at the forefront of that.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please drop by our <a href="https://slack.wasmcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> and let's have a discussion. While the new interfaces look different from what a seasoned wasmCloud developer is used to, they enable us to truly benefit from and contribute to WebAssembly standards, and the best experience is just within arm's reach.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The ruling amounted to an overwhelming rebuke of Israel’s wartime conduct and added to mounting international pressure to halt the nearly 4-month-old offensive, which <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-11-3-2023-gaza-camp-8a25acaf136b897492158d128bf5742d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has killed</a></span> more than 26,000 Palestinians, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-gaza-israel-bombing-destruction-hamas-reconstruction-f299a28410b70ee05dd764df97d8d3a0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decimated vast swaths of Gaza</a></span> and driven nearly 85% of its 2.3 million people from their homes.</p>
    
<p>Allowing the accusations to stand stung the government of Israel, which was founded as a Jewish state after the Nazi slaughter of 6 million Jews during World War II.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the fact that the court was willing to discuss the genocide charges was a “mark of shame that will not be erased for generations.” He also vowed to press ahead with the war.</p>
    

<p>The power of the ruling was magnified by its timing, coming on the eve of International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p><p>“Those truly needing to stand trial are those that murdered and kidnapped children, women and the elderly,” former Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz said, referring to Hamas militants who <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-attack-military-war-a8f63b07641212f0de61861844e5e71e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stormed through Israeli communities</a></span> on Oct. 7 in the attack that set off the war. The assault killed some 1,200 people and resulted in another 250 being kidnapped.</p><p>The court also called on Hamas to release the hostages who are still in captivity. Hamas urged the international community to make Israel carry out the court’s orders.</p><p>Many of the measures were approved by an overwhelming majority of the judges. Of the six orders, an Israeli judge voted in favor of two — an order for humanitarian aid and another for the prevention of inflammatory speech.</p><p>Israeli Judge Aharon Barak said he supported those orders in the hope that they would “help to decrease tensions and discourage damaging rhetoric” while easing the ”consequences of the armed conflict for the most vulnerable.”</p>
    

<p>Such provisional measures issued by the world court are legally binding, but it is not clear if Israel will comply with them.</p><p>“We will continue to do what is necessary to defend our country and defend our people,” said Netanyahu, who pushed back against the ruling in two languages. In a message aimed at his domestic audience, the tone was more defiant in Hebrew, and he stopped short of overtly criticizing the court in English.</p><p>The court ruled that Israel must do all it can to prevent genocide, including refraining from killing Palestinians or causing harm to them. It also ruled that Israel urgently needs to get basic aid to Gaza and that the country should punish any incitement to genocide, among other measures.</p><p>The panel told Israel to submit a report on measures taken within a month.</p><p>“That’s a time that the court could come back and say, ‘You have not met the orders. You have not complied. Now we find you are in the midst of committing genocide,’” said Mary Ellen O’Connell, a professor of law and international peace studies at Notre Dame University’s Kroc Institute.</p>
    

<p>Friday’s decision was an interim ruling. It could take years for the court to consider all aspects of <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/world-court-israel-genocide-gaza-south-africa-774ab3c3d57fd7bcc627602eaf47fd98?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Africa’s</a></span> genocide allegations.</p><p>In Israel, commentators said the decision not to order a cease-fire was received with some relief since it helped Israel avoid a collision with a top U.N. body.</p><p>Palestinians and their supporters said the court took an important step toward holding Israel accountable. The Foreign Ministry of the internationally backed Palestinian self-rule government in the West Bank said the ruling “should serve as a wake-up call for Israel and actors who enabled its entrenched impunity,” in an apparent reference to the United States, Israel’s chief ally.</p><p>The U.S. repeated its position that Israel must “take all possible steps” to minimize harm to civilians, increase humanitarian aid and curb “dehumanizing rhetoric.”</p><p>“We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded,” the State Department said in a statement.</p>
    

<p>The South African government said the ruling determined that “Israel’s actions in Gaza are plausibly genocidal.”</p><p>“There is no credible basis for Israel to continue to claim that its military actions are in full compliance with international law, including the Genocide Convention,” the government said in a statement.</p><p>Israel often boycotts international tribunals and U.N. investigations, saying they are unfair and biased.

<p><span>Welcome to the tinySA<sup>®</sup> wiki!</span>
</p>
<p><strong>Important info on the tinySA Ultra</strong>
</p>
<p>The tinySA wiki is slowly being updated with info regarding the tinySA Ultra. The names tinySA4 and tinySA Ultra refer to the same device.
</p>
<p><strong>The tinySA are a small spectrum analyzers and signal generators with some nice capabilities:</strong>
</p>
<ul><li><strong>tinySA Basic</strong>
<ul><li>Screen size 2.8 inch
</li><li>Spectrum Analyzer with two inputs, high quality MF/HF/VHF input for 0.1MHZ-350MHz, lesser quality UHF input for 240MHz-960MHz or
</li><li>Signal Generator with two output, sine wave output for 0.1MHz - 350MHz and square wave output for 240MHz-960MHz when not used as Spectrum Analyzer.
</li><li>Switchable resolution bandpass filters for both ranges between 2.6kHz and 640kHz
</li><li>Color display showing max 290 scan points providing gapless covering up to the full low or high frequency range.
</li></ul></li><li><strong>tinySA Ultra</strong>
<ul><li>Screen size 4 inch
</li><li>Spectrum Analyzer for 0.1-800MHz or, with Ultra mode enabled, level calibrated up to 6GHz. Can observe signals up to 12GHz
</li><li>Signal Generator with sine wave output between 0.1-800MHz or square wave up to 4.4GHz or rf test signal output up to 5.3GHz when not used as Spectrum Analyzer.
</li><li>Switchable resolution bandpass filters from 200Hz to 850kHz
</li><li>Built-in 20dB optional LNA
</li><li>Color display showing max 450 points providing gapless covering up to the full frequency range.
</li><li>MicroSD card slot for storing measurements, settings and screen captures. 
</li></ul></li><li>Input Step attenuator from 0dB to 31dB (can not be used in combination with LNA).
</li><li>A built-in calibration signal generator that is used for automatic self test and (low) input calibration.
</li><li>Connected to a PC via USB it becomes a PC controlled Spectrum Analyzer or Signal Generator
</li><li>Rechargeable battery allowing a minimum of 2 hours of portable use
</li><li>Max input level +10dBm. <a href="https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Transmitters">Do not destroy your tinySA</a>
</li><li>The generator function can not be used as a tracking generator as you can not use the spectrum analyzer and generator functions at the same time.
</li><li>Due to the low cost and very small form factor there are certain relevant <a href="https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.Limitations">tinySA limitations</a> and <a href="https://tinysa.org/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=TinySA4.Limitations">tinySA Ultra limitations</a>

<p><strong>Introduction and other videos </strong>
</p>
<p>A short 7 minute video introducing the main features of the tinySA can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_rNLdZBuxo" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>A short introduction video to the tinySA Ultra can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFD34qUc2PA" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br>Many more videos in my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5ZELMM2xseNkwVBtyAG00uZevwWUdVIg" rel="nofollow"><strong>YouTube channel</strong></a><br>A user has created an very extensive introduction video to the tinySA Ultra which can be found <a href="https://www.hamcom.dk/TinySA/TinySA%20ULTRA_UK.mp4" rel="nofollow">here</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Manual</strong>
</p>
<p>For those that prefer to read a document instead of browsing a wiki, there are two options.<br>Kurt Poulson was so kind to write an extensive document explaining various aspects of the tinySA for a Danish Amatuer Radio magazine. The English version can be found <a href="https://www.hamcom.dk/TinySA/Description_of_TinySA_a_real_Spectrum_Analyzer_for_little_money.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Kurt describes the operation of the signal generator and spectrum analyzer functions and explains how to update the FW. The document contains many screen captures of example measurements. 
</p>
<p>A second option is a PDF version of the wiki, which allows for easier reading for some people, that can be found <a href="https://groups.io/g/tinysa/files/tinySA-user-manual-march2021.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>

At first, he says, humans are incentivized by measurable rewards — namely likes or other engagements on posts.</p><p>But social media can be fickle, and those rewards are intermittent at best. Many behavioural experts and researchers have said that&nbsp;what really keeps people scrolling and posting is dopamine.&nbsp;</p><p>Dopamine is a chemical produced in the brain when we do something pleasurable, like eating, exercising and having sex.

"But we can still have fun and enjoy it."</p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/smartphone-brain-nov14-1.7029406" text="Social media gets teens hooked while feeding aggression and impulsivity, and researchers think they know why" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>Social media gets teens hooked while feeding aggression and impulsivity, and researchers think they know why</span></a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/summer-scrolling-smartphones-unplugged-1.6871589" text="Why putting down the phone and enjoying the summer is harder than you think" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>Why putting down the phone and enjoying the summer is harder than you think</span></a></li></ul></div><p>Arthur and Augustin produced dozens upon dozens of selfies, trying out different angles like real social media pros.

<h2>Storing massive data, as cheap as possible</h2>



<p>The year is 1995 and you live in post-Soviet Russia. </p>



<p>It’s a hellish time: prices for basic consumer goods are <em>tripl</em>e what they were last year. Your employer just paid your salary in eggs instead of money. There are daily shootouts between rival gangs. 🎵<em>Your love life’s DOA…</em>🎵</p>



<p>It’s a wonderful time: Russia is awash in Western computers, TVs, VCRs, cassette players and dialup modems. Technology that was strictly off-limits in 1989 is suddenly within reach.</p>



<p>As one of the lucky Russians to have a computer at home, you are facing a challenge: your 500MB hard drive is overflowing with software, games, and documents. You must find an affordable way to get more digital storage.</p>





<p>You <em>could</em> store files on cheap and plentiful floppy disks. But each floppy only stores 1.44MB and is known to randomly lose data. Your second option is to buy another hard drive. But that costs about $200 USD – as much as a Russian’s entire monthly salary…</p>



<p>You head over to the local computer store in a gray mood. The store is cramped with bootlegged computer games, peripherals and hardware. Inside, you ask Yevgeni the proprietor whether there might be a cheap solution to your storage problem.</p>



<p>This is Yevgeni:</p>




<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="805" height="532" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package.jpg 805w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-300x198.jpg 300w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-768x508.jpg 768w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/arvid-1031-in-package-766x506.jpg 766w" sizes="(max-width: 805px) 100vw, 805px"></a></figure></div>


<p>Fortunately, Yevgeni <em>does</em> have a 3<sub><sup>rd</sup></sub> option for you! It’s a truly innovative Russian-made product called <strong>the “ArVid” card</strong>. It comes in a package like this: </p>



<p>It is an ISA expansion card for your computer and will allow you to use your home-VCR to store <strong>4 hard-drives’ worth of data</strong> on a single VHS tape. The same tape you use to watch movies at home.</p>



<p>You hand over 80 American Dollars. Yevgeni slides out a little warranty card from inside the ArVid package, writes in the date of purchase and signs it. You step out of that store into the crisp air of a 1995 Moscow day. A proud owner of an ArVid 1030.</p>



<h2>Getting started with this device</h2>



<p>You take the package home and take a closer look at what’s inside:</p>



<div><p>There’s the ArVid ISA Card itself. This card slots into your “386” PC motherboard. The plate sits flush with the back of your computer. It has a port for a cable and a glossy diode for receiving an infrared signal.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kontr_Arvid-1020_2-e1705878838312.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/5333649035_335cdaf2a7_o-1024x576.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>The package includes several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">3½” floppy disks</a> . Each one is loaded with 1.44MB of software, drivers and documentation. A printed documentation pamphlet with “АPВИД” on the front is also included.</p></div>



<div><p>Finally, there is a custom cable that connected your computer to your VCR. Aside from the standard “video in” and “video out” connectors, this cable has an extra wire with an Infrared emitting LED at the tip (circled in red).</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="400" height="300" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter.jpg 400w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Arvid-cable-with-IR-emitter-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"></figure></div>



<p>Here is how the card, VCR and home computer worked together:</p>



<div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/arvid-diagram-for-web-2.svg">
</p>



<div>
<ol>

<h2>Impersonating your VCR remote</h2>



<p>After installing the ArVid card into your<a href="https://ancientelectronics.wordpress.com/2014/04/23/anatomy-of-a-386-dos-pc/"> 386 PC</a> and connecting all the video wires, the next challenge was getting the card to control your domestic VCR. </p>



<p>The ArVid had a neat way of controlling VCRs: it did so by pretending to be the VCR’s own remote-control. To accomplish this trick, users needed to “teach” the card which specific infrared remote-control signals corresponded to commands such as “play”, “stop” and “rewind”.</p>



<p>To “teach” the card, you needed to turn the back of your computer to face you. At the back of the card there was a shiny receiver diode. You’d point the VCR remote at it and the ArVid’s software would tell you which button to press while it recorded the signals. It could use modulated and unmodulated signals to disguise itself as your remote.</p>



<p>Teaching ArVid all of your VCR remote’s commands took 3 hours (… or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143412/http://www.phantom.sannata.ru/cgi-bin/ikonboard/topic.cgi?forum=10&amp;topic=18">7 minutes, depending on who you believe</a> <sup>🇷🇺</sup>).</p>



<h2>Writing data to tape</h2>



<p>To prepare the tape for writing, ArVid tried to figure out the best “<a href="https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/vcr2.htm">tracking alignment</a>” for your VCR. It did so by writing a 2.5-minute data segment to tape, then reading it back while adjusting the VCR’s “read head” position to one of 6 different settings. ArVid calculated the reading “error rate” at each one of the 6 track positions. Finally, the software recommended the track alignment with the least number of errors for your VCR’s magnetic read-head.</p>



<p>Below: ArVid has tested 5 track-alignment options. It recommends option 3 – although it had more “double” errors than option 2 (164 of them) it had the fewest <em>total errors</em> at 7,887.</p>

<p>To write digital data from your computer to tape, you select the files using a custom file navigation program that resembled the popular “Norton Commander” application. Then pop one of these bad boys into your VCR:</p>





<p>Once you give the command to “write”, the ArVid card converts your file’s data into a video signal. At the same time, ArVid flashes the infrared emitter to send a “start recording” command to the VCR – and your data starts being laid down on the VHS magnetic tape.</p>



<p>When the computer is finished recording the files to tape, there is a “verification” step. ArVid rewinds the tape and reads back all the data it wrote to make sure there were no critical data losses.</p>


<div>

There were 23,795 “single” errors and 149 “double” errors. No “triple” errors.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Reading data from tape</h2>



<p>To get your data of the VHS tape and into your computer, you needed 2 things: the tape and a special “table of contents” file. That file made it so you didn’t need to view the whole tape just to get a single file. ArVid left time markers on the tape that you could use to fast-forward to a specific file.</p>



<p>You’d insert the VHS tape into your VCR and bring up the ArVid software in reading mode. Pick the files you want to download from the tape and go! The device would send “fast forward”, “rewind” and “play” commands to your VCR and the video signal from the tape would go out of the VCR and into the computer. The computer converts the visual signal back into digital data.</p>



<h3>Boosting the quality of your backups</h3>



<p>The ArVid device and its software were remarkably reliable. But there were still things you could do if you wanted your data to stay safely stored on VHS tapes for a loooong time. The main factors within your control were the kind of VCR Device you owned and the quality of the VHS tapes you bought.</p>



<p>For the VCR, ArVid’s manufacturer recommended the pricy <em>Sony 130XR</em> and the cheaper <em>Akai-120EDG</em>. It appears that the best VCRs are heavy ones with a metal envelope. That’s because they don’t shake around as much when the tape is forwarded, rewound and stopped. You wouldn’t want a superfast-rewinding VCR either: the slow ArVid hardware would have trouble keeping up with it… (<a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9E%D0%B1%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5%3A%D0%90%D1%80%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%B4">see these comments on Russian Wikipedia</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>). ArVid would not work with 60Hz NTSC VCRs.</p>



<p>For the VHS tapes, the best ones were tapes with a 180-minute capacity. These tapes have the thickest magnetic ribbon inside. Longer-playing tapes had thinner tape, which were mechanically weaker and would wear down from use. This “tape thickness” logic makes sense when you think about the fact that longer tapes have to be thinner to fit in a standard VHS case.</p>



<p><em>Here is a video of ArVid’s set up, writing and reading (in Russian):</em></p>

<h2>The technical details</h2>



<p>To store signal on tape reliably, the device used only the luminance portion of the video signal. And only black and white – no grays. That means that variations in colour and sound were <strong>not used</strong> when recording data.</p>



<p>As best as I could figure out, data was stored to tape using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-return-to-zero">Non-Return-to-Zero</a> encoding (<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/kEVSfplyuzk/m/ZWLxp3qYfhsJ">according to some Fido7 comments</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>). On the tape itself, files were recorded in sections separated by 5-second blank intervals.</p>



<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="604" height="249" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape.png 604w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/screenshot-arvid-faq-spacing-on-tape-300x124.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px"></a><figcaption>An ASCII diagram from the ArVid FAQ, illustrating how files are laid out on tape.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Home-use VHS tapes had worse quality than commercial-grade magnetic tape, so the makers took extra measures to detect and fix errors on tape. ArVid read and wrote data using an error correction algorithm called “Reed-Solomon with Interleaving” (I also came across mentions of a Galois algorithm). They claimed that this let the ArVid software correct up to 3 defective bytes in a code group, and a loss of up to 450 consecutive bytes could be corrected. After reading data from tape, the software performed a <a href="https://www.lammertbies.nl/comm/info/crc-calculation">CRC32 check </a>for errors, operating on every 512-byte block.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="722" height="973" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad.jpg 722w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/real-time-ad-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px"></a><figcaption>An ad for a computer store in gaming magazine Video-ACC. Mid 90s.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The ArVid software gave users a lot of information about the number of errors on tape. This was unique at a time when backup vendors preferred to pretend that errors didn’t exist. And it was a source of pride for the creators. This decision gave users the feedback they needed to improve their use of the system: you could see the impact of adjusting VCR tracking, purchasing better VHS tapes, switching out your VCR for another… even placing your VCR on a sturdier surface to reduce shaking and errors.</p>



<p>Errors could also be caused by VHS players taking a long time to “rev up to full speed” once playback started, so the ArVid software could be set to write more “initial empty frames” to make up for it.</p>



<p>Finally, the software saves a manifest of the files on your tape locally in “.TDR” format. This local table-of-contents gave the device a fast way of seeing and accessing the right file locations without playing through the whole tape. If the .TDR file was lost, there was also a program to recreated it by reading through an entire tape (a slow affair).</p>



<p>This is what the ArVid data on VHS tapes looked like if you played it through a normal TV:</p>

<h2>ArVid in action</h2>



<h3>Capacity and cost – how did it compare to other options? </h3>


<p>You could record an <strong>absolutely whopping</strong> amount of data onto a single VHS tape. All models of ArVid could record 1.08 Gigabytes onto a 180-minute tape, at a 100 kilobytes/sec speed. From model 1020 and onward, they could record 2.16 Gigabytes on that same tape (at 200 kilobytes/sec).</p>
<p>The ArVid system cost about $80 USD, with VHS tapes costing $4 USD, and a VCR that cost on average $160 (which many people already had at home). That was a phenomenal value for storage!</p>
<p>To show you just how good this was for the time, here are typical storage prices in 1997:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD-R recording drive – would start at $300 for the drive. CD capacity ranged from 184-870 Mb. Note that the first consumer CD-R under $1,000 was only introduced in September 1995 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-R">the Hewlett Packard model 4020i manufactured by Philips)</a></li>
<li>ZIP drive – cost $150 for the drive and $15 per disk (100mb each)</li>
<li>JAZ drive – $350 for the drive, and $85 for each disk (up to 1GB each)</li>
<li>3.5″ floppy drive – $28 CAD for the drive (source: <a href="https://archive.org/details/thecomputerpaper">1997 issue of the Computer Paper in Canada</a>) with the puny 1.44MB diskettes costing about $0.30 (as <a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/diskettes-ad-1997.jpg">seen in this ad</a> from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/issuu_dougalder_1996-01_tcp_on/page/n123/mode/2up">1996 issue of Computer Paper</a>). Although, you could get them as cheap as 14 cents if you’re willing to trust <a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/computer-clearance-and-apples.jpg">someone who runs a computers-and-apples warehouse!</a></li>
<li>Hard Drives – typical capacity would be around 1.2GB and would cost $150 USD.
<ul>
<li>Note that just 2 years before – in 1995 – hard drive capacity would’ve been only around 560 Mb (<a href="https://dosdays.co.uk/topics/1995.php">Source</a>). One VHS tape could store more information than an entire hard drive.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How long would data last on tape?</h3>



<p>The Canadian Conservation Institute says that <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/technical-bulletins/digitization-vhs-video-tapes.html#a2b">VHS tapes have a 10-30 year lifespan, on average</a>.</p>



<p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?f=&amp;t=8665">user <em>Ctrl</em> on the <em>Sannata</em> forum<sup>🇷🇺</sup> used an ArVid system to successfully recover</a> all the files they saved onto a VHS tape in 1994/1995 without any errors. That’s 16 years of reliable data storage. <em>Ctrl </em>used the last-generation 1052 card for both writing and recovery. Another tape from 98 (on a semi-professional BASF tape) had only minor errors that didn’t affect data restoration.</p>



<p>On the same thread, user&nbsp;<em>Teodor</em> claimed they had no problems reading tapes from the late 90s in 2011. This person successfully used Hitachi VHS tapes. They had errors reading data at first, with a Panasonic NV-SD450 VCR, but saw a big improvement when they switched to the JVC HR-DD868 VCR.</p>



<p>On the Rutracker torrent site, <a href="https://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=47499118#47499118">user <em>korvegeta</em> successfully read from tapes in 2011</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. Although it isn’t known exactly when they were recorded. I’d guess 1998.</p>



<h3>Real-world use cases</h3>



<p>The ArVid devices were sold as data backup solutions. “PO KSI”, the manufacturers, directly positioned them as competitors for backup providers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Memory_Systems">Colorado Memory Systems</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarter-inch_cartridge">QIC systems</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandberg_Data">Tandberg Data</a> . </p>



<p>The nature of the medium – VHS tape – means that they can’t be read and rewritten over and over again. That’s because heavy use causes mechanical wear on the magnetic VHS tape. “Write once – read infrequently” is the ideal use case.</p>



<p>Throughout my ArVid research, I saw that people indeed used this device for data backup. Among them were people who used these disks at the office. This makes sense because the average home user had a hard drive that was 500mb-1.2GB in size and there simply wasn’t enough “stuff” around to fill up several 2GB Tapes’ worth of data. Remember: this was in the infancy of the World Wide Web. No MP3s. No digital video. No software websites. Purchasing ArVid as a backup solution made more sense for a small business than for a home user.</p>



<p>Others mentioned storing Log Data on these tapes. There wasn’t much detail beyond that, except for an author that said he personally saw <a href="http://sannata.org/articles/arvid.shtml">academic experiment data being stored to tape using ArVid</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>



<p>On both Russian and English forums, I found references to VHS tapes being used to shuttle Astronomical observation data between institutions. Presumably because of the cheap dollars-per-gigabyte for this medium.</p>

<p>People didn’t generally use these VHS tapes to exchange or sell data, like they did with floppy disks. There were several factors that made it challenging for one person to read data from a tape written by another person. These included differences in the ArVid hardware version, writing density, the quality of the VCR – even differences in the processing power between the two computers – all of them could create problems in reading a tape. This was despite the PO KSI team’s efforts to have backwards compatibility between ArVid versions. Another reason why tapes didn’t take off as a way to trade software: their capacity was overkill when most software at the time could fit on several floppies. I mean… as late as 1997 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5o6NQmEA-8">Microsoft Office was available on floppy disks. Although 46 of them…</a></p>



<p>There were several interesting “off-label” uses for Arvid:</p>



<p>User <a href="https://www.yaplakal.com/forum3/st/25/topic2569781.html?hl=%D0%90%D1%80%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4#entry120991245">Шеридан (“Sheridan”) on the Yaplakal forums<sup>🇷🇺</sup>, </a>recalled travelling to Moscow to purchase ArVid-made VHS tapes with many computer games packed on them. Sheridan then travelled back home, copied the individual games off the tape onto floppy disks and resold them to eager locals.</p>



<p>In the year 2000, vagrants kept stealing the lightbulb in the lobby of one enterprising ArVid use. He put on his vigilante cape and set up a security camera, an ArVid 1052 and a VCR as a kind of jerry-rigged motion-triggered camera. The system stayed on all day and video recording would only start once ArVid detected major visual changes using the <em>Arvid Control</em> software package (“<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041211201053/http://www.arvid.anadyr.ru/">Using ArVid as a surveillance system</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>”). The culprits were caught on tape!</p>



<p>On Fidonet (a BBS network that also carried Usenet posts), ArVid  sparked the imaginations of Russia’s IT enthusiasts.&nbsp; One ambitious idea was to broadcast a video signal carrying data over a regular TV channel, in order to mass-share software to the homes of people who would tune in with their ArVid.</p>



<h2>Product improvements over time</h2>



<p>Production of ArVid cards went on from 1993 to the summer of 1998. In those 5 short years the product had a remarkable number of improvements.</p>



<p>The company that made them had the acronym “PO KSI” (short for “Professional Association of Designers of Data Processing Systems” in Russian). They were based in Zelenograd, a “one industry town” outside Moscow that was a hub for microelectronics production. The town was a brainchild of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Sarant">Alfred Sarant</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Barr">Joel Barr</a> – two spies who escaped from America and went on to illustrious careers in the USSR.</p>



<p>From a hardware perspective, the ISA cards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZWUzcxMS7w">were an unusual mixture of Russian-made and foreign electronic components</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. The cards kept getting bigger built-in buffers and the ability to record data at a higher density (full history of specs in the Appendix). ArVid got a major boost when PO KSI moved from using an assembly of single-function microchips to using an <a href="https://www.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/pdf/525665/ACTEL/A1020B-PL84C.html">Actel a1020b-pl84c FPGA chip</a>. Switching to an FPGA processor meant that the cards ran cooler and didn’t cause the computer to overheat during operation.</p>



<p>Note the different look when you compare the older 1020 model with its integrated circuits to the newer 1052 with its big FPGA chip. <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">(Photo source)</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>As we saw earlier, “training” the card to control your domestic VCR was critical to the system’s operation. Originally, ArVid would have had 2 infrared diodes built into the card’s back: a receiver to record signals from the remote control and a transmitter to send them ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PB9FvHNIzco">according to YouTube comments by user “spbtvmaster”</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>). But this setup meant that users had to rotate the back of their PC to face their VCR. PO KSI improved the experience by putting the infrared transmitter on a separate cable that could reach the VCR regardless of where the PC was facing.</p>



<p>Another improvement was to completely cut out the “training” phase for various VCR’s remotes. The company pre-recorded the remote-control sequences for common VCRs at the factory and shipped them with ArVid’s software package. Customers could pick their VCR make &amp; model from a list and be ready instantly. And if your VCR wasn’t on the preconfigured list, you could still train ArVid manually.</p>

This instantly loaded the correct remote-control signals to trigger “play”, “pause”, “fast forward” and other commands on the VCR. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTWwNYnwUQA">Source video</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>An extraordinary amount of documentation and software came with the ArVid device. You’d typically get:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date FAQ</li>
<li>User Interface walkthroughs for common operations</li>
<li>Descriptions of the .TDR format which was the “table of contents” for tapes</li>
<li>API descriptions</li>
<li>Data on compatibility with different PCs, VCRs and Tapes</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought it was a “Catch 22” that you had to buy the device in order to read which VCRs/PCs it was compatible with. How would I know if my system is compatible if I only get this information after purchasing ArVid?</p>
<p>But it turned out that most of the ArVid documents were freely available from BBS systems belonging to PO KSI and authorized dealers. Just set your modem to dial the dealer’s number between the hours of 8pm and 8am, and you could download all the FAQs before you bought the system.</p>
<p>These BBSs were part of the FidoNet7 network, a Russian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet">network of BBSs that used software compatible with FidoNet</a> but independent of its political structure. <a href="https://www.fidonet.us/dummyguide.html">Here is more info about FidoNet</a>.</p>
<p>In 1997, a “newsgroup” was established at “<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid">fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid</a>”<sup>🇷🇺</sup>. There, Mikel Lavrentyev – the main ArVid dealer – provided support to customers and prospects. There was also an official ArVid website at www.arvid.ru, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429075532/http://www.arvid.ru:8080/indexr.htm">now available through the Wayback Machine</a>. In this way, with a patchwork of Web and pre-Web technologies, customers could get close to real-time support. This was quite an accomplishment for a country that was undergoing rapid – <strong>and often violent </strong>– privatization after the Soviet Union collapsed.</p>


<p>To learn more about this time of transition, read “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization_in_Russia">Privatization in Russia</a>” on Wikipedia; “<a href="http://webhome.auburn.edu/~mitrege/FLRU2520/RussianOrganizedCrime.htm">The Russian Mob: Organized Crime in a Fledgling Democracy</a>“;&nbsp;and this Russian article about <a href="https://4pda.to/2018/04/06/350624/">how oligarchs and hustlers got their start in the computer industry</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>

<p>While ArVid’s producers were a small company with a tiny dealer network, they did provide a warranty for the device. The pictured warranty, for a late-model ArVid 105 from 1997, covered 3 years. This was meaningful in a society where everything was uncertain and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Russian_financial_crisis#/media/File:Russian_inflation_rate_1993-2022.webp">inflation from 1993 to 1995 was always higher than 200% a year</a></p>



<h2>Software</h2>



<p>ArVid’s software could work under the DOS operating system, as well as Windows (3.1, 3.11, 95 and NT), and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/relcom.comp.os.os2/c/0YaCfLtL7-Y/m/30jI9bTd0NQJ">OS/2</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. There were unofficial ports for <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/vOE7mg3DvqI/m/ejly3hHz80kJ">Linux</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.su.hardw.support.arvid/c/esM2n46Jb_Y/m/ghsbNuFGsdcJ">FreeBSD</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>



<p>The main User Interface for ArVid resembled the popular filesystem browsing program “Norton Commander” and made it simple to read and write files from a VHS tape. Other executables that came with the card let the user record Infrared signals for controlling their VCR, to change the configuration parameters, and to re-creating the special “table of contents” file that listed file locations on a particular VHS tape.</p>

<p>The hardware, software, documentation and “API” bundled with ArVid opened a world of possibilities. These were the tools that programmers needed to create their own applications on top of the device. One such programmer was Slava Gostrenko.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202040501/http://www.aha.ru/%7Egw/">Gostrenko created 3 interesting applications</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arvid Draw</strong> – a program that would show the contents of a text file to your “Big Screen” Television.</li>
<li><strong>Arvid Control</strong> – a program that could act on visual signals from a TV broadcast or a surveillance camera. With this program, ArVid owners could do basic object detection / change detection in video signals. These changes could then trigger actions on the PC. The main pitch for it: while recording your favourite shows, the program could pause VCR recording during commercial breaks and resume it when the ads ended. You’d get commercial-free tapes.</li>
<li><strong>Arvid Audio</strong> – a program that used the ArVid system to record audio (3 hours of music on a $2 tape). Audio could be recorded directly from CD, Audio In, or any other source that a SoundBlaster sound card could handle.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Endgame</h2>



<p>In the summer of 1998 PO KSI stopped producing the ArVid.</p>



<p>Later that year, <a href="https://old.computerra.ru/194873/">an article in the Russian computer journal “Computerra”</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> claimed that ArVid dropped in popularity because HDD storage and CD-R drives became cheaper. That article’s author, Andrei Fatkullin, pointed out that ArVid never achieved an “economy of scale”. It was always priced at around $80 USD when the alternatives steadily got cheaper. (As an example, the latest ArVid cost <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/relcom.commerce.stocks/c/QVMaX4aqsaM/m/3FFZWLiySAkJ">$79 in 1994</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> and <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/fido7.pvt.exch.pricelist/c/wDVs2uHY8w4/m/1EG4JOyWWIoJ">$90 in 1997</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> while still doing the same fundamental “job”.)</p>



<p>I think Fatkullin is correct about the cause of ArVid’s death. From my vantage point in 2023 I can see that storage costs have been declining predictably – today $82 USD gets you a 2 Terabyte solid-state hard drive. Heck, for $8 USD you can get 128 GB of storage on a USB Stick. This doesn’t leave any space for a clunky data storage on VHS for $80…</p>



<p>A person who could’ve predicted this decline in price would see that a product in this space has a “built-in retirement date”. VHS always had an upper limit on capacity: PO KSI claimed it was 3.34GB for a 3-hour tape. The last ArVid device hit that ceiling at 325 Kbytes/sec. Using VHS tapes and unreliable domestic VCRs for data storage was a temporary measure. Your home VCR couldn’t compete with a purpose-built commercial device. It was all just a brilliant hack that let people in a dirt-poor country get massive storage for pennies.</p>



<p>Even in the peak years of 1994-1997 ArVid couldn’t be more than a niche product: the average consumer couldn’t even <strong>get</strong> their hands on 2GB worth of digital “stuff”. Why would you need a 2GB backup solution when your entire hard drive is just 500 MB in size? The “sweet spot” for ArVid was a small business or an academic organization – entities that would drop ArVid and “graduate” to a more “professional” backup solution as soon as they could.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">Sannata forums</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>, user “ASL” says that ArVid was a product that was mostly used by the Fido7 crowd, a small group:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In those times, the Trio64 cost 40 bucks, while the first Pentium was 100. During our first year at the university, out of our class (120 people), only five students had a computer. Only those who really needed it would pay a hundred for an archiving board. And even then, you had  to know about it <em>(information about it mostly circulated among Fido network users). And that was not a lot of people.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Another factor slowing its spread: this was not a user-friendly device. It required skill to set up, to “train” for working with your VCR, and to troubleshoot the variety of issues that cropped up along the way…</p>



<p>As for the makers of ArVid, the PO KSI company:</p>



<p>PO KSI is still around and they <a href="http://poksi.ru/homeeng.html">have a website</a>. They <a href="http://poksi.ru/arvid.html">claim that 200,000 ArVid boards were manufactured</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> but that assertion is <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">hotly contested</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup> based on the analysis of serial numbers on the devices. PO KSI always had multiple product lines to rely on, like digital document scanning equipment and satellite photography devices. </p>



<p>This story doesn’t have a happy ending.</p>



<p>Russia has a sickly economy, and it does not have <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/rule-of-law/rule-of-law-equation.page">Rule of Law</a>. Entrepreneurs have to find stability and protection from violence – and the best way to do so is to get in bed with the government (<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/shirtless-vladimir-putin-takes-dip-icy-russian-lake/story?id=52450562">the oh-so-sexy government</a>). If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PO_KSI">you dig deeper</a>, you’ll discover that PO KSI has gone on to supply <a href="https://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2016/12/29_a_10456787.shtml">equipment for the Russian Census and for the military</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>. In December 2016, the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/12/29/fact-sheet-actions-response-russian-malicious-cyber-activity-and">US White House sanctioned the company</a> for providing specialized training to Russia’s GRU spy agency.</p>



<p>Post-Soviet Russia in the 1990s was a wild and violent place. For budding computer enthusiasts, this was an exciting time. A time when it was finally possible to get your hands on western technology. A time to take your rightful place on the global Internet. The lack of money meant that you had to get inventive – the ArVid backup system was a shining example of this inventiveness, care and skill that could thrive in a chaotic environment. </p>



<p>But no amount of technical ability can change the reality of politics, power and even the national character of Russia. As I write this in 2023, Russian technologists can’t escape the same bleak choices facing ordinary Russians: escape, hide, persevere… or collaborate and prosper.</p>

<h2>Delicious leftovers 🍖</h2>



<h3>Was ArVid the first of its kind?</h3>



<p>No. There were several Western products that tried to accomplish the same thing. Storing data on <em>magnetic tape</em> was not a new thing: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic-tape_data_storage">tape was popular in the days of mainframes, and is still used today</a>. It is a cheap and reliable storage medium.</p>



<p>Storing data on <em>domestic VHS tapes</em> was the innovation here. It was also a logical next step from commercial tape technology, but only a few companies tried it and it ended up as a niche curiosity.</p>



<p>There is a long history of storing data on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cassette_tape_data_storage_formats">media meant for domestic <strong>music</strong> playback</a>. The Commodore Datasette devices and the cassette drives for the Atari 400/800 computers used audio cassettes for data storage:</p>

<p>For those who are curious to learn more about digital data storage on analog cassettes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cassettes">this Wikipedia page is a good starting point</a>. The main principle is that data ones-and-zeroes can be turned into audio or video signals and stored just like a song or a movie.</p>





<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131019213353/http://blog.modernmechanix.com/the-floppy-rom-software-distributed-on-records/">An extreme example of using a domestic medium for data is the “Floppy ROM”</a> – a flexible <strong>turntable record</strong> that arrived as a magazine insert. You could put it on your record player, and “play” the programs on it into your computer. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvXXkB2jic0&amp;t=260s">Here it is on video</a> – you can see how thin and soft it is)</p>



<p>Moving from audio media to VHS tape, the Corvus “Mirror” device was one that <a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/brochures/PC_Mirror_Brochure.pdf">could store 91 megabytes of data on a 3-hour tape</a>. In 1980 Corvus filed patent US4380047A for the device. From <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/corvus/service/Corvus_Mirror_Service_Manual.pdf">the Corvus Mirror manual</a>, it appears that the product was in-market in 1984. </p>



<p>Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSnrQBfBCzY"><em>Technology Connections</em> has a great video about the early days of storing high-fidelity digital audio on VHS tape</a>. At <a href="https://youtu.be/xSnrQBfBCzY?feature=shared&amp;t=837">time 13:57</a>, you can see how effectively proper error-correction algorithms compensated for errors on tape. The audio signal sounds great despite Alec’s intentional interference with it. This is why the ArVid’s software had so many error control measures.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970110151745/http://www.danmere.com/backer.html">Danmere Backer</a> was often compared to the ArVid. It could store 1.5 GB on a 3-hour VHS tape in normal mode and 3GB in long-play. Apparently, it showed a “file identifier” on screen to help you manually forward the tape to the precise spot where your file was stored.</p>

<h3>Counterfeits</h3>



<p>A passive-aggressive rant in the ArVid FAQ documents mentioned that PO KSI had to deal with “fake” ArVid cards. It appears that older cards – the ones that weren’t based on an FPGA microchip – could be hand-soldered from standard components.</p>



<p>Forum user “Vintik_33” on the Sannata forums claims that they participated in a ring that <a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=44">made fake etched plates and soldered ArVid clones from components</a><sup>🇷🇺</sup>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="689" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-1024x689.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-1024x689.jpg 1024w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-300x202.jpg 300w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-768x517.jpg 768w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device-766x515.jpg 766w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/counterfit-ArVid-device.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><figcaption>An allegedly counterfeit ArVid card (<a href="https://www.phantom.sannata.org/viewtopic.php?t=2242&amp;start=33">source</a>).</figcaption></figure>



<h3>Where would people buy this device in the 90s?</h3>



<p>I spent a long time figuring out how PO KSI advertised these devices to the public. There were no magazine ads. Only a few spammy posts on Fido7… There were about 5 authorized dealers of the product listed in the FAQs – with most of them appearing to be individuals, rather than businesses. One endearing thing I found was a BBS file with prices and <strong>directions to the home </strong>of Mikel Lavrentyev, the primary dealer:</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="619" height="862" src="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png" alt="" srcset="https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address.png 619w, https://jacobfilipp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pricelist-and-mikel-address-215x300.png 215w" sizes="(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px"></a></figure></div>


<p>In one forum discussion, a user backed their opinion that ArVid had limited sales by stating “I visited Mikel’s place to pick up my device – and it didn’t look like the home of a high-earning businessman”.</p>



<p>I believe that knowledge of this product spread by word of mouth. Especially among BBS operators. Mikel, in particular, seemed to be a key member of the Fido7 network of technologists and would have been part of the social scene in the 90s. This method of marketing would’ve been great for staying under the radar of local criminals, but terrible for attracting the public’s business…</p>



<h3>How much will an ArVid cost me today?</h3>



<p>Nowadays (<em>the year 2023 – when men were horses, and horses knew the value of a nickel</em>), a 1052 card sells for $10USD on Meshok.net. I also saw an old computer with an ArVid installed on sale for 18,500 Roubles – about $205 USD – on Avito.ru. You can search Avito, Meshok and Youla.ru for the Russian word “Арвид” to find it.</p>



<p>Russia is under financial sanctions, so you may have trouble paying for the device and getting it shipped. You might have better luck looking for one on Ukrainian sites. Back in the 90s there was an official dealer in Kiev so there would be a few floating around. Stunningly, even though Ukraine is a warzone I’ve been able to get eBay-bought items from Ukrainian dealers. With real-time shipment tracking and all!<br></p>

<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Arvid 600</strong> <br>Was the first model, possibly internal. Worked only with Toshiba VS-109CZ and used exclusively the VCR’s time position indexing.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Free play is essential for children’s development and for their physical, mental, and social health. Opportunities to engage in outdoor free play—and risky play in particular—have declined significantly in recent years, in part because safety measures have sought to prevent all play-related injuries rather than focusing on serious and fatal injuries. Risky play is defined by thrilling and exciting forms of free play that involve<em> </em>uncertainty of outcome and a possibility of physical injury. Proponents of risky play differentiate ‘risk’ from ‘hazard’ and seek to reframe perceived risk as an opportunity for situational evaluation and personal development. This statement weighs the burden of play-related injuries alongside the evidence in favour of risky play, including its benefits, risks, and nuances, which can vary depending on a child’s developmental stage, ability, and social and medical context. Approaches are offered to promote open, constructive discussions with families and organizations. Paediatricians are encouraged to think of outdoor risky play as one way to help prevent and manage common health problems such as obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Play is essential for children’s development and for their physical, mental, and social health<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. The right to play is recognized in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to be as fundamental as the rights to be cared for and protected from violence<sup>[<a href="#ref2">2</a>]</sup>. Children engaged in free play are also building social and executive functioning skills that are critical for school readiness and lifelong achievement<sup>[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref4">4</a>]</sup>. Over the last several decades, family and social trends have increasingly prioritized the supervision and protection of children. A shift in the balance of play has also occurred, with unscheduled free play outdoors steadily giving way to planned, structured activities, including extra-curriculars and academics, in the lives of most children<sup>[<a href="#ref3">3</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref6">6</a>]</sup>. Children are spending more of their recreational time indoors (and often on screens) than playing outside with minimal supervision<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. The 2022 ParticipACTION report card gave Canadian children a ‘D’ grade for overall physical activity and a ‘D−’&nbsp;for active play<sup>[<a href="#ref7">7</a>]</sup>. Many Canadian organizations are now calling for a shift in strategies to keep children “as safe as necessary” rather than “as safe as possible”, and a more balanced approach to healthy and active living that encourages the developmental benefits of risk-taking as well as preventing injury<sup>[<a href="#ref8">8</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>This statement for paediatric health care providers (HCPs) describes the concept and benefits of outdoor risky play, along with its challenges and nuances related to children’s developmental stage, individual ability, and social and medical context. Approaches to promote open, constructive discussions with families and organizations are offered. Paediatricians are encouraged to think of outdoor risky play as a strategy to help prevent and manage common health problems such as obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues<sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref10">10</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>What is risky play?</strong></h2>
<p>Risky play is defined by thrilling and exciting forms of free play that involve uncertainty of outcome and a possibility of physical injury<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup>. Based on evidence gathered over the last 15 years, primarily in children 1 to 13 years of age<sup>[<a href="#ref12">12</a>]</sup>, risky play is often further categorized into various play types (<a href="#Table 1">Table 1</a>)<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref13">13</a>]</sup>. These categories are purposefully imprecise because activities can differ widely based on a child’s developmental stage (rather than age), past experience, and personality.</p>

<p><sup><em>Information drawn from references 11,13</em></sup></p>
<p>More specifically, the category of “playing at height” could involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>A toddler climbing and jumping from a chair,</li>
<li>An older child who feels confident in her/his motor and physical skills climbing a tree, several branches above the ground, or</li>
<li>A child of similar age but with a different temperament, experience, and skill level climbing a small tree or stopping just a few branches above ground.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the play looks different, all three children are engaged in risky play because they feel excited, thrilled, and challenged by their chosen activity.</p>
<p>Risky play is associated most often with activities outdoors or in nature because of the many challenging and creative opportunities for play these settings afford. Play involving natural, loose parts (e.g., gravel, sand, branches) or manufactured materials (e.g., tires, milk crates) that children can use in various ways, without specific direction, likewise supports rich opportunities for risky play<sup>[<a href="#ref14">14</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref16">16</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p><a id="Text box 1" name="Text box 1">Text box 1.</a> <strong>Risky play differentiates hazard from risk</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>A risk</strong> arises in situations where a child can recognize and evaluate the challenge and decide on a course of action based on personal preference and self-perceived skill. For example, how high to go on a climbing structure or how fast to run down a slope.</p>
<p>A <strong>hazard</strong> is posed by situations where the potential for injury is beyond the child’s capacity to recognize it as such or to manage it. For example, an improperly anchored slide could topple under a child’s weight, or a rotten tree limb may break.</p>
</div>
<p><sup><em>Reference 16</em></sup></p>
<p>Risk is inherent to free play. When children play spontaneously, they may choose to push boundaries and test limits. Risky play encourages creative, spontaneous play, first by eliminating hazards, then by supporting risk-taking that is chosen and controlled by the child and appropriate to her/his experience and ability (<a href="#Text box 1">Text box 1</a>)<sup>[<a href="#ref11">11</a>]</sup>. The concept of risky play is a response, in part, to restrictive safety programs and measures that have become more broadly implemented—and sometimes mandated—in child care settings, schools, and playgrounds in recent years. Given the developmental benefits of play-related risk-taking (detailed below), some researchers are advocating for safety rules that effectively prevent serious injury and death while helping children develop risk management strategies that are essential aspects of healthy and active growth<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref17">17</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The literature on risky play has highlighted the need for a balanced approach between risk and hazard, where children’s overall health and well-being are served by addressing both their developmental and injury prevention needs. Environments such as a busy roadway or rough waters pose hazards that any responsible adult will recognize as hazardous. Yet some activities, like play around fire or rough-and-tumble play, offer a more nuanced relationship between risk and hazard, especially when taking characteristics of the individual child into account. The adult’s role is to identify hazards and remove or mitigate them, then to supervise appropriately for the type of activity as well as the child’s skill level, personality, and developmental stage (which may also involve no supervision). The degree of autonomy children have can be determined by how well an adult knows the children at play and their capabilities. Adults should always be ready to intervene when child’s play becomes a danger to self or others. Preventing children from engaging in risky play experiences is different from intervening in a timely manner that takes their skill level and self-confidence into account.</p>
<p>Risky play is<em> not</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring evidence-based and mandated safety measures (e.g., the use of helmets, car seats, life jackets, stair safety gates)</li>
<li>Leaving children unsupervised in potentially hazardous situations (e.g., street play in traffic areas)</li>
<li>Pushing children to take risks beyond their own comfort level.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debate among researchers and decision-makers regarding the appropriate balance between risk-taking and injury prevention<sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup> has led to the use of other terms besides “risky” to qualify play. Examples include ‘outdoor play’, ‘nature play’, ‘active play’, ‘adventurous play’, and ‘free’ or ’unstructured’ play. These terms are defined in the “Terminology and taxonomy of the Play, Learn, and Teach Outdoors-Network (PlaTO-Net)<sup>[<a href="#ref14">14</a>]</sup>. This work standardizes terminology and recognizes that organizations will understand the role and consequences of risk-taking differently and may prefer to use a range of terms to advance conversations about play. However, when children are free to play as they choose, risk is always present, though in different forms, and all descriptive terms imply some measure of risky play.</p>
<h2><strong>The benefits of risky play</strong></h2>
<p>A comprehensive literature search&nbsp;for the effects of risky play on children’s health, undertaken in March 2022, found ample evidence of benefits for children’s physical, mental, and social-emotional development, which are detailed below. Systematic reviews focused on the influence of nature and outdoor play on children’s health found positive relationships with physical activity<sup>[<a href="#ref18">18</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref19">19</a>]</sup>, well-being <sup>[<a href="#ref16">16</a>]</sup>, and with lowering perceived stress<sup>[<a href="#ref12">12</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref18">18</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref20">20</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h3><em>Physical health</em></h3>
<p>Studies that assessed children’s independent mobility (i.e.,&nbsp;their level of freedom to travel and play in their neighbourhood without adult supervision)<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup> or the modification of play environments by adding loose parts, natural materials, and opportunities for risk-taking, showed increased levels of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day and decreased sedentary time<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref24">24</a>]</sup>. Risky play may also contribute to supporting engagement in physical activities for life, a concept known as ‘physical literacy’, which assumes individuals have the cognitive, affective, and physical skills to ensure lifelong physical activity-related behaviours. Physical literacy interventions have been shown to improve several outcomes related to physical activity and health<sup>[<a href="#ref25">25</a>]</sup> and to reduce the likelihood of injury in sport settings<sup>[<a href="#ref26">26</a>]</sup>. One recent study showed that outdoor play with loose parts provides children with opportunities to develop risk-assessment and fundamental movement skills through repeated movements, which are both components of physical literacy<sup>[<a href="#ref27">27</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Risky play may also contribute to modulating the immune system. A study published in 2020 showed that adding plants and natural or loose elements (e.g., logs, barrels, tires) to a daycare yard for digging and climbing led to increased skin bacterial diversity and modified gut microbiota in children (through changes in plasma cytokine levels and T-reg cell frequencies)<sup>[<a href="#ref28">28</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h3><em>Mental and social-emotional health</em></h3>
<p>In addition to the positive effects of adding loose materials to the environment, increasing risk and challenges in school playgrounds can be positive for children’s mental health. One study of rough-and-tumble play found that allowing this form of play at school led to more reports of pushing and shoving but fewer related to bullying. Rough-and-tumble play may help build resilience and conflict resolution skills in children<sup>[<a href="#ref29">29</a>]</sup>.<sup>&nbsp; </sup>Studies have also associated rough-and-tumble play with better problem-solving scores in boys<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup>. Following a 3-month school-based intervention providing risky play opportunities, teachers reported lower conflict sensitivity and higher self-esteem and concentration among children in Grade 4<sup>[<a href="#ref30">30</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>The literature appears to support opportunities for children to recognize and test their limits and tackle new challenges<sup>[<a href="#ref31">31</a>]</sup>. Theoretical papers have suggested that children engaging in risky play will increase their socio-emotional skills and sense of belonging<sup>[<a href="#ref32">32</a>]</sup>. Also, the ability to communicate, cooperate, and compromise with others improves in situations where children can test and push their own limits<sup>[<a href="#ref21">21</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref32">32</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref34">34</a>]</sup>. Risky play helps facilitate children’s exposure to fear-provoking situations<sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref17">17</a>]</sup>, providing them with opportunities to experiment with uncertainty, associated physiological arousal, and coping strategies, which can significantly reduce children’s risk for elevated anxiety<sup>[<a href="#ref9">9</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref35">35</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing the benefits of risk-taking with the possibility of injury</strong></h2>
<p>Injuries sustained during risky play are usually minor soft tissue injuries such as abrasions, contusions, and lacerations<sup>[<a href="#ref36">36</a>]</sup>. Studies on the incidence of risky play-related injuries have tended to focus on playground equipment height, surfacing, and fall-related injuries, with inconsistent results<sup>[<a href="#ref37">37</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref38">38</a>]</sup>. One study from New Zealand found fracture frequency and severity (mostly distal forearm) to be unrelated to the height of playground equipment<sup>[<a href="#ref37">37</a>]</sup>. However, a systematic review of risk factors for playground injuries did associate falls from playground equipment higher than 1.5 m with higher fracture odds<sup>[<a href="#ref38">38</a>]</sup>. While some stakeholders have asked for more scientific evidence confirming the safety of risky play<sup>[<a href="#ref39">39</a>]</sup>, the research has established that children are less likely to be injured while engaging in unstructured activities than when playing an organized sport<sup>[<a href="#ref40">40</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Head injuries and concussion are particularly concerning in children and youth. While both types of injury are increasing in sport<sup>[<a href="#ref41">41</a>]</sup> and playground environments<sup>[<a href="#ref42">42</a>]</sup>, data on incidence during outdoor risky play are lacking but believed anecdotally to be low. Analysis of the Canadian Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (CHIRPP) data on proportion of injury types sustained during popular childhood activities between April 2011 and January 2023 was revealing. The injury rate from climbing trees (195 cases per 100,000 CHIRPP records) was between 5 to 22 times lower than for other popular activities, such as indoor and outdoor soccer (4296 cases per 100,000), falls from playground equipment (4090 cases per 100,000), cycling (2816 cases per 100,000), and skateboarding (881 cases per 100,000)<sup>[<a href="#ref43">43</a>]</sup>.<sup>&nbsp; </sup>No child fatalities caused by falling from a tree have been reported in Canada in the past 20 years. Two playground-related fatalities occurred in Canada between 2007 and 2017<sup>[<a href="#ref44">44</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Some experts have attributed playground injuries to unexciting play structures. Low structures for all age groups and unnatural surfaces under play structures (e.g., synthetic surfacing rather than grass or sand) may lead to inappropriate equipment use and greater risk-taking<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. Bored children may resort to play&nbsp;indoors or on screens, which also has health consequences<sup>[<a href="#ref5">5</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref45">45</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>Is risky play equally appropriate for all child populations?</strong></h2>
<p>Concerns have been expressed regarding the unequal benefits of risky play for some populations, including Indigenous children, who face disproportionate levels of risk for injury in Canada<sup>[<a href="#ref46">46</a>]</sup>, and children who live in poverty or in marginalized neighborhoods<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>. The literature search for this statement did not find an ongoing project or published literature assessing the effects of risky play in First Nations, Inuit, and Métis children. Indigenous community perspectives on risky play and how to adapt the concept for their own realities are not yet known.</p>
<p>One Canadian study demonstrated that parents living in a marginalized neighbourhood are often concerned about ‘having no extra money for (children’s)&nbsp;play’ and the ‘physical safety of play spaces’<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>. A focus group of mothers new to Canada cited discarded needles, homeless people sleeping in parks, and proximity to the sex trade and drug users as barriers to outdoor play. These parents felt pressured to keep children indoors because they did not know and trust their neighborhood environments<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>. This research highlights the critical role of community programming, schools, and daycares in providing physical spaces, materials, and human resources toward ensuring safe, equitable access to outdoor play<sup>[<a href="#ref47">47</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Children with disabilities can benefit from engaging in risky play. A study demonstrated that over-protection and lowered expectations of children with a medical condition or disability can reduce their self-esteem and sense of ‘belonging’ as well as impede independence<sup>[<a href="#ref48">48</a>]</sup>. Encouraging children with a disability to engage in manageable risk-taking (i.e., activities they can assess for risk and control themselves) can promote autonomy and self-responsibility, and reduce social exclusion<sup>[<a href="#ref49">49</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref50">50</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>More research on the benefits and challenges of risky play for select populations is needed. In the meantime, however, making sure to include all children in risky play initiatives by accommodating and adapting play environments should be prioritized.</p>
<h2><strong>Reframing perceptions of risk</strong></h2>
<p>Protecting children from harm while ensuring their access to the opportunities and benefits of risky play can be challenging for parents, child care settings, and public policy-makers. Adults are responsible for providing the safe physical spaces and emotionally supportive environments that may also invite and optimize opportunities for spontaneous risky play. Such opportunities may include supervising children less closely (e.g., accepting that a child may climb higher, without a restraining hand or remaining at arm's length to break a fall). Ensuring there is time in a child’s schedule for free play, encouraging play with natural, loose parts (e.g., sticks, branches, or rocks), and allowing rough-and-tumble play are key conditions.</p>
<p>Communication and language around risk-taking is another factor that parents and educators may need to adapt in support of risky play. Cautions like ‘Be careful’, ‘Are you sure this is a good idea?’, ‘Slow down’, and ‘Not too high’ are often heard when supervising children. While caring adults usually mean ‘I love you’, ‘I care about you’, or ‘I worry about you’, children who are cautioned repeatedly may learn to hear: ‘You don’t trust me’ or ‘You don’t think I can do it’. Innocuous cautions, repeated often over time, can convey fear even when there is little or no danger present. Also, such ‘watchwords’ do not offer guidance for managing play in a risky situation, which can (again, used repeatedly over time) negatively influence children’s confidence in their own skills and decrease the appeal of active play<sup>[<a href="#ref50">50</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Some experts have suggested that parents practice pausing for 15 to 30 seconds to observe children’s ‘state of play’ before intervening<sup>[<a href="#ref51">51</a>]</sup>. The length of this pause depends on the individual child, situation, and activity being observed. When parents do intervene, their first focus can be on raising a child’s awareness of a situation or behaviour, then helping the child to manage a predicament or problem-solve (<a href="#Text box 2">Text box 2</a>).</p>

<h2><strong>Facilitating risky play opportunities for children</strong></h2>
<p>A 2012 review prioritized risky play for Canadian children based on extensive international experience<sup>[<a href="#ref1">1</a>]</sup>. In 2015, a multi-sectoral, inter-disciplinary group of active and healthy living, injury prevention, and insurance and legal experts published the first Canadian position statement on active outdoor play and promoting the implementation of risky play<sup>[<a href="#ref8">8</a>]</sup>. The Canadian Childcare Federation, the Canadian Public Health Association, and the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health have also addressed the need for unstructured risky play in position statements<sup>[<a href="#ref35">35</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref52[53">52[53</a>]</sup>. They, along with some provincial/territorial governments, have called for a shift in strategy to keep children “as safe as necessary” rather than “as safe as possible”. The YMCA mandated risky play training for their child care staff in Canada and have shared the experience of rolling out this initiative at their website<sup>[<a href="#ref54">54</a>]</sup>.</p>
<p>Tools for parents, early childhood educators, teachers, designers, and administrators to help with the implementation of outdoor risky play follow the recommendations<sup>[<a href="#ref35">35</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref44">44</a>]</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref55">55</a>]</sup><sup>-</sup><sup>[<a href="#ref62">62</a>]</sup>.</p>
<h2><strong>Recommendations </strong></h2>
<p>Child health care providers are well positioned to talk with families about the benefits of outdoor risky play for children’s development, healthy and active living, and social-emotional well-being.</p>
<p>To help shift the emphasis of children’s play toward greater risk-tolerance, paediatricians and other child health care providers are encouraged to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Educate families about the benefits of risky play as part of counselling and resource-sharing, alongside injury prevention, healthy eating, and purposeful screen time.</li>
<li>Add risky play to their ‘clinical toolbox’ to help prevent or manage obesity, anxiety, and behavioural issues.</li>
<li>‘Prescribe’ active outdoor free play as an alternative to recommending an optimal number of hours of exercise per day or week.</li>
<li>Help parents reframe their language around risk and hazard as children play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Public health authorities and government policy-makers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support early childhood educators (ECEs), teachers, municipal authorities, and community organizers with evidence for the benefits of spontaneous outdoor play, and funding to introduce and build on opportunities for risky play.</li>
<li>Help community, child care, and school settings comply with mandatory safety standards while improving opportunities for risky play.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Help advocate locally—with child care settings, schools, and public parks­—to enrich children’s play experiences by adding loose parts and natural elements and ensuring equitable access to risky play opportunities.</li>
<li>Help fund training for ECEs, school authorities, and community advocates regarding the benefits of risky play and how to optimize local opportunities to promote play, starting with these&nbsp;resources.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

The firm has filed cases against platforms including Meta, Snap, TikTok, and Discord.</p><p>Bergman, who has been practicing law since 1991,<strong> </strong>had a storied career in asbestos litigation before turning his attention to social media. Inspired by the testimony of Facebook whistleblower <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/24/frances-haugen-i-never-wanted-to-be-a-whistleblower-but-lives-were-in-danger" data-link-name="in body link">Frances Haugen</a>, Berman said he noticed a number of parallels between social media and asbestos. Both are products initially thought to be beneficial before being exposed as detrimental to human health, he said. The corporations involved brazenly tried to cover up the harms they knew were coming, he added.</p><p>“The confluence of these things made me think that this really was asbestos all over again,” Bergman said. “I saw this as an opportunity to do something different with my legal career – something more proactive.”</p><p>Lawsuits against social media firms over alleged harms have long struggled to see their day in court due to section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a federal law in the US that shields online platforms from liability for illegal actions of their users. With this in mind, Bergman took on a different tack, modeled after his days in asbestos litigation. Rather than arguing against content on the platforms, his firm leans on product liability laws and argues that the products are harmful by design.</p><p>“We’re not winning yet – we’re just getting in the game,” Bergman said. “It’s clear that this is going to be a long, hard fight.”</p><p>The Guardian spoke with Bergman about similarities between his history in asbestos litigation, his present focus on social media firms and his expectations for the upcoming Senate hearing.</p><p><strong>Can you start by talking about how the Social Media Victims Law Center came to exist?</strong></p><p>I founded the Social Media Victims Law Center in the fall of 2021. I had spent a career recovering money for injured victims, including over $1bn for asbestos victims over more than 20 years. But I reached the stage in life where I wanted to do something to not just compensate victims, but to stop people from becoming victims in the first place.</p><p>It coincided with the testimony of Francis Haugen before the Senate commerce committee, where she for the first time made clear what a lot of us suspected: that social media companies knowingly design products to addict kids – as well as the surgeon general’s <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/23/surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-about-effects-social-media-use-has-youth-mental-health.html" data-link-name="in body link">advisory on the youth mental health crisis</a> in the US, and around the world.</p><p><strong>What similarities have you seen between your career in asbestos litigation and your efforts to take on social media harms?</strong></p><p>These were some of the same dynamics that I had litigated in asbestos – namely, a ubiquitous product that is at least initially seen as a very good thing. When social media first came out, they thought this was going to save the world, that it was going to be a change for the better. With social media, like asbestos, you have a cause-and-effect relationship between a product and a disease manifesting in terms of a public health crisis. Whereas asbestos was the largest industrial carcinogen that was ever exposed to workers around the world, with social media we see a public health crisis emerging in the form of youth mental health and suicidality, as well as sexual abuse arising from social media.</p><p>As in asbestos, you also have outrageous corporate misconduct. The reason the asbestos companies took the hits that they did was because their documents showed that they knowingly exposed workers to a product that they had actual knowledge was going to kill them. And what we’ve seen from the social media companies is the same level of culpability. You look at Francis Haugen’s documents and see that they know their products make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/07/meta-facebook-employee-congress-testimony-instagram-child-harm-social-media" data-link-name="in body link">young girls feel worse</a> and give kids an addict’s mentality. We are seeing the same kinds of smoking gun documents that we saw in asbestos litigation.</p><p><strong>I know you’ve talked about a lot of the similarities between your asbestos litigation and social media. Are there any key differences or changes you’ve had to make to strategy?</strong></p><p>One of the key differences is that in asbestos litigation, the outrageous misconduct typically occurred decades before the manifestation of the disease in the exposed worker, whereas there is no latency period with social media.</p><p>The other difference is that we’re talking about young, vulnerable kids. The generation of clients that I previously represented – while they didn’t know about asbestos, they understood they may have to work a dangerous job to put food on the table for their family. In this case, the exposed cohort are kids that, by virtue of basic neurology, do not have the reasoning power to make that kind of cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>The third major difference is that nobody is addicted to asbestos. People worked around it without knowing about it. In this case, we know that social media is addictive. We thought until about a year ago that this was a behavioral addiction, but new evidence is suggesting that there is an actual physiological addiction and that among adolescents, there’s differential brain development in the hypothalamus based upon frequency of social media use.</p><p>I think these differences make social media much more morally reprehensible than asbestos – which is a hard thing to say, because I spent a career representing people who were dying because of asbestos companies’ misconduct. But I always say the conduct of the social media industry makes the asbestos companies and their CEOs look like a bunch of Boy Scouts.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-20">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-20" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p><strong>What about their behavior makes you say that? Is it just that they’re targeting such a vulnerable group of victims, or is it their legal strategies?</strong></p><p>Well, they’re addicting kids and they know it. They know the dopamine response diminishes over time as a young brain becomes habituated to particular stimuli, so the algorithms are designed to provide more and more discordant, disturbing and outrageous material in order to keep that level of engagement.</p><p>The other is that they are intentionally designed to take advantage of adolescents’ need for social acceptance and social status with gamification features such as Snap streaks, or how many friends you have, or how often you are engaged with directly. We now understand that the dopamine response to a “like” on social media for a 14-year-old is a similar response to a bump of cocaine of an older person. So it is not only a physiological process, but also a sociological process.</p><p><strong>Could you speak generally about your legal strategies with social media firms and how they are different from people attempting to go up against these companies in the past?</strong></p><p>Past attempts have focused more on inadequate content moderation – that the companies allowed a third party to post bullying, harassment or salacious content and didn’t remove it. That falls within traditional publishing protections, which are protected by section 230, so the courts have held up until now. To get around this, you’d have to focus on the design, which is what we are trying to do.</p><p><strong>Is this strategy similar to your asbestos career, in terms of focusing on failure to warn and product liability?</strong></p><p>Yes, the theory behind product liability is that you place the duty of creating a safe product in the hands of the party most able to make that product safe to manufacture. It’s basic Milton Friedman, Richard Posner economics; it’s not liberal woo-woo stuff.</p><p>What we are doing is seeking to adapt 1950s product liability concepts to 21st century products – by definition, it’s pouring old wine into new bottles, but that’s what lawyers do.</p><p><strong>You’ve talked a lot about your background with asbestos, but is there any other precedent for the kind of movement we’re seeing against </strong><strong>big </strong><strong>tech? I’ve seen it compared to tobacco and opioids.</strong></p><p>Just as social media companies have designed their algorithms to be addictive, we know tobacco companies knowingly manipulated nicotine levels in their products to make them more addictive – so there is a similarity there. The other similarity is that the tobacco companies marketed to young people, because they knew that lifetime smokers are often people that start smoking in their teens.</p><p><strong>It feels like there is generally a lot more support from both the public and legislators to rein in </strong><strong>big </strong><strong>tech recently, compared to the more free</strong><strong>wheeling early days of the internet. Why do you think the tide is turning on that?</strong></p><p>When the internet came out, it was greeted with a lot of optimism – we thought it was this thing that was going to bring people together, and make us a closer and more prosperous society. The addictiveness of the algorithmic design was really unknown. One of the reasons for that is because these companies have operated under this veil of immunity [due to section 230] and avoid the kind of public scrutiny that other companies have.</p><p>It took a while for the harms associated with social media to publicly manifest and be identified. In the 90s, there was a landmark hearing in which CEOs of tobacco companies stood in front of Congress and testified they did not believe that nicotine was addictive. I think the upcoming hearing has the possibility of the same level of historic significance – and hopefully, the same level of cure.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
The free-software community has managed to build a body of software that is
worth, by most estimates, many billions of dollars; all of this code is
freely available to anybody who wants to use or modify it.  It is an
unparalleled example of independent actors working cooperatively on a
common resource.  Free software is certainly a success story, but all is
not perfect.  One of the community's greatest strengths — convincing
companies to contribute to this common resource — is also part of one of
its biggest weaknesses.
</p><p>
The GNU project, as described by Richard Stallman in the 1985 <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html">GNU Manifesto</a>, looked
hopelessly ambitious at the time.  To many of us, it seemed that only large
companies could build operating systems, and that a group of volunteers
would never be able to aspire to such a goal.  The volunteers got
surprisingly far, to the point that, less than ten years after the GNU
Manifesto was published, running a system on only free software (or
something close to that) was possible.  It was an impressive achievement.
</p><p>
Even then, though, that software not entirely devoid of corporate
contributions.  The X&nbsp;Window System, for example, was the product of a
commercial consortium that predated Linux.  The development of GCC was
pushed forward by companies like Cygnus Computing.  When the Linux kernel
arrived on the scene, there was indeed a substantial body of GNU software
that could run on it, but there was a nontrivial amount of
company-contributed software as well.
</p><p>
Linux in the 1990s still lagged far behind the proprietary Unix systems in
many ways, even though it was better in others.  That began to change with
the arrival of corporate funding, which supercharged development on Linux
and on free software in general.  Without it, we would not have the system
we take for granted today.  Companies, working in their own interest, have
built up our body of free software hugely; it is almost as if this
capitalism thing actually works.
</p><p>
The problem, of course, is that these companies have a tendency to
interpret their own self-interest rather narrowly.  They will happily pay
to develop a driver for a hardware product, but they are less interested in
supporting the maintainership and review that are needed to integrate that
driver, the development of the subsystem into which the driver fits, or
the support the driver will need over the years.  Companies pay for
thousands of developers to work on the kernel, but none pays for a single
technical writer to create documentation.  Work that is not seen as
contributing to short-term revenue tends not to get much attention in the
corporate world.
</p><p>
There are, needless to say, numerous other pathologies exhibited by
corporations in the open-source community.  These include license
violations, free-riding, throwing code over the wall, and more.  Projects
that are controlled by a single company are often particularly problematic.
These difficulties have often been covered elsewhere; today the focus is on
the failure to support parts of the community that we all depend on.
</p><p>
Consider some recent examples of how this behavior affects the development
and user communities.
</p><p>
In a recent linux-kernel discussion, Kent Overstreet <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2uh4sgj5mqqkuv7h7fjlpigwjurcxoo6mqxz7cjyzh4edvqdhv@h2y6ytnh37tj/">complained</a>
about the lack of testing infrastructure for the kernel, calling it a
failure of leadership.  Greg Kroah-Hartman, instead, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/linux-kernel/2024011532-mortician-region-8302@gregkh/">said that
the problem lies elsewhere</a>: "<q>No, they fall into the 'no company
wants to pay someone to do the work' category, so it doesn't get done.</q>"
He pointed out that there is not much the leadership (such as it is in the
kernel community) can do in a situation like this.  So testing
infrastructure for the kernel tends to languish.
</p><p>
Also recently, Konstantin Ryabitsev, the keeper of kernel.org and the
author of the <a href="https://people.kernel.org/monsieuricon/introducing-b4-and-patch-attestation">b4
tool</a>, <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/Ae0x6yb73Oinx4WznE">apologized</a>
for a lack of progress with b4, observing that he has not been able to get
the go-ahead to put time into that work.  He later <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/Ae2y1fgYQjHQ7R1xDc">clarified</a>
that post: "<q>it just means that we haven't properly reallocated resources
to allow me to prioritize tooling work</q>".  He has a lot of demands on
his time, and b4 has not been able to rise to the top of the list.
</p><p>
This matters; anybody who has been watching kernel development over the
last few years has seen that b4 has transformed the maintainer's task in
many ways.  It must have paid back the effort that went into its
development many times over.  The kernel community has never put the effort
into tooling that it needs; the advent of b4 was a change in that pattern
and one that we would all like to see continue.
</p><p>
One can easily criticize the Linux Foundation (LF) for not supporting this
work at the level that we would like.  But the fact of the matter is that
the LF is about the only entity that has supported this work <i>at all</i>;
without that support, we would not have b4.  So, while encouraging the LF
to more strongly support b4 is a good thing to do, it is also worth asking
why no other company has seen fit to support that work, despite the fact
that they have all benefited from it.  The incentives that drive companies
(and their managers) simply leave little room for this kind of work, even
though the benefits from it would be real and immediate.
</p><p>
In a different part of our community, a discussion on the upcoming <a href="https://news.opensuse.org/2024/01/15/clear-course-is-set-for-os-leap/">openSUSE
Leap 16</a> distribution has led to <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/opensuse-factory/9B42BF3F-2D93-4FCF-A479-DE292AC9F989@opensuse.org/">fears</a>
that this version of the distribution will not support packages like KDE or
Thunderbird — fears that are arguably getting ahead of the game, since they
have not yet been confirmed by SUSE.  Such a move would seem similar to Red
Hat's <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/933525/">decision to drop LibreOffice</a> from Red
Hat Enterprise Linux.  Support from companies for the Linux desktop, it
seems, is threatened.
</p><p>
Once again, it comes down to corporate priority setting, though with a
slightly different driving force.  Companies like Red Hat and SUSE (and a
number of others) have supported Linux desktop development heavily for many
years.  But that investment is not seen as paying off.  As Neal Gompa <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/opensuse-factory/CAEg-Je_+Di-kn=k5Nd76Bx0DHdRkK9Mx8jHQ=izHkuunAACLgA@mail.gmail.com/">put
it</a> in the Leap discussion:
</p><blockquote>
	Have you ever wondered why KDE was deprecated in RHEL? It wasn't
	just because KDE Plasma 5 was so big that they couldn't make the
	jump for RHEL 8, it was also because people were not paying for
	RHEL for the desktop, so they had no budget for more people. It
	happened again with the layoffs at Red Hat last year. SUSE is no
	different. And Ubuntu?  Canonical already did their big layoff in
	2017 where they laid off hundreds of staff related to the desktop.
</blockquote>
<p>
In many parts of the system, the work that leads to some company making
money just happens to benefit all of us, even if we are not directly paying
for it.  But, seemingly, that path toward making money is more elusive in
the desktop realm; those of us who are using desktop Linux are not
generally paying for the privilege, and neither is anybody else.  So the
resources going into desktop development are reduced, and Linux desktop
users will feel the effects of that.
</p><p>
Then, consider <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pypi-account-recovery-process-triaging-on-halt/43422/50">this
ongoing discussion</a> in the Python community about funding for the PyPI
repository.  As "fungi" put it:
</p><blockquote>
	Companies are unlikely to fund open source communities that are
	critical to their own business because “someone else will do it,”
	so it ends up falling on a handful of volunteers and people
	donating their own time after hours because they’re already being
	paid to work full time on other stuff.
</blockquote>
<p>
There are few projects in our community that do not contain this kind of
neglected area.
</p><p>
Solutions to these problems are not easy to come by.  Criticizing companies
for a failure to support the ecosystem they depend on can have results, but
only to a point.  Organizations like the LF can organize resources toward
the solution of common problems, but they have to please the same companies
that are paying their bills in the end.  Governments can help to fund areas
that the market has passed over; that path gets harder in the absence of a
functioning government, which is the situation to varying degrees in many
parts of the world at the moment.
</p><p>
If we cannot find a solution, we are likely to be forced back to our roots,
depending on volunteers to do the work in areas that companies decline to
fund.  That can be successful, but often at a high cost to the people who
are doing that work.  Depending on volunteers is not an inclusive approach;
there are a lot of people who do not have the luxury of giving many hours
of their time to this kind of project.  Progress in that world will be
slow.
</p><p>
The community that has accomplished so much over the last few decades
should be capable of doing better than that.  We have solved many problems
getting to the point we are at now — problems that few thought we would be
able to overcome; we should be able to find a way around these difficulties
as well.  It will be interesting to see what we come up with.<br clear="all"></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p> Good morning from the T3 Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. A few hundred of the most successful executives in wealth tech are here this week to talk about the products and services they’re building for financial advisors all over America. Everyone is here. This is the 20th anniversary of the event and the founder, Joel Bruckenstein, should be very pleased with the turnout - not just in terms of quantity but the quality of the crowd. </p><p> It should come as no surprise that the buzzword of the event this year is AI. People are very excited, and with good reason. There is a shortage of talent in the financial advisory space - one that will persist throughout the course of the decade as the number of wealthy people continues to explode and the eldest generation of advisors ages out and retires en masse. Serving the next generation of wealth while still taking care of prior generations is going to require firms and staffers to scale themselves with technology. We’re all going to have to provide more service, for more people, than ever before. </p><p> AI is going to play a role in this but perhaps not in the way many would think. There are two versions of the AI premise and both could be valid. Version one is a handful of new companies will utilize AI to replace human advisors and serve clients directly via chatbots and suggestion engines. The responsiveness will provide the right amount of verisimilitude to make people feel like they’re being heard and cared for and listened to and understood. This premise is wrong if we’re talking about the traditional bread-and-butter client for registered investment advisors of $1 million to $25 million in household wealth. </p><p> If we’re talking about the mass affluent - $100,000 to $1 million in investable assets - it’s possible that there could be one or two companies that can build a business this way, but you wouldn’t want to be an investor on those cap tables. It’ll be one more race-to-zero business a la the robo-advisors I’ve recently written the eulogy for (<a href="https://thereformedbroker.com/2023/05/27/the-bet/?utm_source=www.downtownjoshbrown.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rich-people-don-t-talk-to-robots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">read ‘The Bet’</a>, which is my definitive history of the rise and fall of robo ). </p><div><p> The venture backers in Silicon Valley made the bet 12 years ago that the robo-advisors would start off with lower income, younger customers and perfect their product before moving up the value chain and displacing the middle, then the high-end players in the industry. This is classic Clay Christensen-style disruption where a competitor starts at the bottom and works its way up, shocking the incumbents with its ability to crush margins and gobble up share. </p><p>This has not happened. And I told you it wouldn’t happen. And here is why: Rich people don’t talk to robots. </p></div><div><p> I have been around wealthy people more than half my life at this point in a professional and personal context. I have worked for and with thousands of wealthy families. And the number one thing you do when you have lots of money is you pay people to deal with stuff. You trade your money for time and convenience. You make sure that you are paying people enough so that when you have a question, they are incentivized to pick up the telephone. Rich people do not attempt to save money on professional services and advice. They don’t want the cheapest doctor, lawyer, accountant, personal trainer, financial advisor, psychologist, college advisor, etc. They want the best available and, within reason, they are happy to pay for it so long as they feel they are getting value for their money. </p><p>Rich people don’t attempt to save money by agreeing to sit on hold. They don’t want to engage with recordings, email chains, chatbots, webinars, call centers, customer service hotlines or any of that shit. What is the point of being wealthy and successful if you can’t afford to be taken care of and have knowledgable, accountable professionals at your beck and call. </p></div><p> You have to have lived most of your life on Mars or among inexperienced college students to not understand this. I’m amazed at how many people still need to have it explained to them. “Literally, have you ever met a rich American before? Are you from another galaxy?” </p><p> This is how I feel about the people I see pitching a new wave of B2C AI financial advisory products. I won’t say this to their faces but if I were less diplomatic, I might be like “You are most definitely wasting your time, although I will concede that some of you will be able to trick an incumbent into overpaying to acquire your startup.” One hundred “AI Advice” startups will launch and get funded in the next three years. Two or three will get close to scale and then plateau once they’ve run out of the percentage of the population for whom the movie “Her” seemed like an idyllic modern-day love story (It’s Joaquin Phoenix falling hard for the voice programmed into his phone). </p><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/45c7fcc1-a7f9-4bd0-ba90-88f97d9e1fdc/image.png?t=1706113804"></p><p> Most people don’t want this for themselves. If you’re going direct-to-consumer with an AI advice offering, count your TAM in the tens of thousands of people, not the tens of millions, and recognize that as your typical customer’s wealth grows, so too will the cost of their lifestyle, the complexity of their situation and the anxiety level that comes along with that. </p><div><p>Wealthy people are going to want to talk to a person about their problems, no matter how well the parlor trick has succeeded in faking empathy when their portfolio was smaller. </p></div><p id="susan"><h2>Susan</h2></p><p> I have a travel agent. In the Year of Our Lord 2024, indeed, I work with a professional for booking hotels and restaurant reservations and attractions and flights and planning the itinerary. How much does it cost? Some trips are too expensive to not pay for a professional to help you plan and execute. </p><p> For most of my business travel and weekend trips, I just book on Delta’s website or the JetBlue app. No problem. Cheapest price for a good seat on a timely flight, decent hotel room in the right part of town. But then there is a trip with meaning. Something you will remember for the rest of your life. When I’m taking Sprinkles to the Amalfi Coast or bringing the kids to Paris for the trip of a lifetime, I’m not interested in spending $20,000 and making all kinds of mistakes. Wrong resort, bad transportation, third best tour boat company, dealing with the concierge, picking a mediocre restaurant, etc. You’re going to spend a lot of money for a trip like this no matter what. And most people can’t afford to do it twice. There are too many other places to see. So for god’s sake, do it right if you can. Save the money on something else. </p><p> If I spend 25k instead of 20k and the trip is flawless, it’s money well spent. You can’t do that all the time but when it counts it’s worth every penny. Showing up at the Il San Pietro and the entire staff has been prepped for your arrival solely because Susan booked you (I can’t reveal her identity because I don’t want her to get too busy for me, LOL) - that’s next level shit. Being at all the very best restaurants and doing things in the right order and getting upgraded everywhere you go, getting better pricing where possible, VIP entrances to attractions, guides taking you into museums through a special door, saving you time so you can see and do more - that’s whats’s up. You can’t do that for yourself. You don’t have the experience or the connections. Nor would you want to. Booking amazing trips is the job of a professional. </p><p> Susan doesn’t compete with Expedia. That’s not her business. I don’t call her to set up two nights in Boca Raton. She only adds value at higher levels of travel when it really matters. The big trips. The milestones. And if you’ve ever taken a poorly-planned but expensive trip, you understand this. It’s not Bougie. It’s the opposite - knowing how to spend money is a whole different skill than knowing how to earn money or how to save money. I see people spending money like donkeys everywhere I turn. Three years ago there were people buying jpeg files for millions of dollars. It’s an epidemic. We live in a Donkey Republic. </p><p> Now my example above is just travel. Substitute “vacations” for “financial planning and portfolio management.” Then tell me if you still think wealthy people want discounted advice delivered via software. </p><p id="b-2-b-wins"><h2>B2B Wins</h2></p><p> On the other hand, I think AI solutions for the industry are going to be absolutely transformative. I am as bullish about the prospect of AI tools to augment human financial planners as I am skeptical about the B2C opportunity. This, to me, is the real revolution we’re about to experience. Advisors who are currently taking care of $100 million in client household assets (this is somewhat of an industry standard benchmark for success) are going to find that they’re able to cater to a practice approaching $200 or even $300 million with the same time commitment and effort. This will be the new expectation that wealth management firms have for their advisor employees. The benchmarking studies will reflect this upgrade a decade from now. Everyone is going to be equipped and expected to do more. </p><div><p><img alt="" src="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4581f26c-adad-4f79-b3c8-9c1c7dd8c85a/IMG_3456.jpeg?t=1706116040"></p><p><small><p>Michael and I talking to Rich Cancro of AdvisorEngine on stage at T3</p></small></p></div><p> As we speak, AI tools to address every advisor pain point imaginable are now underway. One of the most cumbersome and time-consuming tasks that a senior advisor must complete each day is the summation of their last client meeting on Salesforce or other CRM after the conversation. The advisor documents everything that was discussed (both for service purposes but also for compliance reasons). This takes a lot of the advisor’s time and the client is already off the phone and long gone. </p><p> The advisor is not getting any credit for this post-meeting drudgery in the eyes of the client. They don’t even know about it. The client feels as though they had 45 minutes of their advisor’s time that morning. Great! What don’t realize is that once that’s over, the actual work begins. The advisor is documenting everything and checking off all sorts of boxes and bubbles on a variety of pages and platforms. Emails and Slack instructions are being prepared so that the firm’s traders and client service associates know which account to move which funds from, what trades need to be done in order to facilitate the dictates from the client meeting, what IRA needs funding, what paperwork needs to be Docusigned, which beneficiary updates need to be reviewed, etc. And every single instruction issued by the advisor to his or her co-workers must be verified, followed up on, noted, approved, explained, and more. </p><p> That’s how a 45 minute phone call turns into two hours of highly skilled labor for three or four people at a firm. Multiply this by four or five client meetings in a single day, then by five days in a week, 20 business days in a month. Then multiply it by the number of advisors a firm employs. It’s a huge lift. It’s not hard to see where the time goes and why the modern human advisor is constrained by the burden of their work. </p><p> Now imagine an AI digital agent that rides along with the advisor during a client phone call, silently documenting everything being discussed or suggested. The call ends, the client goes about her day. The advisor sees a summary of the call pop up on the screen in front of them, pre-populating the CRM with bullet points of the specifics while noting the time, date and topics addressed. Then an email window pops with a pre-populated paragraph instructing the advisor’s client service assistant with exactly what needs to happen as a result of the call. The advisor can edit manually or approve. “Jody, please transfer $50,000 to donor advised fund for Gilligan and Ginger. Dial back tax loss harvesting in account ending 8784 as funds need to be available by Wednesday. Update IRA beneficiary on recently transferred account with social security and date of birth for dependents Hayden and Jayden.” </p><p> An hour of post-meeting follow-up becomes a minute. The assistant’s AI is awaiting these instructions from the advisor’s AI. Jody is overseeing it all and directing traffic. Her capacity is multiplying at the same rate as the capacity of the advisors she is assisting. Everyone in the firm has their own AI assistant, This is enabling the firm to serve more people and double the amount of their time that’s dedicated to the only thing that truly matters - talking to clients. In this industry, every minute we spend empowering and encouraging our clients is a minute worth its weight in gold. Every minute we spend doing clerical tasks better suited to the computer is a minute that could have been spent better. AI is coming to change the game. As a business owner and a client service aficionado, I am here for it! </p><p> And <i>that</i> is how AI is going to save the industry from buckling under the demand coming our way. </p><p> Rich people don’t want to talk to the machine. But if you can talk to the machine for them to make their lives better, you’re going to win. </p><p> It’s coming. You should be excited. </p><p id="apples-vision-pro-sells-out"><h2>Apple’s Vision Pro sells out</h2></p><p> Michael and I just did an all new episode of <i>What Are Your Thoughts</i>. We talked about the new all-time highs set by the S&amp;P 500 this week as well as the news that Apple has sold a ton of its first Vision Pro headsets right out of the gate. The Netflix for WWE news is in here too. I pitched him Snap Inc as an investment idea and also took a look at current market sentiment. It’s a great episode, you’ll love it. </p><div><p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="100%" src="https://youtube.com/embed/roQLbEKehfI" width="100%"></iframe></p></div><p id="carbone-las-vegas"><h2>Carbone Las Vegas </h2></p><p> We live in a world of hype and almost everything ends up being a disappointment. I have found that the anticipation of most things is a superior sensation to the actual getting of things these days. </p><p> But not always. Sometimes things measure up. They deliver. </p><p> I’m a New Yorker so when one of our restaurants opens in Vegas, Miami or London, I laugh to myself and say “can you imagine the a**hole waiting in line for that in a casino?” </p><p> Well, it’s not always like that. Carbone Las Vegas delivered. If you love the original in NYC, you will very much like its Vegas facsimile. They got the important stuff right if you can look past the mega-scale of the place. The food is great, the service is on point, the crowd is attractive. Lakers great Rick Fox was sitting next to us. He accidentally bumped Batnick on his way to the table and politely apologized. That was cool. Howard Lindzon had Michael, Joe Fahmy and I laughing for hours as the plates kept coming.

<article>
  
  <span><time datetime="2013-05-29">29 May 2013</time></span>
  <p>Since I haven't published anything in almost two months, let me jot down one thought that has come to mind frequently over the past few months.</p>
<h2>If you use LaTeX …</h2>
<p>Well, first of all, are you sure you <em>have to</em> use LaTeX? By which I mean, are you sure you can't use Markdown+MathJax or textile+MathJax or restructuredText+MathJax? Especially if you're teaching your students, are you absolutely sure you are completely and utterly unable to use something simpler? Something that is more modern than learning a hundred bits of print typesetting that your student will never, ever need? Ok, just checking. So…</p>
<h2>If you (have to) use LaTeX, then make HTML your primary output.</h2>
<p>By which I mean: don't just produce PDFs that nobody can read on small screens, PDFs that nobody can read accessibly, PDFs that nobody will want to read in 5 years.</p>
<p>Make HTML your first output. It's important. HTML is the future engine for mathematical and scientific content. If you can't produce HTML, then ur doin it rong. If you don't produce HTML, you won't ever help all the people working on pushing math on the web forward.</p>
<p>It won't be trivial but easier than you think. Install <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/a">LaTeXML</a> and learn how to use it. (Alternatively you probably have a copy of tex4ht installed with your TeX.) How hard is it? This hard:</p>
<pre><code>  latexml --dest=mydoc.xml mydoc.tex
  latexmlpost --dest=mydoc.html --format=html5 mydoc.xml
</code></pre>
<p>And when you run into LaTeXML limitations, then get over it, <a href="http://dlmf.nist.gov/LaTeXML/contact.html">report them back</a>, help make it better. If you run into problems with MathJax, <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax/issues">report them</a>, help make it better. You need graphics? Check out <a href="https://github.com/sonoisa/XyJax">xyjax</a>. You need pstricks? Check out <a href="http://mathapedia.com/">mathapedia</a>. You need computations? Check out <a href="http://www.sagemath.org/eval.html">Sage cell server</a>. It's all there, but you have to get started. To it today.</p>
<p>But if you've ever wanted math to be native on the web, then you have to realize that it <strong>won't happen without your help</strong>.</p>
<p>If you're too lazy for converting (e.g., when you're teaching), then use something that compiles to both TeX and HTML (like markdown+MathJax etc). Pick a decent tool for it, like <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute">Qute</a>, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/">ReText</a>, write on the web with <a href="http://fiduswriter.com/">FidusWriter</a> or <a href="http://authorea.com/">Authorea.com</a>, write in your favorite Mac-editor with <a href="http://markedapp.com/">Marked</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview">extend sublimetext</a>, on an iPad app use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/writing-kit-research-write/id426208994">Writing Kit</a> -- and that's just off the top of my head; there are many more editing environments that offer good syntax and MathJax integration. Many can save to TeX documents, anything can be converted via <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">pandoc</a>. It's not perfect yet but it won't get better unless you give everybody some feedback.</p>
<p>So, if you can, don't author LaTeX, author <em>into</em> LaTeX. And whatever you do, compile it to HTML. It's important.</p>

<p><em>Comments</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>michalh21</strong>, 2013/05/30<br>
For LaTeX to html conversion, I would really recommend tex4ht, its problem is fragmentation of documentation, some information is completely missing, but on the other side it can convert any LaTeX document, it can be even configured to convert tikz pictures to svg, or to output math as <a href="http://www.albany.edu/~hammond/demos/Html5/arXiv/" rel="nofollow">mathml with mathjax rendering</a><br>
I think it is a good idea to output html for people who wants to read on tablets or smart phones, but personally, I still prefer to read PDFs, even on my laptop or PC. For me, PDF has advantage in better readability. HTML even with most recent trends like web fonts and responsive typography is still far behind PDF in this regard. Other advantage is pagination, it helps me with orientation in document. Maybe not so many readers pay attention to such things today, but I think majority of writers in LaTeX wouldn't like how bad their documents look in HTML.<br>
And last point :) I don't really think LaTeX is hard. For things that markdown etc. supports, like sections, tables, links or footnotes, it is only few commands to learn, every editor today supports snippets for fast inserting these commands, you can use templates for document preamble etc. And when you want to use things like referencing, bibliographies, indexing, glossaries etc, using LaTeX is much easier. Plus, for new functionality, you can write your own macros, which is easier than modifying markdown parser and inventing new syntax :)
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
Thanks for your comments. tex4ht is certainly a nice and powerful tool. But there’s a fundamental difference: it’s really a dvi-to-html converter, not a LaTeX-to-html one. That allows it to circumvent a lot of problems (by letting the TeX binary do all the hard work) but also comes with losses since LaTeX is semantically richer than TeX/DVI (something that’s visible in the quality of the MathML output last time I tried it).<br>
I understand that most people find PDFs better. IMO, HTML has much more potential than PDF to provide a better reading experience, with rich content and easy interaction with other web content (and of course PDFs are virtually inaccessible). My main point was merely that we won’t get there if we don’t get started. Authors, in any case, should care more about their readers than their own reading experience. They can, after all, produce whatever they like for themselves whereas a reader rarely has that option. (Personally, I prefer my handwritten notes but that won’t help anyone given my illegible hand writing)<br>
I’m definitely not trying to tell people what they should use. Certainly, an experienced user often finds LaTeX the most flexible and powerful tool (TeX is a programming language, after all). But this power brings an awful lot of problems with it and in almost all situation that power is not needed. So I do like to argue for the right tool for the job instead, especially in educational settings — and above all, I would like to argue for conversion. No tool or format is perfect. But any content that cannot be converted to something else is (for better or worse) at a dead end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Norman Lewis Perlmutter</strong>, 2013/06/04<br>
Given that LaTeX already compiles into pdf, might it be better to use or develop a pdf to html converter? This would have the added benefit of being able to convert pdf files not generated by LaTeX into html.
<ul>
<li><strong>Peter</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
The short answer is: no. PDF is a very “loss-ful” format. The only way to extract e.g. mathematical content is by using heuristics, i.e., guessing from the placement what kind of expression was actually used. While converters like pdf.js do a good job at reproducing the layout, they do not really convert to HTML, they merely render it (much like a printer) — the output is inaccessible, doesn’t reflow well etc. TeX to HTML is already very solid and used in big publishing houses. Automatic conversion is perhaps at 95% — but to get to 100% (which is needed), the open source projects out there need feedback.<br>
Since the conversion from for strictly mathematical TeX to MathML is very solid, it’s much easier to go directly anyway. The only remaining problem are the messy packages, in particular the graphical packages that could either be converted to static graphics (like LaTeXML or tex4ht do) or re-implemented in javascript (like xyjax or mathapedia).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>jessemckeown</strong>. 2013/06/06<br>
Well, I’m doing my very little bit, then; since you mention it, though, is there any plan to eventually absorb xyjax into the main mathjax? AMScd does do the arrows nicer than putting <code>\to</code> and <code>\downarrow</code> in a <code>\begin{array}\end{array}</code>, but…
<ul>
<li><strong>jessemckeown</strong>, 2013/06/06<br>
Oh, I forgot to make sure of the right website…</li>

<p><img alt="AMD" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/amd.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
With the AMD Ryzen 7040 series "Ryzen AI" was introduced as leveraging Xilinx IP onboard the new Zen 4 mobile processors. Ryzen AI is beginning to work its way out to more processors while <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Ryzen-AI-Open-Source-Demo">it hasn't been supported on Linux</a>. Then in October was <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Ryzen-AI-For-Linux-Requests">AMD wanting to hear from customer requests around Ryzen AI Linux support</a>. Well, today they did their first public code drop of the XDNA Linux driver for providing open-source support for Ryzen AI.

More than 1,000 requests for Linux support were logged following that October statement and since then I've been hearing quietly of AMD working on Linux support... Well, there's now an open-source but currently out-of-tree driver available. The XDNA driver will work with AMD Phoenix/Strix SoCs so far having Ryzen AI onboard. AMD has tested the driver to work on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS but you will need to be running the Linux 6.7 kernel or newer with IOMMU SVA support enabled. The Xilinx XRT software also needs to be built to work with this kernel driver. So far is a simple test script for verifying that your driver stack is currently setup.

<p>Those wanting to check out this XDNA open-source Linux driver can find it via <a href="https://github.com/amd/xdna-driver">amd/xdna-driver on GitHub</a>.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=ryzen_ai_1" alt="AMD Ryzen AI"></p>
<p>The documentation doesn't yet outline any upstreaming plans they have for this driver to get it into the mainline kernel or if they will just be maintaining it out-of-tree or what all their Linux support plans entail. In any event I'll be working on getting more information about their Ryzen AI / XDNA Linux plans for future article(s) on Phoronix as well as getting to trying this driver out once knowing the software support expectations.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The study, led by Canadian federal scientists, adds to other research that found Alberta's oil sands were underreporting climate changing carbon emissions.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="524" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Aircraft flying over Alberta’s oil sands have found emissions of organic carbon — a primary driver of air pollution — between 1,900 per cent and 6,300 per cent higher than industry has reported.</p>

<p>That’s more than all the organic carbon pollution emitted across Canada combined, according to the new study, led by Canadian federal scientists and published in the journal Science Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drew Gentner, a researcher at Yale University’s Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering and one of 24 co-authors of&nbsp;the&nbsp;study, said the previously unaccounted for emissions from the Athabasca oil sands were largely made up of volatile organic compounds overlooked in routine monitoring. He said they were surprised by the massive gap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“These compounds are important reactive chemicals in the atmosphere with implications for air quality and the environment,” said Gentner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those compounds react with sunlight to produce fine particulate matter — which is linked to major health and climate effects — and gases like ozone, a key component of smog and leading cause of pollution in Canadian cities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Organic carbon pollution levels were found to be more than 1,500 per cent higher than U.S. mega-cities like Los Angeles, Calif., a city long known for smog.</p>

<p>Ozone has also been known to reduce wheat crop yields by up to a third, costing agriculture&nbsp;in East Asia up to US$63 billion a year, according to one 2022 <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-021-00422-6" target="_blank">study</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Depending on the pollutant, air quality impacts can span from nearby communities in the region (e.g., Fort&nbsp;McMurray, Indigenous communities) to downwind impacts on humans and the environment,” said Gentner in an email.</p>

<p>Past monitoring has failed to capture the full scope of organic carbon pollution because it wasn’t looking at a diverse enough range of molecular sizes often associated with heavy oil and bitumen deposits. Such deposits&nbsp;are expected to account for 40 per cent of global oil production by 2040, the study found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an estimated 1.7 trillion barrels of oil, the Alberta oil sands make up most of Canada’s oil production and a large share of its carbon pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Study the latest evidence industry is underreporting&nbsp;emissions</h3>

<p>In a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/5/pgad140/7127723?login=false" target="_blank">study</a> released last April, some of the same researchers at Environment and Climate Change Canada used aircraft, satellite and historical data to reassess climate changing emissions from the oil sands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They found the oil-producing region could be producing 31 million tonnes of unreported carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year — 65 per cent higher than industry reported.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest study found organic carbon pollution to be 20 to 64 times greater than&nbsp;reported in Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory, which is required the report the entire range of volatile organic compounds. That’s 13 per cent more than Canada’s entire annual output of organic carbon emissions.</p>

<p>“Measured [volatile organic compounds] only account for a fraction of total measured organic carbon,” said the study.</p>

<p>“Thus, the oil sands sector alone represents a dominant fraction of country-wide gas-phase organic carbon emissions, even when only including the facilities studied here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researchers concluded that current surveillance of organic carbon pollution would need to change if Canada were to accurately report the full air quality and environmental impacts of the oil sands operations.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2>Command-line Tools can be 235x Faster than your Hadoop Cluster</h2><h3 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h3><p>As I was browsing the web and catching up on some sites I visit periodically, I found a cool article from <a href="https://tomhayden3.com/2013/12/27/chess-mr-job/">Tom Hayden</a> about using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/">Amazon Elastic Map Reduce</a> (EMR) and <a href="https://github.com/Yelp/mrjob">mrjob</a> in order to compute some statistics on win/loss ratios for chess games he downloaded from the <a href="https://www.top-5000.nl/pgn.htm">millionbase archive</a>, and generally have fun with EMR. Since the data volume was only about 1.75GB containing around 2 million chess games, I was skeptical of using Hadoop for the task, but I can understand his goal of learning and having fun with mrjob and EMR. Since the problem is basically just to look at the result lines of each file and aggregate the different results, it seems ideally suited to stream processing with shell commands. I tried this out, and for the same amount of data I was able to use my laptop to get the results in about 12 seconds (processing speed of about 270MB/sec), while the Hadoop processing took about 26 minutes (processing speed of about 1.14MB/sec).</p><p>After reporting that the time required to process the data with 7 c1.medium machine in the cluster took 26 minutes, Tom remarks</p><blockquote><p>This is probably better than it would take to run serially on my machine but probably not as good as if I did some kind of clever multi-threaded application locally.</p></blockquote><p>This is absolutely correct, although even serial processing may beat 26 minutes. Although Tom was doing the project for fun, often people use Hadoop and other so-called <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools for real-world processing and analysis jobs that can be done faster with simpler tools and different techniques.</p><p>One especially under-used approach for data processing is using standard shell tools and commands. The benefits of this approach can be massive, since creating a data pipeline out of shell commands means that all the processing steps can be done in parallel. This is basically like having your own <a href="https://storm-project.net/">Storm</a> cluster on your local machine. Even the concepts of Spouts, Bolts, and Sinks transfer to shell pipes and the commands between them. You can pretty easily construct a stream processing pipeline with basic commands that will have extremely good performance compared to many modern <em>Big Data (tm)</em> tools.</p><p>An additional point is the batch versus streaming analysis approach. Tom mentions in the beginning of the piece that after loading 10000 games and doing the analysis locally, that he gets a bit short on memory. This is because all game data is loaded into RAM for the analysis. However, considering the problem for a bit, it can be easily solved with streaming analysis that requires basically no memory at all. The resulting stream processing pipeline we will create will be over 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation and use virtually no memory.</p><h3 id="learn-about-the-data"><a href="#learn-about-the-data">Learn about the data</a></h3><p>The first step in the pipeline is to get the data out of the PGN files. Since I had no idea what kind of format this was, I checked it out on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation">Wikipedia</a>.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia Yugoslavia|JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]
(moves from the game follow...)
</code></pre><p>We are only interested in the results of the game, which only have 3 real outcomes. The 1-0 case means that white won, the 0-1 case means that black won, and the 1/2-1/2 case means the game was a draw. There is also a <em>-</em> case meaning the game is ongoing or cannot be scored, but we ignore that for our purposes.</p><h3 id="acquire-sample-data"><a href="#acquire-sample-data">Acquire sample data</a></h3><p>The first thing to do is get a lot of game data. This proved more difficult than I thought it would be, but after some looking around online I found a git repository on GitHub from <a href="https://github.com/rozim/ChessData">rozim</a> that had plenty of games. I used this to compile a set of 3.46GB of data, which is about twice what Tom used in his test. The next step is to get all that data into our pipeline.</p><h3 id="build-a-processing-pipeline"><a href="#build-a-processing-pipeline">Build a processing pipeline</a></h3><p><em>If you are following along and timing your processing, don’t forget to clear your OS page cache as otherwise you won’t get valid processing times.</em></p><p>Shell commands are great for data processing pipelines because you get parallelism for free. For proof, try a simple example in your terminal.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>sleep <span>3</span> | echo <span>"Hello world."</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Intuitively it may seem that the above will sleep for 3 seconds and then print <code>Hello world</code> but in fact both steps are done at the same time. This basic fact is what can offer such great speedups for simple non-IO-bound processing systems capable of running on a single machine.</p><p>Before starting the analysis pipeline, it is good to get a reference for how fast it could be and for this we can simply dump the data to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p><p>In this case, it takes about 13 seconds to go through the 3.46GB, which is about 272MB/sec. This would be a kind of upper-bound on how quickly data could be processed on this system due to IO constraints.</p><p>Now we can start on the analysis pipeline, the first step of which is using <code>cat</code> to generate the stream of data.</p><p>Since only the result lines in the files are interesting, we can simply scan through all the data files, and pick out the lines containing ‘Results’ with <code>grep</code>.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will give us only the <code>Result</code> lines from the files. Now if we want, we can simply use the <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> commands in order to get a list of all the unique items in the file along with their counts.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | sort | uniq -c
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a very straightforward analysis pipeline, and gives us the results in about 70 seconds. While we can certainly do better, assuming linear scaling this would have taken the Hadoop cluster approximately 52 minutes to process.</p><p>In order to reduce the speed further, we can take out the <code>sort | uniq</code> steps from the pipeline, and replace them with AWK, which is a wonderful tool/language for event-based data processing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>cat *.pgn | grep <span>"Result"</span> | awk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will take each result record, split it on the hyphen, and take the character immediately to the left, which will be a 0 in the case of a win for black, a 1 in the case of a win for white, or a 2 in the case of a draw. Note that <code>$0</code> is a built-in variable that represents the entire record.</p><p>This reduces the running time to approximately 65 seconds, and since we’re processing twice as much data this is a speedup of around 47 times.</p><p>So even at this point we already have a speedup of around 47 with a naive local solution. Additionally, the memory usage is effectively zero since the only data stored is the actual counts, and incrementing 3 integers is almost free in memory space terms. However, looking at <code>htop</code> while this is running shows that <code>grep</code> is currently the bottleneck with full usage of a single CPU core.</p><h3 id="parallelize-the-bottlenecks"><a href="#parallelize-the-bottlenecks">Parallelize the bottlenecks</a></h3><p>This problem of unused cores can be fixed with the wonderful <code>xargs</code> command, which will allow us to parallelize the <code>grep</code>. Since <code>xargs</code> expects input in a certain way, it is safer and easier to use <code>find</code> with the <code>-print0</code> argument in order to make sure that each file name being passed to <code>xargs</code> is null-terminated. The corresponding <code>-0</code> tells <code>xargs</code> to expected null-terminated input. Additionally, the <code>-n</code> how many inputs to give each process and the <code>-P</code> indicates the number of processes to run in parallel. Also important to be aware of is that such a parallel pipeline doesn’t guarantee delivery order, but this isn’t a problem if you are used to dealing with distributed processing systems. The <code>-F</code> for <code>grep</code> indicates that we are only matching on fixed strings and not doing any fancy regex, and can offer a small speedup, which I did not notice in my testing.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 grep -F <span>"Result"</span> | gawk <span>'{ split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print NR, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This results in a run time of about 38 seconds, which is an additional 40% or so reduction in processing time from parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline. This gets us up to approximately 77 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>Although we have improved the performance dramatically by parallelizing the <code>grep</code> step in our pipeline, we can actually remove this entirely by having <code>awk</code> filter the input records (lines in this case) and only operate on those containing the string “Result”.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++;} END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You may think that would be the correct solution, but this will output the results of <strong>each</strong> file individually, when we want to aggregate them all together. The resulting correct implementation is conceptually very similar to what the MapReduce implementation would be.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 awk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | awk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>By adding the second awk step at the end, we obtain the aggregated game information as desired.</p><p>This further improves the speed dramatically, achieving a running time of about 18 seconds, or about 174 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><p>However, we can make it a bit faster still by using <a href="https://invisible-island.net/mawk/mawk.html">mawk</a>, which is often a drop-in replacement for <code>gawk</code> and can offer better performance.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>find . -type f -name <span>'*.pgn'</span> -print0 | xargs -0 -n4 -P4 mawk <span>'/Result/ { split($0, a, "-"); res = substr(a[1], length(a[1]), 1); if (res == 1) white++; if (res == 0) black++; if (res == 2) draw++ } END { print white+black+draw, white, black, draw }'</span> | mawk <span>'{games += $1; white += $2; black += $3; draw += $4; } END { print games, white, black, draw }'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This <code>find | xargs mawk | mawk</code> pipeline gets us down to a runtime of about 12 seconds, or about 270MB/sec, which is around 235 times faster than the Hadoop implementation.</p><h3 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h3><p>Hopefully this has illustrated some points about using and abusing tools like Hadoop for data processing tasks that can better be accomplished on a single machine with simple shell commands and tools. If you have a huge amount of data or really need distributed processing, then tools like Hadoop may be required, but more often than not these days I see Hadoop used where a traditional relational database or other solutions would be far better in terms of performance, cost of implementation, and ongoing maintenance.</p><a href="https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon"></a>
