<p>When copying and pasting on a Mac, most applications will retain the formatting of whatever you copied. If that bugs you as much as it bugs me, try this trick to switch up the default to pasting unformatted text. Or more accurately, having the pasted text ignore its own formatting and match the text where it's pasted.</p><ol><li>Open the <code>System Preferences</code> app.</li><li>Go to <code>Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts</code>.</li><li>Click on <code>App Shortcuts</code>.</li><li>Add a new shortcut.</li><li>Choose <strong><code>All Applications</code></strong> for the Application, and type <code><strong>Paste and Match Style</strong></code>. Enter <code><strong>⌘V</strong></code> for the Keyboard Shortcut. Click <code>Add</code>.</li></ol><p>Next time you copy/paste, the copied text will fit in with the style of wherever it's &nbsp;pasted. Cool.</p>

KDE developer Nate Graham is out with his usual weekly recap highlighting all of the interesting accomplishments for this open-source desktop for the past week. But with not having posted last weekend, this edition highlights the many achievements made by the KDE camp over the past two weeks.
</p><p>
There's been a lot happening in the KDE world as the developers prepare to wrap up October. Some of the latest KDE highlights include:
</p><p>
- KDE Plasma Wayland now supports per-screen color management. Assigning ICC color profiles to each screen will now work correctly under KDE on Wayland. 
</p><p>
- The KDE Desktop Cube effect has returned via the kdeplasma-addons repository. Here's the screenshot shared by Nate that will surely bring back Compiz/Beryl memories for long-time Linux users:
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2023&amp;image=kde_desktop_cube" alt="KDE Desktop Cube"></p>
<p>- Many small UI improvements to KDE Discover.
</p><p>
- KFontView now works as expected on Wayland.
</p><p>
- KRunner's "Recent Documents" runner is enjoying more than twice the performance as previously.
</p><p>
- Fixing a case where when logging into Plasma Wayland it would cause KWin to crash immediately and return to the log-in screen.
</p><p>
- Fixing the most common crash in Plasma that could happen when closing notifications.
</p><p>
- Many other bug fixes.
</p><p>

<p>My Thursday CppCon talk is now online.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Note: There’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/171o3q9/cooperative_c_evolution_toward_a_typescript_for_c/">already a Reddit thread for it</a>, so if you want to comment on the video I suggest you use that thread instead of creating a new one.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At CppCon 2022, I argued for why we should try to&nbsp;<a href="https://herbsutter.com/2022/09/19/my-cppcon-2022-talk-is-online-can-c-be-10x-simpler-safer/">make C++ 10x simpler and 50x safer</a>, and this update is an evolution of the update talk I gave at C++ Now in May, with additional news and demos.</p>

<h2>The “Dart plan” and the “TypeScript plan”</h2>



<p>The back half of this talk clearly distinguishes between what I call the “Dart plan” and the “TypeScript plan” for aiming at a 10x improvement for an incumbent popular language. Both plans have value, but they have different priorities and therefore choose different constraints… most of all, they either embrace up-front the design constraint of&nbsp;<em>perfect C++ interop and ecosystem compatibility</em>, or they forgo it (forever; as I argue in the talk, it can never be achieved retroactively, except by starting over, because it’s a fundamental up-front constraint). No one else has tried the TypeScript plan for C++ yet, and I see value in trying it, and so that’s the plan I’m following for cppfront.</p>



<p>When people ask me “how is cppfront different from all the other projects trying to improve/replace C++?” my answer is “cppfront is on the TypeScript plan.” All the other past and present projects have been on the Dart plan, which again is a fine plan too, it just has different priorities and tradeoffs particularly around</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>full seamless interop compatibility</strong> with ISO Standard C++ code and libraries without any wrapping/thunking/marshaling, </li>



<li><strong>full ecosystem compatibility </strong>with all of today’s C++ compilers, IDEs, build systems, and tooling, and</li>



<li><strong>full standards evolution support </strong>with ISO C++, including not creating incompatible features (e.g., a different concepts feature than C++20’s, a different modules system than C++20’s) and bringing all major new pieces to today’s ISO C++ evolution as also incremental proposals for today’s C++.</li>
</ul>



<p>See just the <a href="https://youtu.be/8U3hl8XMm8c?si=mmUehvFs5b5uVfwj&amp;t=4973"><strong>final 10 minutes of the talk</strong></a> to see what I mean — I demo’d syntax 2 “just working” with four different IDEs’ debuggers and visualizers, but I could also have demo’d that profilers just work, build systems just work, and so on.</p>



<p>I call my experimental syntax 2 (aka Cpp2) “still 100% pure C++” not only because cppfront translates it to 100% today’s C++ syntax (aka Cpp1), but because:</p>



<ul>
<li>every syntax-2 type <em>is</em> an ordinary C++ type that ordinary existing C++ code can use, recognized by tools that know C++ types including IDE visualizers;</li>



<li>every syntax-2 function <em>is</em> an ordinary C++ function that ordinary existing C++ code can use, recognized by tools that know C++ functions including debuggers to step into them;</li>



<li>every syntax-2 object <em>is</em> an ordinary C++ object that ordinary existing C++ code can use;</li>



<li>every syntax-2 feature can be (and has been) brought as a normal ISO C++ standards proposal to evolve today’s syntax, because Cpp2 embraces and follows today’s C++ standard and guidance and evolution instead of competing with them;</li>
</ul>



<p>and that’s because I want a way to keep writing 100% pure C++, just nicer.</p>



<p>“Nicer” means: 10x simpler by having more generality and consistency, better defaults, and less ceremony; and 50x safer by having 98% fewer vulnerabilities in the four areas of initialization safety (guaranteed in Cpp2), type safety (guaranteed in Cpp2), bounds safety (on by default in Cpp2), and lifetime safety (still to be implemented in cppfront is the C++ Core Guidelines Lifetime static analysis which I designed for Cpp2).</p>



<p>Cpp2 and cppfront don’t <em>replace</em> your C++ compilers. Cpp2 and cppfront <em>work with</em> all your existing C++ compilers (and build systems, profilers, debuggers, visualizers, custom in-house tools, test harnesses, and everything else in the established C++ ecosystem, from the big commercial public C++ products to your team’s internal bespoke C++ tools). If you’re already using GCC, Clang, and/or MSVC, keep using them, they all work fine. If you’re already using CMake or build2, or lldb or the Qt Creator debugger, or your favorite profiler or test framework, keep using them, it’s all still C++ that all C++ tools can understand. There’s no new ecosystem.</p>



<p><a href="https://youtube.com/clip/Ugkxo4k6pbLcABFMmoJQs1ybAcvY26SZ5xX5?si=nRHz_EXEebDlf1iW">There are only two plans for 10x major improvement. (1-min clip)</a> This is the fundamental difference with all the other attempts at a major improvement of today’s C++ I know of, which are all on the Dart plan — and those are great projects by really smart people and I hope we all learn from each other. But for my work I want to pursue the TypeScript plan, which I think is the only major evolution plan that can legitimately call itself “still 100% C++.” That’s important to me, because <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxAZ2589d6OAa2dULANeX9askxuueZSBpu?si=ufjoIXBlLfHqvf1M">like I said at the very beginning of my talk last year (1-min clip)</a>, I want to encourage us to pursue major evolution that brings <em>C++ itself </em>forward and to double down <em>on C++</em>, not switch to something else — to aim for major C++ evolution directed to things that will make us <em>better C++ programmers</em>, not programmers of something else.</p>



<p>I’m spending time on this experiment first of all for myself, because C++ is the language that best lets me express the programs I need to write, so I want to keep writing real C++ types and real C++ functions and real C++ everything else… just nicer.</p>



<p>Thanks again to the <a href="https://herbsutter.files.wordpress.com/2023/09/image-1.png">over 120 people</a> who have contributed issues and PRs to cppfront, and the many more who have provided thoughtful comments and feedback! I appreciate your help.</p>

<p>From time to time, many of us find ourselves delivering speeches of various sorts: 
   best-man toasts, employee training sessions, or extended monologues delivered to a confused Arby's employee.</p>

<p>It can be tricky, however, to determine the optimal duration of such speech.</p>

<p>Below, I've compiled a visual guide to help you figure out when you should put a sock in it.</p>

<p>Following these rules won't necessarily guarantee a successful speech — that largely depends on 
   the quality of the content — but it will guarantee that excessive duration is not the chief complaint.</p>

<p>In addition to the visual guide, I've also included an accompanying algorithm that implements the logic from the guide.</p>

<p><a href="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/shut_up.jpg" target="_new"><img src="https://shaungallagher.pressbin.com/blog/img/shut_up.jpg"></a></p><p>In case you're curious about the format of the flow chart shown in the image above, it's a Drakon chart.</p>

<p>Drakon was developed as part of the now-defunct Soviet space program to produce flow charts with tidy control structures.</p>

<p>If you'd like to experiment with your own Drakon charts, check out <a href="https://drakonhub.com/">DrakonHub.com</a></p>

<h3>The algorithm</h3>


<p>Below is a simple Python algorithm that (roughly) implements the logic shown in the flow chart above.</p>

<pre>def when_should_i_shut_up(
    threshold = "optimal",  # one of: "safe", "optimal", "maximum"
    speech_solicited = False,
    speaker_prepared = False,
    speech_outlined = False,
    speaker_experienced = False,
    audience_knows_time = False,
    speech_written = False,
    audience_paid = False,
    speaker_is_jesus = False,
):
    if not speech_solicited:
        speech_minutes = (0, 0, 1)
    elif not speaker_prepared:
        speech_minutes = (1, 2, 3)
    elif not speech_outlined:
        speech_minutes = (2, 2, 3)
    elif not speaker_experienced:
        speech_minutes = (3, 4, 5)
    elif not audience_knows_time:
        speech_minutes = (5, 8, 10)
    else:
        speech_minutes = (15, 30, 60)

    if speech_minutes:
        if threshold == "safe":
            result = speech_minutes[0]
        elif threshold == "optimal":
            result = speech_minutes[1]
        else:
            result = speech_minutes[2]

    if speaker_experienced or audience_knows_time:
        if speech_written:
            result = int(result * 1.2)

    if audience_paid:
        result = result + (30 if threshold != "maximum" else 60)

    if speaker_is_jesus:
        result = float('inf')

    return result

    I’m thinking back to the early-American homesteading days when a man could venture into uncharted territory and make a simple life for himself. It seems like every square inch of Earth is owned by someone, but are there any places someone could still do this in modern times?
  </p><p>
    Edit: Several users have pointed out that homesteading was incredibly difficult, and we’d all likely die trying to live so simply. Let’s assume the person is relatively capable of sustaining life using whichever resources might be provided by the particular environment — forest, desert, famous Bay Area city, etc.

Haldi, the spice’s Hindi name, is derived from the Sanskrit for “golden coloured”. But for the millions of South Asians who habitually consume it, turmeric’s skin-staining yellowness can be deceptive and deadly.</p><p data-component="paragraph">To heighten their colour, the rhizomes from which the spice is extracted are routinely dusted with lead chromate, a neurotoxin. The practice helps explain why South Asia has the highest rates of lead poisoning in the world. The heart and brain diseases it causes—to which children are especially susceptible—accounted for at least 1.4m deaths in the region in 2019. The economic cost is crippling; that year lead poisoning is estimated to have lowered South Asian productivity by the equivalent of 9% of <small>GDP</small>. Yet it turns out that with clever policies, enlightened leadership and astute messaging this blight can be greatly reduced. Bangladesh has <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/11/02/bangladesh-strikes-a-blow-against-lead-poisoning">shown how</a>.</p><p data-component="paragraph">At the instigation of teams from Stanford University and the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, a research institute, the country launched a nationwide campaign against turmeric adulteration in 2019. Rules against adulteration were enforced and well-publicised stings carried out against wholesalers who persisted in it. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, discussed the problem on television. Bangladeshi bazaars were plastered with warnings against it. Local media also publicised it.</p><p data-component="paragraph">According to newly published data, the country thereby reduced the prevalence of turmeric adulteration in its spice markets to zero in just two years. That slashed lead levels in the blood of Bangladeshi turmeric-mill workers by about a third. Nationwide, it probably saved thousands of lives. Early analysis suggests that each extra year of healthy life cost a mere $1 to preserve. Achieving the same benefit through cash transfers is estimated to cost over $800.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Other countries where lead poisoning is rife should follow Bangladesh. Recent estimates suggest a staggering 815m children—one in three of the global total—have been poisoned by the metal. According to the Centre for Global Development, a think-tank in Washington, this disaster explains a fifth of the learning gap between children in rich and poor countries.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The poisoning has many causes. Weak or absent regulators permit lead-infused cooking utensils, cosmetics and other products. Yet adulterated turmeric looks like a major culprit almost everywhere, chiefly owing to poor practice in India, which produces 75% of the spice. India was the source of much of the poisonous pigment found in Bangladesh and is estimated to have the highest incidence of lead poisoning of any country.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Bangladesh’s response to the problem, if properly understood, could work in many countries. Its key elements included an openness to foreign expertise; effective <small>NGO</small>s; a willingness by the government to work with them; and the formation of an even broader coalition, also including journalists and private firms, to maximise the effort. This low-cost, co-ordinated and relentless approach to problem-solving, familiar to admirers of Bangladesh, has underpinned its outstanding development success over the past two decades. And Sheikh Hasina deserves credit for it—even though her commitment to such enlightened policymaking appears to be flagging.</p><h2>Leaders and lead poisoning </h2><p data-component="paragraph">With an election approaching, the world’s longest-serving woman prime minister, Bangladesh’s ruler for two decades, is growing more <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2023/05/24/sheikh-hasina-is-asias-iron-lady">authoritarian and irascible</a>. The importance of the turmeric campaign should help persuade her to reverse course. As it shows, the Bangladeshi model rests on organising, collaboration and consensus, not political fiat, and there is much more than her legacy riding on it.</p><p data-component="paragraph">India, whose leader, Narendra Modi, is in the process of driving out foreign donors and dismantling any <small>NGO</small> he considers unfriendly to him, has much to learn from Bangladesh’s more open, pragmatic approach. The developing world has countless health and environmental problems that it might help solve. For these many reasons, it should be sustained and widely copied. <span>■</span></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline "How to stop turmeric killing people"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/">Leaders</a> <span>November 4th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2023/11/02/the-world-economy-is-defying-gravity-that-cannot-last"><span>The world economy is defying gravity.

                <p>Beginning on Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 11:43 UTC Cloudflare's control plane and analytics services experienced an outage. The control plane of Cloudflare consists primarily of the customer-facing interface for all of our services including our website and APIs. Our analytics services include logging and analytics reporting.</p><p>The incident lasted from November 2 at 11:44 UTC until November 4 at 04:25 UTC. We were able to restore most of our control plane at our disaster recovery facility as of November 2 at 17:57 UTC. Many customers would not have experienced issues with most of our products after the disaster recovery facility came online. However, other services took longer to restore and customers that used them may have seen issues until we fully resolved the incident. Our raw log services were unavailable for most customers for the duration of the incident.</p><p>Services have now been restored for all customers. Throughout the incident, Cloudflare's network and security services continued to work as expected. While there were periods where customers were unable to make changes to those services, traffic through our network was not impacted.</p><p>This post outlines the events that caused this incident, the architecture we had in place to prevent issues like this, what failed, what worked and why, and the changes we're making based on what we've learned over the last 36 hours. </p><p>To start, this never should have happened. We believed that we had high availability systems in place that should have stopped an outage like this, even when one of our core data center providers failed catastrophically. And, while many systems did remain online as designed, some critical systems had non-obvious dependencies that made them unavailable. I am sorry and embarrassed for this incident and the pain that it caused our customers and our team.</p><h2 id="intended-design">Intended Design</h2><p>Cloudflare's control plane and analytics systems run primarily on servers in three data centers around Hillsboro, Oregon. The three data centers are independent of one another, each have multiple utility power feeds, and each have multiple redundant and independent network connections.</p><p>The facilities were intentionally chosen to be at a distance apart that would minimize the chances that a natural disaster would cause all three to be impacted, while still close enough that they could all run active-active redundant data clusters. This means that they are continuously syncing data between the three facilities. By design, if any of the facilities goes offline then the remaining ones are able to continue to operate. </p><p>This is a system design that we began implementing four years ago. While most of our critical control plane systems had been migrated to the high availability cluster, some services, especially for some newer products, had not yet been added to the high availability cluster.</p><p>In addition, our logging systems were intentionally not part of the high availability cluster. The logic of that decision was that logging was already a distributed problem where logs were queued at the edge of our network and then sent back to the core in Oregon (or another regional facility for customers using regional services for logging). If our logging facility was offline then analytics logs would queue at the edge of our network until it came back online. We determined that analytics being delayed was acceptable.</p><h2 id="flexential-data-center-power-failure">Flexential Data Center Power Failure</h2><p>The largest of the three facilities in Oregon is run by Flexential. We refer to this facility as “PDX-04.” Cloudflare leases space in PDX-04 where we house our largest analytics cluster as well as more than a third of the machines for our high availability cluster. It is also the default location for services that have not yet been onboarded onto our high availability cluster. We are a relatively large customer of the facility, consuming approximately 10 percent of its total capacity.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/11/Flexential-Electrical-System.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1045"></figure><p>On November 2 at 08:50 UTC Portland General Electric (PGE), the utility company that services PDX-04, had an unplanned maintenance event affecting one of their independent power feeds into the building. That event shut down one feed into PDX-04. The data center has multiple feeds with some level of independence that can power the facility. However, Flexential powered up their generators to effectively supplement the feed that was down.</p><p>Counter to best practices, Flexential did not inform Cloudflare that they had failed over to generator power. None of our observability tools were able to detect that the source of power had changed. Had they informed us, we would have stood up a team to monitor the facility closely and move control plane services that were dependent on that facility out while it was degraded.</p><p>It is also unusual that Flexential ran both the one remaining utility feed and the generators at the same time. It is not unusual for utilities to ask data centers to drop off the grid when power demands are high and run exclusively on generators. Flexential operates 10 generators, inclusive of redundant units, capable of supporting the facility at full load. It would also have been possible for Flexential to run the facility only from the remaining utility feed. We haven't gotten a clear answer why they ran utility power and generator power.</p><h2 id="informed-speculation-on-what-happened-next">Informed Speculation On What Happened Next</h2><p>From this decision onward, we don't yet have clarity from Flexential on the root cause or some of the decisions they made or the events. We will update this post as we get more information from Flexential, as well as PGE, on what happened. Some of what follows is informed speculation based on the most likely series of events as well as what individual Flexential employees have shared with us unofficially.</p><p>One possible reason they may have left the utility line running is because Flexential was part of a program with PGE called DSG. DSG allows the local utility to run a data center's generators to help supply additional power to the grid. In exchange, the power company helps maintain the generators and supplies fuel. We have been unable to locate any record of Flexential informing us about the DSG program. We've asked if DSG was active at the time and have not received an answer. We do not know if it contributed to the decisions that Flexential made, but it could explain why the utility line continued to remain online after the generators were started.</p><p>At approximately 11:40 UTC, there was a ground fault on a PGE transformer at PDX-04. We believe, but have not been able to get confirmation from Flexential or PGE, that this was the transformer that stepped down power from the grid for the second feed that was still running as it entered the data center. It seems likely, though we have not been able to confirm with Flexential or PGE, that the ground fault was caused by the unplanned maintenance PGE was performing that impacted the first feed. Or it was a very unlucky coincidence.</p><p>Ground faults with high voltage (12,470 volt) power lines are very bad. Electrical systems are designed to quickly shut down to prevent damage when one occurs. Unfortunately, in this case, the protective measure also shut down all of PDX-04’s generators. This meant that the two sources of power generation for the facility — both the redundant utility lines as well as the 10 generators — were offline.</p><p>Fortunately, in addition to the generators, PDX-04 also contains a bank of UPS batteries. These batteries are supposedly sufficient to power the facility for approximately 10 minutes. That time is meant to be enough to bridge the gap between the power going out and the generators automatically starting up. If Flexential could get the generators or a utility feed restored within 10 minutes then there would be no interruption. In reality, the batteries started to fail after only 4 minutes based on what we observed from our own equipment failing. And it took Flexential far longer than 10 minutes to get the generators restored.</p><h2 id="attempting-to-restore-power">Attempting to Restore Power</h2><p>While we haven't gotten official confirmation, we have been told by employees that three things hampered getting the generators back online. First, they needed to be physically accessed and manually restarted because of the way the ground fault had tripped circuits. Second, Flexential's access control system was not powered by the battery backups so it was offline. And third, the overnight staffing at the site did not include an experienced operations or electrical expert — the overnight shift consisted of security and an unaccompanied technician who had only been on the job for a week.</p><p>Between 11:44 and 12:01 UTC, with the generators not fully restarted, the UPS batteries ran out of power and all customers of the data center lost power. Throughout this, Flexential never informed Cloudflare that there was any issue at the facility. We were first notified of issues in the data center when the two routers that connect the facility to the rest of the world went offline at 11:44 UTC. When we weren't able to reach the routers directly or through out-of-band management, we attempted to contact Flexential and dispatched our local team to physically travel to the facility. The first message to us from Flexential that they were experiencing an issue was at 12:28 UTC.</p><blockquote><em>We are currently experiencing an issue with power at our [PDX-04] that began at approximately 0500AM PT [12:00 UTC]. Engineers are actively working to resolve the issue and restore service. We will communicate progress every 30 minutes or as more information becomes available as to the estimated time to restore. Thank you for your patience and understanding.</em></blockquote><h2 id="designing-for-data-center-level-failure">Designing for Data Center Level Failure</h2><p>While the PDX-04’s design was certified Tier III before construction and is expected to provide high availability SLAs, we planned for the possibility that it could go offline. Even well-run facilities can have bad days. And we planned for that. What we expected would happen in that case is that our analytics would be offline, logs would be queued at the edge and delayed, and certain lower priority services that were not integrated into our high availability cluster would go offline temporarily until they could be restored at another facility.</p><p>The other two data centers running in the area would take over responsibility for the high availability cluster and keep critical services online. Generally that worked as planned. Unfortunately, we discovered that a subset of services that were supposed to be on the high availability cluster had dependencies on services exclusively running in PDX-04.</p><p>In particular, two critical services that process logs and power our analytics — Kafka and ClickHouse — were only available in PDX-04 but had services that depended on them that were running in the high availability cluster. Those dependencies shouldn’t have been so tight, should have failed more gracefully, and we should have caught them.</p><p>We had performed testing of our high availability cluster by taking offline each (and both) of the other two data center facilities entirely offline. And we had also tested taking the high availability portion of PDX-04 offline. However, we had never tested fully taking the entire PDX-04 facility offline. As a result, we had missed the importance of some of these dependencies on our data plane.</p><p>We were also far too lax about requiring new products and their associated databases to integrate with the high availability cluster. Cloudflare allows multiple teams to innovate quickly. As such, products often take different paths toward their initial alpha. While, over time, our practice is to migrate the backend for these services to our best practices, we did not formally require that before products were declared generally available (GA). That was a mistake as it meant that the redundancy protections we had in place worked inconsistently depending on the product.</p><p>Moreover, far too many of our services depend on the availability of our core facilities. While this is the way a lot of software services are created, it does not play to Cloudflare’s strength. We are good at distributed systems. Throughout this incident, our global network continued to perform as expected. While some of our products and features are configurable and serviceable through the edge of our network without needing the core, far too many today fail if the core is unavailable. We need to use the distributed systems products that we make available to all our customers for all our services so they continue to function mostly as normal even if our core facilities are disrupted.</p><h2 id="disaster-recovery">Disaster Recovery</h2><p>At 12:48 UTC, Flexential was able to get the generators restarted. Power returned to portions of the facility. In order to not overwhelm the system, when power is restored to a data center it is typically done gradually by powering back on one circuit at a time. Like the circuit breakers in a residential home, each customer is serviced by redundant breakers. When Flexential attempted to power back up Cloudflare's circuits, the circuit breakers were discovered to be faulty. We don't know if the breakers failed due to the ground fault or some other surge as a result of the incident, or if they'd been bad before and it was only discovered after they had been powered off.</p><p>Flexential began the process of replacing the failed breakers. That required them to source new breakers because more were bad than they had on hand in the facility. Because more services were offline than we expected, and because Flexential could not give us a time for restoration of our services, we made the call at 13:40 UTC to fail over to Cloudflare's disaster recovery sites located in Europe. Thankfully, we only needed to fail over a small percentage of Cloudflare’s overall control plane. Most of our services continued to run across our high availability systems across the two active core data centers.</p><p>We turned up the first services on the disaster recovery site at 13:43 UTC.Cloudflare's disaster recovery sites provide critical control plane services in the event of a disaster. While the disaster recovery site does not support some of our log processing services, it is designed to support the other portions of our control plane. </p><p>When services were turned up there, we experienced a thundering herd problem where the API calls that had been failing overwhelmed our services. We implemented rate limits to get the request volume under control. During this period, customers of most products would have seen intermittent errors when making modifications through our dashboard or API. By 17:57 UTC, the services that had been successfully moved to the disaster recovery site were stable and most customers were no longer directly impacted. However, some systems still required manual configuration (e.g., Magic WAN) and some other services, largely related to log processing and some bespoke APIs, remained unavailable until we were able to restore PDX-04.</p><h2 id="some-products-and-features-delayed-restart">Some Products and Features Delayed Restart</h2><p>A handful of products did not properly get stood up on our disaster recovery sites. These tended to be newer products where we had not fully implemented and tested a disaster recovery procedure. These included our Stream service for uploading new videos and some other services. Our team worked two simultaneous tracks to get these services restored: 1) reimplementing them on our disaster recovery sites; and 2) migrating them to our high-availability cluster.</p><p>Flexential replaced our failed circuit breakers, restored both utility feeds, and confirmed clean power at 22:48 UTC. Our team was all-hands-on-deck and had worked all day on the emergency, so I made the call that most of us should get some rest and start the move back to PDX-04 in the morning. That decision delayed our full recovery, but I believe made it less likely that we’d compound this situation with additional mistakes.</p><p>Beginning first thing on November 3, our team began restoring service in PDX-04. That began with physically booting our network gear then powering up thousands of servers and restoring their services. The state of our services in the data center was unknown as we believed multiple power cycles were likely to have occurred during the incident. Our only safe process to recover was to follow a complete bootstrap of the entire facility.</p><p>This involved a manual process of bringing our configuration management servers online to begin the restoration of the facility. Rebuilding these took 3 hours. From there, our team was able to bootstrap the rebuild of the rest of the servers that power our services. Each server took between 10 minutes and 2 hours to rebuild. While we were able to run this in parallel across multiple servers, there were inherent dependencies between services that required some to be brought back online in sequence.</p><p>Services are now fully restored as of November 4 at 04:25 UTC. For most customers, because of how we queue analytics at the edge, you should see no data loss in your analytics. Any gaps that appear as of now we expect will fill in as any lingering caches of analytics data is ingested. For customers that use our log push feature, your logs will not have been processed for the majority of the event, so anything you did not receive will not be recovered. However, the records in our analytics dashboard will still be accurate.</p><p>We have a number of questions that we need answered from Flexential. But we also must expect that entire data centers may fail. Google has a process where when there’s a significant event or crisis they can call a Code Yellow or Code Red. In these cases, most or all engineering resources are shifted to addressing the issue at hand.</p><p>We have not had such a process in the past, but it’s clear today we need to implement a version of it ourselves: Code Orange. We are shifting all non-critical engineering functions to focusing on ensuring high reliability of our control plane. As part of that, we expect the following changes:</p><ul><li>Remove dependencies on our core data centers for control plane configuration of all services and move them wherever possible to be powered first by our distributed network</li><li>Ensure that the control plane running on the network continues to function even if all our core data centers are offline</li><li>Require that all products and features that are designated Generally Available must rely on the high availability cluster (if they rely on any of our core data centers), without having any software dependencies on specific facilities</li><li>Require all products and features that are designated Generally Available have a reliable disaster recovery plan that is tested</li><li>Test the blast radius of system failures and minimize the number of services that are impacted by a failure</li><li>Implement more rigorous chaos testing of all data center functions including the full removal of each of our core data center facilities</li><li>Thorough auditing of all core data centers and a plan to reaudit to ensure they comply with our standards</li><li>Logging and analytics disaster recovery plan that ensures no logs are dropped even in the case of a failure of all our core facilities</li></ul><p>As I said earlier, I am sorry and embarrassed for this incident and the pain that it caused our customers and our team. We have the right systems and procedures in place to be able to withstand even the cascading string of failures we saw at our data center provider, but we need to be more rigorous about enforcing that they are followed and tested for unknown dependencies. This will have my full attention and the attention of a large portion of our team through the balance of the year. And the pain from the last couple days will make us better.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>At long last, Mozilla is planning to make browser extensions, also known as add-ons, available for Firefox on Android, at some point following the expected November 21 release of the browser's version 120 build.</p>
<p>This week, the organization urged developers to evaluate their extension code in preparation for the occasion, since it's expecting a lot of demand.</p>
<p>"We anticipate strong interest from users excited to explore all the new ways they can customize Firefox for Android," <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2023/11/01/is-your-extension-ready-for-firefox-for-android/">said</a> Scott DeVaney, staff editorial manager for Firefox add-ons, in an online post. "Current trends indicate we’ll have at least 200+ new Firefox for Android extensions on AMO [addons.mozilla.org] when open availability debuts in December."</p>

    

<p>Mozilla has been working on this idea since at least 2019, when Vesta Zare, product strategy lead for Firefox Mobile suggested the idea in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/5315">a post</a> to the GitHub repo for <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://codetribute.mozilla.org/projects/fenix">Fenix</a>, a revised version of Firefox for Android.</p>

        


        

<p>But progress was slow and there were <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/11308#issuecomment-671500918">concerns about security</a>, a vexing issue when it comes to extensions. Allowing Firefox for Android users to download and install extensions that haven't been thoroughly reviewed poses a risk, particularly given the sensitivity of data stored on phones (e.g. payment cards and personal details). In the desktop ecosystem, browser extensions have been a frequent source of malware and abuse.</p>
<p>Even with the security risks, the extensibility of web browsers is one of the defining characteristics of the open web. Unlike passive display technologies like televisions, the browser lets users take an active role in how content gets processed and presented.</p>

<p>This freedom is not entirely to the liking of online content providers. Web publishers for years have asked site visitors to disable ad blocking extensions, a step YouTube has recently <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/26/privacy_advocate_challenges_youtube/">undertaken</a> in force.</p>
<p>Google, which makes the most popular browser at the moment, Chrome, does not currently support extensions in Chrome for Android. People <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://support.google.com/chrome/thread/206989103/why-doesn-t-google-allow-extensions-in-chrome-mobile-browser?hl=en">speculate</a> that Google does not do so because Android users would block ads, a known matter of concern for the advertising giant.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/apple_safari_browser/">In quest to defeat Euro red-tape, Apple said it had three Safari browsers – not one</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/03/apple_q4_2023/">Apple's year ends with surging services, a billion subscribers, and a view of generation next</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/01/official_mozilla_debian_firefox/">Mozilla treats Debian devotees to the raw taste of Firefox Nightly</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/10/google_pays_apple_18_20_claims_bernstein/">Google pays Apple $18B to $20B a year to keep its search in iPhone</a></li>
</ul>
<p>However, Google's ongoing revision of its Chrome extension architecture, known as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/01/google_mv2_chrome_extensions/">Manifest v3</a>, aspires to make extensions less demanding of CPU resources and less dependent on persistent processes. That would make Manifest v3 extensions better suited for mobile devices, if Google chose to add extension support in Chrome for Android to avoid being left behind by competitors. It's worth noting that Apple, Mozilla, and Microsoft are all planning to support Manifest v3, with some variation, in their respective browsers.</p>
<p>The Yandex mobile browser, popular in Russia, added support for extensions on Android in 2016 and other Android-based browsers like Kiwi have done so. Among the larger browser makers, Mozilla managed to roll out support for a limited set of Recommended Extensions for Firefox on Android in January, 2021. But Apple managed a broader implementation when it introduced support for <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/get-extensions-iphab0432bf6/15.0/ios/15.0">Safari extensions</a> in iOS 15 in September 2021.</p>

        

<p>Mozilla mentioned <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/webvision/full/#extensibility">browser extensibility</a> in its 2022 vision for the web and hinted at some of the challenges that prevented the organization from realizing mobile browser extensions earlier.</p>
<p>"Add-ons have access to much more powerful capabilities than sites do, which makes them distinctly not casual," the company said. "This necessitates some degree of gatekeeping and curation in order to keep people safe from malicious add-ons. We are exploring ways to reduce this friction, but ultimately need to exercise some degree of oversight to balance openness, agency, and safety for browser extensions."</p>
<p>A year-and-a-half later, Firefox for Android is almost ready to live up to Mozilla's web vision. ®</p>

</p>
<p>The de-make no one asked for.</p>
<p><a href="https://dukope.itch.io/lcd-please"><strong>Play on itch.io</strong></a></p>
<p>I love a good set of limitations and on my way to making games with miasma and wind I’ve stopped off at the <em>Game &amp; Watch</em> tier.</p>
<h2 id="lcd-why">LCD. Why.</h2>
<p>I played a lot of LCD games when I was a kid. They were mostly terrible. Before the Gameboy existed, mostly terrible in your pocket was great and we loved it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpei_Yokoi">Gunpei Yokoi</a> invented the <em>Game &amp; Watch</em> LCD game in ~1980 at Nintendo, apparently after watching some bored guy mess around with a pocket calculator. Legends, the both of em.</p>
<p>The first LCD games were very basic reconfigurations of digital watch tech: shift registers and low-segment-count displays. As time progressed things got more complex, and not really for the better. You could be satisfied with a ball juggling LCD game but going too far was asking for disappointment.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HistoryNintendo.jpg" alt="Lcd-HistoryNintendo"></p><p>Nintendo's first, best-selling, and last LCD games</p>

<p>Nintendo had a good number of innovations in game, control, and case design over the years. When the Gameboy was released in 1989 (also from Yokoi, damn) they mercifully shuttered their <em>Game &amp; Watch</em> corps. Lucky for us, other companies stuck around in the LCD dungeon for a few more years.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HistoryOther.jpg" alt="Lcd-HistoryOther"></p><p>Not shown: thousands of other makers and games</p>

<p>Most LCD games produced in the 80’s and 90’s were shameless clones of Nintendo’s originals. A few companies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger">Tiger</a> with their licensed shovelware, Bandai with their <a href="http://www5e.biglobe.ne.jp/~kiden/densigame10/akuryo_no_yakata.htm">layered-screen</a> titles, or Epoch with their <a href="https://www.s40otoko.com/archives/142910">creativity,</a> were stretching the format a little bit beyond Nintendo. Great job fellas.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HistoryMine.jpg" alt="Lcd-HistoryMine"></p><p>Old LCD games salvaged from the attic.</p>

<p>The two LCD games I still have from my youth are <em>Plane &amp; Tank</em>, a Radio Shack badged clone of Nintendo’s <em>Helmet</em>, and Rambo, an Akklaim shooter that combines a few classic mechanics. I fired them both up while writing this devlog and honestly they’re still kinda hard to put down.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HistoryBest.jpg" alt="Lcd-HistoryBest"></p><p>'Lost in Space' &amp; 'Bombsweeper'</p>

<p>“Zero depth” is a good way to describe most LCD games of yore. I spent some time looking for a counterpoint and from that lot, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpYrQ1bjdjM"><em>Lost in Space</em></a> (1989) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGKZaevZuQU"><em>Bombsweeper</em></a> (1987) stood out as two of the best. <em>Lost in Space</em> is a fully realized monster hunting 3D maze game from Epoch and <em>Bombsweeper</em> is a wall-pushing puzzler from Nintendo. Both are deeper and more satisfying than what you’d expect. I didn’t know about either of these games back in the day.</p>
<h2 id="lets-go">Let’s Go</h2>
<p>Bringing it back. This post is about the LCD de-make of <em>Papers, Please</em>.</p>
<p>I’ve already <a href="https://obradinn.com/">mined the 1-bit Mac era</a> so there should be no surprise that I’m now back with my shovel, digging up liquid crystals. Looking at 1980 LCD game tech with 2023 eyes, there’s a few cool things:</p>
<ol>
<li>No pixels. These are proper little drawings that you can turn on and off.</li>
<li>No overlapping graphics. A totally unreasonable limitation. Love it.</li>
<li>No touching graphics. Really twisting the knife.</li>
<li>Crushing framerate. Just a few fps.</li>
<li>No advanced logic. Shift registers only. Ignore this one. Maybe next time.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these limits are good fun for modern indie developers but it was mostly #1 that got me interested in the format. Some of those games had really charming segment and background art.</p>
<p>I figured the low-action elements of <em>Papers, Please</em> could fit snugly with #4, and making randomly-generated faces with the idiosyncratic display tech seemed like the perfect thing to burden myself with.</p>
<p>No one (*) cares about LCD games in 2023 though so let’s just call this project  a fun diversion. I started working on it a few years ago on a lark, convinced my wife Keiko to help me, spent a few days on it here and there, and finally crunched to finish it up for the <a href="https://papersplea.se/#year10">tenth anniversary of <em>Papers, Please</em>.</a></p>
<p>(*) Except me &amp; you.</p>
<h2 id="have-limited-display-need-randomized-faces">Have Limited Display, Need Randomized Faces</h2>
<p>To make a procedural face generator with this antique display tech, the first step was to forget everything I was doing in the original game.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-OldFaces.gif" alt="OldFaces"></p><p>Original game. Individually-drawn faces with marked parts, jumbled to make new faces.</p>

<p>Nothing about this method works on a segmented LCD, and the somber style isn’t a good fit for the <em>Game &amp; Watch</em> look anyways. This de-make called for something lighter and more cartoony. With that in mind, I drew a bunch of ideas and just slowly adjusted things over time. Eventually it was both good enough and also too spider-webbed to change any more.</p>
<p>

<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FaceAllSegments.png" alt="Lcd-FaceAllSegments"></p><p>Final LCD segment art</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FaceGallery.gif" alt="Lcd-FaceGallery"></p><p>Some resultant faces</p>

<p>The two main tricks I used for variety were to divide standard features into multiple parts, and to design pieces that could be used in multiple ways.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FacePartials.png" alt="Lcd-FacePartials"></p><p>Using partial segments from an fully-defined eye.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FaceShared.png" alt="Lcd-FaceShared"></p><p>Reusing the same LCD segment for different features.</p>

<p>The whole thing was one big interlocking set of puzzle pieces. Adjust one piece and the effect cascades through the whole face. Fortunately, in the end it’s still just a static image. What you see is what you get. No variations, animations, extra dimensions, or even colors. Very refreshing for anyone toiling away on modern games.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-Procreate.jpg" alt="Lcd-ToolsProcreate"></p><p>iPad, Apple Pencil, Procreate</p>

<p>The LCD art was drawn in Procreate on an iPad with the convenience of layers and undo. I really feel for those poor souls 40 years ago working on paper. I am doughy soft when it comes to any kind of asset-creation hardship.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-ColorChannels.png" alt="Lcd-ColorChannels"></p><p>Blocks of green group unconnected segments</p>

<p>From Procreate I brought it into Photoshop and used the color channels for marking segment groups. At this point it’s still just an image so we needed a way to address individual segments/groups for the game’s display logic. Keiko wrote a Python script to split each segment out into subimages and I experimented with a few ways to manually assign names to them. There’s nearly 500 segments in all so this wasn’t exactly self-evident.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-EdgeTraces.png" alt="Lcd-EdgeTraces"></p><p>Connecting each segment to the image's edge</p>

<p>First try was to draw thin horizontal or vertical red lines running from each segment to the edge, similar to an actual solder trace. That put all segments in a 1D list around the edge, which could be synchronized with a text list of names. This quickly became too difficult to maintain so on to the second try.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-BlenderSegments.jpg" alt="Lcd-BlenderSegments"></p><p>Named Empty nodes placed on segments in Blender</p>

<p>Next I mapped the texture onto a quad in Blender, created Empty nodes, gave them names, and aligned them over each segment. With a short Python script, these node coordinates are exported to .json, where Keiko’s script combines it with the segment subimages to assign names. Much easier and maintainable once the scripts are done.</p>
<p>I often have random little tool needs this like. “Edit named points on an image”. I usually go pretty far twisting a stock tool to do it, writing something custom as a last resort. Blender’s great in a lot of these cases with how flexible and scriptable it is. Can’t recommend it enough.</p>
<h2 id="case-design">Case Design</h2>
<p>Along with the fun of designing an LCD panel I also jumped into this project with an itch to work up the plastic case. Back in the day, case design spanned a pretty wide swath from mundane to inspired. Since I’m hitting the nostalgia vein pretty hard I opted to go for something relatively generic, combining the bargain Radio Shack case with a slightly more elegant Bandai <em>Game Digital</em> series case.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HardInspiration.jpg" alt="Lcd-HardInspiration">
</p>
<p>I had a few goes at this, first testing out <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/">Affinity Designer</a>, a very capable Illustrator-alike.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HardAffinity.jpg" alt="Lcd-HardAffinity"></p><p>First (2D) case design made in Affinity Designer</p>

<p><em>Designer</em> is full of thoughtful features and most importantly feels like modern software that isn’t dragged down by 30 years of legacy. I was fully happy with this case until I decided that actually everything should be in 3D. Over to Blender.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-HardBlender1.jpg" alt="Lcd-HardBlender1"></p><p>Final (3D) case design made in Blender</p>

<p>Blender’s Eevee viewport renderer is both gorgeous and an immense timesaver. I gave up on Maya after Obra Dinn so maybe things are nicer there now. At the time, this kind of convenience, in Maya, was unthinkable. Thinking it now every day in Blender.</p>
<h2 id="also-a-game">Also a Game</h2>
<p>Once the basics of the art were worked out, the course was set and I had to figure out how to port the gameplay. For <em>Papers, Please</em> I decided this meant just the most basic sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait for someone to enter the booth.</li>
<li>See their face and read their stated name + country.</li>
<li>Check their passport to verify everything matched.</li>
<li>Stamp APPROVE or DENY.</li>
<li>No story, no other docs, no dialog, no repeat characters, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Focusing on just the stamps would hopefully capture an essential element of the original game and also keep the interface simple. As a personal preference, I enjoy the LCD games with just two left|right gameplay buttons over the more complicated ones with left|right|action or d-pad|action|etc.</p>
<p>An important early choice was that this would be a single-screen game. Having two screens like Nintendo’s Donkey Kong or layered screens like Bandai’s Amazone would’ve opened up a lot of options but please this project is not about options. One screen or go home. I also had a dream of actually getting this hardware manufactured at some point, and price-wise I don’t think anything beyond a simple plastic slab with one screen would be feasible.</p>
<p>As a result, unlike the full game, we don’t have the unimaginable luxury of showing both the entrant’s face and their passport at the same time.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FlowRealPass.gif" alt="Lcd-FlowRealPass"></p><p>You can see the face, or the passport, but never both at once</p>

<p>To put some intention behind this no-two-faces-at-once limitation, the core gameplay mechanic is very simply just pure memorization. Memorize what the entrant looks like and what they say, then compare that against the information in the passport. If it matches, <strong>approve</strong>. If not, <strong>deny</strong>. The hardware VIEW button was a fairly late addition to (slowly) cycle between the passport and the entrant’s face/statements again for review.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FlowDenied.gif" alt="Lcd-FlowDenied"></p><p>Comparing entrant face and statements to their passport. Sorry Erik.</p>

<p>That’s the <strong>easy</strong> mode. To add more complexity, there’s also a <strong>hard</strong> mode with two new rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>Randomized BANNED and WANTED notices. This is the only vestige of the “daily rules” aspect from the full game. The start of each day may briefly show a banned country, whose residents should be denied, or a wanted person, who should also be denied.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-FlowRestrictions.gif" alt="Lcd-FlowRestrictions"></p><p>BANNED and WANTED restrictions shown at the start of the day</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>VIP entrants. Same as a regular entrant except the VIEW button doesn’t work. Note their face and statements carefully because there’s no second chance to see them. (This rule’s design, code, art, &amp; script were added two hours before release – Keiko had the idea and it was so good we had no choice but to implement it.)</li>
</ol>
<p>After working out the basic design, we did our best to keep it sensible with the limited display and low framerate. There was so little elbow room here that I can’t say we floundered around too much. The display for results and in-day progress probably went through the most iterations.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-GameProgress.png" alt="Lcd-GameProgress"></p><p>Different ways of showing results &amp; progress</p>

<ol>
<li>Icons to show which parts of the entrant’s info were right/wrong after stamping. Daily progress dots/circles. Dot = stamped incorrectly, circle = stamped correctly. TMI, too confusing.</li>
<li>Simple citation icon if player stamps incorrectly. Progress dots/circles. Better but still has the confusing dots/circles.</li>
<li>Ticker tape showing a star if stamp was correct, blank if incorrect. Conveniently combines result with progress and has a nice 3D effect but it’s even more confusing in practice.</li>
<li>Final. Split progress from results. Show number of entrants remaining on left, collected citations (mistakes) on right.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>A long time ago my wife and I worked together <a href="https://www.ratloop.com/?games/mightier">pretty</a> <a href="https://www.ratloop.com/?games/helsings_fire">often</a>. She’s a very capable game programmer but ducked out of the industry when we added some kids to the family just before releasing <em>Papers, Please</em>. Since then I’ve been looking for an opportunity to drag her back in and this was the perfect project. She handled nearly all of the programming here.</p>
<p>The game is written in an old favorite, <a href="https://haxe.org/">haxe</a>, with support scripts in Python. The runtime uses the <a href="https://heaps.io/">Heaps</a> library, a lightweight game engine with robust 2D and 3D support. We build to a <a href="https://hashlink.haxe.org/">HashLink</a> target for desktop development and javascript for web deployment.</p>
<p>Structure-wise, our first decision was to create a simple domain-specific scripting language to define program flow for each tick of the clock. This created a nice separation between the display engine and the high-level game-sequence logic.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-CodeSteps.png" alt="Lcd-CodeSteps"></p><p>Logic steps defined in a simple high-level script</p>

<p>For the display control, Keiko wrote a simple in-game editor that enabled me to create named groups of segments, which the Python build script classifies and orders for the runtime.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-CodeEditor.png" alt="Lcd-CodeEditor"></p><p>In-game editor for naming groups of segments</p>

<p>Because the layout of the segments is so wild, each face is generated by selecting groups from the bottom up: first chin, then mouth, nose, and finally eyes.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://3909.co/dev/pp/img/Lcd-CodeRandom.gif" alt="Lcd-CodeRandom"></p><p>Stepwise random face generation</p>

<p>A certain chin selection will limit which mouths are available, and so on, up the face. Everything else (hair, ears, shoulders, etc) is independent and can be chosen randomly without worrying about dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="done">Done</h2>
<p>Hopefully this de-make is a bit of quick fun to play. We couldn’t make a career out of these kinds of games but it was a nice distraction. I think there’s still potential in LCD games, and the restrictions are appealing. Recommended, will try again someday.</p>

<ul>
<li>YouTube’s crackdown on ad blockers is causing users to uninstall the software in record numbers.</li>
<li>However, an even higher number of users are instead turning to better ad blockers that won’t trigger YouTube’s warning.</li>
<li>Some users are even going as far as to switch to a new browser.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>YouTube recently expanded its ad-blocking efforts, transitioning from just a small experiment to a global launch. The move appears to have had some success, as users are uninstalling the software in record numbers. But you can also argue it has had the opposite effect, as even higher numbers of users are turning to <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-ad-blocker-apps-android-954917/">better ad blockers</a>.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of users have uninstalled ad blockers in October, seemingly in connection with YouTube’s broadened crackdown, according to a report from <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/youtubes-ad-blocker-crackdown-spurs-record-uninstalls/" target="_blank"><em>Wired</em></a>. At the same time, data shows that record-breaking numbers of people are also installing alternatives that won’t be caught in YouTube’s net.</p><p>Krzysztof Modras of Ghostery — one of the more popular ad blockers in Chrome’s extension store — says they have seen three to five times the amount of installs and uninstalls over the last month. Over 90% of those users who uninstalled the extension cited the software failing on YouTube as the reason for their decision. However, the company saw a 30% uptick in installations on Microsoft Edge, with users attempting to find a suitable alternative.</p><p>Another blocker, AdGuard, told the outlet they normally see about 6,000 uninstallations per day on Chrome, but that shot up to 11,000 per day between October 9 and the end of the month, peaking at 52,000 on October 18. However, the paid version of the extension appears to be immune to YouTube’s ban. It’s reported that the company says when people realized this, user counts increased, reaching up to 60,000 installations on October 18 and October 27.</p><p>Right now, it appears YouTube’s crackdown on ad blockers has people scrambling to find a better alternative. Some people are even turning to solutions like Newpipe, a YouTube-like website that’s capable of running videos from the platform without ads.</p><p>Experts from the industry, like Modras, are warning that YouTube’s efforts to stop ad blockers could result in more complex blocking tactics. These more complex tactics could lead to the creation of unintentional security holes.</p><p>If you’re looking alternatives, extensions like uBlock Origin still work when used on Firefox. Adblock Plus has also offered <a href="https://blog.adblockplus.org/blog/whats-happening-with-youtube-ads" target="_blank">some suggestions</a> on how to get past the anti-ad block wall. There’s also the option of biting the bullet and paying for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/youtube-premium-1119004/">YouTube Premium</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

The cables and data centers and hyperlinks grew up around me; they grew with me. I find it hard to disentangle the evolution of my psyche from that of the internet.</p><p>Explaining it to my daughter, who was born in 2017, a year when the world’s largest economy had begun tearing itself apart from the tension of this ever-evolving network, I tell her that the internet is like an alien intelligence. We don’t know exactly what it is; it has just landed, and only the first ship. We are trying to figure out how to talk to it. The first generation of explorers have noted that by making certain finger motions you can make the aliens show you images of cats and clothes, or tell you all the ways the world is falling apart.</p><p>For a long time, I thought this was all there was to it. I could tap the keyboard in a particular way and the screen would show me the weather, or tell me which translation of the Iliad to read and then make someone jump in a truck and drive it to our house. I preferred the Iliad to the screen.</p><p>But then, late 2021, after I had been making intricate finger movements again, I woke up in our guesthouse before sunrise and noticed that something had changed.</p><p>During the night, the internet had been set in motion. Tossing hither and thither in silence—as the fields lay frozen and waiting and the hedgehog slept in its pile of leaves—the internet had rearranged itself around me.</p><p>I had written an essay about Ivan Illich and systems thinking, a topic I had never found anyone else intrigued by, and which magazines thought below a rejection letter—and the internet had suddenly reshaped itself so that my keyboard hooked up to the screens of a bunch of people who wanted to talk about these topics, and a little later, their keyboards hooked up to mine.</p><p><span>I had written for 15 years, but never before had this happened. I had conjured a minor conference! And I hadn’t even known that you could&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span> that.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://escapingflatland.substack.com/subscribe?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=magaziney-home-page&amp;just_signed_up=true&amp;requires_confirmation=&amp;subscription_id=51966669&amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fescapingflatland.substack.com%2F&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Upgrade to paid&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:&quot;button-wrapper&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://escapingflatland.substack.com/subscribe?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=magaziney-home-page&amp;just_signed_up=true&amp;requires_confirmation=&amp;subscription_id=51966669&amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fescapingflatland.substack.com%2F" rel=""><span>Upgrade to paid</span></a></p><p>This gave me a first glimpse of the social mechanics of the internet. Looking at the traffic data, and talking to readers, I could retrace how my words had traveled through the network, and I got a sense of why. I didn’t fully understand it; I don’t think anyone does. But like a scientist who’s got hold of an alien artifact, I proceeded by gleefully and semi-randomly pushing every button I could find to see what happened. I would think of a series of funny finger movements and then I’d say to myself, LOL I wonder what this combination does? And then I’d try.</p><p>The way the machine seemed to work was:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p><span>The more precise and niche the words I input, the better the internet would match me with people I could forge meaningful relationships with. This precision was hard for me, partly because my sense for how communication is supposed to work is shaped by reading mass media. Writing for a general public, you need to be broad and a bit bland. I didn’t want a general public. I wanted a specific set of people, the people who could help me along as a human being obsessed with certain intellectual problems. I didn’t know who these people&nbsp;</span><em>were</em><span>. I only knew that they existed. Hence my writing was a search query. It needed to be phrased in such a way that it found these people and, if necessary, filtered others.</span></p></li><li><p>The pleasant parts of the internet seemed to be curated by human beings, not algorithms. For my writing to find its way in this netherworld, I needed to have a rough sense of how information flowed down there. The pattern was this: words flowed from the periphery to the centers. This was a surprisingly rapid stream. Then the words cascaded from the center down in a broader but slower stream to the periphery again.</p></li></ol><p>I will spend the rest of this essay unpacking those two statements.</p><p><span>It will seem like I am mainly talking about how to use writing to forge meaningful relationships. I think doing that is beautiful and important. But lurking behind it is a larger idea. Namely, that </span><a href="https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/first-we-shape-our-social-graph-then" rel="">you can shape yourself by reshaping your relationships</a><span>. By changing who you are addressing, and the responses you garner, you steer your development. You </span><a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2022/08/29/blogging-agency/" rel="">become more agentic</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Human brains are wired such that we get rewarded for attending to surprisal. If we turn our attention toward things that surprise us we get&nbsp;</span><em>excited</em><span>—and our model of the world changes. It grows more complex.</span></p><p>This is easy at first. My one-year-old was in complete rapture today on seeing a hen. But after a while, hens do not surprise us anymore, even if they are scratching dirt. We need a bigger hit to get the same high. To make hens interesting again, you could perhaps read about how they originally lived in the jungle, or you might get into the biology of egg production, or, more likely, you’ll pursue something more interesting than hens. Any which way, by pursuing your interest, you will move toward complexity. The simple things do not surprise you anymore. So you turn your attention to more complicated things. This is an amazing algorithm: do interesting things and magically arrive at a complex understanding of the world.</p><p><span>Sadly, it also leads you down a path that will likely end in existential loneliness and sobbing. What leads you there is the fact that the particular complexity that catches your interest is highly idiosyncratic. People get interested in all sorts of things. I have heard, from credible sources, that there even exist people who are interested in the names of Brazilian soccer players! Having idiosyncratic interests that grow in complexity means that&nbsp;</span><em>if you pursue</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>them too far you will end up obsessed with things that no one else around you cares about</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>(There is a counteracting force in that humans tend to mimic the interests of those around them. But this is of little help for those of us for whom ”those around them” mostly means niche bloggers, contributors at Wikipedia, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus" rel="">Erasmus of Rotterdam</a><span>.)</span></p><p>People feeling alone in their interests has always been true to a certain extent, but the internet has made it much worse. The excess of information allows you to travel down your path of interest with mad velocity. On the internet, Wonderland is recursive, with rabbit holes opening up to yet more rabbit holes; you never stop falling. And the further you fall, the less likely it is that anyone you’ve ever met is falling where you are. This will make you immensely sad. You will visit your parents, and when they ask you about your life you will have two choices. You can either be incomprehensible and see them grow concerned about things you are excited about, or you can talk about surface-level things and cry a little when you are alone at night.</p><p><span>The reason I’m spelling out this dynamic is twofold. First, you&nbsp;</span><em>can</em><span> get out of this mess if you want to. You do that by writing online (or publishing cool pieces of software, or videos, or whatever makes you tickle—as long as you work in public). Second, if you want to get out of the mess the key lies exactly in understanding that you are not the only person who has no one to talk to about the things you get obsessed by.</span></p><p><span>When writing in public, there is a common idea that you should make it&nbsp;</span><em>accessible</em><span>. This is a left over from mass media. Words addressed to a large and diverse set of people need to be simple and clear and free of jargon. It is valuable to write clearly of course, to a degree. Clear writing is clear thinking. But to make the content accessible? To cut digressions and obscure references to reduce the number of things people need to understand to make sense of your argument? Really?</span></p><p><span>That is against our purposes here. A blog post is&nbsp;</span><em>a search query</em><span>. You write to find your tribe; you write so they will know what kind of fascinating things they should route to your inbox. If you follow common wisdom, you will cut exactly the things that will help you find these people. It is like </span><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/06/19/american-sublime" rel="">the time</a><span> someone told the composer Morton Feldman he should write for “the man in the street”. Feldman went over and looked out the window, and who did he see? Jackson Pollock.</span></p><p>Write for Jackson Pollock.</p><p>The people you will be able to have deep conversations with have, like you, already been surprised by the simple, clear things. They need more to get high. And this “more” will be wildly idiosyncratic. It cannot be summarized in a list of writing rules.</p><p>So what do you do?</p><p>You ask yourself: What would have made me jump off my chair if I had read it six months ago (or a week ago, or however fast you write)? If you have figured out something that made you ecstatic, this is what you should write. And you do not dumb it down, because you were not stupid six months ago, you just knew less. You also write with as much useful detail and beauty as you can muster, because that is what you would have wanted.</p><p><span>Six months ago, I was thinking about how large language models will affect how we learn. The essay&nbsp;</span><a href="https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/gpt-3" rel="">Using GPT-3 to augment human learning</a><span> would have made me jump off my chair and run out to Johanna talking excitedly and incomprehensibly; that’s why I wrote it.</span></p><p>To make it interesting for myself, I made it longish and detailed. I like it when people don’t just talk in the abstract but show you with examples, preferably many examples, and preferably taken from the real world so they are messy. Some people find this excess annoying. I don’t. Rich data lets me develop a tacit understanding of the domain. So I wrote 3000 words about how to prompt GPT-3 in ways that make it more truthful, and I included a long dialogue where the AI diagnoses Johanna’s itching hands; and another one about how cities affect innovation; and a third about digitally mediated apprenticeships. I also made the essay a bit literary and flamboyant, which you are not “supposed” to do when writing about AI, at least not if you want the average LessWrong reader to upvote it. I’m not the average Less Wrong reader; I much prefer Thomas Bernhard’s rants to Eliezer Yudkowsky’s. Hence, I made it flamboyant.</p><p><span>I’m not saying it was a great essay; I’m saying&nbsp;</span><em>I</em><span> would have loved it. The essay would have answered most of the questions I had, and it would have given me a new more complex understanding of language models that I could have used to get excited by even more obscure things. And because the internet is big, there were a few thousand people who felt the same way—and I felt really deeply for these people.</span></p><p>It is crazy-beautiful to have a stranger arrive in your inbox, and they are excited by exactly the same things as you! You start dropping the most obscure references, and they’re like, yeah, read that, love it. The first handful of times it happened, Johanna asked me what was wrong. I was crying in the kitchen.</p><p>Those were tears of homecoming.</p><p>And—as if that wasn’t good enough—now these people are routing me interesting things about language models, cow breeding, Quintilian, 19th-century dictionaries, graph-based operating systems . . . and on and on . . . I get more and better input than I could ever have found on my own, a lot of it from sources outside the clear web, tinkerers writing to me about tools they are building, or new observations they have made.</p><p>In other words, I have, to a degree, automated my obsessions now. I have summoned a milieu that pulls me where I want to go!</p><p>A search query doesn’t have to be a 5000-word effort post to work (though the internet does reward that amply). Anything that would have been useful to you sometime in the past will do. Alexey Guzey makes lists, half of which are made up of quotes, and they are incredibly useful and have been instrumental in reshaping his network so that he could start New Science. Most good Twitter accounts can be viewed in the same way.</p><p>If you follow the advice above, you will write essays that almost no one likes.</p><p><span>Luckily,&nbsp;</span><em>almost no one</em><span> multiplied by the entire population of the internet is plenty if you can only find them.</span></p><p>How do you do that?</p><p>Well, you can probably spot a few of them already, even if you are a fairly naive internet user. The people you can spot will be those that have large followings. This might depress you. The famous people will seem out of reach, and the rest of the internet will seem to be pure madness.</p><p>When starting out, my model of how it would work was this: I wouldn’t find any readers. And if I did, they would be plebeians like myself, and then, maybe? hopefully? as I found more of them, I would level up? so that I could connect to people with increasingly large followings? like climbing a corporate hierarchy? This is not how it works.</p><p>The social structure of the internet is shaped like a river.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg" width="1000" height="750" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:750,&quot;width&quot;:1000,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Image&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="Image" title="Image" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3f7da57d-e7a6-4d1f-ad4c-60c2691b69ca_1000x750.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>People with big followings, say someone like Sam Harris, is the mouth of the Mississippi emptying into the Mexican Gulf. Sam has millions of tributaries. There are perhaps a few hundred people Sam pays close attention to, and these in turn have a few hundred they listen to—tributaries flowing into headwaters flowing into rivers. The way messages spread on the internet is by flowing up this order of streams, from people with smaller networks to those with larger, and then it spreads back down through the larger networks. Going over land, from one tributary to another, is harder than going up the stream order and then down again.</p><p>This dynamic is easier to spot on Twitter, where you get notified every time someone likes or retweets what you have written (compared to a blog where the traffic data is more murky). When I tried out the title of this piece as a tweet—a primitive way to A/B-test—I could map that dynamic.</p><p><span>It was not a viral tweet. I am a minor tributary in the Twitter river system (my follower count was ~100 at the time). But a few of my followers were slightly larger. They had found me, I assume, because I made replies to their tweets that they sort of liked. Two of these, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/houshuang" rel="">Stian Håklev</a><span> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/tomcritchlow" rel="">Tom Critchlow</a><span>, resonated with the tweet, so they retweeted it. A few others gave it a heart, which is also a way to route tweets (though it is a weaker form of routing than a retweet).</span></p><p><span>Then a few accounts that were an order of magnitude larger still retweeted it, because they followed Stian and Tom and now saw it. And from there it rushed up the stream order. It only took an hour or two for the tweet to reach the largest accounts it would reach (Tiago Forte with 84k followers, who retweeted it, and Balaji Srinavasan with 681K, who routed it on through a like). But&nbsp;</span><em>the smaller accounts took much longer</em><span>. Information rushes up and then trickles down. The larger accounts are not larger without a reason, but, at least in part, because they spend more time routing information in the network!</span></p><p><span>(This, by the way, is how you sent letters before the post service was established. In the 1600s, if you were an intellectual who wanted to send a letter to another intellectual, you’d send it to someone who could forward it to Marin Mersenne—because he knew everyone who knew anyone and would surely know someone who could find the person you wanted to reach. This I learned from a tweet by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv" rel="">Visa</a><span>, who is the modern day version of Mersenne.)</span></p><p><span>The trick, then, is this. You take the person you think is closest to the person (or type of person) you want to talk to and send what you write to this person. A subreddit is a good place to start. I usually do this by collecting interesting people on Twitter through good reply game. Then I can simply post my essays there and know they will have a chance of seeing it. Occasionally—and this makes more sense in the start—I send essays to people directly, in their direct messages or to their email. I sent&nbsp;</span><a href="https://escapingflatland.substack.com/p/apprenticeship-online" rel="">Apprenticeship Online</a><span> to José Rincón, mostly as a way to give context to a few comments I had on one of his essays. He didn’t answer, but he did tweet out the essay, which brought in a handful of interesting people in my orbit. It turns out that if you’ve written something that&nbsp;</span><em>you</em><span> find interesting, it is not unlikely that people you like will find it interesting too, and pass it on if you give them the chance.</span></p><p>As you start routing information and putting out blog posts, you will begin to accumulate connections. Useful information will start to stream toward you, turning you into a small hub yourself. This will allow you to collect and curate information and route it back out, which will allow even more people to connect to you, in a flywheel that lets you do increasingly useful and good work. I especially enjoy it when intelligent people attack me; I then invite them to comment on upcoming drafts.</p><p><span>You can also post to subreddits and forums, like </span><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/" rel="">LessWrong </a><span>or </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/" rel="">the SlateStarCodex subreddit</a><span>, that act like intellectual cafés on the internet. Pasting your posts there, it is easy to find community when you are starting out; you don't have to scream into the void. And, more importantly, a lot of people pass through these cafés, and if they are&nbsp;</span><em>your kind</em><span> they can help spread your work in the netherworld of personal connections and open weird doors on the internet for you. I relied heavily on forums in the beginning, gaining my first hundred or so subscribers this way, but they are growing less important now that I have collected a set of connections of my own. I can get a more precise spread of my essays by just emailing them to my subscribers and putting out a few tweets. But I feel deep gratitude, especially to LessWrong, which provides me with an editor who helps me with grammar and fact-checking.</span></p><p><span>By the way, the reason you will eventually grow out of forums is that&nbsp;</span><em>they are search queries written by other people</em><span>. LessWrong was summoned into existence by</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky" rel="">&nbsp;Eliezer Yudkowsky</a><span> and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson" rel="">Robin Hanson</a><span> writing a sequence of exceptionally powerful search queries (on Overcoming bias), blog posts so strong that the networks they created survived the exodus of the original nodes.</span></p><p>This is what online writing is at its limit—the summoning of a new culture.</p><p><span>If we squint a little, we could even say that this is how the internet itself came into existence.

This discovery is particularly relevant for developers and entrepreneurs who utilize AI in their offerings, suggesting a new approach to prompt engineering that incorporates emotional context.</span></p><p>The study found that prompts with added emotional weight—dubbed "EmotionPrompts"—can improve AI performance in tasks ranging from grammar correction to creative writing. The implications are clear: incorporating emotional cues can lead to more effective and responsive AI applications.</p><p>For those embedding AI into products, these findings offer a tactical advantage. By applying this understanding of emotional triggers, AI can be fine-tuned to better meet user needs.</p><p>The crux of the matter lies in the very nature of communication. When humans converse, they don't just exchange information; they share feelings, intentions, and urgency. It's a dance of context and subtext, often orchestrated by emotional cues. The question this study tackles is whether AI, devoid of emotion itself, can respond to the emotional weight we imbue in our words—and if so, does it alter its performance?</p><p>Communication transcends the exchange of information; it involves the interplay of emotions and intentions. In AI, understanding whether the emotional context of human interaction can enhance machine response is more than academic—it could redefine the effectiveness of AI in everyday applications. If AI can adjust its performance based on the emotional cues it detects, we're looking at a future where our interactions with machines could also be more intuitive and human-like, leading to better outcomes in customer service, education, and beyond.</p><p>Before diving into the human-like responsiveness of AI, let's unpack the technical side. LLMs, such as GPT-4, are built on intricate neural networks that analyze vast amounts of text data. They identify patterns and relationships between words, sentences, and overall context to generate responses that are coherent and contextually appropriate.</p><p>The core innovation of the study lies in the introduction of "EmotionPrompt." This method involves integrating emotional significance into the prompts provided to LLMs. Unlike standard prompts, which are straightforward requests for information or action, EmotionPrompts carry an additional layer of emotional relevance—like stressing the importance of the task for one's career or implying urgency.</p><p>The integration of emotional cues into language models has introduced a fascinating dynamic: LLMs can produce superior outputs when the input prompts suggest an emotional significance. The recent study rigorously tested this phenomenon across a variety of models and tasks, offering a wealth of data that could reshape our understanding and utilization of AI.</p><p>The researchers set out to evaluate the performance of LLMs when prompted with emotional cues—a technique they've termed "EmotionPrompt." To ensure the robustness of their findings, they designed 45 distinct tasks that covered a wide range of AI applications:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Deterministic Tasks</strong><span>: These are tasks with definitive right or wrong answers, such as grammar correction, fact-checking, or mathematical problem-solving. The models' performances on these tasks can be measured against clear benchmarks, providing objective data on their accuracy.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Generative Tasks</strong><span>: In contrast, generative tasks require the AI to produce content that may not have a single correct response. This includes creative writing, generating explanations, or providing advice. These tasks are particularly challenging for AI, as they must not only be correct but also coherent, relevant, and engaging.</span></p></li></ul><p>In the deterministic tasks, researchers observed a notable increase in performance when using EmotionPrompts. For instance, when tasked with instruction induction—a process that tests the AI's ability to follow and generate instructions based on given input—the models showed an 8.00% improvement in their relative performance.</p><p>Even more striking was the performance leap in the BIG-Bench tasks, which serve as a broad benchmark for evaluating the abilities of language models. Here, the use of EmotionPrompts yielded an incredible 115% improvement over standard prompts. This suggests that the models were not only understanding the tasks better but also producing more accurate or appropriate responses when the stakes were presented as higher.</p><p>To complement the objective metrics, the study also incorporated a human element. A group of 106 participants evaluated the generative tasks' outputs, assessing the quality of AI-generated responses. This subjective analysis covered aspects such as performance, truthfulness, and responsibility—a reflection of the nuanced judgment humans bring to bear on AI outputs.</p><p>When assessing the quality of responses from both vanilla prompts and those enhanced with emotional cues, the participants noted an average improvement of 10.9%. This jump in performance highlights the potential for EmotionPrompts to not only elevate the factual accuracy of AI responses but also enhance their alignment with human expectations and values.</p><p>The implications of these findings are manifold. On a technical level, they support the huge body of evidence that LLMs are sensitive to prompt engineering—a fact that can be harnessed to fine-tune AI outputs for specific needs. From a practical standpoint, the enhancements in performance with EmotionPrompts can lead to more effective AI applications in fields where accuracy and the perception of understanding are critical, such as in educational technology, customer service, and mental health support.</p><p>The improvements reported in the study are particularly significant as they point toward a new frontier in human-AI communication. By effectively simulating a heightened emotional context, we can guide AI to produce responses that are not only technically superior but also perceived as more thoughtful and attuned to human concerns. Basically, these findings suggest that telling your LLM that you're worried or under pressure to get a good generation makes them perform better, all else equal!</p><p><span>While the improvements are statistically significant, they </span><strong>do not</strong><span> imply that LLMs have emotional awareness. The increase in performance is a result of how these models have been engineered to process and prioritize information embedded in the prompts. Moreover, the study opens up a conversation about the ethical use of such techniques, as there's a fine line between enhancing AI performance and misleading users about the capabilities and sensitivities of AI systems.</span></p><p>In summary, the study's findings offer a compelling case for the strategic use of EmotionPrompts in improving LLM performance. The enhancements observed in both objective and subjective evaluations underscore the potential of integrating emotional nuances into AI interactions to produce more effective, responsive, and user-aligned outputs.</p><p>When we tell AI that we're relying heavily on its answers, it "doubles down" to provide us with more precise, thoughtful, and thorough responses. The AI isn't actually feeling the pressure, but it seems to recognize these emotional signals and adjust its performance accordingly.</p><p>For those incorporating AI into their businesses or products, this isn't just an interesting tidbit; it's actionable intelligence. By understanding and utilizing emotional triggers effectively, AI can be made more responsive and useful.</p><p>In a nutshell, this research indicates that LLMs like GPT-4 respond with improved performance when prompted with emotional context, a finding that could be quite useful for developers and product managers. This isn't about AI understanding emotions but rather about how these models handle nuanced prompts. It's a significant insight for those looking to refine AI interactions, though it comes with ethical considerations regarding user expectations of AI emotional intelligence.</p><p>Emotionally aware AI doesn't just understand our words—it understands our urgency and acts accordingly.

<p>Nuclear is back. After decades of decline in the West’s nuclear energy industry, public and private support of nuclear energy is reversing course. As the specter of climate change grows and intensifies, increased nuclear power production has emerged as a promising pathway to solving the world’s&nbsp;<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2023-0074/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20energy%20trilemma,and%20reliability%20of%20energy%20supplies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">energy trilemma</a>: an energy supply that is secure, affordable, and sustainable.&nbsp;</p><p>While nuclear has received a lot of bad press in the past thanks to high profile nuclear disasters like Fukushima, Chernobyl, and Three Mile Island, its numerous benefits have been receiving more and more attention in recent years. In fact, public support for nuclear energy in the United States is at a&nbsp;<a href="https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Support-For-Nuclear-Energy-In-The-US-Is-At-A-10-Year-High.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10-year high</a>&nbsp;according to a Gallup poll released earlier this year.&nbsp;<!-- /192633929/OilPrice-300x250-ATF-Mobile -->

<!-- END: /192633929/OilPrice-300x250-ATF-Mobile -->
</p><p>Nuclear advocates argue that nuclear energy has a number of unique benefits that we can no longer afford to overlook in the context of climate change. It is a completely carbon-free form of energy production, and – crucially – it’s a baseload power source. This means that, unlike solar and wind energy, its production isn’t variable, waxing and waning according to weather patterns and the Earth’s rotation. While wind and solar have some significant advantages over nuclear (no toxic waste, for one thing), their scalability is currently limited by their variability and the relatively undeveloped long-term energy storage sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuclear is also a proven technology with plenty of existing infrastructure. While the United States fleet of nuclear power plants is aging after decades of disinterest and neglect, it’s still formidable – nuclear power still provides&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly 20%</a>&nbsp;of the nation’s energy. And while the nuclear sector had stalled out in the West over the last few decades, nuclear plant technology has marched forward, solving some of the major challenges toward re-embracing nuclear as a central power source. While traditional nuclear reactors are extremely costly to build, recent breakthroughs in&nbsp;<a href="https://oilprice.com/Alternative-Energy/Nuclear-Power/Small-Nuclear-Reactors-The-Answer-To-Big-Techs-Energy-Crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small modular reactors</a>&nbsp;– which can be mass produced in a dedicated facility and assembled onsite – are already changing this.&nbsp;</p><p>The changing tides for nuclear energy can be quantified through market patterns for the uranium that fuels the reactors. Yellowcake uranium prices have skyrocketed, reaching their highest level in over a decade, going by more than 10% month-over-month. “Uranium demand has been lifted by governments from Washington to Seoul and Paris seeking energy independence by extending the lifetime of the existing fleet of nuclear reactors as they contemplate building new plants after gas prices skyrocketed due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” the Financial Times&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/de05a4a2-2458-4450-99c2-9dd0e079e9cd?fbclid=IwAR0ndrqQYOrITqILnAGdj9NUB8FPAVBieaRSu0ZnpDKCeDOBszuTZhDfhOE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>&nbsp;last month.&nbsp;</p><p>“You have a focus on energy security colliding with a focus on clean energy,” Grant Isaac, chief financial officer at Cameco, the world’s second-largest uranium producer, told the Financial Times. “The days of buying $40 uranium are over — and probably also for $50 or $60. We’re going to need new supplies,” he added. Uranium mining has seriously dipped since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, when demand plummeted. This is also a factor in pushing up prices, and a major incentive for new mining ventures looking to get in on the current demand surge. While uranium prices still haven’t rebounded to pre-Fukushima levels, they’re well on their way, and some speculators think that they could skyrocket to around $200 per pound by just 2025.<!-- /192633929/OilPrice-300x250-BTF-Mobile -->

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="articleContent" id="article-content"><p>A California jury has awarded $332 million to a man who sued chemical giant Monsanto Co. contending that his cancer was related to decades of using its Roundup weedkiller.</p><div>



<p>A San Diego Superior Court jury awarded damages Tuesday in a lawsuit filed by Mike Dennis, 57, of Carlsbad. He was diagnosed in 2020 with a rare form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.</p>



<p>His lawsuit contended that his illness was related to Roundup’s active ingredient, glyphosate.</p>



<p>Dennis had treatment and has been in remission for nearly three years but there is no cure, Adam Peavy, one of his attorneys, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-county-jury-reaches-332m-verdict-in-trial-claiming-roundup-caused-carlsbad-mans-cancer/3343895/" target="_self" rel="">KNSD-TV.</a></p>



<p>“His doctors have told him it’s going to come back and we’re just waiting to see if that happens,” Peavy said.</p>



<p>The jury found that Monsanto, which is now a division of <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/10/shareholders-are-forcing-bayers-ceo-out-what-do-they-expect-from-his-replacement/" target="_self" rel="">pharmaceutical and biotechnology giant Bayer</a>, failed to provide warnings of Roundup’s risks. But jurors also ruled partially in Bayer’s favor by finding the product design wasn’t defective and the company wasn’t negligent.</p>



<p>Dennis was awarded $7 million in compensatory damages and $325 million in punitive damages.</p>



<p>In a statement to KNSD-TV, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/bayer/" target="_blank" rel="">Bayer</a> said it believes “we have strong arguments on appeal to get this unfounded verdict overturned and the unconstitutionally excessive damage award eliminated or reduced.”</p>



<p>“There were significant and reversible legal and evidentiary errors made during this trial,” Bayer added.</p>



<p>Bayer bought Monsanto for $63 billion in 2018 and has been trying to deal with thousands of claims and lawsuits related to Roundup. In 2020, Bayer&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/a12603a80c8238d1f7af3705cfec610a" target="_self" rel="">announced</a>&nbsp;it would pay up to $10.9 billion to settle some 125,000 filed and unfiled claims.</p></div><p><em>Subscribe to the CFO Daily newsletter to keep up with the trends, issues, and executives shaping corporate finance. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/cfodaily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=cfo_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
In December 1995, about a year after the Saturn launched in Japan and only a few short months after the Saturn's launch in North America, Hitachi released the single most extreme console the world has ever seen.  The HiSaturn Navi.  Its feature list was enormous: slim profile, car adaptor, LCD screen, GPS Navigation, karaoke...  No console before or since dared dream of including half these features, which is why to this day it is probably the rarest and most expensive post-NES console.  In fact, even considering the piles of weird pre-NES hardware, the HiSaturn Navi still ranks as one of the most ridiculously expensive and elusive systems you're ever likely to see.  As of this writing (2003/06/23) you can expect to pay over $1200 USD to get one of these in decent shape with a screen, and more if you get one in like-new condition with all the boxes and manuals intact.  Totally ridiculous, and yet...  
</p><p>
<img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/bar_thestory.gif">
When Sega was creating the Saturn system they enlisted the help of several long-time partners - JVC provided the CD mechanism and Hitachi provided the dual SH-2 CPUs.  As part of a co-branding or cross-licensing agreement, both of these companies produced their own variants of the Saturn hardware.  Both JVC's V-Saturn and Hitachi's HiSaturn were merely coloured variants of the Sega Saturn, with no additional features or capabilities.  All three manufacturers, Sega, JVC + Hitachi, released older oval-button systems and newer round-button systems, and none of these are particularly rare, but then Hitachi threw down the gauntlet.
</p><p>
<img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/hisatopen.jpg"></p><p>
It beggars disbelief to this day.  The Saturn was only a year old when Hitachi threw out the Sega mold and released a completely redesigned system jam packed with goodies.  It's smaller than your average Saturn - about the same width and length, but almost a third shorter and it's nearly flat on top.  It's considerably heavier because of the added components, even considering most of the power supply was made external.  In addition to the standard Saturn ports (serial, AV + controller) it has two microphone inputs for karaoke use, a GPS antenna port, video and audio inputs, a TV-tuner port and a line-out port.  This was all standard equipment.

The launch price was 150,000 Yen, or about $1480 US Dollars at the time.  This certainly helps explain the system's rarity - the price of this system without a screen was more than $1000 above the price of a normal Saturn.  Add another 45,000 Yen ($443) for the LCD screen and you've got a system far beyond the reach of most people.
</p><p>
Also accounting for the system's rarity are the production quantities: only two thousand HiSaturn Navi units were produced every month.  <b>Unconfirmed:</b> I've been told the system was in production for only one month.  Possibly then only 2,000 units were produced.
</p><center><a href="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/hrdhisaturn.jpg"><img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/hisat2.jpg"></a><br><span size="-2">Normal HiSaturn + Pad (click for larger)</span></center>
<p><img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/bar_thescreen.gif">
The LCD screen was released at the same time as the system, but only one thousand units per month were produced - half the number of systems.  It was a backlit active-matrix TFT screen, a very expensive process at the time, with resolution, clarity and contrast surpassing any other console screen - equal in vibrancy but larger than the Turbo Express.  It draws its power from the system, so no additional power supply is required.  .  It clips to the back of the system and plugs in with a short cable to the 'monitor out' port.  When closed it sits flush with the CD door, and has quite a slim profile, when closed the system is approximately the same height as a normal Saturn.  The screen is capable of displaying both interlaced and non-interlaced video.  It has a sliding volume control, and one speaker, as well as tint + brightness controls and a Front/Rear switch, which serves a very secret purpose (I have no idea what).
</p><p>

<img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/bar_GPS.gif">
A GPS antenna port and a GPS antenna/receiver were standard equipment.  In-car navigation systems have been popular in Japan for a very long time, but I'm not sure to whom this particular system seemed a good idea.  Installation of the power supply and GPS antenna were semi-permanent, as the former had to be tucked away carefully to avoid unsightly cable dangle, and the latter needed to be clipped to the handbrake.  When installed you could use the system like any other navi.  The screen showed your location overlaid on a road map, and you could zoom in or out, add locations, plot routes and leave 'bread crumb' trails.  No navi software or boot disc was needed, to operate the navi you merely turned the system on with any Naviken compatible map CD in the drive, and the Navi mode started.
</p><center><img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/hisatgps.jpg"><br><span size="-2">GPS Antenna port + VCD bay</span></center><p>
Operation was a bit tricky.  Unlike normal navi systems the HiSaturn used a controller on a cord, and since two hands were required it was beyond the driver's ability to manipulate the system while driving.  In addition, also unlike other navi systems, there was a sensor that needed to be attached to the hand brake cable, and if you weren't parked with the hand brake on there were several functions unavailable to the user, like route planning.  Also game playing was prohibited while the car was in motion - without the handbrake sensor installed and the handbrake applied the screen would shut off after a game started to load.
<br><img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/hisatclosed1.jpg"></p><p>
If you happen to own one and dare use it in the car, you can bypass this 'feature' by connecting the sensor cable to anything grounded.  
</p><p>
<img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/bar_karaoke.gif">
Karaoke was absolutely huge in Japan.  To say it was a phenomenon is a gross understatement.  Every piece of stereo equipment featuered karaoke inputs.  Portable CD players had CD+G capability and video output jacks, even the Sega CD system had a karaoke option.  With the HiSaturn Navi, the karaoke features were built in, with two microphone ports and independant volume controls, as well as four buttons on top of the unit controlling Echo and Pitch.  In addition, there was a control for voice cancellation or multiplexing on the top of the unit.  These features are present in other Saturn models, but the buttons are software controlled and only accessible while playing music CDs or CD+Gs.  With the HiSaturn Navi you can control the pitch or cancel voice for all audio output, a real laugh during gameplay, I assure you!  
</p><center><img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/hisatsound.jpg"><br><span size="-2">Sound controls + karaoke ports</span></center>
<p><img src="https://nfggames.com/games/hisaturn/bar_technic.gif">
The slim profile of the system made some extra demands for manufacturing, and because it was released relatively early in the Saturn's lifespan there was no newer, smaller chipset to use.  To save space, most of the power supply was made external, but there's still part of it inside.  There are two additional PCBs inside, one for the extra sound controls, and one for the GPS.  There are many additional chips - video select, audio control, the GPS software, etc.  It is fully region moddable like any other Saturn, and you can easily make a switchless mod for playing US or European games without cutting new holes.  It has a VCD slot for the movie card, and it uses the same CR2032 battery for backup RAM.  There is a cart slot, but the screen cannot be closed with a cart inserted, and the cart will block some of the screen controls.

The screen uses composite video, not RGB, but this isn't really noticable given the course triad-pixel arrangement.  In a very strange move, the system does not output RGB through the multi-AV port like every other Saturn.  I don't know the reason for this, but it's a relatively easy fix.

I'm not certain the TV tuner was ever released.  I've never seen one for sale, if it did reach store shelves it was in frighteningly limited numbers.  The system manual makes reference to this unit as 'forthcoming' along with the never-released hard drive, and the keyboard and floppy drive which were released much later, and not by Hitachi.  The HiSaturn Navi pad is the same as the other HiSaturn systems, which are in turn only cosmetically different than the Sega-branded units.

<p>03 November 2023</p>

<p>You made me create a wooden Game Boy shell. Yes, you made me do it. After I got myself a CNC machine a while back I just made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ePvpYVNEvzk" target="_blank">wooden Game Boy cartridge</a> to get to know the machine, but social media wanted more. So, I made a Game Boy out of walnut wood.</p>

<h2 id="a-wooden-game-boy">A wooden Game Boy</h2>

<p>This project mostly began as a user request. When I got myself a CNC router a few months ago, one of the little exercises I did was a wooden Game Boy cartridge (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ePvpYVNEvzk" target="_blank">Youtube short clip</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy-cartridge" target="_blank">project files on GitHub</a>). It was a mix of “let’s see if I can do that” and “sure the retro gamers on social media will love this”, but I did not expect how much they would love it and of course they asked for more. So, I did some testing, spent some time and several weeks later I find myself in the possession of a Game Boy with a beautiful walnut wood shell.</p>

<p>I mean, look at that thing. Isn’t it gorgeous? So, if you want to learn how exactly it was built, read on. If you just want to see some CNC timelapses and detail shots of the wooden Game Boy, you should probably watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rECMivhOat4" target="_blank">Youtube video</a> instead.</p>

<h2 id="important-notes">Important notes</h2>

<p>Before we go into details, there are some general things you should know to properly judge the results. At least if you plan to reproduce the Game Boy, you should read these carefully.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a total noob. Yeah, I know that Game Boy does not look like the work of a noob and I would like to believe that I have proven that I can use a CNC router, but the noobness does not necessarily refer to the complexity of the project or my ability to wield some 3d software. This is more about best practices and hardware suggestions. I document what I did and which tools I used, but you should be aware that what I did mostly uses the first method I learned and the tools are the first tools of this kind that I own. They worked to create that Game Boy, but I lack the experience to tell if they are the best or even good methods/tools for this job.</li>
  <li>Related to this, I barely have any experience with wood. I have applied what I learned from some videos, but I have no idea how long that Game Boy will last. Wood tends to grow, shrink and bend over time, especially if exposed to changing humidity. This Game Boy could become something that I pass along to my grand children or it could crack open tomorrow. I literally have no experience to make any assumptions about this.</li>
  <li>The project is far from perfect and many design choices were made as it went along. At the end I knew some things better than at the beginning and some later toolpaths are designed to fix problems of the earlier one. The Game Boy you see here is my successful first attempt, but this also means that the design files have not been polished or tested a second time.</li>
  <li>I designed this Game Boy around aftermarket parts and especially for using an IPS mod. It should also fit original displays, but I have not tried that.</li>
  <li>In the end I closed the case with wood glue, because the original screws did not hold it together properly. So, there currently is no way to open it for maintenance. Read the notes of the drilling toolpaths for more info and thoughts on the problem.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-files-and-software">Project files and software</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the bad news for most of those who already have a CNC machine and just want to reproduce my work: I use the Blender CAM plugin. Yes, there is a CNC CAM plugin for Blender and it is free. Yes, it is quite versatile and powerful. Yes, using it is a pain in the ass even if you are used to Blender.</p>

<p>Still, I love it and the CAM alternatives that seem to allow me to do similar things are very expensive<sup id="fnref:linux" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:linux" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So, I ended up using Blender CAM, which unfortunately means that many CNC users out there will cry before having to copy my models to their CAM to painstakingly recreate the toolpaths there.</p>

<p>Therefore, the project files are <em>blend</em> files <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy" target="_blank">on GitHub</a> and I release everything under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. Do what ever you like with it, just make sure to mention me as the source. …and maybe keep in mind that Nintendo might want to have a word about trademarks if you try to sell these with their logo on it.</p>

<p>In addition to the <em>blend</em> files I have also uploaded the gcode files that I actually used. They are for <a href="https://github.com/grbl/grbl" target="_blank">grbl-based machines</a>, but even if your CNC uses a grbl controller it is a bad idea to just feed them to your machine. You will have to adapt it to the equipment that you actually use and I only added them as reference to review and compare.</p>

<p>Speaking of equipment-specific things: The feeds and cutting depths set in the <em>blend</em> files are for the weak spindle on my machine. If your spindle is stronger, you can quite certainly go a lot faster. But also keep in mind that the <strong>speeds in the <em>blend</em> files do not have any meaning</strong>. My spindle is not digitally controlled and since it has little torque at lower speeds I pretty much used it at its maximum of 10,000 rpm. You will have to adapt this to your machine and your bits.</p>

<h2 id="the-hardware-i-used">The hardware I used</h2>

<p>Remember that I only got my CNC machine a few months ago, so do not expect comparative insights here. I will document what I use and try to explain a few things to people who have never used a CNC before. If you have a CNC and are just interested in the toolpaths, you can probably skip to the table with bits I used.</p>

<h3 id="the-cnc-machine">The CNC machine</h3>

<p>If you have never looked at CNC machines before, this probably looks like a very fancy and professional setup. If you know about CNC machines, you probably recognize immediately that it isn’t. My machine is a <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Genmitsu-PROVerXL-4030-3-Achsen-Graviermaschine-Kugelumlaufspindel/dp/B0C57YC46Q/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1U17F5MJP5IVT&amp;keywords=proverxl+4030+v2&amp;qid=1698789743&amp;sprefix=proverxl%252Caps%252C136&amp;sr=8-2&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=ab08ff80c388456f7dd1a0eac9b976af&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">Genmitsu PROVerXL 4030 V2</a>, which is the toughest Genmitsu CNC router, but in the world of hobbyist CNC machines ranks somewhere in the middle. It is much more rigid than the small 3D printer like machines (that Genmitsu machines are often associated with), but much smaller and weaker than machines by more prestigious brands.</p>

<p>As a beginner I think that it is extremely capable for my needs, but its weak spot is its stock 400W spindle. Compared to stronger machines you will find that my toolpaths take much longer as I am doing significantly shallower cuts. Also the spindle is pretty much limited to its top speed of 10,000rpm as it seems to lack torque at lower settings. For the finer tools I would have wished for a higher speed and for some situations a reduced speed might have been beneficial as well. Luckily, this can be upgraded and I probably will do so in the future.</p>

<p>In the end, I mostly chose the 4030 V2 because of its rather small footprint. While others might consider this to be a disadvantage, it was the largest machine that I could fit into an enclosure onto my workbench. Since I do not have a proper wood workshop, the machine has to share a room with other hobbies in my basement, which means that I needed to address noise and dust, because CNC machines can deliver plenty of both.</p>

<p>I went for the <a href="https://openbuildspartstore.com/modular-enclosure-system/" target="_blank">OpenBuilds Enclosure Kit 510</a>, added acoustic foam and paired it with the <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Genmitsu-Staubschutzschuh-Durchmesser-Spindelmotoren-Au%25C3%259Fendurchmesser/dp/B09QM4DLKK/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_w=Hqi7Z&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.414f57ed-562f-47a3-9f9d-2fc23abd569f%253Aamzn1.symc.adba8a53-36db-43df-a081-77d28e1b71e6&amp;pf_rd_p=414f57ed-562f-47a3-9f9d-2fc23abd569f&amp;pf_rd_r=ZQ52E38MHKKN5W61JYGM&amp;pd_rd_wg=lx81o&amp;pd_rd_r=4dbd95d4-7a8d-4270-89a8-6e8d66ac83d8&amp;ref_=pd_gw_ci_mcx_mr_hp_atf_m&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=73b06a2d3b45b4382ef6faf701724823&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">Genmitsuo dust shoe</a> and a flexible hose.

Add a workbench, an LED lamp inside the enclosure and a screen at the side (you might recognize this one from my <a href="https://there.oughta.be/a/bullet-time-video-booth">bullet time rig</a>) and that’s my setup.</p>

<p>Just a few warnings if you are thinking about picking up CNC as a hobby: Do not underestimate the noise and the amount of dust such a machine produces. The enclosure and dust extraction in my case ate up a huge part of my budget for a good reason. If you are in a dirty workshop far from other people you can ignore the enclosure, but please still think about your hearing and your lungs. I highly recommend to use a dust extraction system anyway and if you are doing this in a room that you spend a lot of time in or that you use for other things in general, a simple shop vacuum will not be enough. Fine saw dust will escape regular vacuums and you should really look into ones with a filter for dust class M.</p>

<p>Oh, and one more warning: I do not have a problem to leave my 3D printer unattended as long as I can check in once in a while through a webcam. The typical 3D printer accidents turn the machine into a PLA spaghetti factory, but it is still ok if you stop it 15 minutes later. The more dangerous typical fail state of a 3D printer is a cable fire especially on cheap printers like mine, but if you place your printer in an environment of low flammability there is plenty of time to recognize the problem before severe consequences.</p>

<p>This is different for a CNC machine! If things go south with a CNC machine, they go south fast! The typical CNC accident means driving a sharp piece of metal rotating at 10,000 rpm into something that was not supposed to receive that piece of metal. You can break a lot of stuff within seconds and that is the harmless case. Imagine running that 10,000 rpm metal stick into a dry piece of wood and leaving it there because of a failure or maybe because that wood got loose and now follows your machine. Remember those adventure movies where they make fire with a rotating stick? Do this with a 400W motor covered by saw dust and maybe with a dust extraction system sucking everything into the big container with even more sawdust.</p>

<p>The point is that you should not leave a running CNC machine, have a fire extinguisher nearby and make sure to have an easily accessible emergency stop that actually cuts power to your machine (in case of an enclose, put something <a href="https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B09FK8KHC9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=6b2fbd57c48ea67cb2eacb8bbf65fee2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">like this</a> on the outside). Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tpxgZUYGSI&amp;ab_channel=WinstonMoy" target="_blank">a video to encourage you to take this serious</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-bits">The bits</h3>

<p>Like in the previous section, I will be talking to people new to CNC routers here. Someone who already knows this stuff will probably just have a glimpse at the table below anyway.</p>

<p>While CNC machining often looks like you are just pushing a common drill bit to some wood, this is not what is happening at all (unless maybe you are actually drilling holes with your CNC). What looks like a drill bit usually is a milling bit (a so-called end mill). It is not designed to plunge vertically into the material (although in many cases it has to be able to do this, too), but to carve away material horizontally.</p>

<p>One interesting aspect of this is that the spiral of the bit might go in different directions. Some bits have a right-handed spiral like a drilling bit, but others can be left-handed or not even have a spiral form at all. The reason is that the actual milling is done at the side and just requires sharp edges while the spiral mostly helps to move the material away from the cutting edge. Right-handed drills are common as you want to push material upwards out of the drilling hole and for the same reason you will find many end mills with that shape. They pull material upwards and away from your work piece, therefore they are called “upcut” bits. The downside of this is that the upwards motion can fray the edges of your work piece, which is why I also often use the counterpart with a left-handed spiral, the “downcut” bit. There are also some other forms and compromises, but I only have those two variants and so for each task I have to pick a suitable diameter for my end mill (obviously you need small ones for details and large one to remove much material fast) and decide between upcut and downcut as a trade-off between a nice finish and efficient material removal especially in tight spots.</p>

<figure>

<img src="https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/1280/bits.jpg" alt="Photos of the nine bits I used. Each one is shown from the side with indications of diameter, shape and cutting direction." srcset="    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/640/bits.jpg 640w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/768/bits.jpg 768w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/1024/bits.jpg 1024w,    https://there.oughta.be/assets/resized/images/2023-11-03/1280/bits.jpg 1280w, https://there.oughta.be/assets/images/2023-11-03/bits.jpg 3840w" sizes="(max-width: 60rem) 100vw, 60rem">

<figcaption>The nine bits I used in this project, roughly grouped by shape and size.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another aspect is the shape of the tip of the bit. The most common one is the flat end mill, which is best suited to create a flat surface. However, if you want to create a curved 3D shape, this is not a good choice as it tends to create little steps that look similar to the layers of 3D printers. A ballnose bit with a circular tip can help as it can create a slope between one line to the next one.</p>

<p>A very important shape is the V-shape. On one hand, this is used to directly create angled edges (chamfers) in a single pass, but also they can be used to carve text or other designs. Imagine to just try and cut a small square. If you use a flat end mill with a 3mm diameter, you can quickly remove the material from the square, but the corners will always be rounded with a radius of 1.5mm. So, instead you use a smaller end mill, let’s say 1mm. Now it takes ages to remove the material<sup id="fnref:longsmallbit" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:longsmallbit" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and still have round corners, now with a radius of 0.5mm (which might be ok for many use cases). That’s where the V-bit shines: If you do not care about how deep you cut, but just want to have a 2D shape at the surface, a V-shaped bit can simply use different depths to have different diameters at the surface. Need a tiny bit for a sharp corner? Only use the very tip of the bit. Need a large diameter to clear most of that example square? Go deep for a large radius. The result is a typical angled V-carving look that many (including me) find quite pleasing. Just search for V-carving on Youtube to find a bunch of very satisfying videos.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that still is not all that needs to be considered when picking the right tool for each detail. You also need to consider the cutting length and the overall clearance of your bits. The cutting length is how deep the bit can go so that its sharp bits are still cutting away material instead of its dull bits just rubbing the wood and heating it up. That’s not much of an issue for me as my weak spindle usually limits the depth of my cuts anyway. The clearance is a much bigger issue because overlooking it usually causes some kind of damage. Whenever you cut into the material (or when you use clamps to hold your stock<sup id="fnref:bluetape" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bluetape" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>) you need to have enough space for your machine and the rest of the bit. The machine itself mostly becomes a problem for deep pockets, but those small diameter end mills often still have a larger shaft. So, even if you observe the cutting length, you cannot cut at the side of a straight wall if you would run the shaft of your bit into it.</p>

<p>That should be enough of an overview. I am mostly writing down what I learned from others (mostly Youtube) over a few months, so I would recommend that, too, if you want to go deeper.</p>

<p>Now, finally, here is the list of bits I used in this project and the short name I use for them henceforth<sup id="fnref:henceforth" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:henceforth" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that I only got my first CNC router a few months ago, so these are mostly the first bits I ever used. I have no comparison to tell if they are good or bad, so take this as pure documentation and not as an endorsement.</p>

<h2 id="the-outside-of-the-bottom-shell-a">The outside of the bottom shell (A)</h2>

<p>Ok, it’s time to get serious. In the following I will go through all the toolpaths one by one and try to remember details that you should know about. For each one I will mention the bit I used, how long it took and the name of the gcode file I used (if available). As mentioned above it is unlikely that you can use the gcode file directly, but you should be able to view it in order to understand what the toolpath does.</p>

<p>The first step is to create the outside of the bottom half of the shell. For this you need a piece of wood with at least 160mm by 99.6mm and it should have a thickness of at least 23mm. Having a few more millimeters is highly recommended to allow for a few surfacing steps without becoming too thin.</p>

<p>And surfacing is exactly what we start with. The current surface will be the one visible on the back of the Game Boy shell. So, it should look nice and needs to be surfaced down to a clean even plane. Keep in mind that the remaining thickness needs to be at least 23mm even after possibly surfacing the other side too. The exact thickness does not matter yet, so just aim for a nice finish on this side.</p>

<p>This is my method of aligning the workpiece after flipping it. I drill small holes through to the backside that I can use to align it after turning it around. If you have a better way of doing this like a flip jig, a tool to measure distances along all three axes or even an additional axis, you can skip this toolpath.</p>

<p>I labeled this as a single path, but please notice that I have split it into two gcode files. The reason is that the working distance of my smallest bit is too short to go all the way through 23mm without hitting the wood with its wider 3mm shaft. So, there is a first step of drilling space for that shaft before creating the smaller and more precise holes on the backside.</p>

<p>If you use my solution, take note that zero is set to the corner of the Game Boy, so the hole in that corner will be drilled 5mm along negative x and y. So, when picking the start point to fit the 160mm by 99.6mm of the reference frame, keep in mind to offset zero by 5mm in both directions. This will be the zero for all subsequent steps, too.</p>

<p>Oh, and obviously, this step will drill through the entire workpiece and into your spoilboard.</p>

<p>Next I do a profile cut that does not go all the way through. It will eventually meet with a profile cut from the other side (if aligned properly). At this point it also gives room for a few upcoming toolpaths that enter and leave the outer rim of the Game Boy shell.</p>

<p>The curved sides on the back are created with a ballnose bit.

<p>This step carves the pockets for the cartridge slot and the battery compartment. Note, that it removes more material in the battery compartment than on the actual original Game Boy shell to make space for the upcoming toolpath using a 1.5mm downcut bit. My 1.5mm bit only has about 8mm of clearance before sloping into a 3mm shaft, so in order to create the finer details inside the battery compartment some room needs to be made. If you have a bit without such a limitation, you might want to optimize this towards the original.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, this adds some details in the battery compartment. Important ones: These are the slits that will hold the battery contacts. My design is made for some after market contacts (see assembly section), but it has too much room and I needed to put something behind the contacts to hold them in place. If you know the exact contacts you want to use, this is something that could be optimized.</p>

<p>Oh, and this path also creates the decorative lines on the back of the Game Boy.</p>

<p>The last step on this side drills some holes for the screws. These are not the holes the screws tap into, but the holes that the screws go through first. I have not tested the diameter much because I ended up gluing the shell, but they seemed ok.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-inside-of-the-bottom-shell-b">The inside of the bottom shell (B)</h2>

<p>Now it is time to flip the workpiece to do the inside of the bottom half. To do so, align it with your favorite method.</p>

<p>If you use my reference drills, align your workpiece such that you can jog 160mm along x and 99.6mm along y and always end up on one of the small 1mm holes as precisely as possible. Remember that you cannot fix the rotation of your workpiece if you use the tape and glue method (like I do), in which case I would recommend using a carpenter’s square to get the orientation right while gluing it and then use the holes to verify and to set zero.</p>

<p>Speaking of zero on my reference frame: Remember that the hole is at -5mm and -5mm, so align your bit above the correct hole and then move it by 5mm along x and y <strong>before</strong> setting zero. Keep that zero for the rest of the steps for the bottom half.</p>

<p>Once again, it is time for surfacing. However, this time you are aiming for a final thickness of exactly 23mm. Of course, if you need to remove a lot of material, you can use a different method first, but at the end of this step you should have a perfectly flat workpiece with a thickness of 23mm. I designed the two sides to allow for a little uncertainty here, but I would say that you should hit 23mm to within about half a millimeter.</p>

<p>This is the big workhorse step for this side. This removes most material to make room for the PCBs and it creates most of the relevant geometry inside. However, my gcode had a few problems here that you might want to improve on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I manually created layers for the pocketing that are far from optimal. By now I know better methods to do this, but at that time this was the best I could do in Blender CAM. The current toolpaths are inefficient and imprecise in a few places. You might want to recreate them with your preferred software (and especially if you have a beefier machine that can handle deeper cuts).</li>
  <li>A big mistake here is that one or two of the lower toolpaths accidentally cut away the lip and part of the rim of the shell near the power switch as well as the screw post near that switch. I compensated for that with a larger lip on the top half of the shell, but that is far from perfect. The reason for this error seems to be a boolean operator that did not work properly and failed to subtract that part of the rim from the pocketing area. Whatever the reason, you should carefully look at what would happen to the rim at the top of your Game Boy.</li>
  <li>Some parts were a bit imprecise. The screw posts for the metal shield of the Game Boy come to mind or the lower end of the link cable cutout. If you want to be precise, check out my photos and adjust things that are not perfect.</li>
</ul>

<p>First of all note that as far as I remember, the only reason for using an upcut bit here is that my 1.5mm upcut is a few millimeters longer than my 1.5mm downcut. If this is not a limitation for your tool, you should be fine with a downcut end mill, too, except maybe for some drilling for the screws.</p>

<p>This step adds some details to the power switch part, the battery contact cutouts for the main PCB and some small details like a little cutaway behind one of the screw posts to make space for the speaker cable. It also drills holes for the screws to tap in. In my experience the 1.5mm holes do not hold the thin original screws reliably. On the top half I will later drill 1mm holes, which unfortunately tended to break if a screw is tapped into a pole. So, some experimentation with alternative screws and drilling diameters might be in order here, especially if you plan to use a different kind of wood.</p>

<p>Now it is time for the iconic front of the Game Boy. Please read steps C02 to C03 carefully and think about them. These are the common sign-maker’s method of doing a V-carve, painting everything and then cutting away the excessive paint. I have little experience here and this is the part of my wooden Game Boy that I am absolutely not happy with. My method (or choice of paint or choice of tools or whatever) lead to quite some smearing of the paint and letters that look soft and unfocused.</p>

<figcaption>The white paint looks soft and some circular smearing from the surfacing bit is visible.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If making the entire wooden Game Boy was less time intensive, I would probably have another try with white epoxy instead of paint. I also notice that many hobby CNCists<sup id="fnref:aword" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aword" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> use a belt or disc sander for this instead of a surfacing bit, so maybe that’s part of the problem. If you recognize why this did not work out so nicely in my case, please let me know. Anyhow, below is what I did to get the Nintendo logo and labels onto my Game Boy and you might want to think about a different method.</p>

<p>You will also notice that I did not list a surfacing step. That’s because my method involves V-carving below zero and a later surfacing step anyway. Depending on what you want to do, you might want to surface first.</p>

<p>But there is one <strong>important difference</strong>: If you use my method of painting you will have to remove the workpiece, paint it, replace it and realign it on the same side. That might not work with a flip jig if it cannot be fixed to your machine’s bed.</p>

<p>Now, this engraves the Nintendo logo and button labels with a V-shaped bit. I actually ran that toolpath twice: Once starting from the surface (resulting in perfect letters at the surface) and then again starting 2mm below the surface. This is because I will later remove 2mm to return to the perfect letters and remove excessive paint. I did this in two steps because I was not sure if plunging a total of 4mm directly would be too much (now I think it wouldn’t). Also, 2mm might be a bit much, but I had made the observation in earlier tests that white paint enters the wood grain even with a clear coat primer, so I wanted to be safe.</p>

<p>A step that is not a toolpath. Paint your workpiece such that the logo and labels are properly colored. I used spray paint for this and first applied several layers of clear coat as a primer. After it had dried completely, I added several layers of white spray paint. The point of the primer is mostly to prevent white paint from entering the wood grain and showing up several millimeters deeper where it should not be visible. Make sure to seal up every part that could get sprayed with white paint - not only the actual letters.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on improving this method are welcome.</p>

<p>And of course, I had to remove my workpiece for this step. If you apply paint with a brush, you might be able to do this in place.</p>

<p>Here I now removed the 2mm that I dove too deep during V-engraving. This removes all the paint outside the carved area, theoretically leaving me with perfect and precise letters. However, as mentioned above I am not entirely happy with the result and you might want to consider alternative methods.</p>

<p>Next I did a profile cut and again not all the way through. This gives some room for some of the upcoming toolpaths at the edge. Also note that I will chamfer the outline of the Game Boy front, so there is no need for a downcut bit here.</p>

<p>The pocketing of the buttons, the actual screen and the speaker grill is done with a finer bit. In some cases because of thin lines and in some cases to achieve sharper corners. In some cases because it seemed like the buttons should be part of this package.</p>

<p>Finally, my favorite step of most CNC projects. Chamfering. So satisfying.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a mistake in my toolpath. While just following the outline works perfectly for most parts of the Game Boy front, I underestimated the effect of the slope at the speaker corner. A 45° chamfer towards this slight incline resulted in a bit of overhand and a slightly weird look. I sanded<sup id="fnref:hate:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hate" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> most of the problem away, but you might want to consider skipping chamfering in this corner.</p>

<p>The last step on the outside of the top half just adds the decorative fine lines to the front. This is quick and easy, but note that the only reason for using an upcut bit here is that I simply don’t own a 1mm downcut bit.</p>

<p>If you use wood from the same board as the bottom half of the shell, you probably have to remove a lot of material here. You are aiming for a final thickness of 14.5mm. And this one needs to be very precise. On the bottom half a too thick shell might make it harder to get the battery contacts through to the battery compartment, but on the top half this impacts the top position of your buttons, how deep the screen is below the window and whether your speaker grill goes through (spoiler: mine didn’t).</p>

<p>This is the massive pocketing job for the inside, covering most parts. Note that I took some liberty in optimizing the shape for a subtractive process. The original injection mold shape obviously tried to save material while we would like to save on carving away material. So in many parts I left a lot of wood in there, where the original Game Boy just has pockets of air. This should also make it more rigid.</p>

<p>Adding details that could not be done with a 3mm bit in the previous step. Most notably some details around the buttons and the inside part of the speaker grill. Like on the original, the speaker grill is designed such that the lines on the outside just touch the ones on the inside to create openings. Unfortunately, this just did not work out on my build, but the sound can still be heard very well, so I am not attempting to tinker with it. However, you might want to keep an eye on the problem and maybe move paths closer together.</p>

<p>Super short, super simple. The cutout for the headphone jack. I only used a ballnose because this is curved. If you want to save time, you could probably have just done it with a flat end mill in one of the previous steps.</p>

<p>This drills 1mm holes into the poles for the screws to tap in. As mentioned in step B03, the 1mm holes also did not work perfectly. In my opinion they are better than the 1.5mm holes I used on the bottom half, but the longer poles near the display were split by the screws in this case. If you come up with a better solution, I would like to know.</p>

<h2 id="battery-cover-e">Battery cover (E)</h2>

<p>Wait, we are not done yet. You still need a battery cover. However, since I did not see how the latch of the original Game Boy could be created with a CNC and survive more than one battery changes, I made a very simple design that uses magnets to hold the cover in place.</p>

<p>So, this is a rather quick process and you only need a piece of wood with an even thickness of about 4mm to 5mm.

<p>This step cuts references for flipping and adds the decorative lines on the outside of the battery cover. That’s it. Nothing more to see here and it is time to flip the wood piece to the other side.</p>

<p>This of course could have been one gcode file, but I couldn’t be bothered for this little part at the end of all the work. In this step you will flatten the cover to the desired thickness while leaving a lip that prevents it from sliding out. Here you also create the pockets for the magnets and do the profile cut, which will go below your workpiece into your spoil board.</p>

<h2 id="assembly">Assembly</h2>

<p>That’s it, the hard part is done. You should sand<sup id="fnref:hate:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hate" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> any problematic or rough parts and apply wood finish. I use <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08TWRJST5?psc=1&amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&amp;_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=oughtabe-21&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;linkId=056f51304a598794d03e7c3cad6423f2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=6742" target="_blank">boiled Linseed oil</a>, but there are many options<sup id="fnref:linseed" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:linseed" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> out there and many people with more experience in selecting them.</p>

<p>After that, you should be able to simply disassemble a Game Boy and replace its shell with your new wooden one.</p>

<p>I actually only used the original mainboard of a broken Game Boy from ebay and aftermarket parts for everything else, so let me show you a few details.</p>

<figcaption>The original metal shield between cartridge slot and mainboard can simply be screwed into the wooden shell with the original screws.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First of all, the metal shield between mainboard and cartridge slot can simply be screwed into the wooden shell with the original screws (ok, those are also original parts). You just might need to file away some edges to fit the bent parts around the screw posts.</p>

<figure>

<p>The same is true for the PCB and the attached boards. However, here I already had some problems of screws not holding well in the 1.5mm drills I did on the bottom half. The 1mm drills on the top half worked better, but posts tended to break there, so be careful here.</p>

<p>In the battery compartment you just have to insert the additional contacts. The outer contacts are already there from the PCB. Note, that in contrast to the photo above I had to put a thin piece of cardboard behind the contacts to press them against the batteries.</p>

<figcaption>The aftermarket plastic buttons fit perfectly.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The white aftermarket plastic buttons fit perfectly, but there are some tricky aspects to the silicone pads between the buttons and the PCB. First of all, there are very thin poles that help aligning the silicone pads. They do not have to hold against any force, but still you should be careful to not break them as they really help putting everything together. Second, the silicone pad of the A and B button has a somewhat complex line around the buttons that looks roughly like a figure eight with an additional outline. I did not reproduce the slit for the additional outline, which prevents it from being flush on the wood by default. You either have to add a carving for the outline or cut the outline from the silicone pad like I did with my aftermarket pads.</p>

<figcaption>Left: Placing the IPS mod display with buttons and silicone pads already in place. Right: The display PCB of the IPS mod screwed into the top half of the shell.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the display I decided against using an original screen<sup id="fnref:screen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:screen" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> and picked up a modern <a href="https://retrohahn.com/collections/display/products/gameboy-classic-q5-osd" target="_blank">IPS mod kit</a> instead. Note, that I made a few simplifications and optimizations to my design to fit this display. In particular, the contrast wheel has an additional lip on the original Game Boy and there are additional posts at the top of the display which I did not model. I think that an original display also fits, but you might look into this if you want to use a different screen.</p>

<p>I did not find a good way to add a small pole right next to the large pole in the bottom left corner of the display (viewed from the inside). Unfortunately, the plastic holder for the display that comes with the kit uses this pole as one of four poles that hold it in place. However, it still seems to be very stable when using only three of those poles. The PCB of the kit can simply be screwed into the shell with original screws and holds very well with the 1mm holes I drilled here. Only problem is that the poles below the display split in the process. So,… well… I am not sure what to make of this. The PCB is held very securely, but I am not sure if I will eventually find cracks in the case from the other screws over time.</p>

<figcaption>Left: Both halves have to be connected with a ribbon cable. Right: Finally the glass cover from the IPS mod screen finishes the build.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, all you need to do is to connect the two halves and glue the display cover into the screen bezel. There is just one major catch: For me the two halves were too tight and the screws could not properly hold them together. I am not sure if filing and sanding some parts for a better fit will help and if tapping the original screws into 1mm drill holes instead of the 1.5mm ones I have in the bottom half might be enough, but I only found a somewhat nasty solution: Gluing the case with wood glue.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>Unfortunately, I had to glue both halves together, resulting in a slight gap and some glue residue.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While I still love the resulting Game Boy and while it feels very solid and reliable, it bugs me a little to have a slight gap on one side and a bit of glue residue. If I ever want to reach the parts inside, I probably have to crack the case open, but at least no original parts had to be glued and could simply be replaced in the original Game Boy. Still, it would be nicer if I could just open the shell in case I ever need to do maintenance inside.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>When I started this project, I somewhat underestimated the amount of effort and time that had to go into it. But I also totally underestimated how stunning the result would be. At the moment it just sits on a sideboard in my office and I have to grin and pick it up each time I walk by it.</p>

<figcaption>I totally love how precisely some of the iconic designs of the original Game Boy could be reproduced.</figcaption>

<p>Initially, I planned to also machine the buttons out of a brighter type of wood. However, I did not find a good way to create a transparent display cover with matching wood applications and eventually settled for white aftermarket buttons and a matching display cover. Now that I see the result, I think that this was a good decision as it helps to define the shape and look.</p>

<figcaption>Even though the speaker grill did not go through in my build, the precision of those lines as well as the headphone jack cutout, totally blew me away. Too bad that the white painted labels did not turn out so well.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also, the Game Boy plays quite well. If I am looking for any playability problem, maybe the buttons trigger a little bit below their tactile response point and I am not entirely certain if this is to be expected. But this Game Boy will not be my daily gaming platform anyways. This is meant to be presented somewhere. At the moment I am thinking of making an acrylic stand for it and use my <a href="https://there.oughta.be/a/wifi-game-boy-cartridge">WiFi cartridge</a> to use it as a status display in a prominent location.</p>

<figcaption>The Game Boy plays well, but I still think it is meant to be a showpiece and not a travel companion.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Oh, and if you have been wondering about the wooden Pokemon cartridges: Those are based on the <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy-cartridge" target="_blank">cartridge I published earlier</a> with several improvements to the toolpaths (man, I learned so much from the Game Boy project) and the Pokemon logo added. These versions are also in the <a href="https://github.com/Staacks/wooden-game-boy" target="_blank">GitHub repository for the wooden Game Boy</a>, but I did not add more documentation for it. If you got to this point, I am sure you can figure it out… :)</p>

<h3>from the <i>QWACs-in-the-web</i> dept</h3>

<p>The EU is currently updating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIDAS">eIDAS</a> (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services), an EU regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the European Single Market. That’s clearly a crucial piece of legislation in the digital age, and updating it is sensible given the fast pace of development in the sector. But it seems that something bad has happened in the process. Back in March 2022, a group of experts sent an <a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2022/03/02/eidas_cybersecurity_community_open_letter_1_1.pdf">open letter to MEPs</a> [pdf] with the dramatic title “Global website security ecosystem at risk from EU Digital Identity framework’s new website authentication provisions”. It warned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Digital Identity framework includes provisions that are intended to increase the take-up of <strong>Qualified Website Authentication Certificates</strong> (QWACs), a specific EU form of website certificate that was created in the 2014 eIDAS regulation but which – owing to flaws with its technical implementation model – has not gained popularity in the web ecosystem. The Digital Identity framework mandates browsers accept QWACs issued by Trust Service Providers, <strong>regardless of the security characteristics of the certificates or the policies that govern their</strong> <strong>issuance</strong>. This legislative approach introduces significant weaknesses into the global multi-stakeholder ecosystem for securing web browsing, and will significantly increase the cybersecurity risks for users of the web.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The near-final text for eIDAS 2.0 has now been agreed by the EU’s negotiators, and it seems that it is even worse than the earlier draft. A new site from Mozilla called “<a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/">Last Chance to fix eIDAS</a>” explains how new legislative articles will require all Web browsers in Europe to trust the the certificate authorities and cryptographic keys selected by the government of EU Member States. Mozilla explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These changes radically expand the capability of EU governments to surveil their citizens by ensuring cryptographic keys under government control can be used to intercept encrypted web traffic across the EU. Any EU member state has the ability to designate cryptographic keys for distribution in web browsers and browsers are forbidden from revoking trust in these keys without government permission.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This enables the government of any EU member state to issue website certificates for interception and surveillance which can be used against every EU citizen, even those not resident in or connected to the issuing member state. There is no independent check or balance on the decisions made by member states with respect to the keys they authorize and the use they put them to. This is particularly troubling given that adherence to the rule of law has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/agenda/briefing/2022-05-02/6/rule-of-law-in-hungary-and-poland-plenary-debate-and-resolution">not been uniform</a> across all member states, with documented instances of <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230524IPR91910/hungary-meps-denounce-deliberate-and-systematic-efforts-to-undermine-eu-values">coercion by secret police</a> for political purposes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, browser producers will be forbidden from carrying out routine and necessary checks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The text goes on to ban browsers from applying security checks to these EU keys and certificates except those pre-approved by the EU’s IT standards body – ETSI. This rigid structure would be problematic with any entity, but government-controlled standard bodies are especially susceptible to <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/nsas-subversion-nists-algorithm">misaligned incentives</a> in cryptography. ETSI in particular has both a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/02/ets-isnt-tls-and-you-shouldnt-use-it">concerning</a> <a href="https://news.rub.de/english/press-releases/2021-06-16-it-security-backdoor-mobile-phone-encryption-90s-still-exists">track</a> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3n3j/backdoor-in-police-radios-tetra-burst">record</a> of producing compromised cryptographic standards and a <a href="https://www.etsi.org/committee/li">working group</a> dedicated entirely to developing interception technology.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/european-signature-dialog/">European Signature Dialog</a>, which aims “to connect major European Trust Service Providers to share best practices, develop a common industry viewpoint on regulatory issues and empower European solutions for guaranteed data-security,” disagrees with Mozilla’s analysis. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/european-signature-dialog_mozilla-campaign-pushes-serious-misinformation-activity-6978078620279824384-ByAc/">a post on LinkedIn</a> it writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Mozilla has recently launched a campaign that pushes serious misinformation about the current eIDAS legislation in order to block changes to Article 45 covering the EU’s Qualified Web Authentication Certificates (“QWACs”).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <a href="https://www.european-signature-dialog.eu/ESD_answer_to_Mozilla_misinformation_campaign.pdf">document</a> [pdf] from European Signature Dialog offers what it claims are refutations of Mozilla’s analysis. I will leave it to technical experts to decide who is right on the detailed points it discusses – for those interested in understanding the underlying technology, there’s an <a href="https://educatedguesswork.org/posts/eidas-article45/">excellent introduction to eIDAS and QWACs</a> from Eric Rescorla on the Educated Guesswork blog. But there’s a less technical issue too. Mozilla writes that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>forcing browsers to automatically trust government-backed certificate authorities is a key tactic used by authoritarian regimes, and these actors would be emboldened by the legitimising effect of the EU’s actions. In short, if this law were copied by another state, it could lead to serious threats to cybersecurity and fundamental rights.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which European Signature Dialog responds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The European Union is not controlling the “roots” used by the issuers of QWACs, and so the EU can’t use the certificates to “spy” on EU citizens. Mozilla should be ashamed of itself for suggesting this.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While it may be true that the European Union itself is not controlling the roots, what Mozilla says is that the <strong>individual </strong><strong>governments of EU Member States</strong> will indeed be able to do precisely that, which means their intelligence services, for example, will be able to carry out <a href="https://last-chance-for-eidas.org/art45interception.html">surveillance of encrypted Web traffic</a>.</p>
<p>European Signature Dialog concludes its reply to Mozilla’s analysis by asking “Why is Mozilla spreading this misinformation”, and answering its own question with: “Mozilla is generally perceived as a Google satellite, paving the way for Google to push through its own commercial interests”. Attacking the motives of Mozilla in this way, suggesting that it is just some “satellite” of Google, suggests a lack of confidence in the other arguments the European Signature Dialog has offered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the insinuation that this is just an attempt by Google to head off some pesky EU legislation is undercut by the fact that separately from Mozilla, 335 scientists and researchers from 32 countries and various NGOs have signed a <a href="https://nce.mpi-sp.org/index.php/s/cG88cptFdaDNyRr">joint statement criticizing the proposed eIDAS reform</a>. If the latest text is adopted, they warn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>the government-controlled authority would then be able to intercept the web traffic of not only their own citizens, but all EU citizens, including banking information, legally privileged information, medical records and family photos. This would be true even when visiting non-EU websites, as such an authority could issue certificates for any website that all browsers would have to accept. Additionally, although much of eIDAS2.0 regulation carefully gives citizens the capability to opt out from usage of new services and functionality, this is not the case for Article 45. Every citizen would have to trust those certificates, and thus every citizen would see their online safety threatened.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It concludes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This regulation does not eliminate any existing risk. Instead, by undermining the existing secure web authentication processes, introduces new risks with no gain by European citizens, businesses, and institutions. Moreover, if this regulation becomes a reality, it is only to be expected that other countries will put pressure on browsers to obtain similar privileges as EU Member States — as <a href="https://censoredplanet.org/kazakhstan">some have unsuccessfully attempted in the past</a> — globally endangering web security.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Confirming the bad faith of the EU negotiators, these new and dangerous elements of eIDAS were added in closed-door meetings without any public consultation of experts. It’s a blatant power-grab by the EU, already attempting to circumvent encryption elsewhere with its <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/26/eu-pitched-client-side-scanning-by-targeting-certain-eu-residents-with-misleading-ads/">Chat Control</a> proposals. It must be stopped before it undermines core elements of the Internet’s security infrastructure not just in the EU, but globally too as result of its knock-on effects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
		<h2>Harvard study, almost 80 years old, has proved that embracing community helps us live longer, and be happier</h2>	</p><div>

				<p><em>Second in an occasional <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/topic/aging/">series</a> on how Harvard researchers are tackling the problematic issues of aging.</em></p>
<p><span>W</span>hen scientists began tracking the health of 268 Harvard sophomores in 1938 during the Great Depression, they hoped the longitudinal study would reveal clues to leading healthy and happy lives.</p>
<p>They got more than they wanted.</p>
<p>After following the surviving Crimson men for nearly 80 years as part of the <a href="http://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/">Harvard Study of Adult Development</a>, one of the world’s longest studies of adult life, researchers have collected a cornucopia of data on their physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Of the original Harvard cohort recruited as part of the Grant Study, only 19 are still alive, all in their mid-90s. Among the original recruits were eventual President John F. Kennedy and longtime Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee. (Women weren’t in the original study because the College was still all male.)</p>
<p>In addition, scientists eventually expanded their research to include the men’s offspring, who now number 1,300 and are in their 50s and 60s, to find out how early-life experiences affect health and aging over time. Some participants went on to become successful businessmen, doctors, lawyers, and others ended up as schizophrenics or alcoholics, but not on inevitable tracks.</p>
<p>During the intervening decades, the control groups have expanded. In the 1970s, 456 Boston inner-city residents were enlisted as part of the Glueck Study, and 40 of them are still alive. More than a decade ago, researchers began including wives in the Grant and Glueck studies.</p>
<p>Over the years, researchers have studied the participants’ health trajectories and their broader lives, including their triumphs and failures in careers and marriage, and the finding have produced startling lessons, and not only for the researchers.</p>
<p>“The surprising finding is that our relationships and how happy we are in our relationships has a powerful influence on our health,” said <a href="http://robertwaldinger.com/">Robert Waldinger</a>, director of the study, a psychiatrist at <a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> and a professor of psychiatry at <a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard Medical School</a>. “Taking care of your body is important, but tending to your relationships is a form of self-care too. That, I think, is the revelation.”</p>

<p>Close relationships, more than money or fame, are what keep people happy throughout their lives, the study revealed. Those ties protect people from life’s discontents, help to delay mental and physical decline, and are better predictors of long and happy lives than social class, IQ, or even genes. That finding proved true across the board among both the Harvard men and the inner-city participants.</p>
<p>The long-term research has received funding from private foundations, but has been financed largely by grants from the National Institutes of Health, first through the National Institute of Mental Health, and more recently through the National Institute on Aging.</p>

<p>Researchers who have pored through data, including vast medical records and hundreds of in-person interviews and questionnaires, found a strong correlation between men’s flourishing lives and their relationships with family, friends, and community. Several studies found that people’s level of satisfaction with their relationships at age 50 was a better predictor of physical health than their cholesterol levels were.</p>
<p>“When we gathered together everything we knew about them about at age 50, it wasn’t their middle-age cholesterol levels that predicted how they were going to grow old,” said Waldinger in a popular <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness">TED Talk</a>. “It was how satisfied they were in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80.”</p>

<p>He recorded his TED talk, titled “What Makes a Good Life? Lessons from the Longest Study on Happiness,” in 2015, and it has been viewed 13,000,000 times.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that marital satisfaction has a protective effect on people’s mental health. Part of a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2896234/">study</a> found that people who had happy marriages in their 80s reported that their moods didn’t suffer even on the days when they had more physical pain. Those who had unhappy marriages felt both more emotional and physical pain.</p>
<p>Those who kept warm relationships got to live longer and happier, said Waldinger, and the loners often died earlier. “Loneliness kills,” he said. “It’s as powerful as smoking or alcoholism.”</p>
<p>According to the study, those who lived longer and enjoyed sound health avoided smoking and alcohol in excess. Researchers also found that those with strong social support experienced less mental deterioration as they aged.</p>
<p>In part of a recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4579537/">study</a>, researchers found that women who felt securely attached to their partners were less depressed and more happy in their relationships two-and-a-half years later, and also had better memory functions than those with frequent marital conflicts.</p>


<p>“Good relationships don’t just protect our bodies; they protect our brains,” said Waldinger in his TED talk. “And those good relationships, they don’t have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn’t take a toll on their memories.”</p>
<p>Since aging starts at birth, people should start taking care of themselves at every stage of life, the researchers say.</p>
<p>“Aging is a continuous process,” Waldinger said. “You can see how people can start to differ in their health trajectory in their 30s, so that by taking good care of yourself early in life you can set yourself on a better course for aging. The best advice I can give is ‘Take care of your body as though you were going to need it for 100 years,’ because you might.”</p>
<p>The study, like its remaining original subjects, has had a long life, spanning four directors, whose tenures reflected their medical interests and views of the time.</p>
<p>Under the first director, Clark Heath, who stayed from 1938 until 1954, the study mirrored the era’s dominant view of genetics and biological determinism. Early researchers believed that physical constitution, intellectual ability, and personality traits determined adult development. They made detailed anthropometric measurements of skulls, brow bridges, and moles, wrote in-depth notes on the functioning of major organs, examined brain activity through electroencephalograms, and even analyzed the men’s handwriting.</p>
<p>Now, researchers draw men’s blood for DNA testing and put them into MRI scanners to examine organs and tissues in their bodies, procedures that would have sounded like science fiction back in 1938. In that sense, the study itself represents a history of the changes that life brings.</p>
<p>Psychiatrist George Vaillant, who joined the team as a researcher in 1966, led the study from 1972 until 2004. Trained as a psychoanalyst, Vaillant emphasized the role of relationships, and came to recognize the crucial role they played in people living long and pleasant lives.</p>


<p>In a book called “Aging Well,” Vaillant wrote that six factors predicted healthy aging for the Harvard men: physical activity, absence of alcohol abuse and smoking, having mature mechanisms to cope with life’s ups and downs, and enjoying both a healthy weight and a stable marriage. For the inner-city men, education was an additional factor. “The more education the inner city men obtained,” wrote Vaillant, “the more likely they were to stop smoking, eat sensibly, and use alcohol in moderation.”</p>
<p>Vaillant’s research highlighted the role of these protective factors in healthy aging. The more factors the subjects had in place, the better the odds they had for longer, happier lives.</p>
<p>“When the study began, nobody cared about empathy or attachment,” said Vaillant. “But the key to healthy aging is relationships, relationships, relationships.”</p>
<p>The study showed that the role of genetics and long-lived ancestors proved less important to longevity than the level of satisfaction with relationships in midlife, now recognized as a good predictor of healthy aging. The research also debunked the idea that people’s personalities “set like plaster” by age 30 and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>“Those who were clearly train wrecks when they were in their 20s or 25s turned out to be wonderful octogenarians,” he said. “On the other hand, alcoholism and major depression could take people who started life as stars and leave them at the end of their lives as train wrecks.”</p>

<p>The study’s fourth director, Waldinger has expanded research to the wives and children of the original men. That is the second-generation study, and Waldinger hopes to expand it into the third and fourth generations. “It will probably never be replicated,” he said of the lengthy research, adding that there is yet more to learn.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to see how people manage stress, whether their bodies are in a sort of chronic ‘fight or flight’ mode,” Waldinger said. “We want to find out how it is that a difficult childhood reaches across decades to break down the body in middle age and later.”</p>
<p>Lara Tang ’18, a human and evolutionary biology concentrator who recently joined the team as a research assistant, relishes the opportunity to help find some of those answers. She joined the effort after coming across Waldinger’s TED talk in one of her classes.</p>
<p>“That motivated me to do more research on adult development,” said Tang. “I want to see how childhood experiences affect developments of physical health, mental health, and happiness later in life.”</p>
<p>Asked what lessons he has learned from the study, Waldinger, who is a Zen priest, said he practices meditation daily and invests time and energy in his relationships, more than before.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to get isolated, to get caught up in work and not remembering, ‘Oh, I haven’t seen these friends in a long time,’ ” Waldinger said. “So I try to pay more attention to my relationships than I used to.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-dtm-region="articulo_cuerpo"><p>The therapeutic revolution that has been established in the fight against cancer is delivering victories that were unthinkable until recently. Dr. Miguel Ángel Perales, <a href="https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/miguel-angel-perales" target="_blank">head of the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Service</a> at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, is, as is often the case with oncologists, conservative in his expectations and does not like to use the word “cure” lightly. But, in his case, everyday life invites optimism. “The difference between what I do and what other colleagues in oncology do with solid tumors is that I give treatments that can cure patients,” he states confidently. He is referring to <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-02-19/car-t-cancer-treatments-from-science-fiction-to-saving-lives.html">CAR-T treatments</a>, a cellular therapy that has shaken up the traditional approach to hematologic cancer. This technique, which is already used to treat various leukemias and lymphomas, consists of extracting T lymphocytes from the patient — a type of immune cell that is responsible for the body’s defense — modifying them in the laboratory with genetic engineering and returning them to the patient so that they can better fight the tumor. “In lymphoma [treated] with CAR-T, the cure rate is 45%,” the doctor says. Before the CAR-T, the percentage of people cured was half that.</p><p>Perales has ended up in Barcelona in the middle of a European tour full of professional and personal commitments, from his daughter’s birthday in Paris to a conference at a hematology congress in Romania. The doctor, whose father is Spanish and mother is English, has been in the United States for 25 years, seeing patients and researching the ins and outs of cancer. The leap that has been made in this time is gigantic, admits this scientist, an expert in cell therapy: “What we are doing with CAR-T therapy, day by day in the clinic, may seem like science fiction. When I explain to the patient that we are going to collect their cells, we are going to put a vector inside and, suddenly, all those cells are going to attack the cancer, it is something that seems like science fiction,” he says.</p><p><b>Question.</b> What has <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2022-09-17/one-girls-genetic-mutation-sheds-light-on-the-causes-of-lupus.html">CAR-T therapy</a> meant in the treatment of hematological cancer?</p><p><b>Answer. </b>There has been a total change in how we treat it. We have patients who are alive today because of this. I have been doing allogeneic [stem cell] transplants, which use cells from a donor, for more than 20 years, and autologous transplants, with cells from the patients themselves. With allogeneic treatment we have been able to cure patients, but in those where the autologous transplant was made, the options are very bad in, say, lymphoma. CAR-T treatment was first approved in these patients after relapse, and now we have long-term results in that the patients are still alive more than five years later. What has changed since 2017 (when CAR-T was first approved) is that we have now done a second-line trial: these are patients who relapse early (within the first year) or who do not even respond to the first line of treatment. In this group, we know that the typical results with chemotherapy or even with autologous transplant are very bad, and the trial we did was a comparison between taking the patient directly to CAR-T or doing the classic chemo treatment followed by autologous transplant. And what we saw is that CAR-T works better, it is more effective, fewer patients are going to relapse and there are more patients alive than with the traditional treatment.</p><p><b>Q. </b>CAR-T began with patients whose prognoses were hopeless, with no therapeutic alternative, and now you say that the treatment is given in earlier stages. What is your hypothesis? Surely, the sooner it is administered, the better the results will be, or is it too aggressive to use early?</p><p><b>A. </b>In oncology there are two philosophies. Some say: “I’ll save the best treatment for later, in case the first one doesn’t work.” And my philosophy is the opposite: if we have something that works well, it is better to give it to the first line, because if not, it may not reach the patient in the second line or the third line. From an immunological point of view, the more treatment the patient receives, the worse the T cells that we are going to use to make the CAR-T will be. So the patient who receives the CAR-T first will have a healthier immune system than the one who receives it in the third, fourth, or fifth line.</p><p><b>Q.</b> Can CAR-Ts end up completely replacing traditional bone marrow transplantation?</p><p><b>A. </b>In my current practice, 80% or 90% of patients receive CAR-T to diffuse large cell lymphoma in the second line [before an eventual transplant]. And what we have seen in the United States is that the highest level of autologous transplantation was in 2015 and, since then, it has been decreasing. And it’s going to go down more and more because the CAR-T treatment is better. Occasionally there is a patient who relapses later and we give them a transplant, and if they relapse after the transplant, we give them a CAR-T afterward. But the majority of the patients that I am treating at my center are with CAR-T in the second line.</p><blockquote><p>“We have cancer patients who are alive today thanks to CAR-T therapy.”</p></blockquote><p><b>Q.</b> Is the aim for CAR-Ts to end up being the first-line treatment, even before chemotherapy?</p><p><b>A.</b> Before chemo, no. But I think what we are going to see is that, patients who have a very aggressive lymphoma, who we know in advance are going to do poorly with chemo, will start with a couple of cycles of chemo and then CAR-T will be given on the front line. But it must be shown that this is better than doing the usual thing.</p><p><b>Q.</b> CAR-Ts, in any case, are not free of side effects. What impact does this collateral damage have?</p><p><b>A. </b>We have learned a lot: when we started, eight of the first ten patients went to the ICU. But they were also patients who had been waiting several months to get CAR-T. They were very advanced patients, who had received several lines of treatment. Today, we have learned a lot about patient selection, we are treating them much earlier, and we handle complications better. There are two very specific complications that come from CAR-T, which are cytokine syndrome and neurotoxicity, which can appear between 24 and 48 hours. Now we treat them more aggressively and, in cases of neurotoxicity, almost all the patients recover completely. Mortality due to treatment after allogeneic transplant can be between 10% and 20%; in CAR-T, it is less than 1%. For me, the complications we have with CAR-T are something we can handle without a problem and the risk of losing a patient is very rare.</p><p><b>Q. </b>One of the limitations of CAR-T is <a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-10-25/andres-cervantes-oncologist-innovative-cancer-drugs-have-similar-costs-regardless-of-their-benefit.html" target="_blank">its price</a>: the therapies marketed by the pharmaceutical industry are around €300,000 ($316,273) per patient. Even the academic CAR-T developed by the Hospital Clínic, which is cheaper, is still expensive (about €90,000 or $94,882). What can be done about that?</p><p><b>A.</b> I have no answer for that. What I can say is that in the United States we analyzed whether it was cheaper to do CAR-T or autologous transplant and we showed that it was cheaper to do CAR-T. And the reason was because 55% of the patients who were in the control group ended up receiving CAR-T. Instead of receiving CAR-T immediately when they had a relapse, they went on to chemo and then, if chemo<i> </i>didn’t work, they went to CAR-T. If chemo did work, they went to transplant and if that didn’t work, they went to CAR-T. In other words, it is CAR-T now or CAR-T later. But the cost is much more because you have to pay for everything you put in beforehand. I can’t say how we are going to lower the price. The academic CAR-T is a very interesting model, which is unique in Spain. But in the United States it couldn’t be done.</p><figure><span><img alt="Miguel Ángel Perales in Barcelona." decoding="auto" height="259" srcset="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/jc5Cdz9r-yYHnwcjwHa0hUmWcFg=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/CAPE5YWV5NCPDITV5Y27ILZVYQ.jpg 414w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/REZXXhZcB7jIUkRKqTdE17rp44A=/828x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/CAPE5YWV5NCPDITV5Y27ILZVYQ.jpg 640w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/tIjpJLIM8xeKLPTaq1vUisvM9WQ=/980x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/CAPE5YWV5NCPDITV5Y27ILZVYQ.jpg 1000w,https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/6U2T3h50oaDoi98QGxlwVIPptk4=/1960x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/CAPE5YWV5NCPDITV5Y27ILZVYQ.jpg 1960w" width="414" loading="lazy" src="https://images.english.elpais.com/resizer/jc5Cdz9r-yYHnwcjwHa0hUmWcFg=/414x0/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/prisa/CAPE5YWV5NCPDITV5Y27ILZVYQ.jpg" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw"><svg viewBox="0 0 40 40"><use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"></use></svg></span><figcaption><span>Miguel Ángel Perales in Barcelona.</span><span>Gianluca Battista</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Q.</b> What is the industry’s responsibility with this type of drug? Because, in Spain there is the peculiarity that, to carry out these therapies, the patient’s own cells are used.</p><p><b>A.</b> It is a therapy that is difficult to produce. It is a [bespoke] treatment that is done for each patient, and you have to take into account all the expense of removing the cells, sending them, and producing them. There is much less margin than in some pills.</p><p><b>Q.</b> One of the proposals is payment by results, depending on the response of that drug.</p><p><b>A.</b> It is a very interesting idea. It is a model that has a lot of value and that could be done [in Spain]. In the United States, no. But from a health economics point of view, it is a very interesting model. What is done in the United States in acute lymphoblastic <a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2023-03-15/an-experimental-pill-achieves-complete-cancer-remission-in-18-people-with-aggressive-leukemia.html">leukemia</a> for children is that they only pay if they are in remission on day 28.</p><p><b>Q. </b>Despite being promising, the CAR-Ts are not infallible. Some patients relapse. Why does this happen?</p><p><b>A.</b> There are several reasons. The CAR-T will recognize CD19, which is on the surface of the cell and is present on all normal B cells, and your CD19 is the same as mine. In other words, if I make the vector (the biological part of the CAR-T), it works for both of us. Lymphoma cells will sometimes lose CD19, and if it no longer exists, the CAR-T is no longer useful, and some cells will relapse. Another reason may be that the T cells become immunologically tired and no longer function. Sometimes, the T cells become worn out, they stop working, or the lymphoma becomes invisible to the CAR-T.</p><blockquote><p>“I think that stem cell transplantation is going to disappear and we are going to have more specific cell therapies.”</p></blockquote><p><b>Q. </b>Will CAR-T also revolutionize solid tumors?</p><p><b>A.</b> We have seen promising results in some cases, such as mesothelioma, where work has also been done in combination with checkpoint inhibitors [a type of immunotherapy]. But in solid tumors, the biology is somewhat different. There are more variations in the tumors because they grow over a longer term. What is more, the tumor microenvironment is more difficult for the immune system because there is more suppression of immune cells. I think there will be something, but it will take time.</p><p><b>Q. </b>If we thought that CAR-Ts were science fiction 20 years ago, what other science fiction today can we see become reality in the future?</p><p><b>A.</b> Where we do not have CAR-T is in acute myeloid leukemia, which is a disease where, for the most part, we do allogeneic transplants. We need a CAR-T for that. Tests are being done, and I think that in five years we could have one. Little by little, I believe that allogeneic transplantation will disappear, and we will have more specific cell therapies, fewer complications, fewer side effects, and less risk of mortality due to the treatment. I think that in five or ten years we will have CAR-T for solid tumors. And the Covid vaccine platform is going to greatly change the options for cancer vaccines.</p><p><i>Sign up for our </i><a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en"><i>weekly newsletter</i></a><i> to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition</i></p></div></div>]]></description>

Easy to navigate, easy to use, hard to lose stuff (am I the only one who's constantly losing stuff in other task tracking systems?)<p>Not that I was ever successful in getting anyone other than programmers to use it, though. Which I guess is why they made it worse, to try to court the kind of people who <i>like</i> Jira and Asana and Azure Devops (what a terrible name) and all that junk.

          </p>
          <div>
            <p><span>A performance and resilience optimization to the authorization microservice contained a memory leak that was exposed under high traffic. This resulted in a number of pages returning 404’s that should not have. Testing the build in our canary ring did not expose the service to sufficient traffic to discover the leak, allowing it to graduate to production at 6:37 PM UTC.  The memory leak under high load caused pods to crash repeatedly starting at 6:42 PM UTC, failing authorization checks. These failures triggered alerts at 6:44 PM UTC. Rolling back the authorization service change was delayed as parts of the deployment infrastructure relied on the authorization service and required manual intervention to complete. Rollback completed at 7:08 PM UTC and all impacted GitHub features recovered after pods came back online.  We are evaluating changes to our rollout strategy to better detect this sooner and with less impact, changes to remove the dependency between authorization services and deployment rollback, and incident response improvements to reduce the overall time to recover.<p>This incident is unrelated to the Slack integration incident.  The combined status updates are a limitation of our status reporting tooling and we recognize the confusion this creates. Work to address this was already in progress and will be complete this month.</p></span>

in <a href="https://www.lua.org/" rel="nofollow">Lua</a></strong>. It packages the latest Lua interpreter with

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-why" dir="auto"><a href="#why">Why</a></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Lua is a small, embeddable language. It is easy to learn and reasonably fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The RP2040 is a small, powerful microcontroller with a nice set of
peripherals and an active developer community. Besides the official
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html#technical-specification" rel="nofollow">Pico</a>
and
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/raspberry-pi-pico.html#raspberry-pi-pico-w-and-pico-wh" rel="nofollow">Pico W</a>
boards from
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/" rel="nofollow">Raspberry Pi</a>, a variety of cheap modules in
various shapes and configurations are readily available for purchase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I had been wanting to play with Lua for a very long time, without having a
concrete use case for it. Similarly, I wanted to explore the RP2040 but didn't
have a concrete project for it. MicroLua served as an excuse to get started with
both.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-features" dir="auto"><a href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Pristine, unpatched Lua interpreter:</strong> MicroLua runs the latest,
unmodified Lua 5.4.x interpreter, imported as a git submodule. All
customization is done through <a href="https://github.com/MicroLua/MicroLua/blob/main/core/luaconf.in.h"><code>luaconf.h</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Per-core interpreter instances:</strong> MicroLua runs a separate Lua interpreter
in each core. They don't share state except through C libraries.</li>
<li><strong>Cooperative multithreading through Lua coroutines:</strong> MicroLua implements
cooperative threads as coroutines. This enables multitasking without the need
for locks. Blocking library calls (e.g. <code>pico.time.sleep_us()</code>) yield to
other threads.</li>
<li><strong>Thin bindings to C libraries:</strong> MicroLua exposes a growing subset of the
functionality provided by the Pico SDK. The bindings are designed with a
straightforward and consistent <a href="https://github.com/MicroLua/MicroLua/blob/main/docs/core.md#binding-conventions">mapping</a> to
their underlying C implementation.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive suite of unit tests:</strong> They not only test the binding layer,
but when possible also the underlying functionality of the Pico SDK.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-performance" dir="auto"><a href="#performance">Performance</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Performance is adequate for applications that don't require very low latency,
but it could be better. Event dispatch latency is currently in the hundreds of
microseconds, which is fairly slow. This is mainly due to a naive threading
implementation, and it can be improved.</p>
<p dir="auto">So it probably isn't realistic to try bit-banging high-speed serial protocols
or PWM in Lua, but that's what the PIO and PWM peripherals are for. Anything
that requires precise timings should probably be implemented in C. But Lua is
a great glue language for the non timing-critical logic, and very easy to
interface to C code.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-roadmap" dir="auto"><a href="#roadmap">Roadmap</a></h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Add more bindings for the Pico SDK.</strong> SPI and PIO are high on the list,
followed by USB, Wifi and Bluetooth. Eventually, most SDK libraries should
have a binding.</li>
<li><strong>Improve threading performance.</strong> A C implementation of the
<a href="https://github.com/MicroLua/MicroLua/blob/main/docs/mlua.md#mluathread"><code>mlua.thread</code></a> module, with a less naive timer list,
could significantly improve event dispatch latency.</li>
<li><strong>Add a filesystem</strong> (probably
<a href="https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs">littlefs</a>) with support for
loading Lua modules and updating them over USB. This will enable simpler
development workflows similar to e.g. <a href="https://micropython.org/" rel="nofollow">MicroPython</a>
&amp; <a href="https://thonny.org/" rel="nofollow">Thonny</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Tune garbage collection.</strong> Garbage collection parameters are currently left
at their default value, which may not be ideal for a memory-constrained
target.</li>
<li><strong>Improve cross-core communication.</strong> Each core runs its own Lua interpreter,
so they cannot communicate directly through shared Lua state. Currently, the
only way for the cores to communicate is the SIO FIFOs, which is fairly
limited. A form of memory-based cross-core channel would be useful.</li>
<li><strong>Add multi-chip communication.</strong> As an extension of cross-core channels,
cross-chip channels could enable fast communication between multiple RP2040
chips.</li>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-why-lua-why-the-rp2040" dir="auto"><a href="#why-lua-why-the-rp2040">Why Lua? Why the RP2040?</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Both Lua and the RP2040 evolve at a velocity that can be followed by a single
developer in their spare time. Lua is developed by a small team: the language
itself evolves very slowly and the interpreter has a couple of minor releases
each year. Similarly, the RP2040 is developed by a small company, and a new chip
may be released every few years.</p>
<p dir="auto">Contrast this with e.g. Python: the language evolves rather quickly nowadays,
and the interpreter gets contributions from dozens (hundreds? thousands?) of
developers. Similarly, large semiconductor companies release new chips and
variants every year. Developing for these targets is a game of catch-up that I
don't want to play.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-can-microlua-support-other-microcontroller-families" dir="auto"><a href="#can-microlua-support-other-microcontroller-families">Can MicroLua support other microcontroller families?</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">No, that's an explicit non-goal. Supporting multiple microcontroller families
inevitably leads to either limiting features to the common denominator, or
introducing a complex configuration system.</p>
<p dir="auto">Moreover, MicroLua integrates directly with the build system of the Pico SDK,
which is strongly tied to the RP2040. Supporting other microcontrollers would
require a different build system.</p>
<p dir="auto">MicroLua will likely support later RP devices if / when they get released, but
until then, the RP2040 is the only supported target.</p>

interpreter, and aims to provide a full embedded development environment,

<p dir="auto">MicroLua uses an unpatched Lua interpreter at the latest stable version, and
aims to expose most of the functionality provided by the Pico SDK through a
thin binding layer.</p>

</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-whats-the-relationship-with-microlua-ds" dir="auto"><a href="#whats-the-relationship-with-microlua-ds">What's the relationship with MicroLua DS?</a></h3>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/microlua/" rel="nofollow">MicroLua DS</a> was a development
environment for building apps for the Nintendo DS in Lua. It was last released
in January 2014. MicroLua has no relationship with MicroLua DS.</p>
<p dir="auto">While the naming conflict is unfortunate, I felt that almost 10 years of
inactivity was long enough that it was fair game to re-use the name.</p>
