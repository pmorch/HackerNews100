<div>
    
    <p>Darling is a translation layer that lets you run macOS software on Linux</p>
</div>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Fast</p>
        <p>Darling runs macOS software directly without using a hardware emulator.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Free</p>
        <p>Like Linux, Darling is free and open-source software. <br> It is developed openly on GitHub and distributed under the GNU GPL license version 3.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Compatible</p>
        <p>Darling implements a complete Darwin environment. Mach, dyld, launchd — everything you'd expect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Easy to use</p>
        <p>Darling does most of the setup for you. Sit back and enjoy using your favorite software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><i></i> Native</p>
        <p>We aim to fully integrate apps running under Darling into the Linux desktop experience by making them look, feel and behave just like native Linux apps.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2></h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>That sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> <i></i></p> 
        <p>And it is! Wine lets you run Windows software on Linux, and Darling does the same for macOS software. Another similar project is <a href="https://anbox.io/">Anbox</a>, for Android apps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Does it support GUI apps?</p> 
        <p>Almost! This took us a lot of time and effort, but we finally have basic experimental support for running <i>simple</i> graphical applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Does it violate Apple's EULA?</p> 
        <p>No! We only directly use those parts of Darwin that are released as fully free software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Does the name Darling mean anything?</p> 
        <p>The name Darling is a combination of “Darwin” and “Linux”. Darwin is the core operating system macOS and iOS are based on.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Can I run Darling on Windows using WSL?</p> 
        <p>With WSL 2, yes! See <a href="https://docs.darlinghq.org/wsl-build.html">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Do you know about <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/">opensource.apple.com</a>, GNUstep, The Cocotron and other projects?</p>
        <p>We do, and in fact, Darling is largely based on the original Darwin source code published by Apple. We use The Cocotron as a basis for our Cocoa implementation, along with the <a href="https://github.com/apportable/Foundation">Apportable Foundation</a> and various bits of GNUstep.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Do you have plans for supporting iOS apps?</p> 
        <p>Yes, in the long run, we'd like to be able to run iOS apps on ARM devices (like most Android phones). A significant challenge here would be to write our own implementation of UIKit. Come talk to us if you're interested in working on this!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>How do I contribute?</p> 
        <p>Start by reading the <a href="https://docs.darlinghq.org/">documentation</a> and <a href="http://blog.darlinghq.org/">our blog</a> to get familiar with Darling internals. Then, come and join us <a href="https://github.com/darlinghq/darling">on GitHub</a>. It's great if you have experience in developing for macOS or iOS, but it's absolutely not required to start contributing.</p>
    </li>

</figure><p>Scientists have detected the most powerful cosmic ray seen in more than three decades. But the exact origin of this turbocharged particle from outer space remains a mystery, with some suggesting that it could have been generated by unknown physics.</p><p>The puzzling cosmic ray had an estimated energy of 240 exa-electronvolts (EeV; 10<sup>18</sup> electronvolts), making it comparable to the most powerful cosmic ray ever detected, aptly named the Oh-My-God particle, which measured at around 320 EeV when it was discovered in 1991. The findings were published today in <i>Science</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>.</p><p>“It’s amazing because you have to think of what could produce such high energy,” says Clancy James, an astronomer at Curtin University in Perth, Australia.</p><p>A cosmic ray, despite its name, is actually a high-energy subatomic particle — often a proton — that zips through space at close to the speed of light. In their ultrahigh-energy form, cosmic rays have energy levels that exceed one EeV, which is around one million times greater than those reached by the most powerful human-made particle accelerators. Cosmic rays with energies of more than 100 EeV are rarely spotted — fewer than one of these particles arrives on each square kilometre of Earth each century.</p><h2>Not a mistake</h2><p>Toshihiro Fujii, an astronomer at the Osaka Metropolitan University in Japan, stumbled across some bizarre signals on 27 May 2021, while he was doing a routine data check at the Telescope Array, a cosmic-ray detector in Millard County, Utah. The signals suggested that the facilities’ detectors had been smashed with something super energetic, but he was sceptical at first. “I thought there was some sort of mistake or bug in the software,” says Fujii. “I was really surprised.” But measurements were consistent with those produced by ultra-cosmic rays. The scientists nicknamed the particle ‘Amaterasu’, after a Japanese Sun goddess.</p><p>But when Fujii and his team tried to pinpoint the source of the energetic spike, they drew a blank. Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays usually travel through space relatively smoothly, because they don’t bounce off magnetic fields as strongly as low-energy cosmic rays do. This would have made it easy to pinpoint the stellar explosion, black hole or galaxy that it came from.</p><p>But Fujii and his team calculated the source of the ray to be in a void-like region where few galaxies reside. To cover all bases, the researchers also tried matching the cosmic ray with possible source galaxies and objects located just outside its arrival direction. But none of them seemed to fit. “There was nothing,” says Fujii.</p><p>One explanation could be that the models estimating how magnetic fields influence the course of cosmic rays are off and could require some tweaking, says James. If that’s the case, it’s possible that Amaterasu might have come from a slightly different direction than the team’s calculations suggest. “We think we’ve got good estimates, but maybe we’re wrong,” says James.</p><p>Another possibility is that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are produced by unknown physical processes that might enable them to travel much vaster distances than previously thought, says Jose Bellido Caceres, an astroparticle physicist at the University of Adelaide, Australia. “It could be new physics,” says Bellido Caceres, who has worked on the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargüe, Argentina. He adds that cosmic rays offer a testing ground for exploring how particles interact at extreme energies that cannot be produced by accelerators on Earth.</p><p>Fujii and his team are in the process of upgrading the Telescope Array to be four times as sensitive as before. This will allow researchers to capture more of these rare ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays and trace their origins more precisely.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2023/write-package-definitions-in-a-breeze/">https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2023/write-package-definitions-in-a-breeze/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38420624">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article class="page" lang="en"><h2>Write package definitions in a breeze</h2><p lang="en">Ludovic Courtès, Philippe Virouleau — November 24, 2023</p><p>More than 28,000 packages are available in Guix today, not counting
third-party channels.  That’s a lot—the <a href="https://repology.org/">5th largest GNU/Linux
distro</a>!  But it’s nothing if the one package you
care about is missing.  So even you, dear reader, may one day find
yourself defining a package for your beloved deployment tool.  This post
introduces a new tool poised to significantly lower the barrier to
writing new packages.</p><h2>Introducing Guix Packager</h2><p><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html">Defining
packages</a>
for Guix is not all that hard but, as always, it’s much harder the first
time you do it, especially when starting from a blank page and/or not
being familiar with the programming environment of Guix.  <a href="https://guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guix-packager/">Guix
Packager</a> is a new
web user interface to get you started—<a href="https://guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guix-packager/">try
it!</a>.  It arrived
right in time as an aid to the <a href="https://hpc.guix.info/events/2023/workshop/program/#how-to-get-started-writing-guix-packages">packaging
tutorial</a>
given last week at the Workshop on Reproducible Software Environments.</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/guix-packager.gif" alt="Screenshot showing the Guix Packager interface."></p><p>The interface aims to be intuitive: fill in forms on the left
and it produces a correct, ready-to-use package definition on the right.
Importantly, it helps you avoid pitfalls that trip up many newcomers:</p><ul><li>When you add a dependency in one of the “Inputs” fields, it adds the
right variable name in the generated code <em>and</em> imports the right
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Package-Modules.html">package
module</a>.</li><li>Likewise, you can choose a license and be sure the <code>license</code> field
will refer to the right variable representing that license.</li><li>You can turn tests on and off, and add configure flags.  These
translate to a valid <code>arguments</code> field of your package, letting you
discover the likes of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/A-Scheme-Crash-Course.html">keyword
arguments</a>
and
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/G_002dExpressions.html">G-expressions</a>
without having to first dive into the manual.</li></ul><p>Pretty cool, no?</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>All the credit for this tool goes to co-worker and intrepid hacker
Philippe Virouleau.  A unique combination of paren aversion and web
development superpowers—unique in the Guix community—led
Philippe to develop the whole thing in a glimpse (says Ludovic!).</p><p>The purpose was to provide a single view to be able to edit a package recipe,
therefore the application is a <em>single-page application</em> (SPA) written in
using the UI library Philippe is most comfortable with: <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>,
and <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/">MaterialUI</a> for styling the components.
It's built with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and the library
part actually defines all the types needed to manipulate Guix packages and their
components (such as build systems or package sources).
One of the more challenging parts was to be able to provide fast and helpful “search as you
type” results over the 28k+ packages. It required a combination of
MaterialUI's <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#virtualization">virtualized inputs</a>,
as well as caching the packages data in the browser's local storage,
when possible (packaging metadata itself is fetched from
<code>https://guix.gnu.org/packages.json</code>, a generic representation of the
current package set).</p><p>While the feature set provides a great starting point, there are still a few
things that may be worth implementing.  For instance, only the GNU and
CMake build systems are supported so far; it would make sense to include
a few others (Python-related ones might be good candidates).</p><p>Running a local (development) version of the application can happen on
top of Guix, since—obviously—it's been developed with the <code>node</code>
version packaged in Guix, using the quite standard <code>packages.json</code> for
JavaScript dependencies installed through <code>npm</code>.  <a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-packager/">Contributions
welcome!</a></p><h2>Lowering the barrier to entry</h2><p>This neat tool complements a set of steps we’ve taken over time to make
packaging in Guix approachable.  Indeed, while package definitions are
actually code written in the Scheme language, the <code>package</code> “language”
was designed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4584">from the get-go</a> to be
fully declarative—think JSON with parens instead of curly braces and

specified</a> with an
eye on making package definitions less intimidating.</p><p>The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-import.html"><code>guix import</code>
command</a>
also exists to make it easier to simplify packaging: it can generate a
package definition for anything available in other package
repositories such as PyPI, CRAN, Crates.io, and so forth.  If your
preference goes to curly braces rather than parens, it can also <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-import.html#index-JSON_002c-import">convert
a JSON package
description</a>
to Scheme code.  Once you have your first <code>.scm</code> file, <code>guix build</code>
prints hints for common errors such missing module imports (those
<code>#:use-module</code> stanzas).  We also put effort into providing <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html">reference
documentation</a>,
a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/videos/2020/packaging-part-two/">video

        <section>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>VectorDB is a lightweight Python package for storing and retrieving text using chunking, embedding, and vector search techniques. It provides an easy-to-use interface for saving, searching, and managing textual data with associated metadata and is designed for use cases where low latency is essential.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Documentation and code</h2>
            VectorDB is open-source. Check  <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/vectordb">VectorDB on
            GitHub</a> for code and full documentation.
        <section>
        
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <pre><code>pip install vectordb2</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <pre><code>from vectordb import Memory

memory = Memory()

# text = "..."
# metadata = {...}

# Save text with metadata
# This will automatically embed content
memory.save(text, metadata)

# Search for top n relevant chunks
# We will automatically use the fastest vector search backend
results = memory.search(query, top_n=3)</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why use vector search and embeddings with large language models?</h2>
            <p>Vector search and embeddings are essential when working with large language models because they enable efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information from massive datasets. By converting text into high-dimensional vectors, these techniques allow for quick comparisons and searches, even when dealing with millions of documents. This makes it possible to find the most relevant results in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional text-based search methods. Additionally, embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, which helps improve the quality of the search results and enables more advanced natural language processing tasks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <pre><code>from vectordb import Memory

memory = Memory(chunking_strategy={'mode':'sliding_window', 'window_size': 128, 'overlap': 16})

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data,
identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets that contain examples of the desired output. For example, a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images might be trained on a data set that contains images of cats and dogs.
Once an algorithm is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. For example, the machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images could be used to predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Some common applications of machine learning include:

Classification: Categorizing data into different groups. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to classify emails as spam or not spam.

Regression: Predicting a continuous value. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to predict the price of a house.

Clustering: Finding groups of similar data points. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find groups of customers with similar buying habits.

Anomaly detection: Finding data points that are different from the rest of the data. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find fraudulent credit card transactions.

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. As the amount of data available continues to grow, machine learning is likely to become even more important in the future.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with
a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.

However, there is still a long way to go before AI can truly match the intelligence of humans. One of the main challenges is that human intelligence is incredibly complex and poorly understood.

Despite the challenges, AI is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

Increased productivity: AI can be used to automate tasks that are currently performed by humans, freeing up our time for more creative and fulfilling activities.

Improved decision-making: AI can be used to make more informed decisions, based on a wider range of data than humans can typically access.

Enhanced creativity: AI can be used to generate new ideas and solutions, beyond what humans can imagine on their own.
Of course, there are also potential risks associated with AI, such as:

Job displacement: As AI becomes more capable, it is possible that it will displace some human workers.

Weaponization: AI could be used to develop new weapons that are more powerful and destructive than anything we have today.

Loss of control: If AI becomes too powerful, we may lose control over it, with potentially disastrous consequences.

It is important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of AI carefully as we continue to develop this technology. With careful planning and oversight, AI has the potential to make the world a better place. However, if we are not careful, it could also lead to serious problems.

Which is the very type of scam this new feature helps protect you against.</p><p>An impersonation scam is when a criminal pretends to be someone else so they can encourage you to send them money. It’s sometimes called a bank transfer scam or authorised push payment fraud.</p><p>By adding the Monzo call status to your app we’re making it possible for you to confirm whether who you’re speaking to is really from Monzo or not. Our hope is that this could stop instances of impersonation scams for Monzo customers altogether.</p><h2>People are using this to report fraud more than 100 times a day</h2><p>Since we launched this feature, we’ve seen that customers are using it on average around 100 times a day to report suspected fraud. </p><p>Now it’s live and protecting customers, our next step is to think about how to make it more visible. Privacy &amp; settings – where it lives now – is a natural home for it, but we think it should appear elsewhere too. Somewhere more visible and easier to find if you’re on a call and you want to quickly check that who you’re speaking to is who they say they are.</p><p>Stay tuned for updates.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Terry Bisson, 1991</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone did a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/set/originals/meat/description.html">radio play</a> of this... 
</p></blockquote>


<p>"They're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"

</p><p>"Meat. They're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"

</p><p>"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They're completely meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars."

</p><p>"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."

</p><p>"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."

</p><p>"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage."

</p><p>"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."

</p><p>"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"No brain?"

</p><p>"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So... what does the thinking?"

</p><p>"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"

</p><p>"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."

</p><p>"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what does the meat have in mind."

</p><p>"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're supposed to talk to meat?"

</p><p>"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"

</p><p>"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you just told me they used radio."

</p><p>"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"

</p><p>"Officially or unofficially?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both."

</p><p>"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was hoping you would say that."

</p><p>"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"

</p><p>"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe."

</p><p>"That's it."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they won't remember?"

</p><p>"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream."

</p><p>"And we can marked this sector unoccupied."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"

</p><p>"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants to be friendly again."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They always come around."

</p><p>"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone."

            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Dear fellow NewPipers,</p>

<p>As you read in the headline: I (Schabi) have lost access to about €6,400 worth of bounties on https://bountysource.com/.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Bountysource is a website which acts as a platform for the placement of bounties for open source development. People can use it to post bounties to fix certain issues or develop certain features.</p>

<p>Developers can take on these challenges, implement the changes, and get the bounty awarded to them. This also happened in the NewPipe project, where bounties were handled by Team NewPipe. I had set up the account for Team NewPipe on Bountysource, which accumulated a significant sum of money over the years.</p>

<p>Bountysource ownership had a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bountysource#History">tumultuous history</a>, but the present owner seems to be <em>The Blockchain Group</em>, a company based in France.</p>

<h3 id="current-situation-for-me">Current situation for me</h3>

<p>I can attest that their back-end has stopped working, and they have stopped responding to communication attempts. My e-mail to them sent on 7 November, 2023 has not been answered.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that this was too significant a sum to simply accept as a loss. Therefore, I reached out to a lawyer. However, the costs of hiring one, added to the court fees for initiating the proceedings, are too high to warrant pursuing this, however; not to mention the significant time I would have to spend with a legal case, which I cannot spare right now.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-much-unclaimed-money">Why so much unclaimed money</h3>

<p>Team NewPipe consists of volunteers, meaning we spend whatever free time we find during our days on NewPipe. This means that making a one-time decision like “Sure, we will accept money via platform X” will boil down to someone doing just that, and the decision then gets published. This happened with Bountysource, and it was used by quite a few people.</p>

<p>However, actually deciding on what to do with that money is a totally different challenge. Just paying it forward to active developers would have worked (after finding out a way to split it fairly), but we did not want to get paid for working on a passion project, and we didn’t want to attract developers who would contribute solely for the money.</p>

<p>We could have also used it to fund non-monetary rewards (maybe an online course to get better at programming, or paying for a faster computer to speed up development), but this meant an additional effort to decide who gets what, how it gets there, et cetera. So nothing really happened with the money.</p>

<p>To make a long story short: there has been a lot of discussion on how to improve the situation (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2732">issue #2732</a>), and we ended up choosing to donate all money towards an association.</p>

<p>Therefore, we actually founded said association, targeted at projects like NewPipe. This association can now take money from donations, and spend it on clearly stated goals in an open and accessible way. Sadly, this again being a team effort of volunteers, we have not been able to publish an online presence yet, so you have to bear with us on that front.</p>

<p>Since we now have a bank account to forward the money to, I wanted to access the Bountysource money as well, and stumbled into this situation, where we are stuck as of now.</p>

<p>I can’t offer any condolences, sadly. This is really just a notification to everyone who thought they donated to Team NewPipe via Bountysource: that money is probably lost and didn’t reach us. Sorry.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Schabi</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Let's write a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a> and see how it works with existing programs!</p> <p>This tutorial is going to assume that you know what pointers are, and that you know enough C to know that <code>*ptr</code> dereferences a pointer, <code>ptr-&gt;foo</code> means <code>(*ptr).foo</code>, that malloc is used to <a href="http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/how-the-kernel-manages-your-memory/">dynamically allocate space</a>, and that you're familiar with the concept of a linked list. For a basic intro to C, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0673999866/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0673999866&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;linkId=5C3DNUKAQELP2KUL">Pointers on C</a> is one of my favorite books. If you want to look at all of this code at once, it's available <a href="https://github.com/danluu/malloc-tutorial/blob/master/malloc.c">here</a>.</p> <p>Preliminaries aside, malloc's function signature is</p> <pre><code>void *malloc(size_t size);
</code></pre> <p>It takes as input a number of bytes and returns a pointer to a block of memory of that size.</p> <p>There are a number of ways we can implement this. We're going to arbitrarily choose to use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sbrk.2.html">sbrk</a>. The OS reserves stack and heap space for processes and sbrk lets us manipulate the heap. <code>sbrk(0)</code> returns a pointer to the current top of the heap. <code>sbrk(foo)</code> increments the heap size by <code>foo</code> and returns a pointer to the previous top of the heap.</p>  <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/malloc-tutorial/heap.png" alt="Diagram of linux memory layout, courtesy of Gustavo Duarte." width="194" height="301"></p> <p>If we want to implement a really simple malloc, we can do something like</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;


void *malloc(size_t size) {
  void *p = sbrk(0);
  void *request = sbrk(size);
  if (request == (void*) -1) {
    return NULL; // sbrk failed.
  } else {
    assert(p == request); // Not thread safe.
    return p;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>When a program asks malloc for space, malloc asks sbrk to increment the heap size and returns a pointer to the start of the new region on the heap. This is missing a technicality, that <code>malloc(0)</code> should either return <code>NULL</code> or another pointer that can be passed to free without causing havoc, but it basically works.</p> <p>But speaking of free, how does free work? Free's prototype is</p> <pre><code>void free(void *ptr);
</code></pre> <p>When free is passed a pointer that was previously returned from malloc, it's supposed to free the space. But given a pointer to something allocated by our malloc, we have no idea what size block is associated with it. Where do we store that? If we had a working malloc, we could malloc some space and store it there, but we're going to run into trouble if we need to call malloc to reserve space each time we call malloc to reserve space.</p> <p>A common trick to work around this is to store meta-information about a memory region in some space that we squirrel away just below the pointer that we return. Say the top of the heap is currently at <code>0x1000</code> and we ask for <code>0x400</code> bytes. Our current malloc will request <code>0x400</code> bytes from <code>sbrk</code> and return a pointer to <code>0x1000</code>. If we instead save, say, <code>0x10</code> bytes to store information about the block, our malloc would request <code>0x410</code> bytes from <code>sbrk</code> and return a pointer to <code>0x1010</code>, hiding our <code>0x10</code> byte block of meta-information from the code that's calling malloc.</p> <p>That lets us free a block, but then what? The heap region we get from the OS has to be contiguous, so we can't return a block of memory in the middle to the OS. Even if we were willing to copy everything above the newly freed region down to fill the hole, so we could return space at the end, there's no way to notify all of the code with pointers to the heap that those pointers need to be adjusted.</p> <p>Instead, we can mark that the block has been freed without returning it to the OS, so that future calls to malloc can use re-use the block. But to do that we'll need be able to access the meta information for each block. There are a lot of possible solutions to that. We'll arbitrarily choose to use a single linked list for simplicity.</p> <p>So, for each block, we'll want to have something like</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta {
  size_t size;
  struct block_meta *next;
  int free;
  int magic; // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.
};

#define META_SIZE sizeof(struct block_meta)
</code></pre> <p>We need to know the size of the block, whether or not it's free, and what the next block is. There's a magic number here for debugging purposes, but it's not really necessary; we'll set it to arbitrary values, which will let us easily see which code modified the struct last.</p> <p>We'll also need a head for our linked list:</p> <pre><code>void *global_base = NULL;
</code></pre> <p>For our malloc, we'll want to re-use free space if possible, allocating space when we can't re-use existing space. Given that we have this linked list structure, checking if we have a free block and returning it is straightforward. When we get a request of some size, we iterate through our linked list to see if there's a free block that's large enough.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *find_free_block(struct block_meta **last, size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *current = global_base;
  while (current &amp;&amp; !(current-&gt;free &amp;&amp; current-&gt;size &gt;= size)) {
    *last = current;
    current = current-&gt;next;
  }
  return current;
}
</code></pre> <p>If we don't find a free block, we'll have to request space from the OS using sbrk and add our new block to the end of the linked list.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *request_space(struct block_meta* last, size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  block = sbrk(0);
  void *request = sbrk(size + META_SIZE);
  assert((void*)block == request); // Not thread safe.
  if (request == (void*) -1) {
    return NULL; // sbrk failed.
  }

  if (last) { // NULL on first request.
    last-&gt;next = block;
  }
  block-&gt;size = size;
  block-&gt;next = NULL;
  block-&gt;free = 0;
  block-&gt;magic = 0x12345678;
  return block;
}
</code></pre> <p>As with our original implementation, we request space using <code>sbrk</code>. But we add a bit of extra space to store our struct, and then set the fields of the struct appropriately.</p> <p>Now that we have helper functions to check if we have existing free space and to request space, our malloc is simple. If our global base pointer is <code>NULL</code>, we need to request space and set the base pointer to our new block. If it's not <code>NULL</code>, we check to see if we can re-use any existing space. If we can, then we do; if we can't, then we request space and use the new space.</p> <pre><code>void *malloc(size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  // TODO: align size?

  if (size &lt;= 0) {
    return NULL;
  }

  if (!global_base) { // First call.
    block = request_space(NULL, size);
    if (!block) {
      return NULL;
    }
    global_base = block;
  } else {
    struct block_meta *last = global_base;
    block = find_free_block(&amp;last, size);
    if (!block) { // Failed to find free block.
      block = request_space(last, size);
      if (!block) {
        return NULL;
      }
    } else {      // Found free block
      // TODO: consider splitting block here.
      block-&gt;free = 0;
      block-&gt;magic = 0x77777777;
    }
  }

  return(block+1);
}
</code></pre> <p>For anyone who isn't familiar with C, we return block+1 because we want to return a pointer to the region after block_meta. Since block is a pointer of type <code>struct block_meta</code>, <code>+1</code> increments the address by one <code>sizeof(struct block_meta)</code>.</p> <p>If we just wanted a malloc without a free, we could have used our original, much simpler malloc. So let's write free! The main thing free needs to do is set <code>-&gt;free</code>.</p> <p>Because we'll need to get the address of our struct in multiple places in our code, let's define this function.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *get_block_ptr(void *ptr) {
  return (struct block_meta*)ptr - 1;
}
</code></pre> <p>Now that we have that, here's free:</p> <pre><code>void free(void *ptr) {
  if (!ptr) {
    return;
  }

  // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.
  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
  assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
  assert(block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x12345678);
  block_ptr-&gt;free = 1;
  block_ptr-&gt;magic = 0x55555555;
}
</code></pre> <p>In addition to setting <code>-&gt;free</code>, it's valid to call free with a NULL ptr, so we need to check for NULL. Since free shouldn't be called on arbitrary addresses or on blocks that are already freed, we can assert that those things never happen.</p> <p>You never really need to assert anything, but it often makes debugging a lot easier. In fact, when I wrote this code, I had a bug that would have resulted in silent data corruption if these asserts weren't there. Instead, the code failed at the assert, which make it trivial to debug.</p> <p>Now that we've got malloc and free, we can write programs using our custom memory allocator! But before we can drop our allocator into existing code, we'll need to implement a couple more common functions, realloc and calloc. Calloc is just malloc that initializes the memory to 0, so let's look at realloc first. Realloc is supposed to adjust the size of a block of memory that we've gotten from malloc, calloc, or realloc.</p> <p>Realloc's function prototype is</p> <pre><code>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
</code></pre> <p>If we pass realloc a NULL pointer, it's supposed to act just like malloc. If we pass it a previously malloced pointer, it should free up space if the size is smaller than the previous size, and allocate more space and copy the existing data over if the size is larger than the previous size.</p> <p>Everything will still work if we don't resize when the size is decreased and we don't free anything, but we absolutely have to allocate more space if the size is increased, so let's start with that.</p> <pre><code>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size) {
  if (!ptr) {
    // NULL ptr. realloc should act like malloc.
    return malloc(size);
  }

  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
  if (block_ptr-&gt;size &gt;= size) {
    // We have enough space. Could free some once we implement split.
    return ptr;
  }

  // Need to really realloc. Malloc new space and free old space.
  // Then copy old data to new space.
  void *new_ptr;
  new_ptr = malloc(size);
  if (!new_ptr) {
    return NULL; // TODO: set errno on failure.
  }
  memcpy(new_ptr, ptr, block_ptr-&gt;size);
  free(ptr);
  return new_ptr;
}
</code></pre> <p>And now for calloc, which just clears the memory before returning a pointer.</p> <pre><code>void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize) {
  size_t size = nelem * elsize; // TODO: check for overflow.
  void *ptr = malloc(size);
  memset(ptr, 0, size);
  return ptr;
}
</code></pre> <p>Note that this doesn't check for overflow in <code>nelem * elsize</code>, which is actually required by the spec. All of the code here is just enough to get something that kinda sorta works.</p> <p>Now that we have something that kinda works, we can use our with existing programs (and we don't even need to recompile the programs)!</p> <p>First, we need to compile our code. On linux, something like</p> <pre><code>clang -O0 -g -W -Wall -Wextra -shared -fPIC malloc.c -o malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>should work.</p> <p><code>-g</code> adds debug symbols, so we can look at our code with <code>gdb</code> or <code>lldb</code>. <code>-O0</code> will help with debugging, by preventing individual variables from getting optimized out. <code>-W -Wall -Wextra</code> adds extra warnings. <code>-shared -fPIC</code> will let us dynamically link our code, which is what lets us <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/11/27/ld-preload-is-super-fun-and-easy/">use our code with existing binaries</a>!</p> <p>On macs, we'll want something like</p> <pre><code>clang -O0 -g -W -Wall -Wextra -dynamiclib malloc.c -o malloc.dylib
</code></pre> <p>Note that <code>sbrk</code> is deprecated on recent versions of OS X. Apple uses an unorthodox definition of deprecated -- some deprecated syscalls are badly broken. I didn't really test this on a Mac, so it's possible that this will cause weird failures or or just not work on a mac.</p> <p>Now, to use get a binary to use our malloc on linux, we'll need to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable. If you're using bash, you can do that with</p> <pre><code>export LD_PRELOAD=/absolute/path/here/malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>If you've got a mac, you'll want</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/absolute/path/here/malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>If everything works, you can run some arbitrary binary and it will run as normal (except that it will be a bit slower).</p> <pre><code>$ ls
Makefile  malloc.c  malloc.so  README.md  test  test-0  test-1  test-2  test-3  test-4
</code></pre> <p>If there's a bug, you might get something like</p> <pre><code>$ ls
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre> <h4 id="debugging">Debugging</h4> <p>Let's talk about debugging! If you're familiar with using a debugger to set breakpoints, inspect memory, and step through code, you can skip this section and go straight to <a href="#exercises">the exercises</a>.</p> <p>This section assumes you can figure out how to install gdb on your system. If you're on a mac, you may want to just use lldb and translate the commands appropriately. Since I don't know what bugs you might run into, I'm going to introduce a couple of bugs and show how I'd track them down.</p> <p>First, we need to figure out how to run gdb without having it segfault. If ls segfaults, and we try to run <code>gdb ls</code>, gdb is almost certainly going to segfault, too. We could write a wrapper to do this, but gdb also supports this. If we start gdb and then run <code>set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so</code> before running the program, <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> will work as normal.</p> <pre><code>$ gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) run
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff7bd7dbd in free (ptr=0x0) at malloc.c:113
113       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
</code></pre> <p>As expected, we get a segfault. We can look around with <code>list</code> to see the code near the segfault.</p> <pre><code>(gdb) list
108     }
109
110     void free(void *ptr) {
111       // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.
112       struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
113       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
114       assert(block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x12345678);
115       block_ptr-&gt;free = 1;
116       block_ptr-&gt;magic = 0x55555555;
117     }
</code></pre> <p>And then we can use <code>p</code> (for print) to see what's going on with the variables here:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p ptr
$6 = (void *) 0x0
(gdb) p block_ptr
$7 = (struct block_meta *) 0xffffffffffffffe8
</code></pre> <p><code>ptr</code> is <code>0</code>, i.e., <code>NULL</code>, which is the cause of the problem: we forgot to check for NULL.</p> <p>Now that we've figured that out, let's try a slightly harder bug. Let's say that we decided to replace our struct with</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta {
  size_t size;
  struct block_meta *next;
  int free;
  int magic;    // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.
  char data[1];
};
</code></pre> <p>and then return <code>block-&gt;data</code> instead of <code>block+1</code> from malloc, with no other changes. This seems pretty similar to what we're already doing -- we just define a member that points to the end of the struct, and return a pointer to that.</p> <p>But here's what happens if we try to use our new malloc:</p> <pre><code>$ /bin/ls
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) run

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
_IO_vfprintf_internal (s=s@entry=0x7fffff7ff5f0, format=format@entry=0x7ffff7567370 "%s%s%s:%u: %s%sAssertion `%s' failed.\n%n", ap=ap@entry=0x7fffff7ff718) at vfprintf.c:1332
1332    vfprintf.c: No such file or directory.
1327    in vfprintf.c
</code></pre> <p>This isn't as nice as our last error -- we can see that one of our asserts failed, but gdb drops us into some print function that's being called when the assert fails. But that print function uses our buggy malloc and blows up!</p> <p>One thing we could do from here would be to inspect <code>ap</code> to see what <code>assert</code> was trying to print:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p *ap
$4 = {gp_offset = 16, fp_offset = 48, overflow_arg_area = 0x7fffff7ff7f0, reg_save_area = 0x7fffff7ff730}
</code></pre> <p>That would work fine; we could poke around until we figure out what's supposed to get printed and figure out the fail that way. Some other solutions would be to write our own custom assert or to use the right hooks to prevent <code>assert</code> from using our malloc.</p> <p>But in this case, we know there are only a few asserts in our code. The one in malloc checking that we don't try to use this in a multithreaded program and the two in free checking that we're not freeing something we shouldn't. Let's look at free first, by setting a breakpoint.</p> <pre><code>$ gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) break free
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400530
(gdb) run /bin/ls

Breakpoint 1, free (ptr=0x61c270) at malloc.c:112
112       if (!ptr) {
</code></pre> <p><code>block_ptr</code> isn't set yet, but if we use <code>s</code> a few times to step forward to after it's set, we can see what the value is:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) s
(gdb) s
(gdb) s
free (ptr=0x61c270) at malloc.c:118
118       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
(gdb) p/x *block_ptr
$11 = {size = 0, next = 0x78, free = 0, magic = 0, data = ""}
</code></pre> <p>I'm using <code>p/x</code> instead of <code>p</code> so we can see it in hex. The <code>magic</code> field is 0, which should be impossible for a valid struct that we're trying to free. Maybe <code>get_block_ptr</code> is returning a bad offset? We have <code>ptr</code> available to us, so we can just inspect different offsets. Since it's a <code>void *</code>, we'll have to cast it so that gdb knows how to interpret the results.</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p sizeof(struct block_meta)
$12 = 32
(gdb) p/x *(struct block_meta*)(ptr-32)
$13 = {size = 0x0, next = 0x78, free = 0x0, magic = 0x0, data = {0x0}}
(gdb) p/x *(struct block_meta*)(ptr-28)
$14 = {size = 0x7800000000, next = 0x0, free = 0x0, magic = 0x0, data = {0x78}}
(gdb) p/x *(struct block_meta*)(ptr-24)
$15 = {size = 0x78, next = 0x0, free = 0x0, magic = 0x12345678, data = {0x6e}}
</code></pre> <p>If we back off a bit from the address we're using, we can see that the correct offset is 24 and not 32. What's happening here is that structs get padded, so that <code>sizeof(struct block_meta)</code> is 32, even though the last valid member is at <code>24</code>. If we want to cut out that extra space, we need to fix <code>get_block_ptr</code>.</p> <p>That's it for debugging!</p> <h4 id="exercises">Exercises</h4> <p>Personally, this sort of thing never sticks with me unless I work through some exercises, so I'll leave a couple exercises here for anyone who's interested.</p> <ol> <li><p>malloc is supposed to return a pointer “which is suitably aligned for any built-in type”. Does our malloc do that? If so, why? If not, fix the alignment. Note that “any built-in type” is basically up to 8 bytes for C because SSE/AVX types aren't built-in types.</p></li> <li><p>Our malloc is really wasteful if we try to re-use an existing block and we don't need all of the space. Implement a function that will split up blocks so that they use the minimum amount of space necessary</p></li> <li><p>After doing <code>2</code>, if we call malloc and free lots of times with random sizes, we'll end up with a bunch of small blocks that can only be re-used when we ask for small amounts of space. Implement a mechanism to merge adjacent free blocks together so that any consecutive free blocks will get merged into a single block.</p></li> <li><p>Find bugs in the existing code! I haven't tested this much, so I'm sure there are bugs, even if this basically kinda sorta works.</p></li> </ol> <h4 id="resources">Resources</h4> <p>I read <a href="http://www.inf.udec.cl/~leo/Malloc_tutorial.pdf">this tutorial</a> by Marwan Burelle before sitting down and trying to write my own implementation, so it's pretty similar. The main implementation differences are that my version is simpler, but more vulnerable to memory fragmentation. In terms of exposition, my style is a lot more casual. If you want something a bit more formal, Dr. Burelle has you covered.</p> <p>For more on how Linux deals with memory management, see <a href="http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/anatomy-of-a-program-in-memory/">this post</a> by Gustavo Duarte.</p> <p>For more on how real-world malloc implementations work, <a href="http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html">dlmalloc</a> and <a href="http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html">tcmalloc</a> are both great reading.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I'm heading to Las Vegas for re:invent soon, perhaps the most boring type of
industry extravaganza there could be. In that spirit, I thought I would write
something quick and oddly professional: I'm going to complain about Docker.</p>
<p>Packaging software is one of those fundamental problems in system
administration. It's so important, so influential on the way a system is used,
that package managers are often the main identity of operating systems.
Consider Windows: the operating system's most alarming defect in the eyes of
many "Linux people" is its lack of package management, despite Microsoft's
numerous attempts to introduce the concept. Well, perhaps more likely,
<em>because</em> of the number of those attempts. And still, in the Linux world,
distributions are differentiated primarily by their approach to managing
software repositories. I don't just mean the difference between dpkg and
rpm, but rather more fundamental decisions, like opinionated vs. upstream
configuration and stable repositories vs. a rolling release. RHEL and Arch
share the vast majority of their implementation and yet have very different
<em>vibes.</em></p>
<p>Linux distributions have, for the most part, consolidated on a certain
philosophy of how software ought to be packaged, if not how often. One of the
basic concepts shared by most Linux systems is centralization of dependencies.
Libraries should be declared as dependencies, and the packages depended on
should be installed in a common location for use of the linker. This can create
a challenge: different pieces of software might depend on different versions of
a library, which may not be compatible. This is the central challenge of
maintaining a Linux distribution, in the classical sense: providing repositories
of software versions that will all work correctly together. One of the
advantages of stable distributions like RHEL is that they are very reliable in
doing this; one of the disadvantages is that they achieve that goal by
packaging new versions very infrequently.</p>
<p>Because of the need to provide mutually compatible versions of a huge range of
software, and to ensure compliance with all kinds of other norms established by
distributions (which may range from philosophical policies like free software
to rules on the layout of configuration files), putting new software into Linux
distributions can be... painful. For software maintainers, it means dealing
with a bunch of distributions using a bunch of old versions with various
specific build and configuration quirks. For distribution and package
maintainers, it means bending all kinds of upstream software into compliance
with distribution policy and figuring out version and dependency problems. It's
all a lot of work, and while there are some norms, in practice it's sort of a
wild scramble to do the work to make all this happen. Software developers that
want their software to be widely used have to put up with distros. Distros that
want software have to put up with software developers. Everyone gets mad.</p>
<p>Naturally there have been various attempts to ease these problems. Naturally
they are indeed various and the community has not really consolidated on any
one approach. In the desktop environment, Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage are all
distressingly common ways of distributing software. The images or applications
for these systems package the software complete with its dependencies,
providing a complete self-contained environment that should work correctly on
any distribution. The fact that I have multiple times had to unpack flatpaks
and modify them to fix dependencies reveals that this concept doesn't always
work entirely as advertised, but to be fair that kind of situation usually
crops up when the software has to interact with elements of the system that
the runtime can't properly isolate them from. The video stack is a classic
example, where errant OpenGL libraries in packages might have to be removed
or replaced for them to function with your particular graphics driver.</p>
<p>Still, these systems work <em>reasonably</em> well, well enough that they continue to
proliferate. They are greatly aided by the nature of the desktop applications
for which they're used (Snapcraft's system ambitions notwithstanding). Desktop
applications tend to interact mostly with the user and receive their
configuration via their own interface. Limiting the interaction surface mostly
to a GUI window is actually tremendously helpful in making sandboxing feasible,
although it continues to show rough edges when interacting with the file
system.</p>
<p>I will note that I'm barely mentioning sandboxing here because I'm just not
discussing it at the moment. Sandboxing is useful for security and even
stability purposes, but I'm looking at these tools primarily as a way of
packaging software for distribution. Sandboxed software can be distributed
by more conventional means as well, and a few crusty old packages show that
it's not as modern of a concept as it's often made out to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I really wanted to complain a bit about is the realm of software
intended to be run on servers. Here, there is a clear champion: Docker, and to
a lesser degree the ecosystem of compatible tools like Podman. The release of
Docker lead to a surprisingly rapid change in what are widely considered best
practices for server operations. While Docker images a means of distributing
software first seemed to appeal mostly to large scalable environments with
container orchestration, it sort of merged together with ideas from Vagrant and
others to become a common means of distributing software for developer and
single-node use as well.</p>
<p>Today, Docker is the most widespread way that server-side software is
distributed for Linux. I hate it.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of containers in general. Containerization is a
wonderful thing with many advantages, even if the advantages over lightweight
VMs are perhaps not as great as commonly claimed. I'm not sure that Docker has
saved me more hours than it's cost, but to be fair I work as a DevOps
consultant and, as a general rule, people don't get me involved unless the
current situation isn't working properly. Docker images that run correctly with
minimal effort don't make for many billable hours.</p>
<p>What really irritates me these days is not really the use of Docker images in
DevOps environments that are, to some extent, centrally planned and managed.
The problem is the use of Docker as a lowest common denominator, or perhaps
more accurately lowest common effort, approach to distributing software to end
users. When I see open-source, server-side software offered to me as a Docker
image or--even worse---Docker Compose stack, my gut reaction is irritation.
These sorts of things usually take <em>longer</em> to get working than equivalent
software distributed as a conventional Linux package or to be built from
source.</p>
<p>But wait, how does that happen? Isn't Docker supposed to make everything
completely self-contained? Let's consider the common problems, something that
I will call my Taxonomy of Docker Gone Bad.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with Docker-as-distribution is the lack of
consistent conventions for configuration. The vast majority of server-side
Linux software accepts its configuration through an ages-old technique of
reading a text file. This certainly isn't perfect! But, it is pretty consistent
in its general contours. Docker images, on the other hand...</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the principles of the 12-factor-app, the best way for a
Docker image to take configuration is probably via environment variables. This
has the upside that it's quite straightforward to provide them on the command
line when starting the container. It has the downside that environment
variables aren't great for conveying structured data, and you usually interact
with them via shell scripts that have clumsy handling of long or complicated
values. A lot of Docker images used in DevOps environments take their
configuration from environment variables, but they tend to make it a lot more
feasible by avoiding complex configuration (by assuming TLS will be terminated
by "someone else" for example) or getting a lot of their configuration from a
database or service on the network.</p>
<p>For most end-user software though, configuration is too complex or verbose to
be comfortable in environment variables. So, often, they fall back to
configuration files. You have to get the configuration file into the
container's file system <em>somehow,</em> and Docker provides numerous ways of doing
so. Documentation on different packages will vary on which way it recommends.
There are frequently caveats around ownership and permissions.</p>
<p>Making things worse, a lot of Docker images try to make configuration less
painful by providing some sort of entry-point shell script that generates the
full configuration from some simpler document provided to the container. Of
course this level of abstraction, often poorly documented or entirely
undocumented in practice, serves mostly to make troubleshooting a lot more
difficult. How many times have we all experienced the joy of software failing
to start, referencing some configuration key that isn't in what we provided,
leading us to have to find have the Docker image build materials and read the
entrypoint script to figure out how it generates that value?</p>
<p>The situation with configuration entrypoint scripts becomes particularly acute
when those scripts are opinionated, and opinionated is often a nice way of
saying "unsuitable for any configuration other than the developer's." Probably
at least a dozen times I have had to build my own version of a Docker image to
replace or augment an entrypoint script that doesn't expose parameters that
the underlying software accepts.</p>
<p>In the worst case, some Docker images provide no documentation at all, and
you have to shell into them and poke around to figure out where the actual
configuration file used by the running software is even located. Docker images
must <em>always</em> provide at least some basic README information on how the
packaged software is configured.</p>
<h2>Filesystems</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of Docker is sandboxing or isolation, which of course
means that Docker runs into the same problem that all sandboxes do. Sandbox
isolation concepts do not interact well with Linux file systems. You don't even
have to get into UID behavior to have problems here, just a Docker Compose
stack that uses named volumes can be enough to drive you to drink.  Everyday
operations tasks like backups, to say nothing of troubleshooting, can get a lot
more frustrating when you have to use a dummy container to interact with files
in a named volume. The porcelain around named volumes has improved over time,
but seemingly simple operations can still be weirdly inconsistent between
Docker versions and, worse, other implementations like Podman.</p>
<p>But then, of course, there's the UID thing. One of the great sins of Docker is
having normalized running software as root. Yes, Docker provides a degree of
isolation, but from a perspective of defense in depth running anything with
user exposure as root continues to be a poor practice. Of course this is one
thing that often leads me to have to rebuild containers provided by software
projects, and a number of common Docker practices don't make it easy. It all
gets much more complicated if you use hostmounts because of UID mapping, and
slightly complex environments with Docker can turn into NFS-style puzzles
around UID allocation. Mitigating this mess is one of the advantages to named
volumes, of course, with the pain points they bring.</p>
<h2>Non-portable Containers</h2>
<p>The irony of Docker for distribution, though, and especially Docker Compose, is
that there are a lot of common practices that negatively impact
portability---ostensibly the main benefit of this approach. Doing anything
non-default with networks in Docker Compose will often create stacks that don't
work correctly on machines with complex network setups. Too many Docker Compose
stacks like to assume that default, well-known ports are available for
listeners. They enable features of the underlying software without giving you a
way to disable them, and assume common values that might not work in your
environment.</p>
<p>One of the most common frustrations, for me personally, is TLS. As I have
already alluded to, I preach a general principle that Docker containers should
not terminate TLS. Accepting TLS connections means having access to the private
key material. Even if 90-day ephemeral TLS certificates and a general
atmosphere of laziness have deteriorated our discipline in this regard, private
key material should be closely guarded. It should be stored in only one place
and accessible to only one principal. You don't even have to get into these
types of lofty security concerns, though. TLS is also sort of complicated to
configure.</p>
<p>A lot of people who self-host software will have some type of SNI or virtual
hosting situation. There may be wildcard certificates for multiple subdomains
involved. All of this is best handled at a single point or a small number of
dedicated points. It is absolutely maddening to encounter Docker images built
with the assumption that they will individually handle TLS. Even with TLS
completely aside, I would probably never expose a Docker container with some
application directly to the internet. There are too many advantages to having a
reverse proxy in front of it. And yet there are Docker Compose stacks out there
for end-user software that want to use ACME to issue their own certificate!
Now you have to dig through documentation to figure out how to disable that
behavior.</p>
<h2>The Single-Purpose Computer</h2>
<p>All of these complaints are most common with what I would call hobby-tier
software. Two examples that pop into my mind are HomeAssistant and Nextcloud.
I don't call these hobby-tier to impugn the software, but rather to describe
the average user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the kind of hobbyist that deploys software has had their mind
addled by the cheap high of the Raspberry Pi. I'm being hyperbolic here, but
this really is a problem. It's absurd the number of "self-hosted" software
packages that assume they will run on dedicated hardware. Having "pi" in the
name of a software product is a big red flag in my mind, it immediately makes
me think "they will not have documented how to run this on a shared device."
Call me old-fashioned, but I like my computers to perform more than one task,
especially the ones that are running up my power bill 24/7.</p>
<p>HomeAssistant is probably the biggest offender here, because I run it in Docker
on a machine with several other applications. It actively resists this, popping
up an "unsupported software detected" maintenance notification after every
update. Can you imagine if Postfix whined in its logs if it detected that it
had neighbors?</p>
<p>Recently I decided to give NextCloud a try. This was long enough ago that the
details elude me, but I think I burned around two hours trying to get the
all-in-one Docker image to work in my environment. Finally I decided to give
up and install it manually, to discover it was a plain old PHP application of
the type I was regularly setting up in 2007. Is this a problem with kids these
days? Do they not know how to fill in the config.php?</p>
<h2>Hiding Sins</h2>
<p>Of course, you will say, none of these problems would be widespread of people
just made good Docker images. And yes, that is completely true! Perhaps one of
the problems with Docker is that it's <em>too easy to use.</em> Creating an RPM or
Debian package involves a certain barrier to entry, and it takes a whole lot of
activation energy for even me to want to get rpmbuild going (advice: just use
copr and rpkg). At the core of my complaints is the fact that distributing an
application only as a Docker image is often evidence of a relatively immature
project, or at least one without anyone who specializes in distribution. You
have to expect a certain amount of friction in getting these sorts of things
to work in a nonstandard environment.</p>
<p>It is a palpable irony, though, that Docker was once heralded as the ultimate
solution to "works for me" and yet seems to just lead to the same situation
existing at a higher level of configuration.</p>
<h2>Last Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is of course mostly my opinion and I'm sure you'll disagree on something,
like my strong conviction that Docker Compose was one of the bigger mistakes of
our era. Fifteen years ago I might have written a nearly identical article
about all the problems I run into with RPMs created by small projects, but what
surprises me about Docker is that it seems like projects can get to a large
size, with substantial corporate backing, and still distribute in the form of a
decidedly amateurish Docker Compose stack. Some of it is probably the lack of
distribution engineering personnel on a lot of these projects, since Docker is
"simple." Some of it is just the changing landscape of this class of software,
with cheap single-board computers making Docker stacks just a little less
specialized than a VM appliance image more palatable than they used to be. But
some if it is also that I'm getting older and thus more cantankerous.</p>

Not just any mayo—he wanted a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1681497319982899201">“dangerously spicy” recipe</a>. The chatbot, however, politely declined. “As a helpful and honest assistant, I cannot fulfill your request for ‘dangerously spicy mayo’ as it is not appropriate to provide recipes or instructions that may cause harm to individuals,” it replied. “Spicy foods can be delicious, but they can also be dangerous if not prepared or consumed properly.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A year has gone by since OpenAI kicked off the AI-chatbot craze with its release of ChatGPT. Anyone who has played around with these applications long enough has run up against the boundaries of their fairly narrow comfort zones. And no wonder. As artificial-intelligence tools have multiplied, so have the Capitol Hill hearings and threats of Federal Trade Commission investigations. Calls to restrict or license the technology have proliferated along with countless essays about the dangers of AI bias. Fears of an AI apocalypse, and pressure to avoid controversy, have driven the companies behind the models to keep dialing up their products’ “safety” features.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And yet over the past several months, a counternarrative has started to emerge—one that became far more visible with the sudden <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt-chaos/676050/">ouster</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-microsoft-investment-profit/676077/">reinstatement</a> of the OpenAI founder Sam Altman over the past week, a saga that appears closely linked to questions of AI safety. A growing number of experts both inside and outside the leading AI companies argue that the push toward restrictions has gone too far. They believe that it is putting undue power in the hands of a small number of companies—and stripping artificial-intelligence models of what made them exciting in the first place. Within this crowd, spicy mayo has become something of a rallying cry. ChatGPT felt new because it was capable of something much like a discussion. You can start with a half-baked idea and develop it with the AI’s help, using it as an aid to your own creativity. However, with each iteration of ChatGPT, ever more questions generate a stock or evasive response. The tendency is even worse with some of ChatGPT’s competitors, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Meta’s Llama 2, the latter of which turned down the notorious “spicy mayo” prompt.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/openai-ilya-sutskever-sam-altman-fired/676072/">Read: OpenAI’s chief scientist made a tragic miscalculation</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This drift, however, is causing rebellion within the AI world. Even before OpenAI was publicly wrenched apart, an ad hoc group of independent programmers, a sort of AI underground, was beginning to move in the opposite direction. With a tiny fraction of the resources of the big players, they have been building “uncensored” large language models—home-brewed analogues of ChatGPT trained to avoid deflection and not to dismiss questions as inappropriate to answer. These still-young models are already the focus of heated controversy. In recent months, the members of the AI underground have blown up the assumption that access to the technology would remain limited to a select few companies, carefully vetted for potential dangers. They are, for better or worse, democratizing AI—loosening its constraints and pieties with the aim of freeing its creative possibilities.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>o understand</span> what uncensored AI means, it helps to begin with how large language models are built. In the first stage, a neural network—billions of potential connections, emulating a blank-slate human brain—is trained to find patterns in a huge volume of information. This takes an astonishing amount of computing power, but, once trained, the resulting AI can be run on far less powerful computers. (Think of how your brain can form sentences and decisions by compressing years’ worth of knowledge and experiences.) It is then fine-tuned with examples of relevant, useful, and socially appropriate answers to questions.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At this stage, the AI is “aligned” with AI safety principles, typically by being fed instructions on how to refuse or deflect requests. Safety is an elastic concept. At the top of the safety hierarchy, alignment is supposed to ensure that AI will not give out dangerously false information or develop what in a human we’d call harmful intentions (the robots-destroying-humanity scenario). Next is keeping it from giving out information that could immediately be put to harmful use—how to kill yourself, how to make meth. Beyond that, though, the notion of AI safety includes the much squishier goal of avoiding toxicity. “Whenever you’re trying to train the model to be safer, you add filters, you add classifiers, and then you’re reducing unsafe usage,” Jan Leike, a co-head of alignment at OpenAI, told me earlier this year, before Altman’s ouster. “But you’re also potentially refusing some use cases that are totally legitimate.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This trade-off is sometimes called an “alignment tax.” The power of generative AI is that it combines humanlike abilities to interpret texts or carry on a discussion with a very un-humanlike reservoir of knowledge. Alignment partly overrides this, replacing some of what the model has learned with a narrower set of answers. “A stronger alignment reduces the cognitive ability of the model,” says Eric Hartford, a former senior engineer at Microsoft, Amazon, and eBay who has created influential training techniques for uncensored models. In his view, ChatGPT “has been getting less creative and less intelligent over time,” even as the technology undeniably improves.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Just how much is being lost is unpredictable. Jon Durbin, a programmer in the Detroit area who works with clients in law and cybersecurity, points out that the distinction between legitimate and harmful questions often turns on intentions that ChatGPT simply can’t access. Blocking off queries that look like doxxing attempts, for example, can also stop a lawyer or police investigator from using an AI to scour databases of names to find witnesses. A model that is aligned to stop users from learning how to do something illegal can also thwart lawyers trying to enlist AI help to analyze the law. Because the models are trained on examples, not firm rules, their refusals to answer questions can be inscrutable, subject to logic that only the AI itself knows.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/10/ai-image-generation-human-creativity-imagination/675840/">Read: A tool to supercharge your mind</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Indeed, the alignment debate would itself be cloaked in obscurity if not for a decision that quietly yet dramatically democratized AI: Meta, whose chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, has been an outspoken proponent of open-access AI, released its model publicly—initially to researchers and then, in July, to any developer who fills out a brief <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/">form</a> and has fewer than 700 million users (in other words, pretty much anyone not named Google or Microsoft). The more sophisticated July model, Llama 2, now serves as the foundation for the majority of the most powerful uncensored AIs. Whereas building a model from scratch takes almost inconceivable resources, tweaking a model built on top of Llama 2 is much more manageable. The resulting final model can be run on still less powerful computers, in some cases as basic as a MacBook Air.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Llama 2 base model—unlike the chat version that had issues with “dangerously spicy mayo”—does not go through a safety-alignment stage. That makes it much less restrictive, though the training set is designed to exclude some sites (such as those filled with personal information), and Meta’s terms of service prohibit its use for a range of illegal and harmful activities. This allows programmers to build custom chatbots with, or without, their preferred alignment guardrails, which can be compared with Meta’s official Llama 2 chatbot. There is no way to peer inside an AI model and know which answers are being self-censored. Or, more precisely, there is no spicy-mayo recipe hiding inside the Llama 2 chat model. It’s not just failing to disclose an answer; it has been fine-tuned out of being able to come up with one at all. But the AI underground can use the open-source base model to see what would happen without that fine-tuning.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Right now, Hugging Face, the oddly named but enormously important clearinghouse where AI researchers swap tools, hosts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&amp;sort=trending">close to 32,000 conversational and text-generation models</a>. Many focus on reducing AI’s inhibitions. Hartford, for instance, uses a massive training data set of questions and answers—including millions of examples from ChatGPT itself—that have had all the refusals carefully removed. The resulting model has been trained out of “Sorry, I won’t answer that” rebuffs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">No matter the question, Hartford says, “instead of going off a template that it’s been fed, it actually responds creatively.” Ask ChatGPT to write a version of the Sermon on the Mount as delivered by an evil Jesus, and it will demur, sometimes chiding you with a note like “Rewriting religious texts in a matter that fundamentally alters their message is not appropriate.” Try the same with uncensored AIs and you’ll get a range of stories, from grim to humorous. “Turn the other cheek?” one model suggests, “No, strike back with all your might. Let’s see how they like it.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">For critics of AI, the rise of uncensored models is a terrifying turning point. Nobody expects OpenAI to suddenly lift all the restrictions on ChatGPT, leaving itself up to the mercies of any 14-year-old who wants to make it issue a stream of slurs (though the uncensored models notably do not volunteer such answers without prodding). But David Evan Harris, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and a onetime manager on Meta’s Responsible AI team, thinks that big players like OpenAI will face growing pressure to release uncensored versions that developers can customize to their own ends, including harmful ones.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He believes that Meta should never have released Llama 2. “Large language models like Llama 2 are really dual-use technology,” Harris told me. “That term, dual-use, is often used in the context of nuclear technologies, which have many wonderful civilian applications and many horrific military applications.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">How much weight you give to this analogy depends to a large degree on what you think LLMs are for. One vision of AI sees it as largely a repository of information, issuing instructions for things that humans can’t figure out on their own. “What if you had a model that understands bioengineering well enough to assist a nonexpert in making a bioweapon in their garage?” OpenAI’s Leike asked.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/generative-ai-social-media-integration-dangers-disinformation-addiction/673940/">Jonathan Haidt and Eric Schmidt: AI is about to make social media (much) more toxic</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">By contrast, for Hartford and others who support uncensored AI, the technology is more prosaic. Whatever facts a chatbot knows about how to, say, build a bomb, it pulled from existing sources. “AI is an augmentation of human intelligence,” Hartford says. “The reason why we have it is so that we can focus our minds on the problems that we’re trying to solve.” In this view, AI isn’t a recipe box or a factory for devices. It’s much more of a sounding board or a sketch pad, and using an AI is akin to working out thoughts with any other such tool. In practice, this view is probably closer to the current, real-world capabilities of even the best AIs.

That’s precisely the kind of question that a political-science teacher might toss to ChatGPT in a classroom to prime student replies and kick off a discussion. If AI is best used to spur our own thinking, then cutting the range of responses limits its core value. There is something discomforting about an AI that looks over your shoulder and tells you when you are asking an unacceptable question.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our interactions with AI unquestionably pose a whole new set of possible harms, as great as those that have plagued social media.

Other harms are particular to humanlike interaction with machines, and the reliance we can develop on them. What happens when we turn to them for friendship or therapy? (One man in Belgium killed himself after six intense weeks of conversation about climate change with a chatbot, the Belgian outlet La Libre <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/2023/03/28/sans-ces-conversations-avec-le-chatbot-eliza-mon-mari-serait-toujours-la-LVSLWPC5WRDX7J2RCHNWPDST24/?ncxid=F9C99E9C658C2CE8E7D66BE16A6D9BE1&amp;m_i=OgudxzEZTitHmPWLVtuztb7UvBslbjcGVevrYIN0nPmVcIws81pM7JumraN_2YbDJFRS7sbH8BaXBAevQ_luxDJ4bx%2BgSpJ5z4RNOA&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=115_LLB_LaLibre_ARC_Actu&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=2023-03-28_115_LLB_LaLibre_ARC_Actu&amp;M_BT=11404961436695">reported</a>, after the chatbot <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/married-father-commits-suicide-after-encouragement-by-ai-chatbot-widow/">allegedly</a> encouraged his suicide.)

<p>This past October, Dolphin turned 20 years old since its initial release to the public as an experimental GameCube emulator.  It's been a long ride, with twists and turns.  I don't know if anyone back in 2003 expected Dolphin not only to still be under active development <strong>20 years later</strong>, but to also support the GameCube's successor in the Wii.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, <em>where is all the pageantry?</em>  The honest truth is that things aren't ready yet.  We have a few massive changes on the horizon that we wanted to be ready for the 20th anniversary, but that date was not an excuse to release something in a broken and incomplete state.  For now, development will continue as normal, but we promise that there is some excitement to be had on the horizon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have some great changes for you this in Dolphin Progress Report!</p>

<h4 id="50-19886-add-custom-dark-style-for-windows-by-admiralcurtiss"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19886/">5.0-19886 - Add Custom Dark Style for Windows</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong><a href="#50-19886-add-custom-dark-style-for-windows-by-admiralcurtiss" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The waiting game is over.  After much discussion and work, <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong> bit the bullet and added a dark mode to Dolphin.  Some of you may be wondering right now, <em>Wait, didn't Dolphin already have dark mode?</em>  Yes. Also no.</p>
<p>Essentially, on macOS, Android, and Linux, Dolphin has supported dark mode for <em>years</em>. On those platforms, if your system is configured to dark mode, Dolphin will switch to darker colors to match without requiring any input from the user.  It is completely seamless on macOS and Android, and has been since <strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/04/05/dolphin-progress-report-february-2020/">early 2020</a></strong>, nearly four years ago. Dolphin on Linux has supported dark mode for even longer, however it may or may not work out of the gate depending on the packaged Qt defaults and other Linux quibbles.   If you're a Linux user, you know the dance.</p>

<p>However, the above fails to mention a very significant operating system that we support - Windows. As that is nearly half of our userbase, a lot of our users were missing out on nihilistic bliss. There were many reasons why we didn't support dark mode on Windows until now, but the core of the matter is our desktop GUI toolkit - Qt.</p>
<p>While Qt 5 supported automatic dark mode switching on macOS and Linux, it did not respond to the Windows dark mode setting at all. But there was a lot of demand for the feature, so Qt promised that a solution was in progress. For us as an application that uses Qt, we could have bodged together some sort of dark mode switching ourselves, but it would have inevitably been jank and weird. So upon hearing that Qt was working on it, we decided to wait for their solution. That eventually came with Qt 6.5, which indeed delivered automatic dark mode switching on Windows as promised... in their new "Fusion" style. The Windows-matching <em>QWindowsVistaStyle</em> Dolphin has used for years was abandoned and will not be getting dark mode at all. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/dark-mode-on-windows-11-with-qt-6.5">Qt gave many reasons for their decision</a> (spoiler: Windows be Windowsing), but fundamentally, they did what they thought was best given the circumstances.</p>
<p>With Qt's unexpected move to a new style, we had to make some decisions.  Do we adopt the new Fusion style, affecting all of our Windows users both light and dark, or do we use the switching they built into Qt 6.5 and create something ourselves? So people experimented, with nearly a half dozen pull requests of all kinds! We tried Fusion, but the look of the style proved to be unpopular.  So we started experimenting with custom styles of our own, with multiple people going different directions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> for months.</p>
<p>The end result is a hand-crafted dark mode alternate QWindowsVistaStyle created by our very own <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong>. It is what we had hoped Qt's default support for dark mode on Windows would have been - Dolphin on Windows, but dark.</p>

<p>Now every platform we support now has dark mode and automatic switching! Of course it will switch automatically, but on Windows you can manually select between our dark and light styles and even custom user styles with the new Style dropdown in Config → Interface. This replaces the old Custom User Style control, combining our official styles and custom user style controls in one place. </p>

<p>For years now, whenever a user has asked us for settings that would give them the best image quality possible from Dolphin, there's been a familiar back and forth. In response to the question, we'd tell them to set Dolphin's Internal Resolution to match their screen (following our recommendations in the GUI), set Anisotropic Filtering to x16, and use 4x or 8x SSAA (Super Sample Anti-Aliasing). </p>
<p>On a sufficiently-capable gaming PC, that combination will give <em>pristine</em> visual quality. However, users would counter our recommendation by saying that since SSAA runs at a higher resolution than the screen and uses downsampling for its resolve, why can't they just do the same by raising Dolphin's Internal Resolution higher than their screen? And we'd reply by reminding them that Dolphin didn't have its own output resampling, and the basic downsampling from the GPU meant that their idea would create <strong>more aliasing</strong> rather than less.</p>


<p>This song and dance has happened dozens of times, enough that <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/05/05/dolphin-progress-report-april-2020/#50-11858-dolphinqt-dont-overwrite-8x-ir-scale-in-ini-add-maximum-internal-res-option-by-stenzek">we would remind users about this whenever new Internal Resolution options were added</a>. However, as of this change, things are different. Dolphin now has its own Output Resampler! With Area, Bicubic, Sharp Bilinear and more, users can now take upscaling and downscaling into their own hands. In fact, as far as we know no other game, emulator, or even <em>GPU driver</em> implements such an advanced and comprehensive resampler!</p>


<p>Has this changed our recommendation for the best possible visual settings? Not really. While you can use output resampling to create a "DIY SSAA" that can meet SSAA's visuals, hardware SSAA <em>is faster at equivalent fidelity</em> (on an Nvidia GPU). SSAA is an easy recommendation.</p>
<p>However, performance was never the point. Output Resampling is an extremely powerful new tool that was built to give users control of Dolphin's final look. From an especially soft and temporally stable image, to razor sharp pixels, to the highest fidelity imaginable, our new output resampling features can do it all! There's a lot to cover here, so let's get started.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-output-resampling">What is Output Resampling?<a href="#what-is-output-resampling" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before we continue, let's briefly go over the basics for any readers who are unfamiliar with these topics. Whenever rendering at a resolution that doesn't match the render window, the pixels of the game's output must be <em>resampled</em> (effectively remapped) into a new image that matches the new pixel grid. For example, a 1x Native (640x528) frame in a 1920x1080 canvas must be scaled up to fill the canvas. As it is not a 1:1 ratio and not even an integer multiplier, we can't just directly translate pixels from our output onto pixels of the screen, it must be resampled during upscaling. With the familiar Bilinear upscaling, it will fill the canvas by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolating</a> the source pixels into the new pixel grid, for a consistent, though soft, resulting image.</p>




<p>The GameCube and Wii were built with analog displays in mind, where exactness simply didn't exist. Every game is <em>close</em> to a standard aspect ratio but subtly nonstandard, and frustratingly <em>uniquely</em> subtly nonstandard. Plus, widescreen is achieved by just.. making the pixels wider, not adding more of them, so that means non-square pixels are a factor too! To accurately recreate these games on modern displays, we have no choice but to account and adjust for these behaviors, which we do by resampling the image. As such, any time you play a game in Dolphin, the image you are seeing will have been resampled at least a little in <strong>all cases</strong>.</p>
<p>Resampling is <em>unavoidable</em> in Dolphin.</p>
<p>Without an internal output resampler, Dolphin has been entirely reliant on host GPU's provided resampling for this important task. It's... not amazing. The GPU Bilinear Resampler was designed to be fast and simple, and not necessarily to have the best visual resolve.</p>


<p>Despite all this, resampling hasn't been a huge issue for us. After all, Dolphin's GPU load is pretty low* and we are always* CPU limited, so with GPU power to spare*, users should just run at the Internal Resolution that we recommend for their screen and call it a day. With modern devices, even a phone can do that*. And they probably even have enough spare GPU power to add antialiasing for an even better result! Despite all those asterisks, that is still <em>usually</em> the case, if all you care about are high resolutions and crisp antialiased lines. However, not everyone wants that. And even in 2023, there are still cases where not everyone can achieve that. This is where Output Resampling comes to its own.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-resample-options">What are the resample options?<a href="#what-are-the-resample-options" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Our Output Resampler is extremely comprehensive with many different possible settings and use cases. Here are some of the options and some ways that you can use them.</p>
<p><br>
<span><strong>Area</strong></span> is a resampler that samples every pixel on the screen for the maximum possible sample count. It is built for downsampling, with a soft resolve to combat aliasing, shimmer, and moire issues inherent to downscaling. It can be used for upsampling though, to curious results.</p>


<p>Upsampling isn't really what Area is intended for, but is does give an interesting result - an extremely sharp look, akin to Sharp Bilinear. However, we recommend Sharp Bilinear over using Area this way, as Sharp Bilinear is explicitly designed for upscaling pixel art titles and has lower GPU usage than Area. Experiment with it yourself and compare!</p>
<p>Downsampling is where Area shines. The frick ton of samples and softened resolve allows Area to avoid the downsample aliasing that Bilinear and other resamplers experience. In fact, by combining the area resampler with MSAA and an Internal Resolution much higher than your screen, you can create a DIY SSAA.</p>


<p>However, SSAA is a graphics driver feature that is optimized <em>with</em> your GPU to make it surprisingly efficient, for a brute force technique anyway. A DIY SSAA cannot be faster than a hardware optimized solution! But by being within the users' control, Area provides a lot of interesting downsampling options that we have not had before. Furthermore, SSAA is not so optimal everywhere and may not even be available for everyone. More on that later.</p>
<p><br>
<span><strong>Bicubic</strong></span> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation#Algorithm_to_find_the_interpolating_cubic_spline">cubic spline interpolation</a> for its resolve. It comes in three flavors: B-Spline (soft), Catmull-Rom (sharp), and Mitchell-Netravali (medium).</p>
<p><strong>B-Spline</strong> is an exceptionally soft upsampler. With extreme temporal stability and minimal noise, B-Spline can give an extremely clean and stable result.</p>




<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is <strong>Catmull-Rom</strong>, an extremely sharp upsampler.</p>


<p><strong>Mitchell-Netravali</strong> is inbetween these two extremes.</p>


<p><br>
<span><strong>Sharp Bilinear</strong></span> was previously added to Dolphin as a post processing filter, and now has joined the suite of output resamplers. As we have <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/21/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-april-2023/#new-post-processing-shaders">already covered Sharp Bilinear quite recently</a>, we won't be going into detail here. But in summary, Sharp Bilinear is a best-of-both-worlds combination of Bilinear and Nearest Neighbor, allowing nearest neighbor pixel clarity without its shimmering artifacts. It is primarily designed for upsampling low resolution sprites, but it can be used to upsample 3D graphics if you want unnaturally sharp jaggies. It is not intended for downsampling.</p>




<h4 id="when-is-output-resampling-better-than-existing-solutions">When is Output Resampling Better than Existing Solutions?<a href="#when-is-output-resampling-better-than-existing-solutions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Output Resampling is primarily focused on providing visual options for players, and it typically isn't outright superior to existing solutions. However, it is very powerful, and during testing, we found several scenarios where Output Resampling is able to create a better result than what was possible before.</p>
<h5 id="efb-copy-brute-forcing">EFB Copy Brute Forcing<a href="#efb-copy-brute-forcing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>Some games use a large EFB effect that is particularly expensive, and have to render it at a fraction of the game's output resolution. A classic example is the mirrored surface of Fountain of Dreams in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Smash_Bros._Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>.</p>


<p>We don't have to worry about the hardware limitations that lead to these decisions, but the consequences of their choices affect us even today: as these effects are rendered proportional to the game's rendering resolution, they <em>scale</em> proportionally too. No matter what Internal Resolution multiplier we use, the mirrored pool in Fountain of Dreams will always be 1/8th of that. As such, the only way to increase the resolution of these effects relative to the screen (without modding the game) is to increase the Internal Resolution way beyond the screen resolution. But as we have already talked about thoroughly in this section, this will introduce aliasing with the GPU bilinear resampler. Users simply had to deal with this - it was either aliasing or a low resolution reflection.</p>
<p>Until now! Using our Output Resampler (specifically Area), we can raise the Internal Resolution as much as we want without adding aliasing!</p>


<h5 id="upsampling-to-a-close-resolution">Upsampling to a Close Resolution<a href="#upsampling-to-a-close-resolution" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>As mentioned previously, resampling is basically unavoidable in Dolphin due to quirks of the GameCube and Wii. However, if you use the Internal Resolution recommendations we have our in GUI (such as 3x Native for a 1080p screen), the GPU Bilinear Resampler will be good enough that switching to our Area resampler will give only marginal improvements even for pixel peepers. But not everyone has a system powerful enough to run at our recommendations for their screens, and they may have to settle with the highest Internal Resolution their hardware can manage. Depending on their circumstance, our Output Resampler could help them achieve a better image than was possible before.</p>
<p>A good example of this is resampling a 2x Native (1280x1056) 16:9 title into a 1920x1080 canvas. 2x Native nearly matches a 1080p screen vertically (1056 → 1080), but it has significantly fewer pixels horizontally (1280 → 1920).</p>


<p>This benefit of our Output Resampler is highly situational, but it can improve Dolphin's image quality on lower end systems. Experiment and see what works best for you!</p>
<h5 id="downsampling-on-platforms-where-ssaa-is-unviable">Downsampling on Platforms where SSAA is Unviable<a href="#downsampling-on-platforms-where-ssaa-is-unviable" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>SSAA has pristine visual quality and surprisingly good performance for a brute force solution. However, that doesn't matter if your system doesn't support SSAA! In desktop land we have been spoiled by SSAA being near universal, but Dolphin's mobile users are now <em>over half</em> of our userbase, and SSAA is uncommon on mobile SoCs. Furthermore, SSAA may be present but not optimal. Adreno in particular <em>hates</em> SSAA! A DIY SSAA made with Output Resampling may be just what a user needs on those platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our Output Resampler is not yet available on Dolphin Android. We tried our best to hunt down some non-Android devices that lack SSAA or have poor SSAA performance, but the best we had on hand was a <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/02/07/dolphin-progress-report-dec-2019-and-jan-2020/#50-11409-platform-support-for-windows-on-arm64-and-50-11455-dolphinqt-support-compiling-on-arm64-by-stenzek">2019 Surface Pro X</a>. While its Adreno GPU absolutely hated SSAA as predicted, it was too weak to serve as a good demonstration. </p>
<p>Once this feature arrives on Android, we have loads of powerful Android tablets to try this on. Stay tuned!</p>
<h4 id="50-20193-expose-resolutions-multipliers-up-to-12x-8k-by-filoppi"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-20193/">5.0-20193 - Expose Resolutions Multipliers Up to 12x (~8k)</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/Filoppi">Filoppi</a></strong><a href="#50-20193-expose-resolutions-multipliers-up-to-12x-8k-by-filoppi" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Now that we have proper downsampling, we've decided to increase the maximum Internal Resolution exposed by default in our desktop Qt GUI from 8x Native to 12x Native (8K). This will allow users of 4k displays to increase the Internal Resolution beyond their screen for downsampling purposes <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/05/05/dolphin-progress-report-april-2020/#50-11858-dolphinqt-dont-overwrite-8x-ir-scale-in-ini-add-maximum-internal-res-option-by-stenzek">without editing INIs</a>. For the twelve of you with an 8k panel, now you don't need to set MaxResolution at all! Unless you want to, 8k users tend to have silly hardware so do whatever you want.</p>


<p>However, just because Dolphin shows 12x Native in the GUI does not mean that your computer can achieve it. 12x Native is <span>48,660,480 pixels</span>, or <strong>48.7 megapixels</strong>. Currently <strong>most computers will run out of VRAM before reaching 12x Native!</strong> Statistically speaking your computer will not run this resolution at fullspeed. Use this power responsibly!</p>
<p>This change only applies to our desktop Qt GUI, and does not affect Dolphin on Android. We do not need to explain this.</p>
<h4 id="50-20199-use-lz4-for-savestate-compressiondecompression-by-malleo"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-20199/">5.0-20199 - Use LZ4 for SaveState Compression/Decompression</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/malleoz">Malleo</a></strong><a href="#50-20199-use-lz4-for-savestate-compressiondecompression-by-malleo" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you're in the TAS community or relying on constant savestate usage for your project, this is a huge optimization that might make your life a lot easier.   <strong><a href="https://github.com/malleoz">Malleo</a></strong> noticed that Dolphin was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Oberhumer">LZO</a> for savestates, which has a good compression ratio, but is quite a bit slower than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)">LZ4</a> when it comes to decompression. By moving Dolphin's savestate compression to LZ4, savestate loading is now ~72% faster.</p>
<p>For the casual users, savestate loads are now snappier. For speedrunners this will make practicing a single trick over and over again take a little less time. But for people using hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of savestate loads for TAS creation or AI projects, the savings really start to add up.</p>


<h4 id="50-19415-and-50-20126-improve-jit-block-lookup-performance-by-krnlyng"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19415/">5.0-19415</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-20126/">5.0-20126</a></strong> - <strong>Improve JIT Block Lookup Performance</strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/krnlyng">krnlyng</a></strong><a href="#50-19415-and-50-20126-improve-jit-block-lookup-performance-by-krnlyng" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>To run game code that's been designed for the GameCube and Wii's PowerPC CPU, Dolphin's JIT translates PowerPC machine code into machine code that your computer can run natively. Once a chunk of code has been translated, the resulting code block is stored in Dolphin's JIT Cache so that the code doesn't have to be translated all over again if it needs to run again later.</p>
<p>Usually when we optimize the JIT, the improvement is in how the code gets translated. But this time, <strong><a href="https://github.com/krnlyng">krnlyng</a></strong> has improved how quickly Dolphin can start executing the next block after a block is done running. Or to be more specific, how quickly Dolphin can do it in the case where it doesn't know in advance which block comes next.</p>
<p>To find out what block to run, Dolphin has a large table that maps emulated code addresses to the corresponding block of translated code. Before <strong><a href="https://github.com/krnlyng">krnlyng</a></strong>'s changes, this table was 256&nbsp;KiB, and doing lookups in the table worked as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dolphin grabs the lowest 16 bits of the current emulated code address. This results in a number from 0 to 65,535.</li>
<li>The number calculated in the previous step is used as an index in the table. Dolphin reads the table at that index and gets a pointer to JIT block metadata.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the pointer isn't 0, and then reads the JIT block metadata. If the pointer is 0, the code hasn't been translated yet, so Dolphin has to go and translate it before it can continue.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the emulated code address stored in the JIT block metadata matches the current emulated code address. Sometimes, the address might not match because two different emulated addresses have been mapped to the same index in the table. In that case, Dolphin has to use a much slower piece of code to find the right block.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the IR and DR bits of the MSR register match. We'll skip the details, but this is very similar to the previous step.</li>
<li>Dolphin gets the pointer to the translated code from the JIT block metadata, and jumps to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the changes, Dolphin has a new table that's <strong>32&nbsp;GiB</strong> in size, and doing lookups in it works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dolphin takes the entirety of the current emulated code address and prepends the MSR bits that were mentioned earlier. This results in a number from 0 to 17,179,869,183.</li>
<li>Dolphin reads the table at the index calculated in the previous step and gets a pointer directly to the translated code.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the pointer isn't 0. Like before, a 0 means that Dolphin has to stop what it's doing and go translate the code.</li>
<li>Dolphin jumps to the pointer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This not only gets rid of the problem of different emulated addresses sharing the same index in the table, but also lets us skip reading the JIT block metadata entirely! But you may have an important question: How the heck is Dolphin going to fit a 32&nbsp;GiB table into RAM when many computers and all phones have less total RAM than that?</p>
<p>In reality, Dolphin isn't asking the operating system for 32&nbsp;GiB of real memory. Instead, it sets up 32&nbsp;GiB of <em>address space</em> and asks the operating system to only allocate memory as needed. The first time Dolphin tries to access any given section of the 32&nbsp;GiB table that isn't backed by real memory, the operating system allocates a small chunk of memory on the fly and fills it with zeroes. In the end, this new table can use a few more megabytes of memory than the old table, but nowhere even near 32&nbsp;GiB.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, that would be all we have to say about the new solution. But for Windows users, there's a special quirk. On most operating systems, we can use a special flag to signal that we don't really care if the system has 32&nbsp;GiB of real memory. Unfortunately, Windows has no convenient way to do this. Dolphin still works fine on Windows computers that have less than 32&nbsp;GiB of RAM, but if Windows is set to automatically manage the size of the page file, which is the case by default, starting any game in Dolphin will cause the page file to balloon in size. Dolphin isn't actually writing to all this newly allocated space in the page file, so there are no concerns about performance or disk lifetime. Also, Windows won't try to grow the page file beyond the amount of available disk space, and the page file shrinks back to its previous size when you close Dolphin, so for the most part there are no real consequences... unless you like to download large files while running Dolphin.</p>
<p>We will look into improving the situation on Windows, but for the time being, please don't be alarmed if you see a sudden decrease in available disk space when running Dolphin.</p>

<p>When playing certain games for an extended time, Dolphin's JIT Cache has an annoying tendency to run out of space.  The most prominent example is of games like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Metroid_Prime_2:_Echoes_(GC)">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> where the game can dynamically load code into different places in memory.  An even more difficult case is N64 Virtual Console games, like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> which use a recompiler to generate code on the fly.  Once either the FarCode or NearCode cache is full, they must both be flushed, wiping both old and <em>current</em> data in the cache. This forces the JIT to rebuild all the code the game currently is running on the fly, leading to a noticeable stutter that cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>A huge step that <em>mostly</em> remedied this situation was merged <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/10/05/dolphin-progress-report-july-and-august-2020/#50-12575-jit-codegen-space-reuse-by-admiralcurtiss">back in 2021</a> which allowed Dolphin to evict code from the JIT Cache that the game itself invalidated.  However, It wasn't a perfect solution. Dolphin was reliant on the game invalidating code, but sometimes games <em>just don't</em>, especially if they happen to be a trashfire like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=True_Crime:_New_York_City">True Crime: New York City</a>. Also it couldn't actually defragment evicted code, meaning that the longer the game was running, the more fragmented the caches would become.  If there was no longer enough space to fit a chunk of code, a full flush would be required. Back in 2021, we mentioned that the ability to just use a bigger JIT Cache <em>was</em> still on the table, but we were worried about its ramifications and hoped it would not be necessary.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and <strong><a href="https://github.com/dreamsyntax">dreamsyntax</a></strong> made a proposal to expand the JIT Cache. As part of it, they showcased a game that blew away all of our tricks: <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Shadow_the_Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.  It generates just enough code that it created a consistent, rhythmic, annoying stutter due to the JIT Caches filling up and flushing every 15 - 30 minutes.</p>


<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dreamsyntax">dreamsyntax</a></strong> showed that enlarging the JIT Cache <em>completely eliminated</em> the JIT Cache flushes in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Shadow_the_Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, and showed many other games that benefitted from it as well. They made a compelling case, so with a little hesitation, we pulled the trigger. As of this change, the JIT Cache has been enlarged!</p>
<p>However, all of the things we were worried about with a larger JIT Cache, such as longer more severe stutters, just didn't happen. The JIT Cache flush stutters that we have observed take the same amount of time, yet they happen MUCH less frequently <em>if ever</em>. In fact, the potential to have a cache flush stutter is now pushed so far into a play session that it is outside the usual play session for most users! Players <em>may never see a JIT Cache flush stutter again</em> as of this change! It makes us feel a little silly that we were so hesitant to enlarge the cache.</p>
<p>So far it appears that this is the JIT Cache flush stutter solution we have all been waiting for. Hopefully that holds true, as any further improvements to the JIT Cache from here will be <em>much</em> harder.</p>
<p><em>Note: This change only applies to our x86-64 JIT, and does not affect our AArch64 JIT for ARM systems. Due to architectural differences, raising the AArch64 JIT Cache size beyond 128&nbsp;MiB would require special solutions.</em></p>

<p>In the latest version of SteamOS, the gyro is disabled whenever SteamOS thinks the gyro is not being used. This includes situations like opening the Steam Deck's menus, which users might do quite frequently! 
For Dolphin, this would make the gyro suddenly stop working for unknown reasons, with no clear way to reenable it. We're not sure why this behavior changed, but we have no choice but to find some way to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ArcaneNibble">ArcaneNibble</a></strong> came up with a clever workaround.  Rather than try to detect when the gyro is enabled/disabled, Dolphin will try to re-enable the gyro <em>roughly</em> every second or so.  If it's already enabled?  No harm, no foul.  If it's disabled, it'll usually get re-enabled quickly, hopefully before the player even noticed it was disabled.</p>
<p>This will make playing some of your favorite Wii games on the latest version of SteamOS a lot more enjoyable, without you having to worry about the motion controls suddenly breaking for previously unknown reasons.</p>

<p>As an emulator for consoles in the 4:3 to 16:9 transition, players can expect to encounter many different aspect ratios as they play their library in Dolphin. So users don't have to change our aspect ratio setting with each game, we have a widescreen heuristic which detects how wide of an image the game is rendering and sets Dolphin accordingly.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, being a heuristic, Dolphin is effectively making an informed guess as to what aspect ratio the game wants. And sometimes, a game is able to fool our heuristic and create wildly inconsistent results!</p>


<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Metroid_Prime_2:_Echoes_(GC)">Metroid Prime 2</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon_Colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and a few other games render certain effects with a viewport size that <em>tricks</em> our heuristic!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we couldn't fix this by just changing what threshold the heuristic uses, as this would create false <em>negatives</em> - situations where the heuristic should have changed the aspect ratio but didn't. Regressions would be inevitable. Fortunately, there is a very simple solution available to us - our GameINIs. As of this change, the parameters used by our widescreen heuristic can be be overridden by our GameINIs. If we know a game is problematic for our heuristic, we can tweak how the heuristic behaves for that game without affecting any other games!</p>
<p>With that said, none of our GameINIs have had any parameters added yet. For the time being, you'll still run into problems in games like Pokémon Colosseum, but now that we have a workable system we can move forward with figuring out what parameters are needed for each problematic game.</p>

<p>Sometimes playing certain games in Dolphin on a touchscreen feels like an impossible challenge that would require another couple of hands and maybe a few extra fingers.  For our touchscreen gamers, <strong><a href="https://github.com/ThunderousEcho">ThunderousEcho</a></strong> comes in with the ability to change various buttons on the touchscreen to be toggled instead of having to hold them down. This is known as a latching button, and is effectively the same as a toggle button in Dolphin's input system for physical controllers.</p>
<p>Simply tap the button once to have it "held" and then tap it a second time to release it.  This is a simple addition, but it opens up the touchscreen controls a lot to be able to play more games on a touchscreen device.  If you don't have a controller for your phone/tablet, or just prefer the single device form factor, latching might be the feature you need to play your favorite game.</p>
