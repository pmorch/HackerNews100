            <guid>46739078</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:51:41 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/">https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-new-privacy-policy/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46739078">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>When TikTok users</span> in the US opened the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/apps/">app</a> today, they were greeted with a pop-up asking them to agree to the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/social-media/">social media</a> platform’s new terms of service and privacy policy before they could resume scrolling.</p><p>These changes are part of TikTok’s transition to new ownership. In order to continue operating in the US, <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/tiktok/">TikTok</a> was compelled by the US government to transition from <a href="https://www.wired.com/china-issue/">Chinese control</a> to a new, American-majority corporate entity. Called TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, the new entity is made up of a group of investors that includes the software company <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/oracle/">Oracle</a>.</p><p>It's easy to tap Agree and keep on <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/no-the-freecash-app-wont-pay-you-to-scroll-tiktok/">scrolling through videos</a> on TikTok, so users might not fully understand the extent of changes they are agreeing to with this pop-up.</p><p>Now that it’s under US-based ownership, TikTok potentially collects more detailed information about its users, including precise location data. A spokesperson for TikTok USDS declined to comment.</p><p>Here are the three biggest changes to <a data-offer-url="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en&quot;}" href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/us/privacy-policy/en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TikTok’s privacy policy</a> that users should know about.</p><h2>TikTok Adds Precise Location Tracking</h2><p>TikTok’s change in <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/location/">location tracking</a> is one of the most notable updates in this new privacy policy. Before this update, the app did not collect the precise, GPS-derived location data of US users. Now, if you give TikTok permission to use your phone’s location services, then the app may collect granular information about your exact whereabouts. Similar kinds of precise location data is also tracked by other social media apps, like <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> and X.</p><p><strong>Old Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>We collect information about your approximate location, including location information based on your SIM card and/or IP address. In addition, we collect location information (such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest) if you choose to add the location information to your User Content. Current versions of the app do not collect precise or approximate GPS information from US users.</em></p><p><strong>New Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including</em> ... l<em>ocation information about your approximate location based on your device and network information, such as SIM card region, IP address, and device system settings. We also collect information, such as tourist attractions, shops, or other points of interest, if you choose to add the location to your user content. Also, if you choose to enable location services for the TikTok app within your device settings, we collect approximate or precise location information from your device.</em></p><h2>TikTok Now Tracks AI Interactions</h2><p>Rather than an adjustment, TikTok’s policy on AI interactions adds a new topic to the privacy policy document. Now, users' interactions with any of TikTok’s AI tools explicitly fall under data that the service may collect and store. This includes any prompts as well as the <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/">AI-generated</a> outputs. The metadata attached to your interactions with AI tools may also be automatically logged.</p><p><strong>Old Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>(These AI interactions are not explicitly mentioned in the past policy.)</em></p><p><strong>New Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>When you create an account, upload content, contact us directly, or otherwise use the Services, you may provide some or all of the following information … AI interactions, including prompts, questions, files, and other types of information that you submit to our AI-powered interfaces, as well as the responses they generate.</em></p><p><em>We automatically collect certain information from you when you use the Services, including … metadata that is automatically uploaded in connection with your user content, messages, or AI interactions, such as how, when, where, and by whom the user content was created, or message or prompt was sent. Metadata may also include information, such as your username, that enables your user content to be traced back to your account by other users.</em></p><h2>TikTok Expands Its Ads Network</h2><p>This change to TikTok’s privacy policy may not be as immediately noticeable to users, but it will likely have an impact on the types of ads you see outside of TikTok. So, rather than just using your collected data to target you while using the app, TikTok may now further leverage that info to serve you more relevant ads wherever you go online. As part of this advertising change, TikTok also now explicitly mentions publishers as one kind of partner the platform works with to get new data.</p><p><strong>Old Privacy Policy:</strong></p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>Advertisers, measurement, and other partners share information with us about you and the actions you have taken outside of the Platform, such as your activities on other websites and apps or in stores, including the products or services you purchased, online or in person. These partners also share information with us, such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help match you and your actions outside of the Platform with your TikTok account.</em></p><p><strong>New Privacy Policy:</strong></p><p><em>Advertisers, publishers, and measurement and other partners provide us with information about you and the actions you have taken outside of our websites and apps, including the pages you visit, products or services you purchase, and apps you download. These partners also provide information such as mobile identifiers for advertising, hashed email addresses and phone numbers, and cookie identifiers, which we use to help measure the effectiveness of ads we serve and to better deliver ads to you on our websites and apps, or through TikTok Ad Network elsewhere online, depending on your ads settings.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>No Tesla sales in California</h2>
<p>Tesla was told that if it couldn’t resolve the deceptive marketing within those 60 days, the sales suspension would take effect. That would be bad for the automaker, as California is far and away its largest market in the US, albeit <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/tesla-lost-the-most-share-last-year-in-ev-stronghold-california">one that </a><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-22/tesla-lost-the-most-share-last-year-in-ev-stronghold-california" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shrinking</a>&nbsp;each quarter. Having to suspend sales entirely in the state would be disastrous. Some had speculated that Tesla could change Autopilot’s name to something less misleading, but the company chose a more drastic approach.</p>
<p>Now, if you want your new Tesla to steer itself—while you pay attention to the road—you will have to pay for FSD. Until the middle of February, that can be done for a one-time fee of $8,000. But starting on February 14, that option goes away, too, and the sole choice will be a $99/month FSD subscription.</p>
<p>But probably not for very long. Last night, Musk <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/2014539856890716418?s=20">revealed on his social media platform</a> that “the $99/month for supervised FSD will rise as FSD’s capabilities improve. The massive value jump is when you can be on your phone or sleeping for the entire ride (unsupervised FSD).”</p>
<p>The quest for recurring revenue streams is becoming something of a holy grail in the automotive industry as OEMs that previously treated their customers as a single sale now hope to make themselves more attractive to investors by encouraging customers to give them regular payouts.</p>
<p>This may have contributed to General Motors’ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/gm-kills-more-than-carplay-support-it-kills-choice/">decision to drop Apple CarPlay and Android Automotive</a>. BMW has also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/12/bmw-does-about-face-drops-carplay-subscription-requirement/">experimented</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/bmw-ditches-subscriptions-for-heated-seats-other-hardware-features/">subscription services</a>. Tesla’s stock price remains so high that such games are probably unnecessary here, but with falling profit margins, declining sales, and the loss of emissions credits to bolster the bottom line, one can see why regular cash infusions from Tesla drivers would be desirable.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="issue-body-viewer" data-team-hovercards-enabled="true" data-turbolinks="false" id="issue-body-viewer"><h3 dir="auto">Preflight Checklist</h3>
<ul>
<li> I have searched <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Abug">existing issues</a> and this hasn't been reported yet</li>
<li> This is a single bug report (please file separate reports for different bugs)</li>
<li> I am using the latest version of Claude Code</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="auto">What's Wrong?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Auto-compact doesn't work. Anthropic flagged this as fixed on January 15, but the issue persists. When context window fills up, instead of auto-compacting and continuing the conversation, one of two things happens:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Messages get bounced back to the input box with no error (most common).</li>
<li>Occasionally, a "limit reached" error appears.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This happens even when the context being fed the chat shouldn't be anywhere near the 200k token limit.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">What Should Happen?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Auto-compact should trigger automatically when approaching context limits, allowing the conversation to continue without manual intervention.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Error Messages/Logs</h3>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Usually none; message just silently returns to input box.
Occasionally &quot;limit reached&quot; error."><pre>Usually none<span>;</span> message just silently returns to input box.
Occasionally <span><span>"</span>limit reached<span>"</span></span> error.</pre></div>
<h3 dir="auto">Steps to Reproduce</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Create a new chat within a Claude.ai project (mine is ~3% capacity).</li>
<li>Feed it a substantial amount of context (documents, instructions, etc.).</li>
<li>Continue chatting until context builds up.</li>
<li>Attempt to send another message.</li>
<li>Message gets returned to input box OR "limit reached" error appears.</li>
<li>Auto-compact never triggers.</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="auto">Claude Model</h3>
<p dir="auto">Not sure / Multiple models</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Is this a regression?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Yes, this worked in a previous version</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Last Working Version</h3>
<p dir="auto">Claude.ai (web/desktop) worked prior to January 14 major outage and January 15 compaction incident. Broken since.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Claude Code Version</h3>
<p dir="auto">N/A</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Platform</h3>
<p dir="auto">Other</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Operating System</h3>
<p dir="auto">Windows</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Terminal/Shell</h3>
<p dir="auto">Other</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Additional Information</h3>
<p dir="auto">Issue was reported previously and marked as resolved January 15. Still broken as of January 17.<br>
Happens within Projects, unsure if it affects non-Project chats.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> Submitting here because there's no dedicated bug tracker for Claude.ai. This affects the web and desktop interfaces, not Claude Code specifically. Auto-compact was functional before the January 14 outage and has remained broken despite being flagged as fixed on January 15.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>46735616</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:05:08 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-8/">https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-8/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46735616">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-2674">
						<p>We’re excited to announce our latest major release, Zotero 8. Zotero 8 builds on the new design and features of <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/">Zotero 7</a> and includes a huge number of improvements and refinements.</p>
<h2 id="redesign-citation-dialog">Redesigned Citation Dialog</h2>
<p>Zotero 8 introduces a new unified citation dialog, replacing the previous citation dialog (the “red bar”), the “classic” citation dialog, and the Add Note dialog (the “yellow bar”).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.zotero.org/static/images/blog/8.0/citation-dialog-list.png" width="840"></p>
<p>The new dialog has two modes: List mode and Library mode. List mode lets you quickly search for citations from across your Zotero libraries by title, creator, and year. Library mode includes a library browser, letting you find items in specific libraries or collections. You can switch between the two modes with a single click, preserving any added items or entered search terms. By default, it will open in the last mode you used, but you can choose a different default mode in the settings.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.zotero.org/static/images/blog/8.0/citation-dialog-library.png" width="840"></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/zotero-7/">Zotero 7</a>, we added the ability to quickly add citations for selected items and open documents. In the new dialog, these options are available in both List mode and Library mode, so you can make these quick selections even if you otherwise prefer to add items via the library browser.</p>
<p>As before, once you’ve selected an item, you can click on its bubble to customize the citation with a page number, prefix, etc. It’s also now possible to add any locator — not just a page number — right from the search bar by typing the full or short name (e.g., “line 10” or “l. 10” after the citation and pressing Enter/Return.</p>
<p>You can switch between adding citations and adding notes using buttons in the bottom left, corresponding to the Add/Edit Citation and Add Note buttons in your word processor.</p>
<p>(For those coming from the classic dialog, note that there’s no text field to make manual edits to citations. It’s been possible to edit citations directly in the document for many years, which is why the red bar didn’t include such a text field either. More importantly, though, such manual edits should be avoided in almost all cases. Instead, <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_plugin_usage#customizing_cites">customize the citation</a> via the citation dialog, which will allow Zotero to continue to update the citation as necessary.)</p>
<h2 id="annotations-in-the-items-list">Annotations in the Items List</h2>
<p>Annotations you make on PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots now show up under their parent attachments in the items list.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.zotero.org/static/images/blog/8.0/annotations-in-the-items-list.png" width="840"></p>
<p>Showing annotations in the items list makes it easier to view annotations across a library or collection, and it also makes it possible to search for annotations directly. For example, you can search for all annotations in a collection with a given tag and then create a note from those annotations or copy them to an external text editor with Quick Copy.</p>
<p>In Advanced Search, you can use “Item Type” “is” “Annotation” to match annotations or use the Annotation Text and Annotation Comment search conditions to search for specific parts of the annotation.</p>
<p>You can assign tags to selected annotations by dragging them to the tag selector, just like other items.</p>
<p>Selected annotations show up in the item pane, grouped by top-level item.</p>
<h2 id="reader-appearance-panel-with-theme-support">Reader Appearance Panel with Theme Support</h2>
<p>We’ve added a new Appearance panel in the reader that provides quick access to view settings and introduces support for reader themes.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.zotero.org/static/images/blog/8.0/appearance-panel.png" alt="Panel coming down from reader toolbar with options such as Scrolling, Spreads, and Split View and a Themes section showing Original, Dark, Snow, and Sepia themes plus a plus button" width="365" height="330"></p>
<p>The view settings are per-document settings. Themes are applied globally for all documents, including in the attachment preview in the item pane, and apply to PDFs, EPUBs, and webpage snapshots.</p>
<p>We offer a number of built-in themes (“Dark”, “Snow”, “Sepia”), and you can create custom themes just by specifying a foreground and background color. (Some other theme engines require additional accent colors, but we’ve tried to make this as simple as possible for users by automatically adjusting other colors based on the foreground and background colors.) You can set a different theme that applies to light mode and dark mode.</p>
<p>The themes replace the previous on-by-default “Use Dark Mode for Content” option, which inverted images in dark mode. We’re now simply darkening images a bit when using a dark theme. Images and ink annotations in the reader sidebar and note editor are now only darkened as well (and only when Zotero itself is in dark mode).</p>
<p>When possible, we also try to apply themes to PDF pages containing full-page images, such as scanned papers, by replacing whitish/dark colors with theme colors. (Otherwise we simply darken the page slightly.)</p>
<h2 id="note-tabs">Note Tabs</h2>
<p>It’s now possible to open notes in tabs in addition to separate windows. Note tabs fill the whole window, with wide margins for better readability and a clean, distraction-free space for note-taking.</p>
<p>By default, double-clicking a note in the items list will open it in a tab. You can choose to open the note in the other space from the context menu, and you can change the default behavior using the “Open notes in new windows instead of tabs” setting in the General pane of the settings.</p>
<p>Notes in tabs have a separate font size setting in the View menu.</p>
<h2 id="reading-mode-for-webpage-snapshots">Reading Mode for Webpage Snapshots</h2>
<p>Reading Mode reformats webpage snapshots for easier reading, with unnecessary page elements removed. You can adjust line height and other view options from the Appearance panel.</p>

<p>We’ve reworked the tabs menu to make it faster to interact with via the keyboard.</p>
<p>You can now press Ctrl/Cmd-; to bring up the menu at any time.</p>
<p>Once the menu is open, it simultaneously accepts search input, up/down navigation, and row selection, without the need to move between different parts of the menu. You can simply start typing the name of an open tab and then press Enter/Return to switch to it once you’ve narrowed down the list.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to quickly close multiple tabs by moving between the row close buttons with up/down and pressing space bar to close a tab.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-file-renaming">Continuous File Renaming</h2>
<p>Zotero now automatically keeps attachment filenames in sync with parent item metadata as you make changes (e.g., changing the title). In previous versions, while Zotero would automatically rename files when you first added them to your library, if you later edited the item’s metadata, you would need to right-click on the attachment and select “Rename File from Parent Metadata”.</p>
<p>You can configure which file types renaming applies to from the General tab of the Zotero settings.</p>
<p>After upgrading to this version, existing eligible files that don’t match the current filename format won’t be automatically renamed, but you can choose to rename them en masse from the Zotero settings. Zotero will also prompt you to rename all files if you change the filename format.</p>
<p>“Rename File from Parent Metadata” has been removed from the item context menu. If a filename doesn’t match the configured filename format (e.g., because automatic renaming is disabled or you changed the format but didn’t choose to rename all files), you can click the “Rename File to Match Parent Item” button next to the filename in the attachment’s item pane to rename it.</p>
<h2 id="new-attachment-title-options">New Attachment Title Options</h2>
<p>Zotero 7 introduced more consistent handling of <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/attachment_title_vs_filename">attachment titles</a>, preserving simpler, less-redundant titles (e.g., “Full Text PDF” or “Preprint PDF”) in cases where the title was previously changed to match the filename. Zotero 8 further refines its renaming and titling logic when adding multiple and/or non-primary attachments, to bring the functionality better in line with the intended behavior.</p>
<p>We’ve also added a “Normalize Attachment Titles” option under Tools → Manage Attachments to update old primary attachments with titles matching the filename to use simpler titles such as “PDF”.</p>
<p>While we recommend the default behavior, allowing Zotero to rename primary files and keep them renamed while using simpler titles in the items list, if you really prefer to view filenames instead of titles, you can now enable “Show attachment filenames in the items list” option in the General pane of the settings.</p>
<h2 id="arm-linux-support">ARM Linux Support</h2>
<p>Zotero 8 adds a version for Linux running on ARM64 devices. This includes ARM-based Chromebooks, Apple Silicon Macs running Linux (Linux VMs, Asahi Linux), and Raspberry Pis.</p>
<p>If you’ve been unable to run Zotero on your ARM-based device, or you’ve been running the x86_64 version under emulation, give it a try.</p>
<h2 id="user-interface-improvements">User Interface Improvements</h2>
<p>We’ve made a number of changes across the interface to address common requests:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new button in the library tab allows you to quickly close the item pane without dragging its edge or using the menus.</li>
<li>You can reorder item pane sections by dragging their icons in the side navigation bar.</li>
<li>You can drag items, collections, and searches into the trash.</li>
<li>You can drag attachments, notes, and related items from the item pane (e.g., to copy files to the filesystem or use Quick Copy).</li>
<li>Collections automatically expand when you drag over them, making it easier to drop collections or items into subcollections.</li>
<li>You can delete attachments from the item pane.</li>
<li>Tabs maintain their size as you close them for faster closing of multiple tabs.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tag-autocomplete-and-note-field-in-zotero-connector">Tag Autocomplete and Note Field in Zotero Connector</h2>
<p>With Zotero 8, the Zotero Connector save popup can autocomplete tags in your Zotero library and allows you to add a note to items as you save them.</p>
<h2>And Much More</h2>
<p>Zotero 8 includes much more than we can list here. See the <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/8.0_changelog">changelog</a> for additional details.</p>
<h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>
<p>Zotero 8 requires macOS 10.15 or later, Windows 10 or later, or a <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/140.0/system-requirements/#gnulinux">Firefox 140–compatible</a> Linux system.</p>
<h2>Faster Future Releases</h2>
<p>Going forward, we’re changing how we put out Zotero releases. Read about <a href="https://www.zotero.org/blog/a-faster-release-cycle-for-zotero">Zotero’s new release schedule</a>.</p>

<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft provided the FBI with the recovery keys to unlock encrypted data on the hard drives of three laptops as part of a federal investigation, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2026/01/22/microsoft-gave-fbi-keys-to-unlock-bitlocker-encrypted-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forbes reported on Friday</a>.</p>

<p>Many modern Windows computers rely on full-disk encryption, called BitLocker, which is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220138/microsoft-bitlocker-device-encryption-windows-11-default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enabled by default</a>. This type of technology should prevent anyone except the device owner from accessing the data if the computer is locked and powered off.&nbsp;</p>







<p>But, by default, BitLocker recovery keys are uploaded to Microsoft’s cloud, allowing the tech giant — and by extension law enforcement — to access them and use them to decrypt drives encrypted with BitLocker, as with the case reported by Forbes.</p>

<p>The case involved several people suspected of fraud related to the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program in Guam, a U.S. island in the Pacific. Local news outlet Pacific Daily News <a href="https://www.guampdn.com/news/another-unsealed-warrant-encrypted-data-seized-in-pua-fraud-investigation/article_1b98b770-daf5-436a-97f9-3a11f57accf5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">covered</a> the case last year, reporting that a warrant had been served to Microsoft in relation to the suspects’ hard drives. Kandit News, another local Guam news outlet, <a href="https://kanditnews.com/3rd-warrant-against-tenorio-unsealed-encrypted-computer-files-seized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also reported</a> in October that the FBI requested the warrant six months after seizing the three laptops encrypted with BitLocker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment by TechCrunch. Microsoft told Forbes that the company sometimes provides BitLocker recovery keys to authorities, having received an average of 20 such requests per year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from the privacy risks of handing recovery keys to a company, Johns Hopkins professor and cryptography expert Matthew Green <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vciumvk2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">raised the potential scenario</a> where malicious hackers compromise Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure — something that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/microsoft-lost-keys-government-hacked/">has happened</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/19/hackers-breached-microsoft-to-find-out-what-microsoft-knows-about-them/">several times</a> in recent years — and get access to these recovery keys. The hackers would still need physical access to the hard drives to use the stolen recovery keys.</p>

<p>“It’s 2026 and these concerns have been known for years,” Green wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewdgreen.bsky.social/post/3md3vnprijk2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on Bluesky</a>. “Microsoft’s inability to secure critical customer keys is starting to make it an outlier from the rest of the industry.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2026-01-23</p><section><p>6 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6xCUVyJD77uApQnstN3KmC/99c33fbd46f0e33009c39be4c98cdf12/image2.png" alt=""><div><p>On January 22, 2026, an automated routing policy configuration error caused us to leak some <a href="https://cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"><u>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</u></a> prefixes unintentionally from a router at our data center in Miami, Florida. While the route leak caused some impact to Cloudflare customers, multiple external parties were also affected because their traffic was accidentally funnelled through our Miami data center location.</p><p>The route leak lasted 25 minutes, causing congestion on some of our backbone infrastructure in Miami, elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency for traffic across these links. Additionally, some traffic was discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers.</p><p>While we’ve written about route leaks before, we rarely find ourselves causing them. This route leak was the result of an accidental misconfiguration on a router in Cloudflare’s network, and only affected IPv6 traffic. We sincerely apologize to the users, customers, and networks we impacted yesterday as a result of this BGP route leak.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="bgp-route-leaks">BGP route leaks&nbsp;</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>We have <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-verizon-and-a-bgp-optimizer-knocked-large-parts-of-the-internet-offline-today/"><u>written multiple times</u></a> about <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-1111-incident-on-june-27-2024/"><u>BGP route leaks</u></a>, and we even record <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/route-leak-detection-with-cloudflare-radar/"><u>route leak events</u></a> on Cloudflare Radar for anyone to view and learn from. To get a fuller understanding of what route leaks are, you can refer to this <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-route-leak-venezuela/#background-bgp-route-leaks"><u>detailed background section</u></a>, or refer to the formal definition within <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7908"><u>RFC7908</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, a route leak occurs when a network tells the broader Internet to send it traffic that it's not supposed to forward. Technically, a route leak occurs when a network, or Autonomous System (AS), appears unexpectedly in an AS path. An AS path is what BGP uses to determine the path across the Internet to a final destination. An example of an anomalous AS path indicative of a route leak would be finding a network sending routes received from a peer to a provider.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/30z4NDtf6DjVQZOfZatGUX/6ff06eb02c61d8e818d9da8ecd87c1c8/BLOG-3135_2.png" alt="BLOG-3135 2" width="1724" height="704" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>During this type of route leak, the rules of <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sylvia/cs268-2019/papers/gao-rexford.pdf"><u>valley-free routing</u></a> are violated, as BGP updates are sent from AS64501 to their peer (AS64502), and then unexpectedly up to a provider (AS64503). Oftentimes the leaker, in this case AS64502, is not prepared to handle the amount of traffic they are going to receive and may not even have firewall filters configured to accept all of the traffic coming in their direction. In simple terms, once a route update is sent to a peer or provider, it should only be sent further to customers and not to another peer or provider AS.</p><p>During the incident on January 22, we caused a similar kind of route leak, in which we took routes from some of our peers and redistributed them in Miami to some of our peers and providers. According to the route leak definitions in RFC7908, we caused a mixture of Type 3 and Type 4 route leaks on the Internet.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>On January 22, 2026, at 20:25 UTC, we pushed a change via our policy automation platform to remove the BGP announcements from Miami for one of our data centers in Bogotá, Colombia. This was purposeful, as we previously forwarded some IPv6 traffic through Miami toward the Bogotá data center, but recent infrastructure upgrades removed the need for us to do so.</p><p>This change generated the following diff (a program that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=3236b0192813a1a3&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1183US1183&amp;sxsrf=ANbL-n4_5E8v7Ar8tpKKnczz7xfci6HL8w:1769145786825&amp;q=compares&amp;si=AL3DRZGCrnAF0R35UNPJcgaBbCFaNwxQEU_o22EUn2GaHpSR2UyenaROnahi_5cmhKmzHjtezT-J9hw3KLJeTkLeyo7_nJgoJebLkbDRWvoJl5t5oX8bAPI%3D&amp;expnd=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiW1bfR9aCSAxXaOjQIHSIBDMoQyecJegQIKhAR">compares</a> configuration files in order to determine how or whether they differ):</p>

            <p>While this policy change looks innocent at a glance, only removing the prefix lists containing BOG04 unicast prefixes resulted in a policy that was too permissive:</p>
            <pre><code>policy-options policy-statement 6-TELIA-ACCEPT-EXPORT {
    term ADV-SITELOCAL-GRE-RECEIVER {
        from route-type internal;
        then {
            community add STATIC-ROUTE;
            community add SITE-LOCAL-ROUTE;
            community add MIA01;
            community add NORTH-AMERICA;
            accept;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>The policy would now mark every prefix of type “internal” as acceptable, and proceed to add some informative communities to all matching prefixes. But more importantly, the policy also accepted the route through the policy filter, which resulted in the prefix — which was intended to be “internal” —&nbsp; being advertised externally. This is an issue because the “route-type internal” match in JunOS or JunOS EVO (the operating systems used by <a href="https://www.hpe.com/us/en/home.html"><u>HPE Juniper Networks</u></a> devices) will match any non-external route type, such as Internal BGP (IBGP) routes, which is what happened here.</p><p>As a result, all IPv6 prefixes that Cloudflare redistributes internally across the backbone were accepted by this policy, and advertised to all our BGP neighbors in Miami. This is unfortunately very similar to the outage we experienced in 2020, on which you can read more <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-july-17-2020/"><u>on our blog</u></a>.</p><p>When the policy misconfiguration was applied at 20:25 UTC, a series of unintended BGP updates were sent from AS13335 to peers and providers in Miami. These BGP updates are viewable historically by looking at MRT files with the <a href="https://github.com/bgpkit/monocle"><u>monocle</u></a> tool or using <a href="https://stat.ripe.net/bgplay/2a03%3A2880%3Af312%3A%3A%2F48#starttime=1769112000&amp;endtime=1769115659&amp;instant=56,1769113845"><u>RIPE BGPlay</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><sup><i>In the monocle output seen above, we have the timestamp of our BGP update, followed by the next-hop in the announcement, the ASN of the network feeding a given route-collector, the prefix involved, and the AS path and BGP communities if any are found. At the end of the output per-line, we also find the route-collector instance.</i></sup></p><p>Looking at the first update for prefix 2a03:2880:f077::/48, the AS path is <i>64112 22850 174 3356 13335 32934</i>. This means we (AS13335) took the prefix received from Meta (AS32934), our peer, and then advertised it toward Lumen (AS3356), one of our upstream transit providers. We know this is a route leak as routes received from peers are only meant to be readvertised to downstream (customer) networks, not laterally to other peers or up to providers.</p><p>As a result of the leak and the forwarding of unintended traffic into our Miami router from providers and peers, we experienced congestion on our backbone between Miami and Atlanta, as you can see in the graph below.&nbsp;</p>

          </figure><p>This would have resulted in elevated loss for some Cloudflare customer traffic, and higher latency than usual for traffic traversing these links. In addition to this congestion, the networks whose prefixes we leaked would have had their traffic discarded by firewall filters on our routers that are designed to only accept traffic for Cloudflare services and our customers. At peak, we discarded around 12Gbps of traffic ingressing our router in Miami for these non-downstream prefixes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should at least skim through Yegge’s original article before continuing to read my reflections. First, because I’m not going to comprehensively summarise it.<span data-astro-cid-az3ff45i=""> <label for="2" data-astro-cid-az3ff45i=""></label>  <span data-astro-cid-az3ff45i=""> A challenging task given the sprawling, haphazard nature of the piece </span> </span>  And second, because a even a one minute glance over Yegge’s style of writing will make the vibes clear.</p>
<p>We should take Yegge’s creation seriously not because it’s a serious, working tool for today’s developers (it isn’t). But because it’s a good piece of speculative design fiction that asks provocative questions and reveals the shape of constraints we’ll face as agentic coding systems mature and grow.</p>
<div data-astro-cid-z3fakvtz=""> <p>“Design fiction” or “speculative design” is a branch of design where you creating things (objects, prototypes, sketches) from a plausible near future. Not to predict what’s going to happen, but to provoke questions and start conversations about what <em>could</em> happen. Not in a bright-and-glorious-flying-cars way that futurism can sometimes fall into. But, most helpfully, in a way that thinks about banal details, overlooked everyday interactions, low status objects, imperfect implementations, knock-on effects, and inconveniences.

<p>I also think Yegge deserves praise for exercising agency and taking a swing at a system like this, despite the inefficiencies and chaos of this iteration. And then running a public tour of his shitty, quarter-built plane while it’s mid-flight.</p>

<p>I should be transparent and say that I have not used Gas Town in earnest on any serious work. I have only lightly poked at it, because I do not qualify as a serious user when I’m still hovering around stages 4-6 in Yegge’s 8 levels of automation:</p>

Which I guess puts me in the agentically conservative camp in this distressingly breakneck moment in history.</p>
<p>Gas Town is a full-on stage 8 piece of tooling: using an orchestrator that manages dozens+ of other coding agents for you. Yegge also warned me not to seriously use Gas Town multiple times, in increasingly threatening typography. I trust his guidance on his own slush pile.</p>

<p>But I have grokked the basic concepts and spent more time with this manifesto than is warranted. And here is what stood out to me from the parts I could comprehend:</p>
<h2 id="1-design-and-planning-becomes-the-bottleneck-when-agents-write-all-the-code" data-astro-cid-lz3qpvh2="">1. Design and planning becomes the bottleneck when agents write all the code</h2> 
<p>When you have a fat stack of agents churning through code tasks, development time is no longer the bottleneck. Yegge says “Gas Town churns through implementation plans so quickly that you have to do a LOT of design and planning to keep the engine fed.” Design becomes the limiting factor: imagining what you want to create and then figuring out all the gnarly <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">little details</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>    required to make your imagination into reality.</p>
<p>I certainly feel this friction in both my own professional work and personal projects. My development velocity is far slower than Yegge since I only wrangle a few agents at a time and keep my eyes and hands on the code. But the build time is rarely what holds me up. It is always the design; how should we architect this? What should this feel like? How should this look? Is that transition subtle enough? How composable should this be? Is this the right metaphor?</p>
<p>When it’s not the design, it’s the product strategy and planning; What are the highest priority features to tackle? Which piece of this should we build first? When do we need to make that decision? What’s the next logical, incremental step we need to make progress here?</p>
<p>These are the kind of decisions that agents cannot make for you. They require your human context, taste, preferences, and vision.</p>
<p>With agents to hand, it’s easy to get ahead of yourself, stumbling forward into stacks of generated functions that should never have been prompted into existence, because they do not correctly render your intentions or achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Gas Town seems to be halfway into this pitfall. The biggest flaw in Yegge’s creation is that it is poorly designed. I mean this in the sense that he absolutely did not design the shape of this system ahead of time, thoughtfully considering which metaphors and primitives would make this effective, efficient, easy to use, and comprehensible.</p>

Not because I wanted it to be, but because I had to keep adding components until it was a self-sustaining machine.” Gas Town is composed of “especially difficult [theories] because it’s a bunch of bullshit I pulled out of my arse over the past 3 weeks, and I named it after badgers and stuff.” It was slapdashed together over “17 days, 75k lines of code, 2000 commits.

<p>Friends and colleagues of mine who have been brave enough to try out Gas Town in more depth report the same thing; this thing fits the shape of Yegge’s brain and no one else’s. I’d categorise that as a moderate design fail, given this is a public product that I assume Yegge wants <em>at least some</em> people to try out. The onboarding is baptism by fire.</p>
<p>This feels like one of the most critical, emerging footguns of liberally hands-off agentic development. You can move so fast you never stop to think. It is so easy to prompt, you don’t fully consider what you’re building at each step of the process. It is only once you are hip-deep in poor architectural decisions, inscrutable bugs, and a fuzzy memory of what you set out to do, do you realise you have burned a billion tokens in exchange for a pile of hot trash.</p>
<h2 id="2-buried-in-the-chaos-are-sketches-of-future-agent-orchestration-patterns" data-astro-cid-lz3qpvh2="">2. Buried in the chaos are sketches of future agent orchestration patterns</h2> 
<p>Now that I’ve just critiqued the design of Gas Town, I will turn around and say that while the current amalgamation of polecats, convoys, deacons, molecules, protomolecules, mayors, seances, hooks, beads, witnesses, wisps, rigs, refineries, and dogs is a bunch of under cooked spaghetti, Yegge’s patterns <em>roughly</em> sketch out some useful conceptual shapes for future agentic systems.</p>
<p>If you step back and squint, this mishmash of concepts reveals a few underlying patterns that future agentic systems will likely follow:</p>
<h3 id="agents-have-specialised-roles-with-hierarchical-supervision" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Agents have specialised roles with hierarchical supervision</h3> 
<p>Every agent in Gas Town has a permanent, specialised role. When an agent spins up a new session, it knows who it is and what job it needs to do. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Mayor</strong> is the human concierge: it’s the main agent you talk to. It talks to all the other agents for you, kicking off work, receiving notifications when things finish, and managing the flow of production.</li>
<li><strong>Polecats</strong> are temporary grunt workers. They complete single, isolated tasks, then disappear after submitting their work to be merged.</li>
<li><strong>The Witness</strong> supervises the Polecats and helps them get unstuck. Its job is to solve problems and nudge the proletariat workers along.</li>
<li><strong>The Refinery</strong> manages the merge queue into the main branch. It evaluates each piece of work waiting to be merged, resolving conflicts in the process. It can creatively “re-imagine” implementations if merge conflicts get too hairy, while trying to keep the intent of the original work.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many more characters in this town, but these give you a flavour of the system. Giving each agent a single job means you can prompt them more precisely, limit what they’re allowed to touch, and run lots of them at once without them stepping on each other’s toes.</p>
<p>There’s also a clear chain of command between these agents. You talk to the Mayor, who coordinates work across the system. The Mayor in Gas Town never writes code. It talks to you, then creates work tasks and assigns them to workers. A set of system supervisors called the Witness, the Deacon, and “Boot the Dog” intermittently nudge the grunt workers and each other to check everyone is doing their work. Oh and there’s also a crew of “dogs” who do maintenance and cleaning.</p>
<p>It’s easier if I try and show you. Here’s the basic relationship structure of Gas Town, as best I can make out:</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-uinjmk2a="">   </figure> 
<p>Since I’m making my own visuals here, I should justify it by pointing out that while Yegge made lots of his own ornate, zoopmorphic diagrams of Gas Town’s architecture and workflows, they are unhelpful. Primarily because they were made entirely by Gemini’s <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://gemini.google/overview/image-generation/" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">Nano Banana</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://gemini.google/overview/image-generation/" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://gemini.google/overview/image-generation/</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>   . And while Nano Banana is state-of-the-art at making diagrams, generative AI systems are still really shit at making illustrative diagrams. They are very hard to decipher, filled with cluttered details, have arrows pointing the wrong direction, and are often missing key information. Case in point:</p>

<p>Does this help you understand how the system works? No? No.</p>
<p>Gas Town’s hierarchical approach solves both a coordination and attention problem. Without it, you are the one assigning tasks to dozens individual agents, checking who’s stuck, who’s idle, and who’s waiting on work from someone else. With the Mayor as your single interface, that overhead disappears. You can continuously talk to the Mayor without interrupting any agents or getting in the way, or having to think much about which one is doing what. This is less cognitive overhead than constantly switching tabs between Claudes.</p>
<p>I think there’s a lot of opportunity to diversify the cast of characters here and make more use of <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">specialist subagents</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>   . The agents in Gas Town are all generalist workers in the software development pipeline. But we could add in any kind of specialist we want: a dev ops expert, a product manager, a front-end debugger, an accessibility checker, a documentation writer. These would be called in on-demand to apply their special skills and tools.</p>
<h3 id="agent-roles-and-tasks-persist-sessions-are-ephemeral" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Agent roles and tasks persist, sessions are ephemeral</h3> 
<p>One of the major limitations of current coding agents is running out of context. Before you even hit the limits of a context window, <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">context rot</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>    degrades the output enough that it’s not worth keeping. We constantly have to compact or start fresh sessions.</p>
<p>Gas Town’s solution to this is make each agent session disposable by design. It stores the important information – agent identities and tasks – in Git, then liberally kills off sessions and spins up fresh ones when needed. New sessions are told their identity and currently assigned work, and continue on where the last one left off. Gas Town also lets new sessions ask their predecessors what happened through “seancing”: resuming the last session as a separate instance in order to let the new agent ask questions about unfinished work.</p>

<h3 id="feeding-agents-continuous-streams-of-work" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Feeding agents continuous streams of work</h3> 
<p>The whole promise of an orchestration system like Gas Town is it’s a perpetual motion machine. You give high-level orders to the mayor, and then a zoo of agents kicks off to break it down into tasks, assign them, execute them, check for bugs, fix the bugs, review the code, and merge it in.</p>
<p>Each worker agent in Gas Town has its own queue of assigned work and a “hook” pointing to the current thing they should be doing. The minute they finish a task, the next one jumps to the front of the queue. The mayor is the one filling up these queues – it’s in charge of breaking down large features into atomic tasks and assigning them to available workers. In theory, the workers are never idle or lacking tasks, so long as you keep feeding the mayor your grand plans.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-4rtoioko="">   </figure> 
<p>This principle of “workers always do their work” is better in theory than practice. It turns out to be slightly difficult to make happen because of the way current models are trained. They’re designed as helpful assistants who wait politely for human instructions. They’re not used to checking a task queue and independently getting on with things.</p>
<p>Gas Town’s patchwork solution to this is aggressive prompting and constant nudging. Supervisor agents spend their time poking workers to see if anyone’s stalled out or run dry on work. When one goes quiet, they send it a ping which jolts the agent into checking its queue and getting back to work. These periodic nudges move through the agent hierarchy like a heartbeat keeping everything moving. This is a decent band-aid for the first version, but more serious efforts at agent orchestration systems will need reliable ways to keep agents on task.</p>
<h3 id="merge-queues-and-agent-managed-conflicts" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Merge queues and agent-managed conflicts</h3> 
<p>When you have a bunch of agents all working in parallel, you’re of course going to run into merge conflicts. Each agent is off on its own branch, and by the time it finishes its task, the main branch might look completely different – other changes have landed, the code has moved on. The later an agent finishes, the worse this gets. Normally you, the human, takes on the burden of sorting out the mess and deciding which changes to keep. But if agents are running on their own, something has to do that job for them.</p>
<p>So Gas Town has a dedicated merge agent – the Refinery – that works through the merge queue one change at a time. It looks at each merge request, resolves any conflicts, and gets it into main. When things get really tangled – when so much has changed that the original work doesn’t even make sense anymore – it can creatively “re-imagine” the changes: re-doing the work to fit the new codebase. Or escalate to a human if needed.</p>
<p>But there’s another way to sidestep merge conflict nightmares that Gas Town doesn’t have built in: ditch PRs for <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">stacked diffs</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/stacked-diffs</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>   . The traditional git workflow puts each feature on its own branch for days or weeks, accumulating commits, then getting merged back as one chunky PR.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-bbk7lzru="">  </figure> 
<p>Stacked diffs avoid this conflict-prone approach by breaking work into small, atomic changes that each get reviewed and merged on their own, building on top of each other. Every change gets its own branch, forked off the previous change, forming a “stack” of changes dependent on one another. When a change earlier in the stack gets updated, all the changes below it automatically rebase on top of the new version.</p>
<figure data-astro-cid-n6ro3rn2="">  </figure> 
<p>This fits how agents naturally work. They’re already producing tiny, focused changes rather than sprawling multi-day branches. When conflicts do pop up, they’re easier to untangle because each diff touches less code. <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://cursor.com/" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">Cursor</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://cursor.com/" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://cursor.com/</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>   ’s recent acquisition of <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://graphite.com/" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">Graphite</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://graphite.com/" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://graphite.com/</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>   , a tool built specifically for stacked diff workflows, suggests I am not the only one who sees this opportunity.

<p>The current cost is almost certainly artificially inflated by system inefficiency. Work gets lost, bugs get fixed numerous times, designs go missing and need redoing. As models improve and orchestration patterns mature, the cost of orchestrators like this should drop while output quality rises.</p>
<p>I expect companies would happily pay around the $1-3k/month mark for a sane, understandable, higher quality, and lower waste version of Gas Town. Maybe that sounds absurd to you, given we’ve all become anchored to the artificially low rate of $100-200/month for unlimited usage by the major providers. But once the AI bubble pops, the VC funds dry up, and providers have to charge the true cost of inference at scale, we should expect that “unlimited” tier to look a lot pricier.</p>

Many people will pick bones over this because the market range is so broad.

<p>The maths on paying for something like this is already defensible in wealthier places like the US and parts of Western Europe. In spots where developer salaries are lower, we would expect the budget for AI assisted tools adjusts accordingly. They’ll get less crazy scaled automation and more conversative useage with humans filling in the cognitive gaps.</p>

I’ve never seen the code, and I never care to.” Not looking at code <em>at all</em> is a very bold proposition, today, in January 2026.</p>
<p>Given the current state of models and the meagre safeguards we have in place around them, the vast majority of us would consider this blind coding approach irresponsible and daft to do on anything that isn’t a throwaway side project. Which, given the amount of effort and Claude tokens Yegge has sunk into building it, writing documentation, and publicly promoting it, Gas Town is not.</p>
<p>“Should developers still look at code?” will become one of the most divisive and heated debates over the coming years. You might be offended by the question, and find it absurd anyone is asking. But it’s a sincere question and the answer will change faster than you think.</p>
<p>I’m already seeing people divide along moralistic, personal identity lines as they try to answer it. Some declare themselves purist, AI skeptic, Real Developers who check every diff and hand-adjust specific lines, sneering at anyone reckless enough to let agents run free. While others lean into agentic maximalism, directing fleets from on high and pitying the mass of luddites still faffing about with manual edits like it’s 2019. Both camps mistake a contextual judgement for a personality trait and firm moral position.</p>
<p>A more conservative, easier to consider, debate is: how <em>close</em> should the code be in agentic software development tools? How easy should it be to access? How often do we expect developers to edit it by hand?</p>

<p>This design choice assumes it is easier to ask an agent to make the change for you, than it is to type it out the syntax yourself. They clearly say “we don’t believe users need to touch code.”</p>
<p>Framing this debate as an either/or – either you look at code or don’t, either you edit code by hand or you exclusively direct agents, either you’re the anti-AI-purist or the agentic-maxxer – is unhelpful. Because nothing is a strict binary.</p>
<p>The right distance isn’t about what kind of person you are or what you believe about AI capabilities in the current moment. How far away you step from the syntax shifts based on what you’re building, who you’re building with, and what happens when things go wrong. The degree of freedom you hand over to agents depends on:</p>
<h3 id="domain-and-programming-language" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Domain and programming language</h3> 
<p>Front-end versus backend makes a huge difference. Language is a poor medium for designing easing curves and describing aesthetic feelings – I always need to touch the CSS, and it’s often faster to just tweak directly than try to explain what I want. Yegge’s CLI tooling is much easier to validate with pass/fail tests than evaluating whether a notification system “feels calm enough”. Model competence also varies wildly by language; prompting React and Tailwind gives you much better results than Rust or Haskell, where the models still regularly choke on borrow checkers and type systems.</p>
<h3 id="access-to-feedback-loops-and-definitions-of-succes" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Access to feedback loops and definitions of succes</h3> 
<p>The more agents can validate their own work, the better the results. If you let agents run tests and see the output, they quickly learn what’s broken and how to fix it. If you let them open browsers, take screenshots, and click around, they can spot their mistakes. Tools like the <span data-maxwidth="400">  <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum" data-internal="false" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">Ralph Wiggum plugin</a>  <template> <div data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <a class="external-url" href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <span data-astro-cid-xcud3gru="">https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum</span> <span class="icon-wrapper" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""> <path d="M10 6H6C4.89543 6 4 6.89543 4 8V18C4 19.1046 4.89543 20 6 20H16C17.1046 20 18 19.1046 18 18V14M14 4H20M20 4V10M20 4L10 14" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" data-astro-cid-xcud3gru=""></path> </svg> </span> </a> </div> </template> </span>    lean into this – it loops until tests pass or some specific condition is validated. This doesn’t work for less defined, clear cut work though. If you try to make an agent design a visual diagram for you, it’s going to struggle. It doesn’t know your aesthetic preferences and can’t really “see” what it’s making.</p>
<h3 id="risk-tolerance-for-shit-going-wrong" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Risk tolerance for shit going wrong</h3> 
<p>Stakes matter. If an agent breaks some images on your personal blog, you’ll recover. But if you’re running a healthcare system where a bug could miscalculate drug dosages, or a banking app moving actual money around, you can’t just wave an agent at it and hope. Consequences scale up fast. Corporate software has people whose entire job is compliance and regulatory sign-off – they need to see the code, understand it, verify it meets requirements. Those people aren’t going to let you widly run Gas Town over projects without serious guardrails in place.</p>
<div data-align-left="true" data-astro-cid-572j4yyn=""> <p>“Gas Town sounds fun if you are accountable to nobody: not for code quality, design coherence or inferencing costs. The rest of us are accountable for at least the first two and even in corporate scenarios where there is a blank check for tokens, that can’t last. So the bottleneck is going to be how fast humans can review code and agree to take responsibility for it.”</p></div>
<h3 id="greenfield-vs-brownfield-projects" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Greenfield vs. brownfield projects</h3> 
<p>Starting fresh (greenfield), means you can let agents make architectural decisions and establish patterns – if you don’t like them, you can easily throw it out and restart. The cost of mistakes is low. But in an existing codebase (brownfield) with years of accumulated conventions, implicit patterns, and code that exists for reasons nobody remembers anymore, agents need much tighter supervision. They’ll happily introduce a new pattern that contradicts the three other ways this codebase already solves the same problem.</p>
<h3 id="number-of-collaborators" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Number of collaborators</h3> 
<p>If you’re solo of course you can YOLO. If you’re working with more than a handful of people, you’ll have to agree on coding standards and agent rules. This creates its own overhead: updating the AGENTS.md file, picking MCPs, writing commands and skills and rules and whatever else we invent to constrain these things. The pace of change when you’re all using agents can be overwhelming and you need to figure out a sensible reviewing pipeline to manage it. Team coordination can fall apart when everyone’s agents start moving too fast. You might show up in the morning and discover someone’s agent renamed the database schema while another agent refactored the whole API layer, and neither of which jive with your giant, unmerged feature.</p>
<h3 id="your-experience-level" data-astro-cid-6vq7zla3="">Your experience level</h3> 
<p>More senior developers can prompt better, debug better, and setup more stringent preferences earned through decades of seeing what can go wrong in scaled, production environments. They can recognize patterns: “oh, that’s a memory leak” or “that’s going to deadlock under load.” Newer developers don’t have that catalog of failures yet and are much more likely to prompt their own personal house of cards. The tests might pass and everything looks fine until you hit production traffic or someone enters a weird character. It is hard to defend against unknown unknowns.</p>
 
<p>Given all these “it depends” considerations, I’m currently in the code-must-be-close camp for most serious work done by professional developers. But I expect I’ll shift to the code-at-a-distance camp over the next year or two as the harnesses and tools we wrap around these agents mature. If we can ship them with essential safe guards and quality gates, the risks drop. Sure, the models will also improve, but the infrastructure matters far more: validation loops, tests, and specialised subagents who focus on security, debugging, and code quality are what will make code-at-a-distance feasible.</p>

It’s these kinds of guardrails that makes a hands-off Sim-City-esque orchestrator system feel less terrifying to me.</p>

<p>I don’t believe Gas Town itself is “it”. It’s not going to evolve into the thing we all use, day in and day out, in 2027. As I said, it’s a provocative piece of speculative design, not a system many people will use in earnest. In the same way any poorly designed object or system gets abandoned, this manic creation is too poorly thought through to persist. But the problems it’s wrestling with and the patterns it has sketched out will unquestionably show up in the next generation of development tools.</p>
<p>As the pace of software development speeds up, we’ll feel the pressure intensify in other parts of the pipeline: thoughtful design, critical thinking, user research, planning and coordination within teams, deciding what to build, and whether it’s been built well. The most valuable tools in this new world won’t be the ones that generate the most code fastest. They’ll be the ones that help us think more clearly, plan more carefully, and keep the quality bar high while everything accelerates around us.</p> </article>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, tech was a foundational part of my childhood.</p>

<p>I built more physical computers than I can remember. We went from paper maps to GPS (which itself evolved from DVDs with static maps to internet-connected real-time navigation). CD players became MP3 players, then streaming services. We had Palm Pilots and early attempts at “smart” phones, which were anything but. Our computers could search for extraterrestrial life through SETI. We emerged from the pager era to portable phones to the entire internet in our pocket (which evolved from charging per SMS or megabyte to unlimited data plans).</p>

<p>We went through what I still think of as a golden era of console gaming: the N64 &amp; PlayStation, then PS2, Xbox, and GameCube. Meanwhile, our bulky CRT monitors became flat (with a misadventure toward “projection” TVs in between). We could buy gadgets for everything. Best Buy and RadioShack felt like amusement parks we’d visit without intention, ready to be drawn in by something new. A trip to Asia’s electronics stores felt like a genuine step into the future.</p>

<p>Today, we have everything we did back then, and much more. And yet it somehow feels like we’ve been left with less.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, tech began a decades-long consolidation. Almost everything we used before became a function of a single device. Objectively, this was an improvement—old VCR interfaces were awful, early MP3 players were clunky, GPS lacked real-time traffic data, and nothing talked to each other. And yet, through that consolidation, something intangible was taken from us.</p>

<p>Our devices lost their unique personalities. Phones became our alarm clocks, flashlights, calendars, watches, cameras, GPS units, music players, radios, journals, and gaming devices—all at once. We betrayed our focus in the pursuit of convenience, and the personality of our devices for homogeneity.</p>

<p>The benefits were clear to us, but the costs weren’t.</p>

<p>This convergence created winner-take-all (and two-player) markets. Console gaming became PlayStation or Nintendo. Phones became Android or iOS. Computers became Mac or Windows. PC gaming became synonymous with Steam. Everything else became a feature inside one of those platforms, with globally synchronized updates making our experiences increasingly uniform, and bland.</p>

<p>For a long time, that felt inevitable. But it’s only become clear in retrospect that somewhere in the early 2020s, things started to change.</p>

<p>New paradigms are emerging for the first time since mobile. VR is no longer experimental. Early AR is starting to reach consumers. Meta shipped a wearable that normal people actually use, thanks to a clever Ray-Ban partnership (and associated equity stake). 3D printers have become real household products. Wearables are diversifying—smart rings, over-the-counter glucose monitors, connected beds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Apple’s aggressive push for services revenue has alienated developers and users alike, creating space for alternatives. And nostalgia has revealed itself as massive, underserved economic demand.</p>

<p>Gen-Z is buying single-purpose iPods and wired headphones. Pokémon cards are trendy. My friends and I are amassing N64 game collections again. There is a revived appetite for film cameras and Polaroids. Companies are recreating old hardware in modern form—ModRetro’s upcoming FPGA-based M64 plays native N64 cartridges, following their successful Game Boy recreation. They’re now working to bring a “next-gen” CRT monitor to market. The Playdate proved there’s still room for third-party handhelds with their own unique philosophies. Even Nintendo couldn’t resist capitalizing with the re-release of their classic consoles.</p>

<p>Design matters again. In our devices, and in our lives. Art Deco is in vogue. Cyberpunk has never been more culturally mainstream. Color is back, and bold.</p>

<p>Canon, Sony, and Nikon may have replaced Kodak for professionals, but Leica is thriving again and Kodak Instamatic has gone viral. People want devices that feel personal—leather finishes, physical controls, intentional constraints. For years this expression was limited to phone cases. Now it’s showing up in hardware itself.</p>

<p>Tech is starting to resemble the wristwatch market: collaborations, limited editions, exclusivity. A market with many players—emerging companies, niche studios, design-forward brands, and even failing companies—is healthier than one dominated by a few giants.</p>

<p>Antitrust pressure has slowed consolidation, opened app distribution, killed the anti-competitive iMessage and AirDrop moats, and made big tech cautious about horizontal expansion. And yet market forces may matter even more. Subscriptions keep multiplying. Advertising creeps into everything. Consolidated platforms are becoming bloated, degrading experiences. Platforms extract value in ways that betray their original philosophies.</p>

<p>Apple’s push toward services has been financially successful but culturally damaging. Users are looking elsewhere. It was imperceptible at first, but that sentiment is spreading.</p>

<p>Barriers to entry are lower than they’ve been in decades. Software can be deployed in minutes. Hardware is still hard, but 3D printing has revolutionized prototyping and accessible manufacturing services have drastically lowered the cost and time to market. Even the consolidation on the USB-C standard has played a role, allowing switching devices without investing in a new ecosystem.</p>

<p>We’ve also grown tired of curation by algorithm. What we watch is shaped by recommendation engines. How we perceive it is influenced by aggregate ratings. I miss wandering through video stores, choosing based on nothing more than a cover. Discovery felt accidental and my opinions felt like my own.</p>

<p>Burnout plays a role too. A Timex ad went viral this year: “Know the time without seeing you have 1,249 unanswered emails.” People are gravitating toward rigid, single-purpose experiences that let them fully disengage.</p>

<p>Our appetite for alternatives has grown, while they’ve also become easier to create. LLMs and modern tools have lowered the effort required to build things. Side projects are easier to start and finish. Even when large companies offer better experiences on paper, individuals are building alternatives for the joy of it. Some go viral. Consumers end up with more choice.</p>

<p>Nothing would have been harder to project than the growth of Linux on the desktop. Integrated platforms seemingly made the Linux philosophy untenable, and yet it may now be growing as a direct result of this decoupling. This was a feature, not a bug.</p>

<p>Looking at my own purchases from 2025, the pattern becomes obvious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>TRMNL (a no-distraction e-paper display)</li>
  <li>Ray-Ban Meta glasses</li>
  <li>Leica D-LUX</li>
  <li>Wired headphones</li>
  <li>Android Pixel Pro (alongside iPhone)</li>
  <li>ASUS ROG laptop (for CUDA and gaming)</li>
  <li>Matic AI vacuum</li>
  <li>Govee programmable lights</li>
  <li>28 TB Seagate hard drive</li>
  <li>Bambu Labs P1S 3D printer</li>
  <li>Kindle (finally retiring my last mini-USB device)</li>
  <li>Oura Ring</li>
  <li>Abbott Lingo glucose sensor</li>
  <li>iPad (single-purpose: as a second MacBook display while traveling)</li>
  <li>More mechanical watches than I can count (while not tech per se, it does reduce the breadth of the Apple ecosystem)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is more than I’ve bought in the last 5 years, and I’m already excited for 2026. While Meta, Apple, Amazon, and Google still appear in my list, their purposes are narrower for me than in the past, and their presence is often no longer part of a two-player market. To be clear, these companies often make great products that should exist, but they should be easy to use as standalone à la carte offerings, not forced omakase experiences.</p>

<p>We’ll never truly recreate the late 80s or mid-90s. SaaS, subscription pricing, and centralized platforms are here to stay. But this feels like the beginning of another golden era—one defined less by consolidation and more by variety, personality, and choice.</p>

<div><p>
	Introducing phase8, an eight-voice acoustic synthesizer that merges the sonic richness of the physical world with precise electronic control. With envelope shaping, sequencing, analogue wavefolding, and pitch-dependent modulation, phase8 harnesses the latest Acoustic Synthesis technology developed at KORG.
</p><p>
phase8 is an organic, responsive instrument that feels alive in your hands and responds to the world around you.	</p></div>
<!-- END OF TYPE S PATTERN -->

<!-- TYPE F PATTERN -->
<div><p>Acoustic Synthesis uses physically vibrating bodies to generate sound, enhanced with the electronic control you’d expect from a synthesizer. The result is an instrument that produces sound which feels alive and responds to physical interactions such as touch and acoustic feedback.
</p><p>

<strong>It is beyond “analogue vs digital”. It’s even beyond electronics.</strong></p><p>
8 independent electromechanical voices with steel resonators are at the heart of the instrument’s acoustic sound.</p></div>
<!-- END OF TYPE F PATTERN -->
<!-- TYPE E PATTERN -->
<div><p>phase8 comes with 13 chromatically tuned resonators; 8 of your choice can be installed at any one time. Through envelope control, these resonators can produce everything from short percussive sounds to long, drawn-out sustained notes.
</p><p>
The design allows you to easily swap and tune resonators, letting you customise the scale and character of your phase8.</p></div>

<p>Radicle is an open source, peer-to-peer code collaboration stack built on Git.
Unlike centralized code hosting platforms, there is no single entity
controlling the network. Repositories are replicated across peers in a
decentralized manner, and users are in full control of their data and workflow.</p>

<h2 id="radicle-desktop-️">Radicle Desktop 🖥️</h2>

<p>For a graphical collaborative experience check out the <a href="https://radicle.xyz/desktop">Radicle Desktop client</a>, as well.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>The Radicle protocol leverages cryptographic identities for code and social
artifacts, utilizes Git for efficient data transfer between peers, and employs
a custom gossip protocol for exchanging repository metadata.</p>

<p><a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol/">Learn more →</a></p>

<h2 id="your-data-forever-and-secure">Your Data, Forever and Secure</h2>

<p>All social artifacts are stored in Git, and signed using public-key
cryptography. Radicle verifies the authenticity and authorship of all data
for you.</p>

<h2 id="unparalleled-autonomy">Unparalleled Autonomy</h2>

<p>Radicle enables users to run their own nodes, ensuring censorship-resistant
code collaboration and fostering a resilient network without reliance on
third-parties.</p>

<h2 id="local-first">Local-first</h2>

<p>Radicle is <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">local-first</a>, providing always-available functionality even
without internet access. Users own their data, making migration, backup, and
access easy both online and offline.</p>

<h2 id="evolvable--extensible">Evolvable &amp; Extensible</h2>

<p>Radicle’s <a href="https://radicle.xyz/guides/protocol#collaborative-objects">Collaborative Objects</a> (COBs) provide Radicle’s <em>social
primitive</em>. This enables features such as issues, discussions and code review
to be implemented as Git objects. Developers can extend Radicle’s capabilities
to build any kind of collaboration flow they see fit.</p>

<h2 id="modular-by-design">Modular by Design</h2>

<p>The Radicle Stack comes with a CLI, web interface and TUI, that are backed by

<p><b>TL;DR:</b> Since at least February 2020, Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover">Autodiscover</a> service has incorrectly routed the IANA-reserved <code>example.com</code> to Sumitomo Electric Industries' mail servers at sei.co.jp, potentially sending test credentials there.</p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>While setting up <code>email@example.com</code> as a dummy account in Outlook (on both Windows and macOS), Outlook consistently auto-configured it to use <code>imapgms.jnet.sei.co.jp</code> (IMAP) and <code>smtpgms.jnet.sei.co.jp</code> (SMTP) despite <code>example.com</code> being an <a href="https://www.iana.org/help/example-domains">IANA-reserved domain</a> that should not resolve to real services.</p>

<p>The same behavior appeared on different machines, profiles, networks, and DNS resolvers, including a newly provisioned <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-365">Windows 365 Cloud PC</a>:</p>

Your web browser doesn't support embedded video.
</video></p>

<h2>Confirmation</h2>

<h3>DNS verification</h3>

<p>Confirm that <code>example.com</code> has no DNS records pointing to <code>sei.co.jp</code>:</p>

<pre><samp>%</samp><code> dig MX example.com +short</code>
<samp>0 .

%</samp><code> dig CNAME autodiscover.example.com +short</code>
<samp>(no response)

%</samp><code> dig SRV _autodiscover._tcp.example.com +short</code>
<samp>(no response)</samp></pre>

<p>The domain has a null MX record (indicating it doesn't accept email) and no Autodiscover DNS entries, confirming the misconfiguration exists entirely within Microsoft's database.</p>

<h3>Microsoft autodiscover API response</h3>

<p>Microsoft's Autodiscover service misconfiguration can be confirmed via <code>curl -v -u "email@example.com:password" "https://prod.autodetect.outlook.cloud.microsoft/autodetect/detect?app=outlookdesktopBasic"</code>:</p>

                            Some companies outside Europe tend to ignore data protection and related laws such as the GDPR or do not implement them correctly.

                            As a business that operates in Europe, it is possible to get a VAT refund for products/services of other European companies. European companies also tend to offer payment methods that are commonly used in Europe.

                            Within the EU, many laws and framework conditions are set by the EU, which helps to cover a large market without having to consider large country-specific differences. It is also easier to enforce your rights against another company located in the EU.

      <p>We’ve just heard from a digital ethics expert who gave us his thoughts after the White House posted an AI-edited image on X of a woman arrested at an anti-immigration enforcement protest in Minnesota.</p><p>The White House <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/ce9yydgmzdvt?post=asset%3Aaec7368e-3986-43fd-a11d-75572a0b7d33#post">manipulated a photo of lawyer and activist Nekima Levy Armstrong to make it look like she was crying</a>.</p><p>“I would imagine most citizens expect government accounts to be trustworthy sources more than meme accounts,” Alex Krasodomski of the London-based international affairs think tank Chatham House told us.</p><p>When we asked the White House to comment on why it edited a genuine photo of Armstrong’s arrest, they directed us to a post by deputy communications director Kaelan Dorr. It said: “Enforcement of the law will continue. The memes will continue.”</p><p>"While memes are an integral part of modern politics, describing the manipulated photo of Nekima Levy as such feels a stretch,” Krasodomski said.</p><p>“Sharing a believable but manipulated image risks both altering the narrative around the arrest and is likely red meat to the activist's political opponents,” he added.</p>

    <p>It’s weird to see Docker Inc (the company) struggle to find its place in 2026. What started as the company that revolutionized how we deploy applications has been through multiple identity crises, pivoting from one strategy to another in search of sustainable revenue and market relevance.</p>
<h2 id="the-identity-crisis">The Identity Crisis</h2>
<p>Docker’s journey reads like a startup trying to find product-market fit, except Docker already had product-market fit - they created the containerization standard that everyone uses. The problem is that Docker the technology became so successful that Docker the company struggled to monetize it. When your core product becomes commoditized and open source, you need to find new ways to add value.</p>
<h2 id="the-swarm-exit">The Swarm Exit</h2>
<p>Docker Swarm was Docker’s attempt to compete with Kubernetes in the orchestration space. But Kubernetes won that battle decisively, and Docker eventually sold Swarm. This was a clear signal that Docker was stepping back from trying to be the full-stack container platform and instead focusing on what they could uniquely provide.</p>

<p>For a while, Docker seemed to focus on developer experience. This made sense - developers are Docker’s core users, and improving their workflow could be a differentiator. Docker Scout emerged from the acquisition of Atomist in June 2022, bringing “software supply chain” capabilities. Scout allows Docker to see not just what’s in a container, but how it was built and where vulnerabilities are. This was a smart move toward security and observability, areas where Docker could add real value.</p>
<p>Docker also acquired AtomicJar, the company behind Testcontainers, adding shift-left testing capabilities. Testcontainers lets developers run real dependencies (databases, message queues, etc.) in containers during testing, making integration tests more reliable and closer to production environments.</p>
<h2 id="the-ai-pivot">The AI Pivot</h2>
<p>Then came the AI pivot. Docker Model Runner entered the scene, positioning Docker as a platform for running AI models. Docker Compose expanded to support AI agents and models. Docker Offload was introduced for cloud-scale GPU execution of AI tasks. Partnerships with Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AI SDKs (CrewAI, LangGraph, Vercel AI SDK) followed.</p>
<p>The acquisition of MCP Defender in September 2025 further cemented Docker’s move into AI security, focusing on securing agentic AI infrastructure and runtime threat detection. This was a significant shift - from developer tools to AI infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardened-images-move">The Hardened Images Move</h2>
<p>Suddenly, Docker moved into the hardened images space. In December 2025, Docker made over 1,000 Docker Hardened Images free and open source under Apache 2.0, reducing vulnerabilities by up to 95% compared to traditional images. This move was likely triggered by Chainguard’s success in the secure container image space. Chainguard had been building a business around minimal, secure container images, and Docker needed to respond.</p>
<p>Making hardened images free was a bold move - it’s hard to compete with free, especially when it’s open source. But it also raises questions about Docker’s business model. If you’re giving away your security features for free, what are you selling?</p>
<h2 id="leadership-changes-and-acquisition-speculation">Leadership Changes and Acquisition Speculation</h2>
<p>In February 2025, Docker replaced CEO Scott Johnston (who led the company since 2019) with Don Johnson, a former Oracle Cloud Infrastructure founder and executive vice president. This leadership transition has prompted tech analysts to anticipate a potential acquisition by a major cloud provider. The CEO swap, combined with the strategic pivots, suggests Docker may be positioning itself for sale rather than building a standalone business.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-all-means">What This All Means</h2>
<p>Docker’s strategic shifts tell a story of a company searching for its place in a market it helped create. The containerization technology Docker pioneered became so successful that it became infrastructure - something everyone uses but no one wants to pay for directly.</p>
<p>The pivots from orchestration (Swarm) to developer tools (Scout, Testcontainers) to AI (Model Runner, MCP Defender) to security (Hardened Images) show a company trying different approaches to find sustainable revenue. Each pivot makes sense in isolation, but together they paint a picture of a company without a clear long-term vision.</p>
<p>The hardened images move is particularly interesting because it’s defensive - responding to Chainguard’s success rather than leading with innovation. Making it free and open source is a strong competitive move, but it doesn’t solve the fundamental business model question.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>Docker the technology isn’t going anywhere. It’s too embedded in the infrastructure of modern software development. But Docker the company? That’s less clear. The leadership change, acquisition speculation, and rapid strategic pivots suggest Docker Inc may be positioning itself for an exit rather than building a long-term independent business.</p>
<p>For developers, this doesn’t change much. Docker containers will continue to work, and the open source nature of Docker means the technology will persist regardless of what happens to the company. But it’s worth watching how Docker Inc’s search for identity plays out - it could affect the ecosystem of tools and services built around containers.</p>
<p>The irony is that Docker created a standard so successful that it became infrastructure, and infrastructure is hard to monetize. Docker Inc’s struggle to find its place is a cautionary tale about the challenges of building a business around open source technology that becomes too successful.</p>

<p dir="auto">Local Area Network discovery tool with a modern Terminal User Interface (TUI) written in Go.
Discover, explore, and understand your LAN in an intuitive way.</p>
<p dir="auto">Whosthere performs <strong>unprivileged, concurrent scans</strong> using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS" rel="nofollow"><strong>mDNS</strong></a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol" rel="nofollow"><strong>SSDP</strong></a> scanners. Additionally, it sweeps the
local subnet by attempting TCP/UDP connections to trigger ARP resolution, then reads the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol" rel="nofollow"><strong>ARP cache</strong></a> to identify devices on your Local Area Network.
This technique populates the ARP cache without requiring elevated privileges. All discovered devices are enhanced with
<a href="https://standards-oui.ieee.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>OUI</strong></a> lookups to display manufacturers when available.</p>
<p dir="auto">Whosthere provides a friendly, intuitive way to answer the question every network administrator asks: "Who's there on my network?"</p>

		<p>Most PCs tend to boot from a primary media storage, be it a hard disk drive, or a solid-state drive, perhaps from a network, or – if all else fails – the USB stick or the boot DVD comes to the rescue… Fun, eh? Boring! Why don’t we try to boot from a record player for a change?<span id="more-2871"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-scaled.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a><strong>64 512 byte DOS boot disk on a 10″ record, total playing time 06:10 on 45 rpm<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Update February 2022</u></strong>: Click <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/IBMPCjr/posts/1592474927753981/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> to observe the very same vinyl ramdisk <a href="https://boginjr.com/electronics/old/ibm4860/">booted on an IBM PCjr</a>!<br>
So this nutty little experiment connects a PC, <a href="https://boginjr.com/electronics/old/ibm5150/">or an IBM PC to be exact</a>, directly onto a record player through an amplifier. I made a small ROM on-chip boot loader that operates the built-in “cassette interface” of the PC (that was hardly ever used), which will now be invoked by the BIOS if all the other boot options fail, i.e. floppy disk and the hard drive. The turntable spins an analog recording of a small bootable read-only RAM drive, which is 64K in size. This contains a FreeDOS kernel, modified by me to cram it into the memory constraint, a micro variant of COMMAND.COM and a patched version of INTERLNK, that allows file transfer through a printer cable, modified to be runnable on FreeDOS. The bootloader reads the disk image from the audio recording through the cassette modem, loads it to memory and boots the system on it. Simple huh?</p>
<p><a href="https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot3.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot3.png" alt="" width="771" height="574" srcset="https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot3.png 771w, https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot3-300x223.png 300w, https://boginjr.com/wp-content/uploads/vinyl-boot3-768x572.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 771px) 100vw, 771px"></a><strong>The vinyl loader code, in a ROM</strong><br>
<strong>(It can also reside on a hard drive or a floppy, but that’d be cheating)</strong></p>
<p>And now to get more technical: this is basically a merge between <a href="https://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/bootlpt-86/">BootLPT/86</a> and <a href="https://boginjr.com/it/sw/dev/5150caxx/">5150CAXX</a>, minus the printer port support. It also resides in a ROM, in the BIOS expansion socket, but it does not have to. The connecting cable between the PC and the record player amplifier is the same as with 5150CAXX, just without the line-in (PC data out) jack.<br>
The “cassette interface” itself is just <a href="https://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5150/misc/5150_post_test_131.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC speaker</a> timer channel 2 for the output, and 8255A-5 PPI port C channel 4 (PC4, I/O port 62h bit 4) for the input. BIOS INT 15h routines are used for software (de)modulation.<br>
The boot image is the same 64K BOOTDISK.IMG “example” RAM drive that can be downloaded at the bottom of the BootLPT article. This has been turned into an “IBM cassette tape”-protocol compliant audio signal using 5150CAXX, and sent straight to a record cutting lathe.<br>
Vinyls are cut with an RIAA equalization curve that a preamp usually reverses during playback, but not perfectly. So some signal correction had to be applied from the amplifier, as I couldn’t make it work right with the line output straight from the phono preamp. In my case, involving a vintage Harman&amp;Kardon 6300 amplifier with an integrated MM phono preamp, I had to fade the treble all the way down to -10dB/10kHz, increase bass equalization to approx. +6dB/50Hz and reduce the volume level to approximately 0.7 volts peak, so it doesn’t distort. All this, naturally, with any phase and loudness correction turned off.<br>
Of course, the cassette modem does not give a hoot in hell about where the signal is coming from. Notwithstanding, the recording needs to be pristine and contain no pops or loud crackles (vinyl) or modulation/frequency drop-outs (tape) that will break the data stream from continuing. However, some wow is tolerated, and the speed can be 2 or 3 percent higher or lower too.</p>

<p>And that’s it! For those interested, the bootloader binary designed for a 2364 chip (2764s can be used, through an adaptor), can be obtained <a href="https://boginjr.com/apps/vinyl-boot/BootVinyl.bin">here</a>. It assumes an IBM 5150 with a monochrome screen and at least 512K of RAM, which kind of reminds me of my setup (what a coincidence). The boot disk image can be obtained at the bottom of the BootLPT/86 article, and <a href="https://boginjr.com/misc/bootdisk.flac">here’s its analog variant</a>, straight from the grooves 🙂</p>

        <p><strong>Jan 22nd, 2026</strong><br>Lev Kokotov</p>
       <p>PgDog is a proxy for scaling PostgreSQL. Under the hood, we use <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze/libpg_query/"><code>libpg_query</code></a> to parse and understand SQL queries. Since PgDog is written in Rust, we use its <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze/pg_query.rs/">Rust bindings</a> to interface with the core C library. 
Those bindings use Protobuf (de)serialization to work uniformly across different programming languages, e.g., the popular Ruby <em>pg_query</em> gem.</p>

<p>Protobuf is fast, but not using Protobuf is faster. We forked <em>pg_query.rs</em> and replaced Protobuf with direct C-to-Rust (and back to C) bindings, using bindgen and Claude-generated wrappers. This resulted in a 5x improvement in parsing queries, and a 10x improvement in deparsing (Postgres AST to SQL string conversion).</p>

<h5 id="results">Results</h5>

<p>You can reproduce these by cloning <a href="https://github.com/pgdogdev/pg_query.rs">our fork</a> and running the benchmark <a href="https://github.com/pgdogdev/pg_query.rs/blob/f5a92bf9ed87ebe60c444f64ccb7a40397a31bcc/tests/raw_parse_tests.rs">tests</a>:</p>

<h3 id="the-process">The process</h3>

<p>The first step is always profiling. We use <a href="https://github.com/mstange/samply">samply</a>, which integrates nicely with the Firefox profiler. Samply is a sampling profiler: it measures how much time code spends running CPU instructions in each function. It works by inspecting the application call stack thousands of times per second. The more time is spent inside a particular function (or span, as they are typically called), the slower that code is. This is how we discovered <code>pg_query_parse_protobuf</code>:</p>

<center>
    <img src="https://pgdog.dev/assets/images/pg_query_parse_protobuf.png" width="95%" height="auto" alt="Parameters everywhere">
</center>

<p>This is the entrypoint to the <code>libpg_query</code> C library, used by all <em>pg_query</em> bindings. The function that wraps the actual Postgres parser, <code>pg_query_raw_parse</code>, barely registered on the flame graph. Parsing queries isn’t free, but the Postgres parser itself is very quick and has been optimized for a long time. With the hot spot identified, our first instinct was to do nothing and just add a cache.</p>

<h4 id="caching-mostly-works">Caching mostly works</h4>

<p>Caching is a trade-off between memory and CPU utilization, and memory is relatively cheap (latest DRAM crunch notwithstanding). The cache is mutex-protected, uses the LRU algorithm and is backed by a hashmap<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The query text is the key and the Abstract Syntax Tree is the value, which expects most apps to use prepared statements. The query text contains placeholders instead of actual values and is therefore reusable, for example:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>users</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>$</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While the <code>id</code> parameter can change between invocations, the prepared statement does not, so we could cache its static AST in memory.</p>

<p>This works pretty well, but eventually we ran into a couple of issues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Some ORMs can have bugs that generate thousands of unique statements, e.g., <code>value IN ($1, $2, $3)</code> instead of <code>value = ANY($1)</code>, which causes a lot of cache misses</li>
  <li>Applications use old PostgreSQL client drivers which don’t support prepared statements, e.g., Python’s <code>psycopg2</code> package</li>
</ol>

<p>The clock on Protobuf was ticking and we needed to act. So, like a lot of engineers these days, we asked an LLM to just do it for us.</p>

<h4 id="tight-constraints">Tight constraints</h4>

<p>I’m going to preface this section by saying that the vast majority of PgDog’s source code is written by a human. AI is not in a position to one-shot a connection pooler, load balancer and database sharder. However, when scoped to a very specific, well-defined and most importantly <em>machine-verifiable</em> task, it can work really well.</p>

<p>The prompt we started with was pretty straightforward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>libpg_query is a library that wraps the PostgreSQL parser in an API. pg_query.rs is a Rust wrapper around libpg_query which uses Protobuf for (de)serialization. Replace Protobuf with bindgen-generated Rust structs that map directly to the Postgres AST.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And after two days of back and forth between us and the machine, it worked. We ended up with 6,000 lines of recursive Rust that manually mapped C types and structs to Rust structs, and vice versa. We made the switch for <a href="https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.parse.html"><code>parse</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.deparse.html"><code>deparse</code></a> (used in our new query rewrite engine, which we’ll talk about in another post), <a href="https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.fingerprint.html"><code>fingerprint</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/fn.scan.html"><code>scan</code></a>. These four methods are heavily used in PgDog to make sharding work, and we immediately saw a 25% improvement in <em>pgbench</em> benchmarks<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Just to be clear: we had a lot of things going for us already that made this possible. First, <em>pg_query</em> has a Protobuf spec for <em>protoc</em> (and Prost, the Protobuf Rust implementation) to generate bindings, so Claude was able to get a comprehensive list of structs it needed to extract from C, along with the expected data types.</p>

<p>Second, <em>pg_query.rs</em> was already using bindgen, so we had to just copy/paste some invocations around to get the AST structs included in bindgen’s output.</p>

<p>And last, and definitely not least, <em>pg_query.rs</em> already had a working <code>parse</code> and <code>deparse</code> implementation, so we could test our AI-generated code against its output. This was entirely automated and verifiable: for each test case that used <code>parse</code>, we included a call to <code>parse_raw</code>, compared their results and if they differed by even one byte, Claude Code had to go back and try again.</p>

<h4 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h4>

<p>The translation code between Rust and C uses <code>unsafe</code> Rust functions that wrap Rust structs to C structs. The C structs are then passed to the Postgres/<em>libpg_query</em> C API which does the actual work of building the AST.</p>

<p>The result is converted back to Rust using a recursive algorithm: each node in the AST has its own converter function which accepts an <code>unsafe</code> C pointer and returns a safe Rust struct. Much like the name suggests, the AST is a tree, which is stored in an array:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>convert_list_to_raw_stmts</span><span>(</span>
    <span>list</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>bindings_raw</span><span>::</span><span>List</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>protobuf</span><span>::</span><span>RawStmt</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// C-to-Rust conversion.</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For each node in the list, the implementation calls <code>convert_node</code>, which then handles each one of the 100s of tokens available in the SQL grammar:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>unsafe</span> <span>fn</span> <span>convert_node</span><span>(</span>
    <span>node_ptr</span><span>:</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>bindings_raw</span><span>::</span><span>Node</span>
<span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>&lt;</span><span>protobuf</span><span>::</span><span>Node</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// This is basically C in Rust, so we better check for nulls!</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>node_ptr</span><span>.is_null</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>match</span> <span>(</span><span>*</span><span>node_ptr</span><span>)</span><span>.type_</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// SELECT statement root node.</span>
        <span>bindings_raw</span><span>::</span><span>NodeTag_T_SelectStmt</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>stmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>node_ptr</span> <span>as</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>bindings_raw</span><span>::</span><span>SelectStmt</span><span>;</span>
            <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>protobuf</span><span>::</span><span>node</span><span>::</span><span>Node</span><span>::</span><span>SelectStmt</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>convert_select_stmt</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;*</span><span>stmt</span><span>))))</span>
        <span>}</span>
        
        <span>// INSERT statement root node.</span>
        <span>bindings_raw</span><span>::</span><span>NodeTag_T_InsertStmt</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>let</span> <span>stmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>node_ptr</span> <span>as</span> <span>*</span><span>mut</span> <span>bindings_raw</span><span>::</span><span>InsertStmt</span><span>;</span>
            <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>protobuf</span><span>::</span><span>node</span><span>::</span><span>Node</span><span>::</span><span>InsertStmt</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>convert_insert_stmt</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;*</span><span>stmt</span><span>))))</span>
        <span>}</span>
        
        <span>// ... 100s more nodes.</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For nodes that contain other nodes, we recurse on <code>convert_node</code> again until the algorithm reaches the leaves (nodes with no children) and terminates. For nodes that contain scalars, like a number (e.g., <code>5</code>) or text (e.g., <code>'hello world'</code>), the data type is copied into a Rust analog, e.g., <code>i32</code> or <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>The end result is <a href="https://docs.rs/pg_query/latest/pg_query/protobuf/struct.ParseResult.html"><code>protobuf::ParseResult</code></a>, a Rust struct generated by Prost from the <em>pg_query</em> API Protobuf specification, but populated by native Rust code instead of Prost’s deserializer. Reusing existing structs reduces the chance of errors considerably: we can compare <code>parse</code> and <code>parse_raw</code> outputs, using the derived <code>PartialEq</code> trait, and ensure that both are identical, in testing.</p>

<p>While recursive algorithms have a questionable reputation in the industry because bad ones can cause stack overflows, they are very fast. Recursion requires no additional memory allocation because all of its working space, the stack, is created on program startup. It also has excellent CPU cache locality because the instructions for the next invocation of the same function are already in the CPU L1/L2/L3 cache. Finally and arguably more importantly, they are just easier to read and understand than iterative implementations, which helps us, the humans, with debugging.</p>

<p>Just for good measure, we tried generating an iterative algorithm, but it ended up being slower than Prost. The main cause (we think) was unnecessary memory allocations, hashmap lookups of previously converted nodes, and too much overhead from walking the tree several times. Meanwhile, recursion processes each AST node exactly once and uses the stack pointer to track its position in the tree. If you have any ideas on how to make an iterative algorithm work better, <a href="https://discord.gg/CcBZkjSJdd">let us know</a>!</p>

<h3 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h3>

<p>Reducing the overhead from using the Postgres parser in PgDog makes a huge difference for us. As a network proxy, our budget for latency, memory utilization, and CPU cycles is low. After all, we aren’t a real database…yet! This change improves performance from two angles: we use less CPU and we do less work, so PgDog is faster and cheaper to run.</p>

<p>If stuff like this is interesting to you, <a href="https://pgdog.dev/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#48202108382f2c272f662c2d3e">reach out</a>. We are looking for a Founding Software Engineer to help us grow and build the next iteration of horizontal scaling for PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>On Jan 14th <a href="https://proton.me/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Proton</a> sent out an email newsletter with the subject line:</p><blockquote><p>Introducing Projects - Try Lumo’s powerful new feature now</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/lumo-spam.avif" alt="screenshot of the official email from @lumo.proton.me" width="515" height="367" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-f8a652e2"><p popover="" id="--alt-f8a652e2" data-anchor="--img-f8a652e2">screenshot of the official email from @lumo.proton.me</p></figure><p>Lumo is Proton’s <glossary-term id="--term-ai"><a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">“AI”</a></glossary-term> offering.</p><p>There is a problem with this email. And I’m not talking about the question of how exactly AI aligns with Proton’s core values of <em>privacy</em> and <em>security</em>.</p><p>The problem is I had already <strong>explicitly</strong> opted out of Lumo emails.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/lumo-opt-out.avif" alt="screenshot of an unchecked toggle" width="235" height="55" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-d9cc8beb"><p popover="" id="--alt-d9cc8beb" data-anchor="--img-d9cc8beb">screenshot of an unchecked toggle</p></figure><p>That toggle for “Lumo product updates” is unchecked. Lumo is the only topic I’m not subscribed to. Proton has over a dozen newsletters, including some crypto nonsense. I opt-in to everything but Lumo, I gave an undeniable <strong>no</strong> to Lumo emails.</p><p>So the email I received from Proton is <strong>spam</strong>, right?</p><p>My understanding is that spam is a violation of GDPR and UK data protection laws. Regardless, Proton’s email is a clear abuse of their own service towards a paying business customer.</p><p>Before I grab my pitchfork I emailed Proton support.</p><h2 id="proton-support">Proton Support</h2><p>Despite the subject line and contents, and despite the “From Lumo” name and <code>@lumo.proton.me</code> address, maybe this was an honest mistake?</p><p>Proton’s first reply explained how to opt-out.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/proton-support-1.avif" alt="screenshot of support email quoted below" width="460" height="614" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-c8d2e805"><p popover="" id="--alt-c8d2e805" data-anchor="--img-c8d2e805">screenshot of support email quoted below</p><figcaption>I’ve blurred the name because whatever</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>Hello David,</p><p>Thank you for contacting us.</p><p>You can unsubscribe from the newsletters if you do the following:</p><p>- Log in to your account at https://account.protonvpn.com/login</p><p>- Navigate to the Account category</p><p>- Disable the check-marks under “Email subscriptions”</p><p>- If you need additional assistance, let me know.</p><p>[screenshot of the same opt-out toggle]</p><p>-Have a nice day.</p></blockquote><p><em>John Support</em> directs me to the exact same <em>“Lumo product updates”</em> toggle I had already unchecked. I replied explaining that I had <strong>already</strong> opted out. Support replies saying they’re <em>“checking this with the team”</em> then later replies again asking for screenshots.</p><blockquote><p>Can you make sure to send me a screenshot of this newsletter option disabled, as well as the date when the last message was sent to you regarding the Lumo offer?</p><p>You can send me a screenshot of the whole message, including the date.</p><p>Is it perhaps 14 January 2026 that you received the message?</p></blockquote><p>I found that last line curious, are they dealing with other unhappy customers? Maybe I’m reading too much into it.</p><p>I sent the screenshots and signed off with <em>“Don’t try to pretend this fits into another newsletter category.”</em></p><p>After more <em>“checking this with the team”</em> I got a response today.</p><blockquote><p>In this case, the mentioned newsletter is for promoting Lumo Business Suit to Business-related plans.</p><p>Hence, why you received it, as Product Updates and Email Subscription are two different things.</p><p>In the subscription section, you will see the “Email Subscription” category, where you can disable the newsletter in order to avoid getting it in the future.</p></blockquote><p>If I understand correctly, Proton are claiming this email is the <em>“Proton for Business newsletter”</em>. Not the <em>“Lumo product updates”</em> newsletter.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I think that’s baloney. Proton Support had five full business days to come up with a better excuse. Please tell me, how can I have been any more explicit about opting out of Lumo emails, only to receive “Try Lumo” “From Lumo”, and be told that is not actually a Lumo email?</p><h2 id="non-consent">Non-Consent</h2><p>Has anyone else noticed that the AI industry can’t take “no” for an answer? AI is being force-fed into every corner of tech. It’s unfathomable to them that some of us aren’t interested.</p><p>The entire AI industry is built upon a common principle of non-consent. They laugh in the face of IP and copyright law. AI bots <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/21831" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DDoS websites</a> and <a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">lie about user-agents</a>. Can it get worse than the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwy875j28k0o" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sickening actions of Grok?</a> I dread to think.</p><p>As Proton has demonstrated above, and <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2026-01-12T07:49Z/">Mozilla/Firefox</a> recently too, the AI industry simply will not accept “no” as an answer. Some examples like spam are more trivial than others, but the growing trend is vile and disturbing.</p><p>I do not want your AI.</p><h3 id="update-for-23rd-january">Update for 23rd January</h3><p>I guess someone at Microsoft read my post and said “hold my beer”. This morning I woke up to a lovely gift in my inbox; <em>“Build Al agents with the new GitHub Copilot SDK”</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/github-spam.avif" alt="GitHub email subject line: 'Build Al agents with the new GitHub Copilot SDK'" width="474" height="68" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-b61aec8e"><p popover="" id="--alt-b61aec8e" data-anchor="--img-b61aec8e">GitHub email subject line: 'Build Al agents with the new GitHub Copilot SDK'</p></figure><p><a href="https://dbushell.com/2025/08/11/github-ensloppification/">GitHub Ensloppification</a> is moving faster than I can delete my account for good. (It’s an unfortunate requirement for client projects.) For the record, I have <em>never</em> said “yes” to any GitHub newsletter. Even before Copilot I disabled every possible GitHub email notification.</p><p>The “Unsubscribe” link provides the hidden newsletter list. There is nothing within GitHub account settings I can find to disable spam.</p><figure><img src="https://dbushell.com/images/blog/2026/github-newsletters.avif" alt="GitHub 'Opt-Out Preferences' with 3 newsletters unchecked but GitHub Copilot emails checked" width="524" height="814" decoding="async" fetchpriority="low" loading="lazy" id="--img-c9841fd3"><p popover="" id="--alt-c9841fd3" data-anchor="--img-c9841fd3">GitHub 'Opt-Out Preferences' with 3 newsletters unchecked but GitHub Copilot emails checked</p></figure><p>As expected, Microsoft has opted me in without my consent. The wheels are falling off at GitHub. The brutally slow front-end UI. The embarrassingly lacklustre <em>Actions</em> CI. Now this sloppy tripe everywhere. Reminder to developers: <strong>GitHub is not Git.</strong></p>
