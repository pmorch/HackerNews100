<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p dir="ltr">The FCC is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/april-2024-open-commission-meeting">set to vote on April 25</a> to restore its authority over the companies we pay to get online, and reinstate federal net neutrality protections that were jettisoned by the Trump administration in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Net neutrality protections are supposed to ensure that we, not the internet service providers (ISPs) we pay to get online, get to decide what we do online.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC released <a href="http://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf">its draft rules</a> early in April and there’s much to celebrate in them. Mobile carriers like T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon that have been degrading video quality for mobile users will have to stop. The FCC kept in place state neutrality protections like California’s net neutrality law, allowing for layers of enforcement. The FCC also made it harder for ISPs to evade net neutrality at the point where data enters their networks.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>However, there’s a huge problem: the proposed rules make it possible for mobile ISPs to start picking applications and putting them in a fast lane - where they’ll perform better generally and much better if the network gets congested.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-expands-worlds-first-network-slicing-beta-nationwide">T-Mobile</a>, <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/oss-bss-cx/at-t-tests-gaming-traffic-prioritization-amid-net-neutrality-debate">AT&amp;T</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carriers-look-to-offer-fast-lane-access-on-5g-networks-0ab57bcc">Verizon</a> are all testing ways to create these 5G fast lanes for apps such as video conferencing, games, and video where the ISP chooses and controls what gets boosted. They use a technical feature in 5G called network slicing, where part of their radio spectrum gets used as a special lane for the chosen app or apps, separated from the usual internet traffic.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The FCC’s draft order opens the door to these fast lanes, so long as the app provider isn’t charged for them.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">That means we could soon see fast lane offerings like this:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile2.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Or we could see add-ons like Enhanced Video Conferencing for $10 a month, or one-time 24-hour passes to have Prioritized Online Gaming.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile1.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">This isn't imagination.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The ISPs write about this in their blogs and press releases. They talk about these efforts and dreams openly at conferences, and their equipment vendors plainly lay out how ISPs can chop up internet service into all manner of fast lanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>These kinds of ISP-controlled fast lanes violate core net neutrality principles and would limit user choice, distort competition, hamper startups, and help cement platform dominance.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Net neutrality means that we, the people who use the internet, get to decide what we do online, without interference from ISPs. ISPs do not get to interfere with our choices by blocking, speeding up or slowing down apps or kinds of apps. Apps compete on a level playing field, and users, not ISPs, determine which apps are successful.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Letting ISPs decide which apps get to be in a fast lane violates these principles. Apps that are in a fast lane work better than those that are not, especially when the network is busy and apps in the regular lane start suffering. If HBO Max is in a fast lane, it will continue to work well even if the network is busy, while all other video is buffering.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Differences in performance, including relative differences in performance, matter. Even small differences in load times affect how long people stay on a site, how much they pay, and whether they’ll come back. Those differences also affect how high up sites show in search results.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Thus, letting ISPs choose which apps get to be in a fast lane lets them, not users, pick winners and losers online.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">And <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2022/05/facebook-google-big-telecoms-want-keep-violating-net-neutrality-europe-regulators">as we’ve seen in the past</a>, programs like this favor the most popular apps, even when the program is supposedly open to all apps in a category and no apps are paying the ISP. So the biggest apps will end up in all the fast lanes, while most others would be left out. The ones left out would likely include messaging apps like Signal, local news sites, decentralized Fediverse apps like Mastodon and PeerTube, niche video sites like Dropout, indie music sites like Bandcamp, and the millions of other sites and apps in the long tail.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Legislators, government agencies, attorneys general in states both red and blue, public interest groups, startups, and open-source technologists are all working to reduce the power and dominance of the biggest platforms. The FCC should be working to help that effort by creating a level playing field and banning these ISP-controlled 5G fast lanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Meaningful net neutrality protections prohibit ISPs from speeding up and slowing down apps and kinds of apps.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">ISPs can pick winners and losers by putting winners in a fast lane or losers in a slow lane.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a what it would look like if an ISP put everything except YouTube and TikTok in a slow lane.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile4.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">This is what it would look like if an ISP put YouTube and TikTok in a fast lane.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img p="" src="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/20240411-mobile4.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s the same picture. The effect is the same. In either case, disfavored apps will find it harder to compete.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meaningful net neutrality protections need to protect against both.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>This is not controversial.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">President Obama’s <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/net-neutrality">November 2014 net neutrality proposal</a> included this protection:</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The rules I am asking for are simple, common-sense steps that reflect the Internet you and I use every day.” That included, he said, a brightline ban on ISPs “intentionally slow[ing] down some content or speed[ing] up others — through a process often called “throttling” — based on the type of service or your ISP’s preferences.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even proposed <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/6393">Republican</a> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1101/text?s=1&amp;r=98">net neutrality</a> <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/files/RepublicanNetworkNeutralityBill-BILLS-114hr-PIH-OpenInternet.pdf">bills</a> prohibited ISPs from speeding up and slowing down apps and kinds of apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Many, including me, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/104020490613577/2">thought the 2015 Order did so</a>, too.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Almost certainly, the millions of Americans who celebrated the 2015 Open Internet Order and fought the 2017 repeal think that net neutrality protections ban fast lanes and slow lanes.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The draft order takes a different approach.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The no-throttling rule that the FCC proposed in October explicitly prohibited ISPs from slowing down apps and classes of apps; it was silent on whether the rule also applies to speeding up.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given the mobile ISPs’ public statements about their plans for 5G fast lanes, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10328020156846/1">public</a> <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10401332717347/1">interest</a> <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10330745507976/1">groups</a>, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1215041660232/1">startups</a>, and <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_to_fcc_title_ii_4224.pdf">members of Congress</a> asked the FCC to clarify in the Order that the no-throttling rule also prohibits ISPs from speeding up apps and classes of apps.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>The draft order did not do that.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-401676A1.pdf">draft order</a> acknowledges that some speeding up of apps could violate the no-throttling rule, it added some unclear, nebulous language suggesting that the FCC would review any fast lanes case-by-case, without explaining how it would do that.<sup><a href="#one">1</a></sup> This language gives the FCC maximum flexibility to accept or reject specific fast lanes in the future as it sees fit.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the draft order, the agency “could” find a violation of the no-throttling rule, if:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">an ISP speeds up specific apps (but not necessarily classes of apps), and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the decision to speed up is “unreasonably discriminatory,” and</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">the speeding up has the effect of “‘impair[ing] or degrad[ing]’ other … apps not given the same treatment.”&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In other words, the proposed no-throttling rule is a bright line rule for slow lanes – ISPs can’t slow down apps or kinds of apps; but for fast lanes, it’s a fuzzy, unclear case-by-case standard.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">For example, would it be “unreasonably discriminatory” to create a 5G fast lane that includes the most popular apps in a category since it responds to consumer preferences? Does an unreasonably discriminatory fast lane need to technically degrade or impair the apps that are not in the fast lane for the FCC to find a violation of the no-throttling rule?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>There is no way to predict which kinds of fast lanes the FCC might ultimately find to violate the no-throttling rule. This gives ISPs cover to flood the market with various fast-lane offerings, arguing that their version does not violate the no-throttling rule and daring the FCC to enforce its rule.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">And if the mobile ISPs do this, the cable companies will soon follow. Cable companies have the tech to build their own fast lanes, and increasingly they compete with 5G to the Home services. If T-Mobile and Verizon start selling home plans that have “enhanced streaming video,” you can bet the cable companies will launch their own version.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC would then investigate these offerings case-by-case in lengthy and costly proceedings. In the meantime, apps that are not in the fast lane will suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Entrepreneurs and application providers that are not included in a fast lane will have to decide whether to try to get into the fast lane, file an FCC complaint, or just silently suffer.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Companies that do file complaints will waste years litigating the meaning of “unreasonably discriminatory,” all the while going up against giant telecoms that stockpile lawyers and lobbyists.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unless you are a high-paid telecom lawyer who bills by the hour, the proposed test for what’s a good or bad fast lane is a nightmare.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Not all 5G slices are harmful.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Just to be clear, net neutrality proponents are not asking the FCC to ban network slicing. There’s lots of ways for ISPs to use slices for things that are not normal internet service such as a dedicated slice for a farming operation using remote controlled tractors, slices for telemetry data and oversight of autonomous cars, or providing a slice for a stadium’s video system at a crowded game.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are good reasons to isolate this kind of traffic, and it can be done without reducing user choice or tilting the online playing field. Under the FCC’s draft order, such services would be so-called enterprise service offerings, to which the Open Internet protections don’t apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But the 5G fast lanes ISPs are imagining for regular internet access – where ISPs decide which apps or kind of apps get a fast lane – would cause real harm and violate the core tenets of net neutrality.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">We don’t need our ISP deciding for us what’s important and what’s not; we want our ISP to let us decide and stick to the job of connecting our devices to the services we want to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It’s not even clear why such fast lanes are necessary for consumer internet access. As one industry analyst noted, isn’t 5G already supposed to be the fast lane for everything?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Luckily, there’s still time to fix this.</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC can and should edit the draft order ahead of the vote on April 24 and clarify in the Order that the no-throttling rule also prohibits ISPs from creating fast lanes for select apps or kinds of apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The FCC just needs to put this fix in the fast lane to get it done before it votes on April 25.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/promoting-fast-open-and-fair-internet">2024 Draft Order</a>, para. 492 (“Our interpretation of “throttling” encompasses a wide variety of conduct that could impair or degrade an end user’s ability to access content of their choosing; thus, we decline commenters’ request to modify the rule to explicitly include positive and negative discrimination of content. We agree, however, with Free Press that a BIAS provider’s “unreasonably discriminatory” decision to speed up specific content, applications, or services could “impair or degrade” other content, applications, or services not given the same treatment.” (footnotes omitted)).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s talk about tree-shaking!</p><h3>looking up from the trough</h3><p>But first, I need to talk about WebAssembly’s dirty secret: despite the
hype, WebAssembly has had limited success on the web.</p><p>There is
<a href="https://medium.com/@addyosmani/photoshop-is-now-on-the-web-38d70954365a">Photoshop</a>,
which does appear to be a real success.  5 years ago there was
<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-faster/">Figma</a>, though they don’t
talk much about Wasm these days.  There are quite a number of little NPM
libraries that use Wasm under the hood, usually compiled from C++ or
Rust.  I think
<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor">Blazor</a>
probably gets used for a few in-house corporate apps, though I could be
fooled by their marketing.</p><p>You might recall the hyped demos of 3D first-person-shooter
games with Unreal engine again from 5 years ago, but that was the previous major release of
Unreal and was always experimental; the current Unreal 5 does not support targetting
WebAssembly.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I think WebAssembly is great.  It is having fine
success in off-the-web environments, and I think it is going to be a key
and growing part of the Web platform.  I suspect, though, that we are
only just now getting past the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle">trough of
disillusionment</a>.</p><p>It’s worth reflecting a bit on the nature of web Wasm’s successes and
failures.  Taking Photoshop as an example, I think we can say that Wasm
does very well at bringing large C++ programs to the web.  I know that
it took quite some work, but I understand the end result to be
essentially the same source code, just compiled for a different target.</p><p>Similarly for the JavaScript module case, Wasm finds success in getting
legacy C++ code to the web, and as a way to write new web-targetting
Rust code.  These are often tasks that JavaScript doesn’t do very well
at, or which need a shared implementation between client and server
deployments.</p><p>On the other hand, WebAssembly has not been a Web success for DOM-heavy
apps.  Nobody is talking about rewriting the front-end of 
<a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a> in Wasm, for example.  Why is
that?  It may sound like a silly question to you: Wasm just isn’t good
at that stuff.  But <i>why</i>?  If you dig down a bit, I think it’s that the
programming models are just too different: the Web’s primary programming
model is JavaScript, a language with dynamic typing and managed memory,
whereas WebAssembly 1.0 was about static typing and linear memory.
Getting to the DOM from Wasm was a hassle that was overcome only by the
most ardent of the true Wasm faithful.</p><p>Relatedly, Wasm has also not really been a success for languages that
aren’t, like, C or Rust.  I am guessing that wordpress.com isn’t written
mostly in C++.  One of the sticking points for this class of language.
is that C#, for example, will want to ship with a garbage collector, and
that it is annoying to have to do this.  Check my <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/03/20/a-world-to-win-webassembly-for-the-rest-of-us">article from March
this year for more
details</a>.</p><p>Happily, this restriction is going away, as all browsers are going to
ship support for reference types and garbage collection within the next
months; Chrome and Firefox already ship Wasm GC, and Safari shouldn’t be
far behind thanks to the efforts from my colleague Asumu Takikawa.  This
is an extraordinarily exciting development that I think will kick off a
whole ‘nother Gartner hype cycle, as more languages start to update
their toolchains to support WebAssembly.</p><h3>if you don’t like my peaches</h3><p>Which brings us to the meat of today’s note: web Wasm will win where
compilers create compact code.  If your language’s compiler toolchain
can manage to produce useful Wasm in a file that is less than a handful
of over-the-wire kilobytes, you can win.  If your compiler can’t do that
yet, you will have to instead rely on hype and captured audiences for
adoption, which at best results in an unstable equilibrium until you
figure out what’s next.</p><p>In the JavaScript world, managing bloat and deliverable size is a huge
industry.  Bundlers like <a href="https://esbuild.github.io/">esbuild</a> are a
ubiquitous part of the toolchain, compiling down a set of JS modules to
a single file that should include only those functions and data types
that are used in a program, and additionally applying domain-specific
size-squishing strategies such as minification (making monikers more
minuscule).</p><p>Let’s focus on tree-shaking.  The visual metaphor is that you write a
bunch of code, and you only need some of it for any given page.  So you
imagine a tree whose, um, branches are the modules that you use, and
whose leaves are the individual definitions in the modules, and you then
violently shake the tree, probably killing it and also annoying any
nesting birds.  The only thing that’s left still attached is what is
actually needed.</p><p>This isn’t how trees work: holding the trunk doesn’t give you
information as to which branches are somehow necessary for the tree’s
mission.  It also <a href="https://pvk.ca/Blog/2012/02/19/fixed-points-and-strike-mandates/">primes your mind to look for the wrong fixed
point</a>,
removing unneeded code instead of keeping only the necessary code.</p><p>But, tree-shaking is an evocative name, and so despite its horticultural
and algorithmic inaccuracies, we will stick to it.</p><p>The thing is that maximal tree-shaking for languages with a thicker
run-time has not been a huge priority.  Consider Go: <a href="https://zchee.github.io/golang-wiki/WebAssembly/">according to the
golang wiki</a>, the most
trivial program compiled to WebAssembly from Go is 2 megabytes, and
adding imports can make this go to 10 megabytes or more.  Or look at
Pyodide, the Python WebAssembly port: the <a href="https://pyodide.org/en/stable/console.html">REPL
example</a> downloads about 20
megabytes of data.  These are fine sizes for technology demos or, in the
limit, very rich applications, but they aren’t winners for web
development.</p><h3>shake a different tree</h3><p>To be fair, both the built-in Wasm support for Go and the Pyodide port
of Python both derive from the upstream toolchains, where producing
small binaries is nice but not necessary: on a server, who cares how big
the app is?  And indeed when targetting smaller devices, we tend to see
alternate implementations of the toolchain, for example
<a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/tinygo-org/tinygo">TinyGo</a>.  TinyGo has a Wasm
back-end that can apparently go down to less than a kilobyte, even!</p><p>These alternate toolchains often come with <a href="https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/lang-support/">some restrictions or
peculiarities</a>, and
although we can consider this to be an evil of sorts, it is to be
expected that the target platform exhibits some co-design feedback on
the language.  In particular, running in the sea of the DOM is
sufficiently weird that a Wasm-targetting Python program will
necessarily be different than a “native” Python program.  Still, I think
as toolchain authors we aim to provide the same language, albeit
possibly with a different implementation of the standard library.  I am
sure that the ClojureScript developers would prefer to remove their
<a href="https://clojurescript.org/about/differences">page documenting the differences with
Clojure</a> if they could, and
perhaps if Wasm becomes a viable target for Clojurescript, they will.</p><h3>on the algorithm</h3><p>To recap: now that it supports GC, Wasm could be a winner for web
development in Python and other languages.  You would need a different
toolchain and an effective tree-shaking algorithm, so that user
experience does not degrade.  So let’s talk about tree shaking!</p><p>I work on the <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot/">Hoot Scheme
compiler</a>, which targets Wasm
with GC.  We manage to get down to 70 kB or so right now, in the minimal
“main” compilation unit, and are aiming for lower; auxiliary compilation
units that import run-time facilities (the current exception handler and
so on) from the main module can be sub-kilobyte.  Getting here has been
tricky though, and I think it would be even trickier for Python.</p><p>Some background: <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/11/16/a-whiff-of-whiffle">like
Whiffle</a>,
the Hoot compiler prepends a
<a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot/-/blob/main/module/hoot/prelude.scm">prelude</a>
onto user code.  Tree-shakind happens in a number of places:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile.git/tree/module/language/tree-il/peval.scm">partial
evaluation</a>
will evaluate unused bindings for effect, possibly eliding them</p></li><li><p><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile.git/tree/module/language/tree-il/fix-letrec.scm">fixing
letrec</a>
will do the same</p></li><li><p>CPS frequently traverses the program, following only referenced
function, value, and control edges, e.g. via
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile.git/tree/module/language/cps/renumber.scm">renumbering</a></p></li><li><p>There is an explicit <a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guile.git/tree/module/language/cps/dce.scm">dead-code
elimination</a>
pass which tries to elide unused effect-free allocations, a situation
that can arise due to other optimizations</p></li><li><p>Finally there is a <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot/-/blob/main/module/hoot/stdlib.scm?ref_type=heads">standard library written in raw-ish
WebAssembly</a>,
whose definitions (globals, tables, imports, functions, etc) are
included in the residual binary <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot/-/blob/main/module/wasm/link.scm?ref_type=heads">only as
neeeded</a>.</p></li></ul><p>Generally speaking, procedure definitions (functions / closures) are the
easy part: you just include only those functions that are referenced by
the code.  In a language like Scheme, this gets you a long way.</p><p>However there are three immediate challenges.  One is that the
evaluation model for the definitions in the prelude is <tt>letrec*</tt>: the
scope is recursive but ordered.  Binding values can call or refer to
previously defined values, or capture values defined later.  If
evaluating the value of a binding requires referring to a value only
defined later, then that’s an error.  Again, for procedures this is
trivially OK, but as soon as you have non-procedure definitions,
sometimes the compiler won’t be able to prove this nice “only refers to
earlier bindings” property.  In that case the <a href="https://legacy.cs.indiana.edu/~dyb/pubs/letrec-reloaded-abstract.html">fixing <tt>letrec</tt>
(reloaded)</a>
algorithm will end up residualizing bindings that are <tt>set!</tt>, which of
all the tree-shaking passes above require the delicate DCE pass to
remove them.</p><p>Worse, some of those non-procedure definitions are <i>record types</i>, which
have vtables that define how to print a record, how to check if a value
is an instance of this record, and so on.  These vtable callbacks can
end up keeping a lot more code alive even if they are never used.  We’ll
get back to this later.</p><p>Similarly, say you print a string via
<a href="https://www.r6rs.org/final/html/r6rs-lib/r6rs-lib-Z-H-9.html#node_idx_832"><tt>display</tt></a>.
Well now not only are you bringing in the whole buffered I/O facility,
but you are also calling a highly polymorphic function: <tt>display</tt> can
print anything.  There’s a case for bitvectors, so you pull in code for
bitvectors.  There’s a case for pairs, so you pull in that code too.
And so on.</p><p>One solution is to instead call <tt>write-string</tt>, which only writes
strings and not general data.  You’ll still get the generic buffered I/O
facility (ports), though, even if your program only uses one kind of
port.</p><p>This brings me to my next point, which is that optimal tree-shaking is a
flow analysis problem.  Consider <tt>display</tt>: if we know that a program
will never have bitvectors, then any code in <tt>display</tt> that works on
bitvectors is dead and we can fold the branches that guard it.  But to
know this, we have to know what kind of arguments <tt>display</tt> is called
with, and for that we need <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2014/07/01/flow-analysis-in-guile">higher-level flow
analysis</a>.</p><p>The problem is exacerbated for Python in a few ways.  One, because
<a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/implementation-of-kcfa-and-0cfa/">object-oriented dispatch is higher-order
programming</a>.
How do you know what <tt>foo.bar</tt> actually means?  Depends on <tt>foo</tt>, which
means you have to thread around representations of what <tt>foo</tt> might be
everywhere and to everywhere’s caller and everywhere’s caller’s caller
and so on.</p><p>Secondly, lookup in Python is generally more dynamic than in Scheme: you
have <tt>__getattr__</tt> methods (is that it?; been a while since I’ve done
Python) everywhere and users might indeed use them.  Maybe this is not
so bad in practice and flow analysis can exclude this kind of dynamic
lookup.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps relatedly, the object of tree-shaking in Python is
a mess of modules, rather than a big term with lexical bindings.  This
is like JavaScript, but without the established ecosystem of
tree-shaking bundlers; Python has its work cut out for some years to go.</p><h3>in short</h3><p>With GC, Wasm makes it thinkable to do DOM programming in languages
other than JavaScript.  It will only be feasible for mass use, though,
if the resulting Wasm modules are small, and that means significant
investment on each language’s toolchain.  Often this will take the form
of alternate toolchains that incorporate experimental tree-shaking
algorithms, and whose alternate standard libraries facilitate the
tree-shaker.</p><p>Welp, I’m off to lunch.  Happy wassembling, comrades!</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>“The best knowledge of what France is able to do is on this vessel,” said Jacques Barreau, CEO and Founder of Grain de Sail in France. <em>Grain de Sail ll </em>is the newest member of the company’s fleet of cargo sailboats. It stretches 52 meters, more than twice as long as <a href="https://untappedcities.com/2021/05/13/chocolate-wine-tasting-sailboat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its predecessor.</a> It can travel to New York from Saint-Malo, France in about 18 days. </p>

<p>Grain de Sail’s cross-Atlantic voyages rely entirely on wind energy. The company’s mission is to empower zero-emission shipping with “retro-innovation,” blending ancestral technology with modern technology. This commitment to low emissions provides sustainable shipment options for Grain de Sail’s coffee, cacao, and wine brands, and other businesses that can now ship their products without contributing to worldwide maritime shipping’s global CO2 and methane emissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to traditional cargo shipping, the process of unloading goods from Grain de Sail vessels averages about five days faster. This is because the sailboats have cranes directly on the deck. Thus, they can avoid harbor congestion and the long, strenuous process. Instead of taking 30-35 days to unload, Grain de Sail vessels take about 20 days.</p>

<p>Grain de Sail was founded in 2010 by two twin brothers, Olivier and Jacques Barreau, who are renewable energy experts from France. The company’s inception stemmed from its goal to reduce the carbon footprint of maritime transportation.&nbsp;<a href="https://untappedcities.com/2020/08/20/schooner-apollonia-brings-freight-by-sail-to-nyc-for-first-time-in-a-century/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wind</a>&nbsp;is a reliable, savvy alternative to the high environmental costs of fossil fuels. Grain de Sail also emphasizes its promise to preserve the quality of goods, so you’re introduced to one of the only floating wine cellars. To properly maintain the quality of the bottles, the vessel is fitted with temperature and humidity control features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We must shift our focus on the quality rather than quantity,” said Barreau. “We must change our mindset to products that last longer and generate less pressure on the environment.”</p>

<p>In New York City,&nbsp;<a href="https://graindesail-overseas.com/search-retailers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several retailers</a>&nbsp;sell goods delivered from the Grain de Sail. Not only can you support local businesses, but your conscious buying is helping to decarbonize shipping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the ship leaves New York City on April 15, 2024, <em>Grain de Sail ll</em> will return to France, loaded with various goods. This is the first load of many for the <em>Grain de Sail ll</em>. In total, this vessel plans to sail the seas five times a year, trekking from France to New York and then down through the Caribbean, where the sailboat will dispatch humanitarian aid, working alongside local NGOs. The sailboat will also restock its coffee and cacao supply on its journey through the Caribbean. That supply is then brought back across the sea to France, where the coffee is roasted, and fine chocolates are produced.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Professionally I've only ever worked in c# code bases. Obviously a lot of projects had a js SPA frontend attached, but I wasnt on that side.</p>

<p>I'm branching out into other languages, I'm pretty involved in reading newest tech twitter stuff, articles, youtube videos etc.</p>

<p>I get hit by incredible "what is going on, I had this in .net for  years, i dont even know how any ecosystem exists without it" more and more recently. How do others feel about this?</p>

<p>Some examples: </p>

<p>I just watched this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB9tEQYLPL4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zB9tEQYLPL4</a>. Appearantly go + htmx have managed to recreate razor or blazor templates and people are gushing about how insane it is that they ALMOST make it typesafe. Its not really typesafe, more like typescript where its autocomplete, but not real.</p>

<p>I remember reading about one of the top javascript ORMs. Drizzle? People realized that it actually queried the entire database in the background and then did in memory query operations in its rust engine??? Generally I have to ignore any "ORM bad" comments people make, because I know their ORMs are actually bad. Its l ike using the original ef at best.</p>

<p>Build stuff and configuration in javascript specifically. In .net its so easy I don't even know what happens. It just works. I press F5 locally and I put it in whatever pipeline for production.Javascript mains just go babel webpack, they have conflicts, c make, i dont know whats going on...</p>

<p>The react server component meme a couple of months back where everyone was freaking out about either how insane it is or how insanely unsafe it is for sql injection. We had it in blazor for years.</p>

<p>Debugging... do I even need to say anything? There are unironic articles out there advocating for print debugging over attaching a debugger. Probably because it has actually some validity in other languages where you not just click the line number and smash F5.</p>

<p>I do like some things from other languages. I think just writing UIs in react, pressing strg s and instantly seeing the result is amazing. Much better than the blazor or razor dev experience.I like ... "hardcoded string options" as actual types. Its like enums but nicer I think. Dont know what that feature is actually called.</p>

<p>I also really like the typescript type magic. Autogenerating a type based on one object. Extending that type with 2 properties in 1 line and using that one. I miss that in c#. But in general these are small nice to haves, not "bro how do you even exist? How can some smart people not just steal ef core 1:1 for rust, go or js?"</p>

<p>I dont really know if I have a question. It just seems to me that these devs with a supposed breadth of knowledge are all missing the .net part. It feels like a weird island. It really feels like a waste.</p>

The publisher has revoked its licence for those who owned it on Ubisoft Connect, almost destroying fan ambitions to revive the game in both an offline and online format.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-crew-removed-from-sale-will-become-unplayable-after-april-1-we-understand-this-may-be-disappointing-for-players-still-enjoying-the-game/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-crew-removed-from-sale-will-become-unplayable-after-april-1-we-understand-this-may-be-disappointing-for-players-still-enjoying-the-game/">The Crew was pulled from sale</a> back in December, with Ubisoft revealing that the servers would be shut down at the beginning of April. Frustratingly, despite a large portion of the game being doable in singleplayer, The Crew remained an online-only endeavour throughout its decade-long lifespan. That had already rendered the game unplayable, but it seems Ubisoft is determined to take things one step further to stamp out any attempts to continue playing it past its expiry date.</p><p>Fans began to notice earlier in the week that the licence to the game had been snatched away from them. A message at the top of the game's library page reads, "You no longer have access to this game. Why not check the Store to pursue your adventures?" It's also been moved to its own individual section in player libraries, listed under "inactive games". Apparently booting the game directly from the installation directory will still launch the game, but only in a demo mode.</p><p>The news has, unsurprisingly, gone down very poorly. "This was the saddest and most ruthless decision I've ever seen in gaming history," one Redditor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz59uec/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz59uec/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">commented</a> after a screenshot began circulating on the site. "I will always fight for digital media, I love all the advantages it gives to users all around the world. But this… we need protection on the national or European level, that when we purchase something, we need to have lifetime access to it. No matter what."</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-320-80.jpg" alt="Ubisoft Connect's store which shows that the licence for The Crew has been revoked." srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WwZW7q7tmf8uJ4BXNCcnoi.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ubisoft)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A further Reddit user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4rn3d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4rn3d/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">called it</a> "really abhorrent behavior that needs to stop being legal," with another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4q9er/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1c1la9j/comment/kz4q9er/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">writing</a>, "In an ideal world, revoking a license like this should entitle the buyer to a refund.

I asked project member ChemicalFlood how it had impacted their plans:</p><p><em>"We are deeply saddened by Ubisoft's choice to start revoking licences to this game when people have paid hard-earned cash for it," he told me. "In regard to the project, yes! We are currently working on a Server Emulator as opposed to cracking the game. Before the shutdown of the servers, we took the precaution of capturing Network Communications Data. Had we not done this, the project would [have] sadly fallen over and this game would [have] been lost forever.</em></p><p><em>"Thankfully, a server emulation is still possible. But no other patch is possible due to the high amount of DRM placed into the game by Ubisoft, which sadly has restricted our ability to work on a fix, but not impossible!"</em></p><p>I also asked ChemicalFlood how the news had gone down with fans and The Crew Unlimited Discord:&nbsp;</p><p><em>"Obviously, Ubisoft pulling the game licences has left a sour taste in every gamer's mouth and it has unfortunately made it so the game cannot even be launched without it turning into a restricted trial mode. However, we can bypass this new change made by them without having to modify the existing game files, so the project is still on track!</em></p><p><em>"It should go without saying that, by any means, the fact that the community has to implement something like this to continue playing something we all paid for is abysmal, especially something of this magnitude. We of course love the game and want it to be played for generations to come (my own son loved playing this on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/playstation/" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/tag/playstation/">PlayStation</a>, 'loved' being the keyword!)

I'll be interested to know if the publisher provides any solid reason for being extra thorough with its shutdown process. There's a good chance it has something to do with licensing—there are a good deal of licensed songs in The Crew, not to mention all of the real-world car manufacturers present, too. It could make for a sticky situation keeping the files around, and perhaps it was easier to try and kill the whole thing instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the reason, it's an ever-looming reminder of how fragile digital ownership can be. A study by the Video Game History Foundation last year found that around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/study-finds-over-87-percent-of-games-are-unplayable-without-resorting-to-piracy-scavenger-hunts-or-travelling-to-an-archive/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/study-finds-over-87-percent-of-games-are-unplayable-without-resorting-to-piracy-scavenger-hunts-or-travelling-to-an-archive/">87% of games are unplayable</a> without diving into some kind of piracy or fan-created archive, and that number could even worsen as physical discs slowly die out. But preservation is becoming a bigger topic, one that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/preserving-old-games-was-seen-as-a-non-commercial-art-project-until-recently-says-nightdive-director-they-were-great-then-and-theyre-great-now-and-companies-have-begun-to-realize-that/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/preserving-old-games-was-seen-as-a-non-commercial-art-project-until-recently-says-nightdive-director-they-were-great-then-and-theyre-great-now-and-companies-have-begun-to-realize-that/">now being taken more seriously</a> as a means of conserving the medium.</p><p>Earlier this month, YouTuber Ross Scott <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/stop-killing-games-campaign/" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/stop-killing-games-campaign/">launched a campaign</a> called "Stop Killing Games" with The Crew as its primary example. His hope is to eventually win a legal victory that would require publishers to keep their live service games playable in some form after they end support, such as by releasing private servers.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We analyze how well pre-trained large language models (e.g., Llama2, GPT-4, Claude 3, etc) can do linear and non-linear regression when given in-context examples, without any additional training or gradient updates. Our findings reveal that several large language models (e.g., GPT-4, Claude 3) are able to perform regression tasks with a performance rivaling (or even outperforming) that of traditional supervised methods such as Random Forest, Bagging, or Gradient Boosting. For example, on the challenging Friedman #2 regression dataset, Claude 3 outperforms many supervised methods such as AdaBoost, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, or Gradient Boosting. We then investigate how well the performance of large language models scales with the number of in-context exemplars. We borrow from the notion of regret from online learning and empirically show that LLMs are capable of obtaining a sub-linear regret.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Police in Japan have arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of selling illegally modified Pokémon save data to customers online — a practice which is banned under the country’s <a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/en/laws/view/3629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 Unfair Competition Prevention Act</a>.</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/lnews/kochi/20240410/8010020207.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese website NHK News</a>, and translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hacked-pokemon-seller-arrested-by-japanese-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, the suspect was apprehended by police on April 9 after a ‘police cyber patrol’ discovered evidence that the individual had used special tools to illegally modify save data for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-violet">Pokémon Violet</a> in order to change Pokémon move sets.A 36-year-old man was arrest for selling illegally modified Pokemon save data.</p><p>The 36-year-old allegedly took custom orders for rare Pokémon, and sold the resulting tampered data between December 2022 to March 2023, for up to 13,000 yen ($84) a time on a website that served as a marketplace for video game assets and items. He also offered deals in which six Pokémon would be created for the equivalent of roughly $30 in yen.</p><p>The 36-year-old has reportedly admitted to committing the crimes at the heart of the ongoing investigation, while providing the justification that he did it to earn a living. According to Automaton, the suspect could face up to five years imprisonment, and/or a fine of up to 5 million yen (over $32,600).</p><p>This isn’t the first time that criminals have sought to make money off of Game Freak’s wildly popular franchise. For example, In 2021 an ill-fated Pokemon card heist saw one desperate man <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/man-arrested-after-literal-pokemon-card-heist?_gl=1*17zenfa*_up*MQ..*_ga*MTg2MzE0MTUzOC4xNzEyODUwNTk0*_ga_736S6FVMCL*MTcxMjg1MDU5My4xLjAuMTcxMjg1MDU5My4wLjAuMA..">attempt to descend from a six-story building in order to steal a treasure trove of trading cards</a> and cash from a Tokyo store. </p><p>2022 saw the trend continue, with criminals in Tokyo committing a series of high-value Pokemon burglaries, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan">including one instance in which theives made off with a haul of cards worth over $60,000</a>. Its worth noting that the raw last for Pokemon — and the trouble it can land you in — is felt well beyond the criminal fraternity.

<div><p>As should be expected, a number of individuals have come forward with responses to the <a href="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/5587" data-type="link" data-id="http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/5587">initial blog post</a>. While I do not expect everyone to take even a passing interest in the rabbit-hole of the situation or the context, I figured it was worth writing a few quick addendums.</p><p>Naturally, as is the case when you post anything anywhere in public, I am called a liar. I’ll simply say that everything I describe in the blog entry happened. I contacted a VCF administrator and was told it was all disposed of, and that they kept the bins. I am fine with people claiming that disposal was not what happened, but this is what I was told, directly, in human words. The fact that I am seeing contradictory and confusing descriptions of what happened is not a checkmark destined for the Win column.</p></div>



<p>A few people have rushed to indicate that I need to be more careful describing “which” VCF entity is at fault. I am sad to report to them all that the Byzantine VCF structure of name licensing, geographic branding, and internal corporate entity is meaningless to anyone six inches away. You all know each other and you all interchangeably use nomenclature. If you are part of an organization that calls itself some form of “VCF” and need an opportunity to write a statement about how your organization in a solitary/separate entity and should be considered more worthy or ethical than others, feel absolutely free.</p>



<p>A small sliver of people were concerned I was saying that I was never going to go to any computer history conference or event again. I am a free person with the freedom to attend whatever is open to the public. As it stood, however, VCF East was the easiest event for me to attend, so it was where I saw people the most. A minor point is that I considered attendance a form of endorsement, but that is my own personal choice. The chances of me attending other events is, like death by cow, low but never zero.</p>



<p>The rest of the discussions I have seen from the blog entry, raging in the usual stages of social media and posting forums, have failed to require any further response or thought from me personally.</p>



<p>Finally, this is all relatively minor in terms of the work I do and projects I focus on, an event that brought me some fury but which has mostly played the part of filed under “life lessons”. I just got tired of having quiet inward emotion when I was reminded of the event, specifically when VCF announcements would pass by my screen, followed by nice folks asking if they would be seeing me at the event. Now I have made a statement, and rather than the beginning of a saga, I consider it the end of one. My conversations with people and organizations I shift materials to are much longer, much more involved, and with much more contingencies as a result of this event, and things are better for it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Good news for those hoping to cling on to working from home: After a year of cracking down with rigid return-to-office mandates—and instilling fear in those who upheaved their life during the pandemic—defeated CEOs are now finally accepting that hybrid working is here to stay.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/kpmg/" target="_blank" rel="">KPMG</a> surveyed U.S. CEOs of companies turning over at least $500 million and found that <a href="https://kpmg.com/kpmg-us/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2024/KPMG-2024-US-CEO-Outlook-Pulse-Survey.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just one-third expect a full return to the office</a> in the next three years.</p>



<p>So it’s official: Leaders who believe that office workers will be back at their desks five days a week in the near future are now in the small minority.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a complete 360 on their stance last year, when 62% of CEOs surveyed predicted that <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/05/ceo-rto-kpmg-research-return-to-work-full-time-5-days/" target="_self" rel="">working from home would end by 2026.</a></p>



<p>At the time, 90% of CEOs even admitted that they were so steadfast on summoning staff back to their vertical towers that they were sweetening the pot with salary raises, promotions, and favorable assignments to those who showed face more.</p>



<p>But now, bosses are backtracking: Nearly half of CEOs have concluded that the future of work is hybrid—up from 34% last year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What’s more, a sizable chunk of CEOs aren’t just embracing working from home on Fridays, they’re going one step further and ditching the workday altogether.</p>



<p>KPMG found that a third of CEOs are exploring the feasibility of a four-day week at their firm.</p>



<h2>Why the change of heart?</h2>



<p>Many CEOs have dedicated the last year to shaking off pandemic-era habits of working from home and calling staff back to the office, but their mandates have been met with resistance.</p>



<p>Deutsche Bank’s decision to outright <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/22/four-day-weekends-from-home-over-fridays-increasingly-just-another-office-day-data/" target="_self" rel="">ban staff from working at home on a Friday</a> and the following Monday has not been taken lightly by staff—a large number of its 90,000-strong workforce have reportedly <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/02/27/deutsche-bank-remote-work-return-to-office-enormous-resistance/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" rel="">started posting critical remarks</a> on the company’s internal messaging board to make their distaste for the new set-up known.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" rel="">Amazon</a> is perhaps the most documented example of how ugly the RTO battle can get: Around 30,000 employees <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-hr-boss-rejects-employee-remote-work-petition-2023-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed a petition</a> protesting the company’s in-office mandate, and more than 1,800 <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/31/amazon-headquarters-workers-walkout-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks" target="_self" rel="">pledged to walk out</a> from their jobs to take a stand.</p>



<p><a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2023/08/01/research-damaging-results-mandated-return-to-office-worse-than-we-thought-rto-remote-work-careers-leadership-gleb-tsipursky/" target="_self" rel="">Research has echoed</a> that nearly half of companies with return-to-office mandates witnessed a higher level of employee attrition than they had anticipated, and 29% of companies enforcing office returns are struggling with recruitment.</p>



<p>It perhaps explains why, as KPMG’s data shows, CEOs are now waking up to the fact that the future of work is probably the happy medium of hybrid.</p>



<p>“CEOs have realized that forcing people back into the office can only go on for so long,” Amrit Sandhar, CEO of &amp;Evolve an employee engagement consultancy tells <em>Fortune.</em> </p>



<p>“With Gen Z over the next few years making up, in some cases the majority of the workforce, how long can CEOs insist people come into the office, when people are choosing to work remotely?</p>



<p>“We are at the threshold of a new dawn and trying to hold on to past mindsets will have a direct impact on the caliber of people you attract going forward.”</p>



<p>Lewis Maleh, CEO of the global executive recruitment agency Bentley Lewis, has already witnessed a U-turn to more flexible job ads.</p>



<p>“I’ve noticed a definite rise in job postings advertising remote or hybrid work,”&nbsp; Maleh tells <em>Fortune</em>. </p>



<p>“We haven’t worked on any searches that require the candidate to be in the office five days per week in the past six months globally.”</p>



<p>“The shift demonstrates the cementing of hybrid work models, as CEOs increasingly recognize flexibility as a key factor in attracting and retaining top talent.”</p></div><p>Subscribe to CHRO Daily, our newsletter focusing on helping HR executive navigate the changing needs of the workplace. <a href="https://www.fortune.com/newsletters/chro-daily?&amp;itm_source=fortune&amp;itm_medium=article_tout&amp;itm_campaign=chro_daily" target="_self" rel="">Sign up</a> for free.</p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
													<p>On March 29, 2024, a single <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">message</a> on the Openwall OSS-security mailing list marked an important discovery for the information security, open source and Linux communities: the discovery of a malicious backdoor in <strong>XZ</strong>. <strong>XZ </strong>is a compression utility integrated into many popular distributions of Linux.</p>
<p>The particular danger of the backdoored library lies in its use by the OpenSSH server process <strong>sshd</strong>. On several systemd-based distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian and RedHat/Fedora Linux, OpenSSH is patched to use systemd features, and as a result has a dependency on this library (note that Arch Linux and Gentoo are unaffected). The ultimate goal of the attackers was most likely to introduce a remote code execution capability to <strong>sshd</strong> that no one else could use.</p>
<p>Unlike other supply chain attacks we have seen in Node.js, <a href="https://securelist.com/two-more-malicious-python-packages-in-the-pypi/107218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PyPI</a>, <a href="https://social.librem.one/@eighthave/112194828562355097" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FDroid</a>, and the Linux <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20210421130105.1226686-1-gregkh@linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kernel</a> that mostly consisted of atomic malicious patches, fake packages and typosquatted package names, this incident was a multi-stage operation that almost succeeded in compromising SSH servers on a global scale.</p>
<p>The backdoor in the liblzma library was introduced at two levels. The source code of the build infrastructure that generated the final packages was slightly modified (by introducing an additional file <strong>build-to-host.m4</strong>) to extract the next stage script that was hidden in a test case file (<strong>bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz</strong>). These scripts in turn extracted a malicious binary component from another test case file (<strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong>) that was linked with the legitimate library during the compilation process to be shipped to Linux repositories. Major vendors in turn shipped the malicious component in beta and experimental builds. The compromise of XZ Utils is assigned <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024–3094</a> with the maximum severity score of 10.</p>

<p>These files were intended to contain shell scripts and the backdoor binary object itself. However, they were hidden within the malformed data, and the attacker knew how to properly extract them when needed.</p>
<h3>Stage 1 – The modified <strong>build-to-host</strong> script</h3>
<p>When the XZ release is ready, the official Github repository distributes the project’s source files. Initially, these releases on the repository, aside from containing the malicious test files, were harmless because they don’t get the chance to execute. However, the attacker appears to have only added the malicious code that bootstrap the infection when the releases were sourced from <strong>https://xz[.]tukaani.org</strong>, which was under the control of Jia Tan.</p>
<p>This URL is used by most distributions, and, when downloaded, it comes with a file named <strong>build-to-host.m4</strong> that contains malicious code.</p>
<p><strong>build-to-host.m4 </strong>(<a href="https://opentip.kaspersky.com/b4dd2661a7c69e85f19216a6dbbb1664/?utm_source=SL&amp;utm_medium=SL&amp;utm_campaign=SL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">c86c8f8a69c07fbec8dd650c6604bf0c9876261f</a>) is executed during the build process and executes a line of code that fixes and decompresses the first file added to the tests folder:</p>

<p>This line of code replaces the “broken” data from <strong>bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz</strong> using the <strong>tr</strong> command, and pipes the output to the <strong>xz -d</strong> command, which decompresses the data.

<p>To execute the next stage, it uses <strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong>, which is indeed compressed correctly with XZ, but contains junk data inside the decompressed data.</p>
<p>The junk data removal procedure is as follows: the <strong>eval</strong> function executes the head pipeline, with each <strong>head</strong> command either ignoring the next 1024 bytes or extracting the next 2048 or 724 bytes.</p>
<p>In total, these commands extracted <strong>33,492 </strong>bytes (<strong>2048*16 + 724 </strong>bytes). The <strong>tail</strong> command then retains the final <strong>31,265 </strong>bytes of the file and ignores the rest.</p>
<p>Then, the <strong>tr</strong> command applies a basic substitution to the output to deobfuscate it. The second XZ command decompresses the transformed bytes as a raw <strong>lzma </strong>stream, after which the result is piped into shell.</p>

<p>The last stage shell script performs many checks to ensure that it is running in the expected environment, such as whether the project is configured to use <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFUNC</a> (which will be discussed in the next sections).</p>

<p>Many of the other checks performed by this stage include determining whether GCC is used for compilation or if the project contains specific files that will be used by the script later on.</p>
<p>In this stage, it extracts the backdoor binary code itself, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/html_node/Object-File-Format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">object file</a> that is currently hidden in the same <strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong> file, but at a different offset.</p>
<p>The following code handles this:</p>

<p>The extraction process operates through a sequence of commands, with the result of each command serving as the input for the next one. The formatted one-liner code is shown below:</p>

<p>Initially, the file <strong>good-large_compressed.lzma</strong> is extracted using the <strong>XZ</strong> tool itself. The subsequent steps involve calling a chain of <strong>head</strong> calls with the “<strong>eval $i”</strong> function (same as the stage 3 extraction).</p>
<p>Then a custom RC4-like algorithm is used to decrypt the binary data, which contains another compressed file. This compressed file is also extracted using the XZ utility. The script then removes some bytes from the beginning of the decompressed data using predefined values and saves the result to disk as <strong>liblzma_la-crc64-fast.o</strong>, which is the backdoor file used in the linking process.</p>
<p>Finally, the script modifies the function <strong>is_arch_extension_supported</strong> from the <strong>crc_x86_clmul.h</strong> file in <strong>liblzma</strong>, to replace the call to the <strong>__get_cpuid</strong> function with <strong>_get_cpuid</strong>, removing one underscore character.</p>
<p>This modification allows it to be linked into the library (we’ll discuss this in more detail in the next section). The whole build infection chain can be summarized in the following scheme:</p>

<h2 id="binary-backdoor-analysis">Binary backdoor analysis</h2>
<h3 id="a-stealth-loading-scenario">A stealth loading scenario</h3>
<p>In the original XZ code, there are two special functions used to calculate the CRC of the given data: <strong>lzma_crc32 </strong>and <strong>lzma_crc64</strong>. Both of these functions are stored in the ELF symbol table with type <a href="https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/GNU_IFUNC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IFUNC</a>, a feature provided by the GNU C Library (GLIBC). IFUNC allows developers to dynamically select the correct function to use. This selection takes place when the dynamic linker loads the shared library.</p>
<p>The reason XZ uses this is that it allows for determining whether an optimized version of the <strong>lzma_crcX </strong>function should be used or not. The optimized version requires special features from modern processors (CLMUL, SSSE3, SSE4.1). These special features need to be verified by issuing the <strong>cpuid </strong>instruction, which is called using the <a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/6f9ba3ea55477cf1bd3d37e40ad116150c06a75e/gcc/config/i386/cpuid.h#L324" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>__get_cpuid</strong></a> wrapper/intrinsic provided by GLIBC, and it’s at this point the backdoor takes advantage to load itself.</p>
<p>The backdoor is stored as an object file, and its primary goal is to be linked to the main executable during compilation. The object file contains the <strong>_get_cpuid</strong> symbol, as the injected shell scripts remove one underscore symbol from the original source code, which means that when the code calls <strong>_get_cpuid</strong>, it actually calls the backdoor’s version of it.</p>

<p>The initial backdoor code is invoked twice, as both <strong>lzma_crc32</strong> and <strong>lzma_crc64</strong> use the same modified function (<strong>_get_cpuid</strong>). To ensure control over this, a simple counter is created to verify that the code has already been executed. The actual malicious activity starts when the <strong>lzma_crc64</strong> IFUNC invokes <strong>_get_cpuid</strong>, sees the counter value 1 indicating that that the function has already been accessed, and initiates one final step to redirect to the true entry point of this malware.</p>

<p>To initialize the malicious code, the backdoor first initializes a couple of structures that hold core information about the current running process. Primarily, it locates the Global Offset Table (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Offset_Table">GOT</a>) address using hardcoded offsets, and uses this information to find the <strong>cpuid</strong> pointer inside it.</p>

<p>The GOT contains the offsets of symbols, including the <strong>cpuid</strong> wrapper. The backdoor then swaps the pointers to the main malware function, and calls it as if it were calling <strong>cpuid</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="core-behavior">Core behavior</h3>
<p>The main goal of the backdoor is to successfully hook specific functions that will allow it to monitor every connection to the infected machine. The targeted functions include:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Targeted function</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>RSA_public_decrypt</strong></td>
<td>Used by <strong>libcrypto</strong> to decrypt a ciphertext signed by a private key</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>EVP_PKEY_set1_RSA</strong></td>
<td>Used by <strong>libcrypto</strong> to set the RSA key of a given context</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>RSA_get0_key</strong></td>
<td>Used by <strong>libcrypto</strong> to retrieve an RSA key</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>However, hooking all these functions is not a simple and straightforward task for the backdoor. It involves accessing many internal structures and manipulating process-specific structures until it achieves its goal, and it also needs to be as stealthy as possible, which means that the malicious code contains multiple checks to avoid being analyzed.</p>
<h3 id="execution-environment-check">Execution environment check</h3>
<p>It first parses <strong>ld-linux</strong> (dynamic linker), which is primarily responsible for dynamically resolving symbol addresses in memory. It also extracts various information about the environment and verifies that the current process the backdoor is running in matches its execution criteria, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The current process is <strong>/usr/bin/sshd</strong></li>
<li>Check if the kill switch is present</li>
</ul>
<p>It extracts the name of the current process from <strong>argv[0]</strong> and also parses all the process environment variables to see if any of them are present in its internal string table. If a match is found, or the process is not <strong>sshd</strong>, the malware halts its execution.</p>

<p>The only variable inside its own table is <strong>yolAbejyiejuvnup=Evjtgvsh5okmkAvj</strong>, which in this context serves as a <strong>kill switch</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="the-trie-structure">The trie structure</h3>
<p>One of the distinctive features of the backdoor is the use of a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trie</a> structure for string operations. Instead of directly comparing strings or using string hashes to match a particular constant (for example, the name of a library function), the code performs a trie lookup, and checks if the result is equal to a certain constant number. For example, the magic value for the ELF header results in the trie returning <strong>0x300</strong>, and the name of the <strong>system</strong> function is matched with a return value of <strong>0x9F8</strong>. Trie is not just used for comparisons: certain functions that use pointers to strings (for example, <strong>ssh-2.0</strong>) search for these strings in the host binary using the trie, so there will be no suspicious data in the backdoor’s body.</p>
<p>The implementation of the trie uses 16-byte bitmasks, each half corresponding to the byte input ranges <strong>0x00-0x3F</strong> and <strong>0x40-0x7F</strong>, and 2-byte trie leaf nodes, 3 bits of which are flags (direction, termination) and the rest is reserved for the value (or the location of the next node).</p>
<div id="attachment_112367"><p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150150/XZ_backdoor_analysis_16.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112367" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150150/XZ_backdoor_analysis_16.png" alt="Part of the trie lookup function that performs the bitmap match" width="648" height="275" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150150/XZ_backdoor_analysis_16.png 648w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150150/XZ_backdoor_analysis_16-300x127.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112367">Part of the trie lookup function that performs the bitmap match</p></div>
<h3 id="symbol-resolver">Symbol resolver</h3>
<p>There are at least three symbol resolver-related routines used by the backdoor to locate the ELF Symbol structure, which holds information such as the symbol name and its offset. All symbol resolver functions receive a key to be searched in the trie.</p>
<div id="attachment_112368"><p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112368" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-1024x195.png" alt="Symbol resolver example" width="1024" height="195" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-1024x195.png 1024w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-300x57.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-768x146.png 768w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-740x141.png 740w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05-800x153.png 800w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150247/XZ_backdoor_analysis_05.png 1028w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112368">Symbol resolver example</p></div>
<p>One of the backdoor resolver functions iterates through all symbols and verifies which one has the desired key. If it is found, it returns the <strong>Elf64_Sym</strong> structure, which will later be used to populate an internal structure of the backdoor that holds all the necessary function pointers. This process is similar to that commonly seen in Windows threats with API hashing routines.</p>
<p>The backdoor searches many functions from the libcrypto (OpenSSL) library, as these will be used in later encryption routines. It also keeps track of how many functions it was able to find and resolve; this determines whether it is executing properly or should stop.</p>
<p>Another interesting symbol resolver abuses the <strong>lzma_alloc</strong> function, which is part of the liblzma library itself. This function serves as a helper for developers to allocate memory efficiently using the default allocator (malloc) or a custom one. In the case of the XZ backdoor, this function is abused to make use of a fake allocator. In reality, it functions as another symbol resolver. The parameter intended for “allocation size” is, in fact, the symbol key inside the trie. This trick is meant to complicate backdoor analysis.</p>
<div id="attachment_112369"><p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-112369" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06.png" alt="Symbol resolver using a fake allocator structure" width="997" height="98" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06.png 997w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06-300x29.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06-768x75.png 768w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06-990x98.png 990w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06-740x73.png 740w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2024/04/11150335/XZ_backdoor_analysis_06-800x79.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 997px) 100vw, 997px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-112369">Symbol resolver using a fake allocator structure</p></div>
<p>The backdoor dynamically resolves its symbols while executing; it doesn’t necessarily do so all at once or only when it needs to use them. The resolved symbols/functions range from legitimate OpenSSL functions to functions such as <strong>system</strong>, which is used to execute commands on the machine.</p>
<h3 id="the-symbind-hook">The Symbind hook</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the primary objective of the backdoor initialization is to successfully hook functions. To do so, the backdoor makes use of <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtld-audit.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>rtdl-audit</strong></a>, a feature of the dynamic linker that enables the creation of custom shared libraries to be notified when certain events occur within the linker, such as symbol resolution. In a typical scenario, a developer would create a shared library following the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/rtld-audit.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>rtdl-audit</strong> manual</a>. However, the XZ backdoor opts to perform a runtime patch on the already registered (default) interfaces loaded in memory, thereby hijacking the symbol-resolving routine.</p>

<p>The addresses for <strong>dl_audit</strong> and <strong>dl_naudit</strong>, which holds the number of audit interfaces available, are obtained by disassembling both the <strong>dl_main</strong> and <strong>dl_audit_symbind_alt</strong> functions. The backdoor contains an internal minimalistic <strong>disassembler </strong>used for instruction decoding. It makes extensive use of it, especially when hunting for specific values like the <strong>*audit</strong> addresses.</p>

<p>The <strong>dl_naudit</strong> address is found by one of the <strong>mov </strong>instructions within the <strong>dl_main</strong> function code that accesses it. With that information, the backdoor hunts for access to a memory address and saves it.</p>
<p>It also verifies if the memory address acquired is the same address as the one accessed by the <strong>dl_audit_symbind_alt</strong> function on a given offset. This allows it to safely assume that it has indeed found the correct address. After it finds the <strong>dl_naudit </strong>address, it can easily calculate where <strong>dl_audit </strong>is, since the two are stored next to each other in memory.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we covered the entire process of backdooring <strong>liblzma (XZ)</strong>, and delved into a detailed analysis of the binary backdoor code, up to achieving its principal goal: hooking.</p>
<p>It’s evident that this backdoor is highly complex and employs sophisticated methods to evade detection. These include the multi-stage implantation in the <strong>XZ</strong> repository, as well as the complex code contained within the binary itself.</p>
<p>There is still much more to explore about the backdoor’s internals, which is why we have decided to present this as <strong>Part I</strong> of the <strong>XZ</strong> backdoor series.</p>
<p>Kaspersky products detect malicious objects related to the attack as <strong>HEUR:Trojan.Script.XZ</strong> and <strong>Trojan.Shell.XZ</strong>. In addition, Kaspersky Endpoint Security for Linux detects malicious code in SSHD process memory as <strong>MEM:Trojan.Linux.XZ</strong> (as part of the Critical Areas Scan task).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>A controversial US <a href="https://www.wired.com/live/section-702-reauthorization-congress-2024/?id=6615b9e20bc16967abadab74">wiretap program</a> days from expiration cleared a major hurdle on its way to being reauthorized.</p><p>After months of delays, false starts, and interventions by lawmakers working to preserve and expand the US intelligence community’s spy powers, the House of Representatives voted on Friday to extend Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for two years.</p><p>Legislation extending the program—controversial for being abused by the government—passed in the House in a <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2024119">273–147 vote</a>. The Senate has yet to pass its own bill.</p><p>Section 702 permits the US government to wiretap communications between Americans and foreigners overseas. Hundreds of millions of calls, texts, and emails are intercepted by government spies each with the “compelled assistance” of US communications providers.</p><p>The government may strictly target foreigners believed to possess “foreign intelligence information,” but it also eavesdrops on the conversations of an untold number of Americans each year. (The government claims it is impossible to determine how many Americans get swept up by the program.) The government argues that Americans are not themselves being targeted and thus the wiretaps are legal. Nevertheless, their calls, texts, and emails may be stored by the government for years, and can later be accessed by law enforcement without a judge’s permission.</p><p>The House bill also dramatically expands the statutory definition for communication service providers, something FISA experts, <a data-offer-url="https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/&quot;}" href="https://www.zwillgen.com/law-enforcement/fisa-702-reauthorization-amendments-second-time-not-charm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">including Marc Zwillinger</a>—one of the few people to advise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC)—have publicly warned against.</p><p>“Anti-reformers not only are refusing common-sense reforms to FISA, they’re pushing for a major expansion of warrantless spying on Americans,” US senator Ron Wyden tells WIRED. “Their amendment would force your cable guy to be a government spy and assist in monitoring Americans’ communications without a warrant.”</p><p>The FBI’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/05/19/fbi-digital-surveillance-misuse-jan6-blm/">track record of abusing the program</a> kicked off a rare détente last fall between progressive Democrats and pro-Trump Republicans—both bothered equally by the FBI’s targeting of activists, journalists, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/darin-lahood-fbi-backdoor-search/">a sitting member of Congress</a>. But in a major victory for the Biden administration, House members voted down an amendment earlier in the day that would’ve imposed new warrant requirements on federal agencies accessing Americans’ 702 data.</p><p>“Many members who tanked this vote have long histories of voting for this specific privacy protection,” says Sean Vitka, policy director at the civil-liberties-focused nonprofit Demand Progress, “including former speaker Pelosi, Representative Lieu, and Representative Neguse.”</p><p>The warrant amendment was passed earlier this year by the House Judiciary Committee, whose long-held jurisdiction over FISA has been challenged by friends of the intelligence community. Analysis by the Brennan Center this week found that 80 percent of the base text of the FISA reauthorization bill had been authored by intelligence committee members.</p><p>“Three million Americans' data was searched in this database of information,” says Representative Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee. “The FBI wasn't even following its own rules when they conducted those searches. That's why we need a warrant.”</p><p>Representative Mike Turner, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, campaigned alongside top spy agency officials for months to defeat the warrant amendment, arguing they’d cost the bureau precious time and impede national security investigations. The communications are legally collected and already in the government's possession, Turner argued; no further approval should be required to inspect them.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“The United States is at its greatest risk of terrorism in more than a decade following the horrific October 7th attack on Israel, and the [intelligence community] must focus attention and resources on that threat while continuing to stay ahead of China,” Turner and Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a joint statement after the vote, adding that 702 remains one of the country's most effective national security tools.</p><p>“It allows the United States to counter our adversaries, like China and Russia, thwart potential terrorist attacks from ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hamas, and Hezbollah, and disrupt international drug cartels who are looking to smuggle fentanyl into our nation,” they said.</p><p>The FBI introduced a slate of new internal policies to clamp down on the abuse itself, changes that the Biden administration argues are sufficient to ward off future abuse. Knowingly searching the database for information about Americans requires analysts—who must now submit to annual training sessions—to seek approval from higher up the chain of command than before. Running batch queries targeting Americans’ communications now requires a consultation with a government attorney.</p><p>While opposing the search warrants, Turner backed a ban on searches of 702 data for criminal cases that lack any foreign element. While that amendment has been welcomed by members on both sides of the issue, privacy hawks say the ban is not quite the major reform that Turner has proclaimed. Data on the program made public by the FISC suggests the ban will in reality affect less than a handful of cases each year.</p><p>Critics of the program say that relying on the FBI to internally police against its own constitutional violations is a tactic that has failed in the past, and that the bureau can no longer be trusted not to spy on Americans without cause.</p><p>“Section 702 has been abused under presidents from both political parties, and it has been used to unlawfully surveil the communications of Americans across the political spectrum,” says Kia Hamadanchy, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “The Senate must add a warrant requirement and rein in this out-of-control government spying.”</p><p>Judiciary members had also sought to include an amendment banning the government from buying Americans' geolocation data from private companies. At Turner’s behest, House speaker Mike Johnson killed the amendment earlier in the week.</p><p>The US Supreme Court has recognized geolocation data as protected from seizure by the “probable cause” standard. Rather than begin applying for warrants, the government has circumvented the ruling in many cases, buying up GPS data from companies that consumers largely believe are tracking them purely for advertising purposes.</p><p>“They’re buying data. That’s what they’re doing,” says Warren Davidson, a Republican congressperson from Ohio. “They’re structuring markets to collect the data and they’re circumventing the Fourth Amendment. We need to turn that off.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey folks,</p><p>About a year ago my wife and I, both closing in on 40, quit our jobs at Red Hat to start a games company and learn game development. Many things happened along the road, and about a week ago we released our first (small) game on Steam.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/" rel="nofollow">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816120/Mazelit/</a></p><p>The demo is free to play up to level 8 (the final game plays up to level 80) and we'd appreciate any feedback you have, whether it's for the store page or the game itself.</p><p>We made the game in Godot 4.2 in roughly 3 months and I was working full time next to it. Since we ran into a bunch of roadblocks, we decided to also offer the entire source code up as a DLC in case someone wants to go look how we implemented the game, mod the game, or compile it for a different platform. The only thing we can't redistribute with the game code is the Steamworks SDK, which is available for download from Steam. (The game minus integration is fully runnable without the SDK, though.)</p><p>Cheers and happy weekend!</p></div></div>]]></description>
