<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Act now: continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages</em></p><p>In April 2026, we will be rolling out a significant update to strengthen the security of your conversations: unverified devices will no longer be able to send and receive end-to-end encrypted messages via Element. This change follows the Matrix <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153?ref=element.io"><u>specification update</u></a> that was announced at the Matrix 2025 conference on October, 17 and benefits everyone by enhancing security, but may require an action from you to continue sending &amp; receiving encrypted messages on your existing devices.</p><p>This security update will give you assurance that when you receive a message from a contact, you can effortlessly assume it’s really from them.</p><p>It’s a big step towards making Element an even more safe and reliable messaging experience. We mean it when we say that we want to provide the most secure communication technology in the world.</p><p>So here’s what’s changing and why it matters to you.</p><h2 id="unverified-devices-are-a-potential-attack-vector"><strong>Unverified devices are a potential attack vector</strong></h2><p>Imagine you’re messaging a colleague and suddenly a warning shield icon appears on your screen. Is this just a harmless unverified device and you can safely ignore the warning, or has someone’s account been compromised? At best this is a distraction and, at worst, it is someone malicious trying to impersonate one of your contacts - neither is ideal. What’s worse is that ignoring these warnings leaves unmitigated risks to proliferate throughout your network.</p><p>With Element, trust is critical - a non-negotiable. For example, we provide end-to-end encryption by default to all of our users to ensure that you and the person you're messaging - and only the person you're messaging - can read the messages. This forthcoming change aims to eliminate uncertainty and the likelihood of malicious activity by requiring all devices to be verified.</p><h2 id="device-verification-matters"><strong>Device verification matters</strong></h2><p>Device verification acts like a hand shake between your devices, proving cryptographically to your contacts that they belong to you. Without this verification step, messages sent from your new devices must be marked as untrusted in your conversations. By making verification mandatory, users can be confident in every message sent and received via Element and are not distracted by warnings about insecure devices.</p><h2 id="trust-by-design-and-default"><strong>Trust by design and default</strong></h2><p>Going forward devices will be either verified or unable to participate in conversations - it’s that simple. No more warning or shield icons that can be easily ignored, these ultimately undermine the impact of important warnings/notifications (users become desensitised).&nbsp;</p><p>By verifying your devices, you’re not just protecting your own communications, you’re creating a more trusted environment for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re designing a system that prioritises the security of your communications and making verification an integral part of the process is a great example of that.</p>

            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has proposed </span><a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/10/17/2025-19580/revision-to-rules-of-practice-before-the-patent-trial-and-appeal-board"><span>new rules</span></a><span> that would effectively end the public’s ability to challenge improperly granted patents at their source—the Patent Office itself. If these rules take effect, they will hand patent trolls exactly what they’ve been chasing for years: a way to keep bad patents alive and out of reach. People targeted with troll lawsuits will be left with almost no realistic or affordable way to defend themselves.</span></p>
<p><span>We need EFF supporters to file public comments opposing these rules right away. The deadline for public comments is December 2.&nbsp;</span><span>The USPTO is moving quickly, and staying silent will only help those who profit from abusive patents.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TAKE ACTION</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.regulations.gov/commenton/PTO-P-2025-0025-0001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tell USPTO: The public has a right to challenge bad patents</a></p>
<p><span>We’re asking supporters who care about a fair patent system to file comments using the federal government’s public comment system. Your comments don’t need to be long, or use legal or technical vocabulary. The important thing is that everyday users and creators of technology have&nbsp; the chance to speak up, and be counted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Below is a short, simple comment you can copy and paste. Your comment will carry more weight if you add a personal sentence or two of your own. Please note that comments should be submitted under your real name and will become part of the public record.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sample comment:&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>I oppose the USPTO’s proposed rule changes for inter partes review (IPR), Docket No. PTO-P-2025-0025. The IPR process must remain open and fair. Patent challenges should be decided on their merits, not shut out because of legal activity elsewhere. These rules would make it nearly impossible for the public to challenge bad patents, and that will harm innovation and everyday technology users.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>Why This Rule Change Matters</b></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab/trials/inter-partes-review"><span>Inter partes review</span></a><span>, (IPR), isn’t perfect. It hasn’t eliminated patent trolling, and it’s not available in every case. But it is one of the few practical ways for ordinary developers, small companies, nonprofits, and creators to challenge a bad patent without spending millions of dollars in federal court. That’s why patent trolls hate it—and why the USPTO’s new rules are so dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span>IPR isn’t easy or cheap, but compared to years of litigation, it’s a lifeline. When the system works, it removes bogus patents from the table for everyone, not just the target of a single lawsuit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>IPR petitions are decided by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), a panel of specialized administrative judges inside the USPTO. Congress designed&nbsp; IPR to provide a fresh, expert look at whether a patent should have been granted in the first place—especially when strong prior art surfaces. Unlike&nbsp; full federal trials, PTAB review is faster, more technical, and actually accessible to small companies, developers, and public-interest groups.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are three real examples of how IPR protected the public:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>The “Podcasting Patent” (Personal Audio)</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Personal Audio claimed it had “invented” podcasting and demanded royalties from audio creators using its so-called podcasting patent. EFF crowdsourced prior art, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/patent-office-gives-green-light-eff-challenge-podcasting-patent"><span>filed an IPR</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/eff-wins-final-victory-over-podcasting-patent"><span>ultimately knocked out</span></a><span> the patent—benefiting&nbsp; the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/01/podcast-episode-saving-podcasts-patent-troll"><span>entire podcasting world</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong>Under the new rules, this kind of public-interest challenge could easily be blocked based on procedural grounds like timing, before the PTAB even examines the patent.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>SportBrain’s “upload your fitness data” patent</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>SportBrain </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/02/ipr-process-saves-80-companies-paying-sports-motion-patent"><span>sued more than 80 companies</span></a><span> over a patent that claimed to cover basic gathering of user data and sending it over a network. A panel of PTAB judges canceled every claim.</span></p>
<p><strong>Under the new rules, this patent could have survived long enough to force dozens more companies to pay up.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shipping &amp; Transit: a troll that <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/stupid-patent-month-how-34-patents-worth-1-led-hundreds-lawsuits">sued hundreds</a> of businesses</b></li>
</ul>
<p><span>For more than a decade, Shipping &amp; Transit sued companies over extremely broad “delivery notifications”patents. After repeated losses at PTAB and in court (including fee awards), the company finally collapsed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Under the new rules, a troll like this could keep its patents alive and continue carpet-bombing small businesses with lawsuits.</strong></p>
<p><span>IPR hasn’t ended patent trolling. But when a troll waves a bogus patent at hundreds or thousands of people, IPR is one of the only tools that can actually fix the underlying problem: the patent itself. It dismantles abusive patent monopolies that never should have existed, &nbsp; saving entire industries from predatory litigation. That’s exactly why patent trolls and their allies have fought so hard to shut it down. They’ve failed to dismantle IPR in </span><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-712_87ad.pdf"><span>court</span></a><span> or in </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/11/tell-congress-stop-these-last-minute-bills-help-patent-trolls"><span>Congress</span></a><span>—and now they’re counting on the USPTO’s own leadership to do it for them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>What the USPTO Plans To Do</b></h3>
<p><b>First</b><span>, they want you to give up your defenses in court. Under this proposal, a defendant can’t file an IPR unless they promise to never challenge the patent’s validity in court.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For someone actually being sued or threatened with patent infringement, that’s simply not a realistic promise to make. The choice would be: use IPR and lose your defenses—or keep your defenses and lose IPR.</span></p>
<p><b>Second</b><span>, the rules allow patents to become “unchallengeable” after one prior fight. That’s right. If a patent survives any earlier validity fight, anywhere, these rules would block everyone else from bringing an IPR, even years later and even if new prior art surfaces. One early decision—even one that’s poorly argued, or didn’t have all the evidence—would block the door on the entire public.</span></p>
<p><b>Third</b><span>, the rules will block IPR entirely if a district court case is projected to move faster than PTAB.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So if a troll sues you with one of the outrageous patents we’ve seen over the years, like patents on </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/09/ultramercial-case-we-love-hate"><span>watching an ad</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/alice/startup-runs-patent-picture-menus"><span>showing picture menus</span></a><span>, or </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/02/stupid-patent-month-clocking-work-app"><span>clocking in to work</span></a><span>, the USPTO won’t even look at it. It’ll be back to the bad old days, where you have exactly one way to beat the troll (who chose the court to sue in)—spend millions on experts and lawyers, then take your chances in front of a federal jury.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><p><span>The USPTO claims this is fine because defendants can still challenge patents in district court. That’s misleading. A real district-court validity fight costs millions of dollars and takes years. For most people and small companies, that’s no opportunity at all.&nbsp;</span></p></div>
<h3><b>Only Congress Can Rewrite IPR</b></h3>
<p><span>IPR was created by Congress in 2013 after extensive debate. It was meant to give the public a fast, affordable way to correct the Patent Office’s own mistakes. Only Congress—not agency rulemaking—can rewrite that system.</span></p>
<p><span>The USPTO shouldn’t be allowed to quietly undermine IPR with procedural traps that block legitimate challenges.</span></p>
<p><span>Bad patents still slip through every year. The Patent Office issues hundreds of thousands of new patents annually. IPR is one of the only tools the public has to push back.</span></p>
<p><span>These new rules rely on the absurd presumption that it’s the </span><i><span>defendants</span></i><span>—the people and companies threatened by questionable patents—who are abusing the system with multiple IPR petitions, and that they should be limited to one bite at the apple.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That’s utterly upside-down. It’s patent trolls like Shipping &amp; Transit and Personal Audio that have sued, or threatened, entire communities of developers and small businesses.</span></p>
<p><span>When people have evidence that an overbroad patent was improperly granted, that evidence should be heard. That’s what Congress intended. These rules twist that intent beyond recognition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2023, more than a thousand EFF supporters spoke out and stopped </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/our-right-challenge-junk-patents-under-threat"><span>an earlier version of this proposal</span></a><span>—your comments </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/07/victory-eff-supporters-beat-uspto-proposal-wreck-patent-reviews"><span>made the difference</span></a><span> then, and they can again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Our principle is simple: the public has a right to challenge bad patents. These rules would take that right away. That’s why it’s vital to speak up now.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-w6n32adp=""> <h2 id="attendance"><a href="#attendance">#</a>Attendance</h2>
<p>I’m in <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/courses/comp_sci/#:~:text=COMP%C2%A0SCI%C2%A0577%20%E2%80%94%20INTRODUCTION%20TO%20ALGORITHMS">Introduction to Algorithms (577)</a> this semester at UW, and I’ve been enjoying hearing Renault explaining how to prove program correctness, DP, network flow, and the circumstances under which Dijkstra invented his shortest-path algorithm.</p>
<p>However… algos is a somewhat unique class for me, given that it’s the first course I’ve taken that mandates being present during lectures by taking attendance. It accomplishes this through a platform called <a href="https://tophat.com/">TopHat</a>, who many students will recognize through its use of displaying participation questions.</p>
<p>TopHat asks you to provide it a four-length numerical code (that’ll be provided to you by your lecturer) in order to verify that you’re actually in the location where the attendance is being taken. You type that code into the student TopHat page, and, bam, you’re marked present.</p>
<p>However, I suppose they caught on to the unpatchable strategy of Having Friends, who, given that they are in the same class section as you, can be sent messages begging for the code from the comfort of your bed.</p>
<p>So, for the paranoid lecturer, TopHat allows “<a href="https://support.tophat.com/article/Educator-Taking-Attendance#SecureAttendance">secure attendance</a>”, a feature which, according to them, determines your location as “…determined by [your] device geolocation or by both geolocation and proximity (to the classroom and other students).”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/tophat.png" alt="TopHat's attendance code feature showing secure attendance enabled">
</p>
<p>The first time I heard about this system, I wondered how much leeway this “geolocation” would afford you. There exist a plethora of traditional “IP geolocation” services, which use your IP address and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)">ASN</a> — both semi-unique identifiers sent to the webpage upon load — to try and identify your location. This provides… varied results depending on where you’re located. When in Madison and NYC, popular IP geolocation services have been able to pin me within a mile or so of my actual location. In any suburban area, the error jumps to city-level.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> Surely TopHat wouldn’t be relying on such an inaccurate measure of detecting location when determining attendance — students living in Chadbourne Hall taking lectures in Mosse Humanities (approx. 250ft apart) would be able to skirt the attendance requirement. That could be catastrophic!</p>
<h2 id="the-geolocation-api"><a href="#the-geolocation-api">#</a>The Geolocation API</h2>
<p>Alas, it is not IP geolocation being used by TopHat. As aforementioned, IP geolocation is a pretty implicit flow — webpages are able to see your IP when you connect to them. However, when trying to determine your location, TopHat pops up a big scary dialogue past the <a href="https://textslashplain.com/2017/01/14/the-line-of-death/">line of death</a>!</p>
<p>Clearly this is asking something else entirely — something that’s presumably so precise as to require my explicit consent.</p>
<p>I’ll spare you the suspense. This is the Geolocation API, a feature of all modern browsers that allows the retrieval of your location to a <em>much</em> more precise degree (hence the permission pop-up). As of writing this post, IP geolocation is enough to place me somewhere in the Lakeshore neighborhood of Madison (1-2 miles long), but Chrome’s Geolocation API is enough to pin me to the exact building — Morgridge Hall — I’m sitting in. That’s orders of magnitude more accurate.</p>
<p>When I first experienced my laptop doing this, my first thought was “How?” There’s nothing special that my laptop has access to that would somehow allow my browser to have a more specific location… right? My laptop doesn’t have a GPS receiver in it<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that would allow location identification in the same way that phones can (and it isn’t just piggybacking off of my phone’s GPS, since this same location API is available on Windows devices).</p>
<h3 id="its-all-of-our-faults"><a href="#its-all-of-our-faults">#</a>It’s all of our faults</h3>
<p>When you press “allow” on the popup, your browser uses an accuracy heuristic to determine which method fetches the most accurate location. While this could be GPS (if on a cellular-enabled device) or the aforementioned IP geolocation, it will most likely have the highest success with the <strong>Wi-Fi Positioning System</strong>, a strategy that uses the wireless access points around you to identify your location.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. After allowing your browser permission to access your location, a website has access to the <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> function. When calling it, your browser kindly asks your operating system for a list of the surrounding Wi-Fi access points — more specifically, their signal strength, SSIDs, and BSSIDs.</p>
<p>If those last two are foreign to you, the “SSID” of a network is just the friendly name — for example, <code>UWNet</code> or <code>eduroam</code>. The BSSID is the MAC address of the access point, which is unique per each device. Having a unique identifier <em>per access point</em> is immensely important, as you can imagine just how many APs are named the same thing. Take a look at the map of APs around campus named <code>UWNet</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/wigle-madison.png" alt="A map of Madison, Wisconsin, with a purple hotspot over the downtown area">
</p>
<p>Okay, so, great. We now know exactly which Wi-Fi network you’re connected to. But how does this translate to your location on a map? And how do we even know where these networks are in the real world?</p>
<h3 id="wardriving"><a href="#wardriving">#</a>Wardriving</h3>
<p>The notion of associating Wi-Fi networks with their physical locations has been prevalent since the early 2000s. As far as I can tell, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyhook_Wireless">Skyhook Wireless</a> were the first to do it on a commercially-available scale, using a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardriving">wardriving</a>. This entails getting in a vehicle and driving around while capturing the information of as many Wi-Fi networks as possible. Since the devices doing the network scanning also have a reliable knowledge of their position (through GPS), all you have to do is associate the location of <em>where you saw the network</em> with its signal strength. Some RSSI trilateration later, and you have a roughly accurate map of Wi-Fi networks you’ve seen and their corresponding physical locations.</p>
<p>The useful thing is that, once in possession of all of this data, you can perform the process in reverse — on a user’s device, send a list of the Wi-Fi networks you can see (and their corresponding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_signal_strength_indicator">RSSI</a>), and receive an approximate guess on where that places your device in the world. For a while, that’s what everyone’s devices (including Apple ones, until iOS 3.2) did, relying on either Skyhook’s or Google’s privately collected list. The latter, interestingly enough, used their Street View vehicles (the ones taking images of roads) to capture the Wi-Fi information for a while.</p>
<p>However, at some point, companies realized the potential benefit of sourcing this information from the users of their devices. After all, they’re already frequently checking their GPS location and phoning home to cell towers, so why not send some anonymized Wi-Fi location data along with it?</p>
<p>So, that’s what Apple, Google, and Microsoft devices began doing. The location services of their products, by default, started aggregating the SSIDs and BSSIDs of Wi-Fi hotspots they could see (and their locations) and logging them for others’ devices to use for more accurate location services. And… that’s more or less the same thing that modern devices use today. When Chrome tells me that a website would like to use my location, and I allow it, the list of the surrounding hotspots will be sent to Google — which, because tens of thousands of people with GPS-enabled devices have also pinged the networks, allows my computer to obtain an extremely accurate estimation on where I am. So, thank you, everybody…?</p>
<h2 id="controversy"><a href="#controversy">#</a>Controversy</h2>
<p>If you were feeling a little nervous about the idea of your phone aggregating and sharing the location and information of every Wi-Fi network you’ve ever interacted with in your entire life, don’t worry, you’re not alone! There have been plenty of historical incidents with abuses of the technology.</p>
<p>Starting with a tough one: remember how earlier (in <a href="#wardriving">wardriving</a>) I mentioned that Google historically used their Street View cars to obtain network information for their location services? It turns out that they were sniffing much more than just the headers of the packets — they were aggregating the raw 802.11 Wi-Fi data frames, which includes the non-encrypted payload of HTTP packets. I assume that very little of the internet was using HTTPS in 2010, so the reported 600 gigabytes worth of data they obtained definitely contained some things that users would probably rather them not see.</p>
<p>A larger and more pertinent concern tends to crop up with regards to the possibility of tracing someone’s location — which is valid, given its sensitivity. This has been a worry since WPS’ inception, but one older example I found was Elie Bursztein et al.’s talk and <a href="https://elie.net/blog/privacy/using-the-microsoft-geolocalization-api-to-retrace-where-a-windows-laptop-has-been">accompanying blog post</a> “Using the microsoft geolocalization api to retrace where a windows laptop has been”. At the time, there was a bug where Windows would save a persistent record of every MAC address that you connected to, making it possible to retrace someone’s steps (thus, tracking their location as it changed) using one of numerous location APIs live at the time.</p>
<p>These vulnerabilities are even seen in contemporary times — Erik Rye and Dave Levin of the University of Maryland wrote “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14975">Surveilling the Masses with Wi-Fi-Based Positioning Systems</a>” in 2024, detailing a flaw in Apple’s location services that allowed them to exfiltrate the positions of nearly two billion BSSIDs by cleverly filtering the MAC address space they were searching. Their paper’s great, and it touches on some real dangers possible from the information in the hands of an adversary, such as stalking individuals by continuously locating their router BSSID, or monitoring population density during wartime by observing the movement of groups of devices (and satellite internet constellations like Starlink).</p>
<p>Over time, the location service providers have improved the security of the APIs they develop. This is <em>supremely</em> important given the risks we’ve discussed, especially given that nearly every device created by these companies are, by default<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>, sending this information to their manufacturers. Nearly every company that participates in WPS allows you to opt your BSSID out — either by changing the name of your SSID or by specifying the MAC address in a form somewhere:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/wifi-location/apple-wps.png" alt="Apple support WPS opt out page">
</p>
<p><i>Apple’s instructional opt out page (appending <code>_nomap</code>) to the SSID.</i></p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If I didn’t mention it yet, this technology does have a name. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_positioning_system">Wi-Fi positioning system</a> (WPS). There’s still a vibrant community of Wi-Fi positioning enthusiasts out there — <a href="https://wigle.net/">https://wigle.net/</a> is a crowd-sourced database from recreational wardrivers who have contributed nearly two billion networks over the last 25 years. You can zoom in on your town and see the Wi-Fi density near you, and you can even check if your own network has been tagged by someone else!</p>
<p>I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention <a href="https://beacondb.net/">https://beacondb.net/</a>, a self described “public domain wireless geolocation database”, which, while I haven’t had time to play with, sounds like a very promising open version of the trackers so commonly used nowadays. While it doesn’t have as dense of a database as any of the other providers, I actually think it’s neat to have a lack of homogeneity among the smaller providers — it shows the data is truly different!</p>
<p>It’s been really fun diving down this rabbit hole to learn how our devices gain access to our location. It’s one of the more niche things that I’ve taken for granted when using my devices, and it certainly didn’t occur to me that, while in lecture, the only reason I could be marked present was because thousands of other students had (without their knowledge) pinged servers all over the world.</p>

<p>This conclusion — “error rates scale based on living settlement density” is my personal conjecture. It is surprisingly frustrating just exactly how little information there is online about how these services attempt to pin your location from <em>just</em> your IP address. Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_geolocation">has an article</a> about IP geolocation, but it’s vague when discussing the actual implementation details… <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

<p>Small digression: did you know that, until May 2000, GPS satellites (which are owned and operated by the United States Space Force) provided the general public a signal with intentional error built into it? This was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_analysis_for_the_Global_Positioning_System#Selective_Availability">Selective Availability</a>, and it augmented the position of GPS readings by about 50 meters (162 feet) horizontally. It was shut off for a number of reasons — one of which being that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_GPS">Differential GPS</a> allows you to circumvent the distortion trivially by comparing the error of the signal against the location of a reference station with a known position. <a href="#user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 2">↩</a></p>

I’ve used Macs for a decade for work, and I dabbled in Ubuntu 20-something years ago, but otherwise I’ve been a Windows guy since 3.1. At first, that’s because it’s what we had at home, later because that’s where the games were, and finally out of force of habit (and because that’s where the games were). I brought a desktop to college instead of a laptop (so I could play games), and I’ve been building my own PCs for 18 years. I started my journalism career at <em>Maximum PC</em> magazine, testing gaming PC components.</p><p>I try to stay familiar with all the major operating systems because of my job, so in addition to my work MacBook I also have a Chromebook, a ThinkPad, and a collection of older hardware I refuse to get rid of. I can work pretty well in Windows, in macOS, or in ChromeOS.</p><p>My experiences with Linux over the past decade, on the other hand, have largely been as a series of extremely optional Tasks:</p><div><ul><li><span>Trying to set up Homebridge on a Raspberry Pi. It sort of worked but was stymied by my home network setup, and I eventually replaced it with Home Assistant.</span></li><li><span>Setting up a <a href="https://beepy.sqfmi.com/">Beepy</a>, a kind of a bootleg Linux handheld with a tiny monochrome screen and a BlackBerry keyboard. This took longer than I wanted, but it worked in the end, and I learned that using a command-line interface with a BlackBerry keyboard on a tiny monochrome screen is my version of hell. </span></li><li><span>Running a Linux VM on my Chromebook so I could use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/760522/obsidian-ceo-steph-ango-kepano-productivity-software-notes-app">Obsidian</a>, my preferred note-taking app, which doesn’t have a web interface. This was a pleasant experience and I have no complaints. </span></li><li><span>[<em>deep breath</em>] Setting up three different virtual machines using the Windows Subsystem for Linux so I could build keyboard firmware: one for QMK, one for ZMK, and I think the third was because the first QMK one stopped working. All of these were on my old desktop, on which the entire Linux subsystem somehow broke beyond repair. </span></li></ul></div><p>All of those projects, except the Chromebook one, took longer than expected, and cut into my vanishingly rare discretionary time. That’s also the time I use for gaming, reading, staring into the void, and half-starting organizational projects, so you can see how precious it is to me.</p><p>The prospect of instead using that time trying to get my computer back to a baseline level of functionality — that is, as useful as it was before I tried installing Linux — is tempting, but it’s also why I haven’t done it yet.</p><p>It’s a good time to try gaming on Linux.

I just rebuilt this thing. The Windows install is only like six months old. It’s working about as well as Windows does.</p></div><p>So really, why <em>wouldn’t</em> I blow that up and start over?</p><p>Based on listening to two and a half episodes of <em>Dual Boot Diaries</em> and a brief text conversation with Will, I’m going to install <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a>, an Arch-based distro optimized for gaming on modern hardware, with support for cutting-edge CPUs and GPUs and an allegedly easy setup.</p><p>I don’t expect things to go smoothly. I don’t <em>really</em> know what I’m doing, and Linux is still a very small percentage of the PC gaming world. As of the most recent <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fhwsurvey%2FSteam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam%3Fplatform%3Dlinux" rel="sponsored">Steam Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a> — the best proxy we have for PC gaming hardware info as a whole — just over 3 percent of Steam users are running Linux. Of those, 27 percent are using SteamOS (and therefore a Steam Deck), 10 percent are using Arch, 6 percent are using CachyOS, 4 percent are using Bazzite, and the rest are split over a bunch of distros.</p><p>So if anything goes wrong in my install, it’ll be a lot of forum-hopping and Discord searching to figure it all out. But I’ve cleverly arranged it so the stakes are only medium: I have other machines to work on while my desktop is inevitably borked (and to run programs like Adobe Creative Suite), and if I end up spending hours of my discretionary time learning Linux instead of gaming, well, that’s not the worst outcome.</p><p>Maybe it’ll all go smoothly and I’ll report back in a few weeks, another prophet of the revolution.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>IT-Security Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research identified and responsibly disclosed a large-scale privacy weakness in WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism that allowed the enumeration of 3.5 billion accounts. In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.</strong></p><p>WhatsApp's contact discovery mechanism can use a user's address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp's infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. "Normally, a system shouldn't respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source," explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. "This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide."</p><p>The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user's phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user's operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.</p><h2>The study also revealed a range of broader insights:</h2><ul><li>Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.</li><li>Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or "about" tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.</li><li>A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.</li><li>Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.</li></ul><p>The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”</p><p>“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences," says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: "They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves."</p><p>"Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise," adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp.&nbsp;</p><h2>Ethical Handling and Disclosure</h2><p>The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.</p><h2>Research Context</h2><p>This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.</p><p>Earlier this year, the researchers published "Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers" (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, "Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp's Handshake Mechanism" (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp's prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.</p><p>"By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we're contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge." said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).</p><p>The current study, "Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy", extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.</p><p><strong>Publication:</strong> Gabriel K.

Investigators found that wire-label banding prevented the wire from being fully inserted into a terminal block spring-clamp gate, causing an inadequate connection.&nbsp;</p><p> <img src="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/PublishingImages/Image%201%20DCA24MM031.png" alt="">&nbsp; &nbsp;​<img src="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/PublishingImages/Image%202%20DCA24MM031.png" alt="">
</p><p>​Illustration showing how placement of wire-label banding affects the way wires are seated in their terminal blocks. (Source: NTSB) 
<br></p><p>After the initial blackout, the Dali’s heading began swinging to starboard toward Pier 17 of the Key Bridge. Investigators found that the pilots and the bridge team attempted to change the vessel’s trajectory, but the loss of propulsion so close to the bridge rendered their actions ineffective. A substantial portion of the bridge subsequently collapsed into the river, and portions of the pier, deck and truss spans collapsed onto the vessel’s bow and forwardmost container bays. 
</p><p>A seven-person road maintenance crew and one inspector were on the bridge when the vessel struck. Six of the highway workers died. The NTSB found that the quick actions of the Dali pilots, shoreside dispatchers and the Maryland Transportation Authority to stop bridge traffic prevented greater loss of life. 
</p><p>”Our investigators routinely accomplish the impossible, and this investigation is no different,’ said NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy. “The Dali, at almost 1,000 feet, is as long as the Eiffel Tower is high, with miles of wiring and thousands of electrical connections. Finding this single wire was like hunting for a loose rivet on the Eiffel Tower. 
</p><p>“But like all of the accidents we investigate,this was preventable,” Homendy said. “Implementing NTSB recommendations in this investigation will prevent similar tragedies in the future.” 
</p><p>Contributing to the collapse of the Key Bridge and the loss of life was the lack of countermeasures to reduce the bridge’s vulnerability to collapse due to impact by ocean-going vessels, which have only grown larger since the Key Bridge’s opening in 1977. When the Japan-flagged containership Blue Nagoya contacted the Key Bridge after losing propulsion in 1980, the 390-foot-long vessel caused only minor damage. The Dali, however, is 10 times the size of the Blue Nagoya.&nbsp;<br></p><p><img src="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/PublishingImages/Image%203%20DCA24MM031.jpeg" alt=""><br></p><p>​The comparative sizes of the Blue Nagoya and the Dali relative to the Key Bridge. (Source: NTSB) 
<br></p><p>As part of the investigation, the NTSB in March released an initial report on the vulnerability of bridges nationwide to large vessel strikes. The report found that the Maryland Transportation Authority—and many other owners of bridges spanning navigable waterways used by ocean-going vessels—were likely unaware of the potential risk that a vessel collision could pose to their structures. This was despite longstanding guidance from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials recommending that bridge owners perform these assessments. </p><p>The NTSB sent letters to 30 bridge owners identified in the report, urging them to evaluate their bridges and, if needed, develop plans to reduce risks. All recipients have since responded, and the status of each recommendation is available on the NTSB’s website. 
</p><p> As a result of the investigation, the NTSB issued new safety recommendations to the US Coast Guard; US Federal Highway Administration; the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK); the American National Standards Institute; the American National Standards Institute Accredited Standards Committee on Safety in Construction and Demolitions Operations A10; HD Hyundai Heavy Industries; Synergy Marine Pte. Ltd; and WAGO Corporation, the electrical component manufacturer; and multiple bridge owners across the nation. 
</p><p>A synopsis of actions taken Tuesday, including the probable cause, findings and recommendations, can be found on <a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Documents/Board%20Summary%20Contact%20of%20Containership%20Dali%20with%20Francis%20Scott%20Key%20Bridge.pdf">ntsb.gov</a>​. The complete investigation report will be released in the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></div><p>To report an incident/accident or if you are a public safety agency, please call 1-844-373-9922 or 202-314-6290 to speak to a Watch Officer at the NTSB Response Operations Center (ROC) in Washington, DC (24/7).</p></div>]]></description>

  <p dir="ltr" data-test-id="main-feed-activity-card__commentary">Qualcomm-owned Arduino quietly pushed a sweeping rewrite of its Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, and the changes mark a clear break from the open-hardware ethos that built the platform.
The new documents introduce an irrevocable, perpetual license over anything users upload, broad surveillance-style monitoring of AI features, a clause preventing users from identifying potential patent infringement, years-long retention of usernames even after account deletion, and the integration of all user data (including minors) into Qualcomm’s global data ecosystem. Military weird things and more.

Several sections effectively reshape Arduino from an open community platform into a tightly controlled corporate service with deep data extraction built in. The most striking addition: 

users are now explicitly forbidden from reverse-engineering or even attempting to understand how the platform works unless Arduino gives permission. That’s a profound shift for a brand long embraced by educators, makers, researchers, and open-source advocates.

With the cloud having a rough day and many systems offline, yesterday... Anyone invested in transparency, community governance, or data rights should read these documents closely.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nakulduggal?trk=public_post-text" target="_self" data-tracking-control-name="public_post-text" data-tracking-will-navigate="">Nakul Duggal</a> seems to be the one that will end up taking the fall for this, the CEO of Qualcomm is not in the press release for the sale (and the press release seems like it was made by ChatGPT when you put it through those AI detectors?)..

ANY WAY -

Naukul and the Ardunio better get a ride in the over 10 Gulfstreams, which are a puzzle to investors, why so many? And why get a G800 now that's over $75m ...? That's how much Arduino has in funding...

US's Qualcomm adds G800 to corporate jet fleet...

<p>Open government experts say the limited disclosure is emblematic of a larger transparency problem in Texas. They pointed to a <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2015/09/25/government-contracts-less-public-under-ruling/" target="_blank">2015 state Supreme Court decision</a> that allowed companies to oppose the release of records by arguing that they contain “competitively sensitive” information. The ruling, experts said, made it harder to obtain records documenting interactions between governments and private companies.</p><p>Tom Leatherbury, who directs the First Amendment Clinic at Southern Methodist University’s Dedman School of Law, said companies took advantage of the ruling. Among the most prominent examples of the ruling’s effect on transparency was <a href="https://www.keranews.org/government/2020-01-08/an-open-government-mystery-solved-mcallen-paid-enrique-iglesias-485-000-for-2015-performance" target="_blank">McAllen's refusal to disclose</a> how much money was spent to lure pop star Enrique Iglesias to the city for a concert. The city argued that such disclosures would hurt its ability to negotiate with artists for future performances. Eventually, it was revealed that Iglesias was paid nearly half a million dollars.</p><p>The problem has been exacerbated, Leatherbury added, by the fact that the Office of the Attorney General, which referees public records disputes, does not have the power to investigate whether the records that companies want to withhold actually contain trade secrets.</p><p>“Corporations are willing to assert that information is confidential, commercial information, and more governmental bodies are willing not to second-guess the company’s assertion,” Leatherbury said. (Leatherbury has performed pro bono legal work for The Texas Newsroom.)</p><p>Musk and his companies’ representatives did not respond to questions about the records.</p><p>One of the richest people in the world, Musk has invested heavily in Texas. He’s <a href="https://www.kut.org/austin/2025-02-12/elon-musk-doge-texas-business-x-spacex-boring-snailbrook-grow-expand" target="_blank">relocated many of his businesses’ headquarters</a> to the state and <a href="https://www.kut.org/politics/2025-07-03/texas-elon-musk-tesla-spacex-lobbyist" target="_blank">hired lobbyists</a> who successfully pushed for <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/elon-musk-texas-legislature-laws-spacex-tesla" target="_blank">several new laws that will benefit his companies</a>.</p><p>As part of an effort to track Musk’s clout in the state Capitol, The Texas Newsroom on April 20 asked Abbott’s office for communications with employees from four of the businessman’s companies: SpaceX, car manufacturer <a href="https://www.kut.org/tags/tesla" target="_blank">Tesla</a>, the social media site X and Neuralink, which specializes in brain nanotechnology.</p><p>The governor’s office said it would cost $244.64 to review the documents, which The Texas Newsroom paid. After the check was cashed, lawyers representing Abbott’s office and SpaceX each sought to keep the records secret.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25984819-spacex-objections-to-oog-pir-202-25-redacted/" target="_blank">SpaceX’s lawyer sent a letter</a> to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton dated June 26, saying that publicly releasing the emails would hurt its competitive advantage.</p><p>Abbott’s public information coordinator, Matthew Taylor, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25975648-2025-06-03-abbott-musk-comms-appeal/" target="_blank">also asked Paxton’s office</a> for permission to withhold the documents, arguing they included private exchanges with lawyers, details about policymaking decisions and information that would reveal how the state entices companies to invest here. Taylor said some of the records were protected under an exception to public records laws known as “common-law privacy” because they consisted of “information that is intimate and embarrassing and not of legitimate concern to the public.”</p><p>Releasing the Musk emails, he said, would have a “chilling effect on the frank and open discussion necessary for the decision-making process.”</p><p>Ultimately, Paxton’s office mostly sided with Abbott and Musk. In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26182126-2025-08-01-or2025-027289a/" target="_blank">a Aug. 11</a> opinion, Assistant Attorney General Erin Groff wrote that many of the documents could be withheld. Groff, however, ordered the release of some records determined to be “either not highly intimate or embarrassing” or of “legitimate public interest.”</p><p>A month later, the governor’s office released 1,374 pages of records, the vast majority of which were completely redacted.</p><p>Some records included a note that appeared to explain why. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26089908-202-25-mcgaughy-document-for-release/#document/p401/a2677171" target="_blank">A note on page 401</a>, for example, cited the exemption for competitive bidding records for 974 redacted pages. Names and emails of Musk’s employees were also removed.</p><p>“The fact that a governmental body can redact more than 1,000 pages of documents that are directly related to a major business’s activities in Texas is certainly problematic,” said Reid Pillifant, an attorney specializing in public records and media law.</p><p>He and other experts said such hurdles are becoming more common as legislation and court decisions have weakened the state’s public records laws.</p><p>Four years after the 2015 Supreme Court decision, legislators passed a new law that was meant to ensure the release of basic information about government deals with private businesses. But open government experts said the law did not go far enough to restore transparency, adding that some local governments are <a href="https://www.keranews.org/news/2024-05-17/the-city-of-dallas-fought-releasing-its-contracts-with-the-nra-the-ag-said-it-should-so" target="_blank">still objecting to the release</a> of contract information.</p><p>Moreover, lawmakers continue to add carve-outs to what qualifies as public information every legislative session. Just this year, for example, legislators added the following exceptions to public records and open meetings laws: information relating to how government entities detect and deter <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB765" target="_blank">fraud</a> and discussions during public government meetings about certain <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&amp;Bill=SB1706" target="_blank">military and aerospace issues</a>.</p><p>Even with the increasing challenges of accessing public records, Leatherbury and Pillifant were stumped by the governor’s decision to release thousands of pages only to black them out fully. Leatherbury said that the governor’s office may have wanted to show the volume of records responsive to the request.</p><p>“They wanted you to see what little you could get in the context of the entire document, even though that’s kind of meaningless,” he said.</p><p>The Texas Newsroom has asked the Office of the Attorney General to reconsider its decision and order the release of the Musk emails. There is little other recourse to challenge the outcome.</p><p>If a member of the public believes a government agency is violating the law, they can try to sue. But the experts noted that <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/06/27/texas-supreme-court-paxton-abbott-uvalde-jan-6-emails/" target="_blank">a recent Texas Supreme Court decision</a> made it more difficult to enforce the public records law against the governor and other executive officers. Now, Leatherbury said, it’s not clear how challenging such a records decision would work.</p><p>“Every Texas citizen should care about access to these kinds of records because they shed light on how our public officials are making big decisions that affect the land where people live and how their taxpayer dollars are being spent,” Pillifant said.</p><p><i>Lauren McGaughy is a journalist with </i><a href="https://www.kut.org/texasnewsroom" target="_blank"><i>The Texas Newsroom</i></a><i>, a collaboration among NPR and the public radio stations in Texas.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I often get very specific infrastructure requests from clients. Most of the time it is some form of hosting. My job is usually to suggest and implement the setup that fits their goals, skills and long term plans. </p><p>If there are competent technicians on the other side, and they are willing to learn or already comfortable with Unix style systems, my first choices are usually one of the BSDs or an illumos distribution. If they need a control panel, or they already have a lot of experience with a particular stack that will clearly help them, I will happily use Linux and it usually delivers solid, reliable results. </p><p>Every now and then someone asks the question I like the least: </p><blockquote><p>“But how does it <em>perform</em> compared to X or Y?” </p></blockquote><p>I have never been a big fan of benchmarks. At best they capture a very specific workload on a very specific setup. They are almost never a perfect reflection of what will happen in the real world. </p><p>For example, I discovered that idle bhyve VMs seem to use fewer resources when the host is illumos than when the host is FreeBSD. It looks strange at first sight, but the illumos people are clearly working very hard on this, and the result is a very capable and efficient platform. </p><p>Despite my skepticism, from time to time I enjoy running some comparative tests. I already did it with <a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2024/06/10/proxmox-vs-freebsd-which-virtualization-host-performs-better/">Proxmox KVM versus FreeBSD bhyve</a>, and I also <a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/09/19/freebsd-vs-smartos-whos-faster-for-jails-zones-bhyve/">compared Jails, Zones, bhyve and KVM</a> on the same Intel N150 box. That led to the FreeBSD vs SmartOS article where I focused on CPU and memory performance on this small mini PC. </p><p>This time I wanted to do something simpler, but also closer to what I see every day: <strong>static web hosting.</strong> </p><p>Instead of synthetic CPU or I/O tests, I wanted to measure how different operating systems behave when they serve a small static site with nginx, both over HTTP and HTTPS. </p><p>This is <strong>not</strong> meant to be a super rigorous benchmark. I used the default nginx packages, almost default configuration, and did not tune any OS specific kernel settings. In my experience, careful tuning of kernel and network parameters can easily move numbers by several tens of percentage points. The problem is that very few people actually spend time chasing such optimizations. Much more often, once a limit is reached, someone yells “we need mooooar powaaaar” while the real fix would be to tune the existing stack a bit.</p><p>So the question I want to answer here is more modest and more practical:</p><blockquote><p>With default nginx and a small static site, how much does the choice of host OS really matter on this Intel N150 mini PC?</p></blockquote><p><em>Spoiler</em>: less than people think, at least for plain HTTP. Things get more interesting once TLS enters the picture.</p><hr><blockquote><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><br> These benchmarks are a snapshot of my specific hardware, network and configuration. They are useful to compare <em>relative</em> behavior on this setup. They are not a universal ranking of operating systems. Different CPUs, NICs, crypto extensions, kernel versions or nginx builds can completely change the picture. </p></blockquote><hr><h2>Test setup</h2><p>The hardware is the same Intel N150 mini PC I used in my previous tests: a small, low power box that still has enough cores to be interesting for lab and small production workloads. </p><p>On it, I installed several operating systems and environments, always on the bare metal, not nested inside each other. On each OS I installed nginx from the official packages. </p><h3>Software under test</h3><p>On the host: </p><p><strong>SmartOS</strong>, with:<br> - a Debian 12 LX zone<br> - an Alpine Linux 3.22 LX zone<br> - a native SmartOS zone </p><p><strong>FreeBSD</strong> 14.3-RELEASE:<br> - nginx running inside a native jail </p><p><strong>OpenBSD</strong> 7.8:<br> - nginx on the host </p><p><strong>NetBSD</strong> 10.1:<br> - nginx on the host </p><p><strong>Debian</strong> 13.2:<br> - nginx on the host </p><p><strong>Alpine Linux</strong> 3.22:<br> - nginx on the host </p><p>I also tried to include <strong>DragonFlyBSD</strong>, but the NIC in this box is not supported. Using a different NIC just for one OS would have made the comparison meaningless, so I excluded it. </p><h3>nginx configuration</h3><p>In all environments: </p><ul><li>nginx was installed from the system packages </li><li><code>worker_processes</code> was set to <code>auto</code> </li><li>the web root contained the same static content </li></ul><p>The important part is that I used <strong>exactly the same <code>nginx.conf</code> file for all operating systems and all combinations in this article</strong>. I copied the same configuration file verbatim to every host, jail and zone. The only changes were the IP address and file paths where needed, for example for the TLS certificate and key. </p><p>The static content was a default build of the example site generated by <a href="https://bssg.dragas.net/"><strong>BSSG</strong>, my Bash static site generator</a>. The web root was the same logical structure on every OS and container type. </p><p>There is no OS specific tuning in the configuration and no kernel level tweaks. This is very close to a “package install plus minimal config” situation. </p><h3>TLS configuration</h3><p>For HTTPS I used a very simple configuration, identical on every host. </p><p>Self signed certificate created with: </p><pre><code>openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost"  
</code></pre><p>Example nginx <code>server</code> block for HTTPS (simplified): </p><pre><code>server {  
listen 443 ssl http2;  
listen [::]:443 ssl http2;  

server_name _;  

ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/server.crt;  
ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/server.key;  

root /var/www/html;  
index index.html index.htm;  

location / {  
try_files $uri $uri/ =404;  
}  
}  
</code></pre><p>The HTTP virtual host is also the same everywhere, with the root pointing to the BSSG example site. </p><h3>Load generator</h3><p>The tests were run from my workstation on the same LAN: </p><ul><li>client host: a mini PC machine connected at 2.5 Gbit/s </li><li>switch: 2.5 Gbit/s </li><li>test tool: <code>wrk</code> </li></ul><p>For each target host I ran: </p><ul><li><code>wrk -t4 -c50 -d10s http://IP</code> </li><li><code>wrk -t4 -c10 -d10s http://IP</code> </li><li><code>wrk -t4 -c50 -d10s https://IP</code> </li><li><code>wrk -t4 -c10 -d10s https://IP</code> </li></ul><p>Each scenario was executed multiple times to reduce noise; the numbers below are medians (or very close to them) from the runs.</p><h2>The contenders</h2><p>To keep things readable, I will refer to each setup as follows: </p><ul><li><strong>SmartOS Debian LX</strong> → SmartOS host, Debian 12 LX zone </li><li><strong>SmartOS Alpine LX</strong> → SmartOS host, Alpine 3.22 LX zone </li><li><strong>SmartOS Native</strong> → SmartOS host, native zone </li><li><strong>FreeBSD Jail</strong> → FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE, nginx in a jail </li><li><strong>OpenBSD Host</strong> → OpenBSD 7.8, nginx on the host </li><li><strong>NetBSD Host</strong> → NetBSD 10.1, nginx on the host </li><li><strong>Debian Host</strong> → Debian 13.2, nginx on the host </li><li><strong>Alpine Host</strong> → Alpine 3.22, nginx on the host </li></ul><p>Everything uses the same nginx configuration file and the same static site. </p><h2>Static HTTP results</h2><p>Let us start with plain HTTP, since this removes TLS from the picture and focuses on the kernel, network stack and nginx itself. </p><h3>HTTP, 4 threads, 50 concurrent connections</h3><p>Approximate median <code>wrk</code> results: </p><table><thead><tr><th>Environment</th><th>HTTP 50 connections</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SmartOS Debian LX</td><td>~46.2 k</td></tr><tr><td>SmartOS Alpine LX</td><td>~49.2 k</td></tr><tr><td>SmartOS Native</td><td>~63.7 k</td></tr><tr><td>FreeBSD Jail</td><td>~63.9 k</td></tr><tr><td>OpenBSD Host</td><td>~64.1 k</td></tr><tr><td>NetBSD Host</td><td>~64.0 k</td></tr><tr><td>Debian Host</td><td>~63.8 k</td></tr><tr><td>Alpine Host</td><td>~63.9 k</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Two things stand out: </p><ol><li>All the native or jail/container setups on the hosts that are not LX zones cluster around 63 to 64k requests per second. </li><li>The two SmartOS LX zones sit slightly lower, in the 46 to 49k range, which is still very respectable for this hardware. </li></ol><p>In other words, as long as you are on the host or in something very close to it (FreeBSD jail, SmartOS native zone, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Linux on bare metal), static HTTP on nginx will happily max out around 64k requests per second with this small Intel N150 CPU. </p><p>The Debian and Alpine LX zones on SmartOS are a bit slower, but not dramatically so. They still deliver close to 50k requests per second and, in a real world scenario, you would probably saturate the network or the client long before hitting those numbers. </p><h3>HTTP, 4 threads, 10 concurrent connections</h3><p>With fewer concurrent connections, absolute throughput drops, but the relative picture is similar: </p><ul><li>SmartOS Native around 44k </li><li>NetBSD and Alpine Host around 34 to 35k </li><li>FreeBSD, Debian, OpenBSD around 31 to 33k </li><li>The SmartOS LX zones sit slightly below, around 35 to 37k req/s </li></ul><p>The important conclusion is simple: </p><blockquote><p>For plain HTTP static hosting, once nginx is installed and correctly configured, the choice between these operating systems makes very little difference on this hardware. Zones and jails add negligible overhead, LX zones add a small one. </p></blockquote><p>If you are only serving static content over HTTP, your choice of OS should be driven by other factors: ecosystem, tooling, update strategy, your own expertise and preference. </p><h2>Static HTTPS results</h2><p>TLS is where things start to diverge more clearly and where CPU utilization becomes interesting. </p><h3>HTTPS, 4 threads, 50 concurrent connections</h3><p>Approximate medians: </p><table><thead><tr><th>Environment</th><th>HTTPS 50 connections</th><th>CPU notes at 50 HTTPS connections</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>SmartOS Debian LX</td><td>~51.4 k</td><td>CPU saturated</td></tr><tr><td>SmartOS Alpine LX</td><td>~40.4 k</td><td>CPU saturated</td></tr><tr><td>SmartOS Native</td><td>~52.8 k</td><td>CPU saturated</td></tr><tr><td>FreeBSD Jail</td><td>~62.9 k</td><td>around 60% CPU idle</td></tr><tr><td>OpenBSD Host</td><td>~39.7 k</td><td>CPU saturated</td></tr><tr><td>NetBSD Host</td><td>~40.4 k</td><td>CPU at 100%</td></tr><tr><td>Debian Host</td><td>~62.8 k</td><td>about 20% CPU idle</td></tr><tr><td>Alpine Host</td><td>~62.4 k</td><td>small idle headroom, around 7% idle</td></tr></tbody></table><p>These numbers tell a more nuanced story. </p><ol><li><p><strong>FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine on bare metal form a “fast TLS” group.</strong><br> All three sit around 62 to 63k requests per second with 50 concurrent HTTPS connections. </p></li><li><p><strong>FreeBSD does this while using significantly less CPU.</strong><br> During the HTTPS tests with 50 connections, the FreeBSD host still had around 60% CPU idle. It is the platform that handled TLS load most comfortably in terms of CPU headroom. </p></li><li><p><strong>Debian and Alpine are close in throughput, but push the CPU harder.</strong><br> Debian still had some idle time left, Alpine even less. In practice, all three are excellent here, but FreeBSD gives you more room before you hit the wall. </p></li><li><p><strong>SmartOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD form a “good but heavier” TLS group.</strong><br> Their HTTPS throughput is in the 40 to 52k req/s range and they reach full CPU usage at 50 concurrent connections. OpenBSD and NetBSD stabilize around 39 to 40k req/s. SmartOS native and the Debian LX zone manage slightly better (around 51 to 53k) but still with the CPU pegged. </p></li></ol><h3>HTTPS, 4 threads, 10 concurrent connections</h3><p>With lower concurrency: </p><ul><li>FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine still sit in roughly the 29 to 31k req/s range </li><li>SmartOS Native and LX zones are in the mid to high 30k range </li><li>NetBSD and OpenBSD sit around 26 to 27k req/s </li></ul><p>The relative pattern is the same: for this TLS workload, FreeBSD and modern Linux distributions on bare metal appear to make better use of the cryptographic capabilities of the CPU, delivering higher throughput or more headroom or both. </p><h2>What TLS seems to highlight</h2><p>The HTTPS tests point to something that is not about nginx itself, but about the TLS stack and how well it can exploit the hardware. </p><p>On this Intel N150, my feeling is: </p><ul><li>FreeBSD, with the userland and crypto stack I am running, is very efficient at TLS here. It delivers the highest throughput while keeping plenty of CPU in reserve. </li><li>Debian and Alpine, with their recent kernels and libraries, are also strong performers, close to FreeBSD in throughput, but with less idle CPU. </li><li>NetBSD, OpenBSD and SmartOS (native and LX) are still perfectly capable of serving a lot of HTTPS traffic, but they have to work harder to keep up and they hit 100% CPU much earlier. </li></ul><p>This matches what I see in day to day operations: TLS performance is often less about “nginx vs something else” and more about the combination of: </p><ul><li>the TLS library version and configuration </li><li>how well the OS uses the CPU crypto instructions </li><li>kernel level details in the network and crypto paths </li></ul><p>I suspect the differences here are mostly due to how each system combines its TLS stack (OpenSSL, LibreSSL and friends), its kernel and its hardware acceleration support. It would take a deeper dive into profiling and configuration knobs to attribute the gaps precisely. </p><p>In any case, on this specific mini PC, if I had to pick a platform to handle a large amount of HTTPS static traffic, FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine would be my first candidates, in that order. </p><h2>Zones, jails and containers: overhead in practice</h2><p>Another interesting part of the story is the overhead introduced by different isolation technologies. </p><p>From these tests and the <a href="https://it-notes.dragas.net/2025/09/19/freebsd-vs-smartos-whos-faster-for-jails-zones-bhyve/">previous virtualization article on the same N150 machine</a>, the picture is consistent: </p><ul><li><p><strong>FreeBSD jails behave almost like bare metal.</strong><br> For both HTTP and HTTPS, running nginx in a jail on FreeBSD 14.3-RELEASE produces numbers practically identical to native hosts on other OSes. CPU utilization is excellent, especially under TLS. </p></li><li><p><strong>SmartOS native zones are also very close to the metal.</strong><br> Static HTTP performance reaches the same 64k req/s region and HTTPS is only slightly behind the “fast TLS” group, although with higher CPU usage. </p></li><li><p><strong>SmartOS LX zones introduce a noticeable but modest overhead.</strong><br> Both Debian and Alpine LX zones on SmartOS perform slightly worse than the native zone or FreeBSD jails. For static HTTP they are still very fast. For HTTPS the Debian LX zone remains competitive but costs more CPU, while the Alpine LX zone is slower. </p></li></ul><p>This is not a surprise. LX zones translate Linux system calls on top of the illumos kernel and there is a cost for that. The important point is that the cost is not catastrophic. On a bigger CPU you would probably not notice it unless you are really pushing the limits. </p><h2>What this means for real workloads</h2><p>It is easy to get lost in tables and percentages, so let us go back to the initial question. </p><blockquote><p>A client wants static hosting.<br> Does the choice between FreeBSD, SmartOS, NetBSD or Linux matter in terms of performance? </p></blockquote><p>For <strong>plain HTTP</strong> on this hardware, with nginx and the same configuration: </p><ul><li>Not really.<br> All the native hosts and FreeBSD jails deliver roughly the same maximum throughput, in the 63 to 64k req/s range. SmartOS LX zones are slightly slower but still strong. </li></ul><p>For <strong>HTTPS</strong>: </p><ul><li>Yes, it starts to matter a bit more. </li><li>FreeBSD stands out for how relaxed the CPU is under high TLS load. </li><li>Debian and Alpine are very close in throughput, with more CPU used but still with some headroom. </li><li>SmartOS, NetBSD and OpenBSD can still push a lot of HTTPS traffic, but they reach 100% CPU earlier and stabilize at lower request rates. </li></ul><p>Does this mean you should always choose FreeBSD or Debian or Alpine for static HTTPS hosting? </p><p>Not necessarily. </p><p>In real deployments, the bottleneck is rarely the TLS performance of a single node serving a small static site. Network throughput, storage, logging, reverse proxies, CDNs and application layers all play a role. </p><p>However, knowing that FreeBSD and current Linux distributions can squeeze more out of a small CPU under TLS is useful when you are: </p><ul><li>sizing hardware for small VPS nodes that must serve many HTTPS requests </li><li>planning to consolidate multiple services on a low power box </li><li>deciding whether you can afford to keep some CPU aside for other tasks (cache, background jobs, monitoring, and so on) </li></ul><p>As always, the right answer depends on the complete picture: your skills, your tooling, your backups, your monitoring, the rest of your stack, and your tolerance for troubleshooting when things go sideways. </p><h2>Final thoughts</h2><p>From these small tests, my main takeaways are: </p><ol><li><p><strong>Static HTTP is basically solved on all these platforms.</strong><br> On a modest Intel N150, every system tested can push around 64k static HTTP requests per second with nginx set to almost default settings. For many use cases, that is already more than enough. </p></li><li><p><strong>TLS performance is where the OS and crypto stack start to matter.</strong><br> FreeBSD, Debian and Alpine squeeze more HTTPS requests out of the N150, and FreeBSD in particular does it with a surprising amount of idle CPU left. NetBSD, OpenBSD and SmartOS need more CPU to reach similar speeds and stabilize at lower throughput once the CPU is saturated. </p></li><li><p><strong>Jails and native zones are essentially free, LX zones cost a bit more.</strong><br> FreeBSD jails and SmartOS native zones show very little overhead for this workload. SmartOS LX zones are still perfectly usable, but if you are chasing every last request per second you will see the cost of the translation layer. </p></li><li><p><strong>Benchmarks are only part of the story.</strong><br> If your team knows OpenBSD inside out and has tooling, scripts and workflows built around it, you might happily accept using more CPU on TLS in exchange for security features, simplicity and familiarity. The same goes for NetBSD or SmartOS in environments where their specific strengths shine. </p></li></ol><p>I will not choose an operating system for a client just because a benchmark looks nicer. These numbers are one of the many inputs I consider. What matters most is always the combination of reliability, security, maintainability and the human beings who will have to operate the<br> system at three in the morning when something goes wrong. </p><p>Still, it is nice to know that if you put a tiny Intel N150 in front of a static site and you pick FreeBSD or a modern Linux distribution for HTTPS, you are giving that little CPU a fair chance to shine.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After years of staring down the world’s biggest tech companies and setting the bar for tough regulation worldwide, Europe has blinked. Under intense pressure from industry and the US government, Brussels is stripping protections from its flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> — including simplifying its infamous cookie permission pop-ups — and relaxing or delaying landmark AI rules in an effort to cut red tape and revive sluggish economic growth.</p><p>The changes, proposed by the European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch, changes core elements of the GDPR, making it easier for companies to share anonymized and pseudonymized personal datasets. They would allow AI companies to legally use personal data to train AI models, so long as that training complies with other GDPR requirements.</p><p>The proposal also waters down a key part of Europe’s sweeping artificial intelligence rules, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/14/24001919/eu-ai-act-foundation-models-regulation-data">AI Act</a>, which came into force in 2024 but had many elements that would only come into effect later. The change extends the grace period for rules governing high-risk AI systems that pose “serious risks” to health, safety, or fundamental rights, which were due to come into effect next summer. The rules will now only apply once it’s confirmed that “the needed standards and support tools are available” to AI companies.</p><p>One change that’s likely to please almost everyone is a reduction in Europe’s ubiquitous cookie banners and pop-ups. Under the new proposal, some “non-risk” cookies won’t trigger pop-ups at all, and users would be able to control others from central browser controls that apply to websites broadly.</p><p>Other amendments in the new Digital Omnibus include simplified AI documentation requirements for smaller companies, a unified interface for companies to report cybersecurity incidents, and centralizing oversight of AI into the bloc’s AI Office.</p><div><p>“This is being done in the European way.”</p></div><p>“We have all the ingredients in the EU to succeed. But our companies, especially our start-ups and small businesses, are often held back by layers of rigid rules,” said Henna Virkkunen, executive vice-president for tech sovereignty at the European Commission. “By cutting red tape, simplifying EU laws, opening access to data and introducing a common European Business Wallet we are giving space for innovation to happen and to be marketed in Europe. This is being done in the European way: by making sure that fundamental rights of users remain fully protected.”</p><p>The proposal now heads to the European Parliament and the EU’s 27 member states — where it will need a <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/council-eu/voting-system/qualified-majority/">qualified majority</a> — for approval, a process that could drag on for months and potentially introduce significant changes.</p><p>The proposed overhaul won’t land quietly in Brussels, and if the development of the GDPR and AI Act are anything to go by, a political and lobbying firestorm is on its way. The GDPR is a cornerstone of Europe’s tech strategy and as close to sacred as a policy can be. Leaked drafts have already provoked outrage among civil rights groups and politicians, who have accused the Commission of weakening fundamental safeguards and bowing to pressure from Big Tech.</p><p>The decision follows months of intense pressure from Big Tech and Donald Trump — as well as high-profile internal figures like ex-Italian prime minister and former head of the European Central Bank <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/topics/competitiveness/draghi-report_en">Mario Draghi</a> — urging the bloc to weaken burdensome tech regulation. The Commission has sought to frame the changes as simplifying the EU’s tech laws, not weakening them – a way of soothing growing fears in Brussels that its tough rules are hampering its ability to compete globally. With very few exceptions, Europe doesn’t have any credible competitors in the global AI race, which is dominated by US and Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Google, and OpenAI.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NzY5ODkx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Robert Hart</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTI1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Dominic Preston</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p><span>Somewhere around 2016, the smartest people I knew started saying increasingly stupid things.</span></p><p><span>These were folks who could parse dense academic papers, who understood reason, who were entirely capable of holding two competing ideas in their heads without their brains short-circuiting.</span></p><p><span>But something changed.</span></p><p><span>One friend became “convinced” that every major news story was manufactured consent. Another started treating political disagreement as evidence of moral corruption. A third began using the word "liberal" as if it was a personality disorder rather than loose coalitions of sometimes contradictory beliefs.</span></p><p><span>The common thread: their extreme positions got them more of what they wanted. The friend who saw conspiracies everywhere built a following. Then an audience. Then a 7-figure income stream. The one who tribalized every issue found a ready-made community that validated every prior. Etc, etc. </span></p><p><span>The incentive gradient was clear: sanity was expensive, and extremism paid dividends.</span></p><p><span>We talk a lot about polarization as if it were a disease that infected society, but we’re missing a key data point: polarization is a growth hack, and it works. </span></p><p><span>It delivers results. </span></p><p><span>When you pick a side and commit to it wholly and without reservation, you get things that moderate positions cannot provide. You get certainty in an uncertain world. You get a community that will defend you. You get a simple heuristic for navigating complex issues.</span></p><p><span>Above all: you get engagement, attention and influence.</span></p><p><span>The writer who says "this issue has nuance and I can see valid concerns on multiple sides" gets a pat on the head and zero retweets. The influencer who says "everyone who disagrees with me on this is either evil or stupid" gets quote-tweeted into visibility and gains followers who appreciate their approximation of clarity.</span></p><p><span>The returns on reasonableness have almost entirely collapsed.</span></p><p id="which-begs-the-question-why-resist-"><h2 translations="[object Object]"><span>Which begs the question: why resist? If extremism delivers what people want, maybe we should just let it run its course and stop clutching our pearls?</span></h2></p><p><span>The problem is what happens when everyone optimizes for the same short-term wins.</span></p><p><span>You end up in a world where changing your mind becomes impossible because you've built your entire identity around being right. Where admitting uncertainty is social suicide. Where every conversation is a performance for your tribe rather than an actual exchange of ideas. You lose the ability to solve problems that don't fit neatly into your ideological framework, which turns out to be most important problems.</span></p><p><span>Someone who goes all-in on ideological purity might start with a few strong opinions. Then those opinions attract an audience. That audience expects consistency. Any deviation gets punished. So they double down. They have to keep escalating to maintain their position, finding new heresies to denounce, new lines to draw. They've locked themselves into a trajectory they can't escape without losing everything they've built. </span></p><p><span>They're prisoners of their own brand.</span></p><p><span>Scale this up and you get a society where nobody can back down, where every disagreement = existential, where we've lost the ability to make tradeoffs // acknowledge complexity.</span></p><p><span>The incentives push us toward positions that feel good but make us collectively stupider. </span></p><p><span>And you can't opt out by just accepting your side lost. </span></p><p><span>You're stuck in stupid-world too.</span></p><p id="so-how-do-you-actually-stay-sane"><h2 translations="[object Object]"><span>So how do you actually stay sane?</span></h2></p><div><ol translations="[object Object]" start="1"><li translations="[object Object]"><p><span>Start by diversifying your information diet in ways that feel actively uncomfortable. The goal isn't to agree with everything you read. You'll still think most of it is wrong. But exposing yourself to articulate versions of positions you oppose does something valuable: it makes you realize that intelligent people can disagree with you without being monsters or morons. This sounds obvious when written out, but your social media feed has spent years training you to believe otherwise.</span></p></li><li translations="[object Object]"><p><span>Second, practice distinguishing between stakes and truth. Just because an issue matters doesn't mean every claim about it is correct, and just because you've picked a side doesn't mean you have to defend every argument your side makes. The tribal logic says you have to accept the whole package, but that logic is selling you certainty you haven't earned.</span></p></li><li translations="[object Object]"><p><span>Third, find (or at least, look for) communities that reward humility, not tribal loyalty. These are rare, but they exist. They're the group chats where someone can say "I changed my mind about this" without being treated like a traitor. They're the forums where "I don't know" is an acceptable answer. They're the relationships where you can test ideas without performing for an audience. You cannot be reasonable in isolation. You need a small group of people who value truth-seeking over status games, and you need to invest in those relationships deliberately.</span></p></li></ol></div><p><span>That all sounds hard.</span></p><p><span>Is it worth it?</span></p><p><span>That’s an individual choice.</span></p><p><span>You'll lose: reach, influence, certainty, the comfort of being part of something larger than yourself.</span></p><p><span>You'll gain: the ability to think clearly, the capacity to update your beliefs when evidence changes, relationships based on something other than shared enemies, and the possibility of being right in ways that matter.</span></p><p><span>These trades won't feel equivalent. The losses are immediate and visceral. The gains are distant and abstract. When you refuse to join the mob, you feel it right away. When you maintain your ability to think independently, the benefits accrue slowly over years. </span></p><p><span>The discount rate on sanity is brutal.</span></p><p><span>But consider the alternative.</span></p><p><span>The people I knew who went all-in on extremism got what they wanted in the short term. Some built audiences. Some found communities. Some gained certainty. Most of ‘em made bank. But they're trapped by their earlier positions. They can't update without admitting they were wrong, and admitting they were wrong would cost them their community. They've optimized themselves into a local maximum they can't escape. They won the game by its current rules and lost something harder to quantify.</span></p><p><span>The world will keep offering you bad trades, will keep rewarding positions you know are too simple to be true. Every day you'll watch people cash in their nuance for influence. Every day you'll be tempted to do the same. The only defense is to remember that some things compound differently than others.</span></p><p><span>Extremism gives you a fast start and a ceiling.</span></p><p><span>Sanity gives you a slow start and no limit to how far you can grow.</span></p><p><span>Remember: the world only rewards insanity because we're measuring the wrong timeframe.</span></p><p><span>Check back in ten years.</span></p></div><p><span><span><strong>Field Notes</strong></span></span><span><span> on </span></span><span><span><strong>Now.</strong></span></span></p></div>]]></description>

<p>Who controls what you can do on your mobile phone? What happens when your device can only run what the government decides is OK? We are dangerously close to this kind of totalitarian control, thanks to a combination of government overreach and technocratic infrastructure choices.</p>
<p>Most Americans have a smartphone, and the average American spends <a href="https://www.harmonyhit.com/phone-screen-time-statistics/">over 5 hours a day on their phone</a>. While these devices are critical to most people’s daily lives, what they can actually do is shaped by what apps are readily available. A slim majority of American smartphone users use an iPhone, which means they can only install apps available from Apple’s AppStore. Nearly all the rest of US smartphone users use some variant of Android, and by default they get their apps from Google’s Play Store.</p>
<p>Collectively, these two app stores shape the universe of what is available to most people as they use the Internet and make their way through their daily lives. When those app stores block or limit apps based on government requests, they are shaping what people can do, say, communicate, and experience.</p>
<p>Recently, Apple <a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/">pulled </a><a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/">an app called </a>ICEBlock from the AppStore, making it unavailable in one fell swoop. This app was designed to let people anonymously report public sightings of ICE agents. In the United States people absolutely have a First Amendment right to inform others about what they have seen government officials doing and where — very much including immigration agents whose tactics have been <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg430dx702o">controversial</a> and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/trump-ice-smashed-windows-deportation-arrests/">violent</a>. Apple pulled the ICEBlock app at <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/apple-takes-down-ice-tracking-app-after-pressure-from-ag-bondi">the demand of the US Department of Justice</a>. The following day, Google <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">pulled a similar app called Red Dot</a> from the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>The DOJ’s pressuring of Apple is an unacceptable, censorious overreach. And Google’s subsequent removal of Red Dot looks like troubling premature capitulation. While some experts and activists have expressed <a href="https://micahflee.com/unfortunately-the-iceblock-app-is-activism-theater/">concerns over ICEBlock’s design and development practices</a>, those concerns are no reason for the government to meddle in software distribution. The administration’s ostensible <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/">free speech warriors</a> are trying to shape how Americans can communicate with each other about matters of pressing political concern.</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure choices</strong><br>
But the government’s overreach isn’t the whole story here. The current structure of the mobile phone ecosystem enables this kind of abuse and control.</p>
<p>Apple’s iOS (the operating system for any iPhone) is designed to only be able to run apps from the AppStore. If Apple hasn’t signed off on it, the app won’t run. This centralized control is ripe for abuse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-enforces-new-check-apps-china-beijing-tightens-oversight-2023-10-03/">handed the Chinese government</a> control over what apps are available to iPhone users in China, including <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-removes-gay-dating-apps-china-app-store/">banning gay dating apps</a>.</li>
<li>The corporation has used its authority over the AppStore <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3495466/apple-bans-another-objectionable-iphone-game-about-foxconn-workers">to block a</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3495466/apple-bans-another-objectionable-iphone-game-about-foxconn-workers">game that</a> critiqued its<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/12/3495466/apple-bans-another-objectionable-iphone-game-about-foxconn-workers"> labor practices</a>.</li>
<li>Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/">guidelines </a>say that “‘Enemies’ within the context of a game cannot solely target a specific … government, corporation, or any other real entity.” That represents a potential for sweeping censorship of anyone who wants to use the art of games to criticize companies or otherwise advance political messages.</li>
<li>It <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/05/17/apple-blocks-fortnite-on-ios-app-store/">banned </a>the popular game Fortnite from the App Store as it was battling the gamemaker to get a bigger cut of money from user transactions.</li>
<li>In 2012 Apple <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/apple-drone-strikes-and-limits-censorship">rejected</a> an app that compiled reports of highly controversial overseas drone strikes by the U.S. government during the “War on Terror.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike Apple, Google’s Android operating system has traditionally allowed relatively easy access to “sideloading”, which just means installing apps through means other than Google’s Play Store. Although most installations default to getting apps from the Play Store, the availability of sideloading means that even if Google censors apps in the Play Store, people can still install them. Even apps critical of Google can make it onto an Android device. It’s also possible to run a variant of Android without the Play Store at all, such as <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that is all set to change with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-will-block-sideloading-of-unverified-android-apps-starting-next-year/">recent Google announcement</a> that it will block apps from “certified Android” devices (which is nearly all Android phones) unless they come from what Google calls a “verified developer.” This means that the common Android user trying to install an app will have to get Google’s blessing: does this app come from someone that Google has “verified”? How Google will decide who is allowed to be verified and who is not is still unclear. Can a developer become “unverified”?</p>
<p>This upcoming change is framed by Google as <a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification">a security measure</a>, but merely knowing the identity of the developer of an app doesn’t provide any security. So the only way that the “verified developer” requirement can offer security is if Google withholds “verified developer” status from people it deems bad actors. But Google’s ability to withhold that status can be abused in the same way that Apple’s AppStore lock-in is being abused. A government will simply make a demand: “treat this developer as a bad actor” and effectively cut off any app by targeting its developer.</p>
<p>When a lever of control is available, the would-be censors will try to use it. It has never been true that someone who buys a Lenovo or Dell laptop, for example, has to let Lenovo or Dell tell them what programs they can and cannot install on their computer. Yet that will soon be the situation with regards to nearly all cell phones used in the United States.</p>
<p>Note that American iPhones are limited to only apps from the AppStore, but European Union (EU) iPhones don’t have that restriction. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) required Apple to permit <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/">alternate app stores and sideloading</a> (which Apple calls “web distribution”). As a result, marketplaces like <a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore</a> are starting to become available — but Apple only lets EU customers use them. The European regime is not perfect, however; while sideloaded apps and alternative app stores aren’t subject to the app store’s constraints, they are still obliged to follow Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/dma-and-apps-in-the-eu/#notarization-for-ios-apps">“Notarization” requirements</a>, which requires Apple to review all iOS apps – even from these alternate sources – on the basis of several vaguely worded rationales. For example, if the DoJ were to claim that ICEBlock “promoted physical harm” (even though it clearly does not), Apple could use this as an excuse to justify revoking their notarization of the app, which would prevent it from being installed even from these alternate channels.</p>
<p><strong>App store security and surveillance</strong><br>
Both Apple and Google make claims that their app distribution mechanisms improve security for their users. And clearly, these tech giants do block some abusive apps by exercising the control they have.</p>
<p>But both of them also regularly allow apps that contain common malicious patterns, including many apps built with <a href="https://appfigures.com/top-sdks/ads/all">surveillance tooling</a> that <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EPIC-ICCL-Enforce-In-re-Googles-RTB-Complaint.pdf">sell their users’ data to </a><a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/EPIC-ICCL-Enforce-In-re-Googles-RTB-Complaint.pdf">data brokers</a>. If either tech giant were serious about user security, they could ban these practices, but they do not. Google’s security claims are also undermined by the fact that the cellphone hacking company Cellebrite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/">tells law enforcement</a> that Google’s Pixel phones can be hacked, while those running GrapheneOS, created by a small non-profit, cannot. (Asked by a reporter why that was so, Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/leaker-reveals-which-pixels-are-vulnerable-to-cellebrite-phone-hacking/">did not respond</a>.)</p>
<p>Making matters worse, organizations like Google are unclear about their policies, and some of their policy statements can put developers and users at risk. Discussing blocking Red Dot, for example, <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/">Google told 404Media</a> that “apps that have user generated content must also conduct content moderation.” This implies that Google could become unwilling to distribute fully end-to-end encrypted apps, like <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal Private Messenger</a> or <a href="https://delta.chat/">Delta Chat</a>, since those app vendors by design are incapable of reviewing user-generated content. End-to-end encrypted apps are <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/">the gold standard</a> for secure communications, and no app store that signals a willingness to remove them can claim to put security first.</p>
<p>In addition, even if you’ve carefully curated the apps you have installed from these dominant app stores to avoid spyware and use strongly secure apps, the stores themselves monitor the devices, keeping dossiers of what apps are installed on each device, and <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/doug.leith/Android_privacy_report.pdf">maybe more</a>. Being a user of these app stores means being under heavy, regular surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Other options exist<br>
</strong>These centralized, surveilled, censorship-enabling app stores are not the only way to distribute software. Consider alternative app stores for Android, like <a href="https://accrescent.app/">Accrescent</a>, which prioritizes <a href="https://accrescent.app/docs/guide/appendix/requirements.html">privacy and security requirements</a> in its apps, and <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, which enables installation of free and open source apps. In addition to offering quality tools and auditing, F-Droid’s policies <a href="https://f-droid.org/docs/Anti-Features/">incentivize</a> the apps distributed on the platform to trim out overwhelming amounts of corporate spyware that infest both Google and Apple’s app stores. Neither F-Droid nor Accrescent do any surveillance of their users at all.</p>
<p>The F-Droid developers <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">recently </a><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">wrote about </a>the impact that Google’s upcoming developer registration requirements are likely to have on the broader ecosystem of privacy-preserving Android apps. The outcome doesn’t look good: the ability to install free and open source software on a common device might be going away. Those few people left using unusual devices (“uncertified” Android deployments like <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a>, or even more obscure non-Android operating systems like <a href="https://phosh.mobi/">phosh</a>) will still have the freedom to install tools that they want, but the overwhelming majority of people will be stuck with what can quickly devolve into a government-controlled cop-in-your-pocket.</p>
<p><strong>How we can push back<br>
</strong>In an increasingly centralized world, it will take very little for an abusive government to cause an effective organizing tool to disappear, to block an app that belongs to a critical dissenting media outlet, or to force invasive malware <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology/consumer-privacy/how-malicious-software-updates-endanger-everyone">into a software update</a> used by everyone. We need a shared infrastructure that doesn’t permit this kind of centralized control. We can disrupt oligopolistic control over software through user choice (e.g., preferring and installing free software), building good protocol frameworks (e.g., demanding tools that use open standards for interoperability), and through regulatory intervention (e.g., breaking up monopolistic actors, or mandating that an OS must allow sideloading, as the EU did with the DMA).</p>
<p>The device you carry with you that is privy to much of your life should be under your control, not under the control of an abusive government or corporations that do its bidding.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>W</span>hen the phone rings at Patrick Ryan and Joseph Kelly’s home in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/philadelphia" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Philadelphia</a>, chances are the caller is desperate. One couple rang because their son was about to abandon his medical practice to follow a new-age guru in Spain. Another call came from a husband whose wife was emptying their life savings for a self-proclaimed prophet in Australia. Yet another family phoned about their niece, who was in a relationship with a man stealing from her, maybe drugging her, probably sexually assaulting her.</p><p>These families had tried everything else. When nothing worked, they heard there were two men in Philadelphia who might still be able to bring their loved one home.</p><p>What Ryan and Kelly do is unusual: they help people leave cults. Over the past 40 years, they have handled hundreds of cases – some simple and local, others stretching across borders and decades. They have been hired by families of both modest and considerable means. They say they have even been hired by government agencies, and that some cults they have investigated have left them genuinely afraid for their lives.</p><p>Although many people are involved in cultic studies and education, fewer than 10 people in the US do anything like what Ryan and Kelly do. And among those, only Kelly and Ryan practice their strange and unique method: embedding themselves in families’ lives, pulling on threads like marionettists, sometimes for years.</p><p>Their method goes something like this. A family reaches out about their daughter, husband, nephew or grandchild. Ryan and Kelly conduct an assessment that can take anywhere from a day to a week (they would not say exactly). They charge $2,500 for the assessment, then $250 an hour after that, interviewing the family until they understand the dynamics well enough to devise a strategy. Then, over months or sometimes years, they work to create the conditions in which a person might begin to question the beliefs their life has been built on.</p><p>Normally, Kelly and Ryan work by strengthening the existing relationships in a person’s life. It can be a long game. They will educate the family about the cultic group, and give advice about what to say (or not to say). They will bring in experts: psychiatrists, lawyers, priests that can provide perspective and counsel. The goal is to untangle the family dynamics that might have made someone vulnerable to a cult in the first place.</p><p>Very occasionally, they meet face to face with the person involved in a cult. But these encounters look nothing like a drug intervention, with friends gathered in a circle and the reason for the meeting laid bare. Instead, Ryan and Kelly will act covertly. In one case, a son (the cult member) came home for a few days. His parents told him that Ryan and Kelly were friends of theirs, “family mediators” who happened to be “in town for a few days, to meet with some colleagues” – both technically true. The pair made sure to “forget” a book at the family home, and return the next day to collect it, as they began to build rapport.</p><hr><p><strong>I met Kelly and Ryan</strong> at their place in south Philadelphia, a three-story house they share with a big dog named Kenny and a bright green parrot named Greta.</p><p>Greta was a consolation prize Ryan bought for himself after a failed intervention, the second he ever attempted. It was the 1980s and<strong> </strong>his client, a woman who had recently finished her master’s at a prestigious university, had been drawn into a scam job. It was essentially a pyramid scheme built around a health regimen. Before you could sell it, you had to try it, so you knew what you were selling.</p><p>The regimen? Multiple enemas a day. “It escalated to 40 to 60 enemas a day,” Ryan said. “And when you do that many enemas, it upsets the electrolyte balance in your body and you begin hallucinating.”</p><p>He spent three days trying to reason with her, but she would not budge. Ryan asked himself: what value do I have if I can’t even talk someone out of an <em>enema</em> cult? Frustrated, he went for a walk, saw a bird in a pet shop window who said: “Hello, hello.” He put her in his coat, fashioned a small cage, took her on an airplane and brought her home.</p><figure id="1465d844-131a-4c5c-9143-874c381f365b" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a man with a parrot on his shoulder " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0a199fce0438c364f5acdbd92875983b29cfa25/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Joseph Kelly with their pet parrot, Greta. She was a consolation prize Ryan bought for himself after a failed intervention.</span> Photograph: Nic Neves</figcaption></figure><p>Their approach has changed a lot since those early interventions.</p><p>First, they are careful with language. They don’t love the word cult. They say it’s a cudgel: too blunt an instrument to get at the heart of the problem. Also, even if a client leaves a group and returns home, Ryan and Kelly wouldn’t say they “got them out”. They describe themselves as mediators who build bridges through which families can reach their loved ones. Sometimes, the person crosses that bridge. Sometimes, the outcome is more complicated.</p><p>Second, they have worked hard to distance themselves from “deprogramming” – the practice most people associate with cult interventions. In the 1970s and 80s, deprogramming could involve kidnappings, involuntary confinement and even violence. In one case Kelly mentioned, a cult member was held at gunpoint. It was controversial, and its effectiveness was questionable. “That,” Ryan said more than once, “is not what we do.”</p><p>Nowadays, they focus more on helping someone reach their own informed conclusion about the group they are part of, trying to soften the obstacles that might cloud their judgment.</p><p>For instance: one of the tricky parts, they explained, is communicating with a person who has been given tools to block out other people’s perspectives. This set of tools or ideas is what Ryan and Kelly call a group’s “gatekeeper”.</p><p>Ryan gave me an example. One client came from an extremely rigid, orthodox Catholic family. The family had a plan for life: retire early, save well, put the kids through college. But against these goals, the wife had joined an eastern religious group and was donating thousands of dollars to it. She had quit her job, and the marriage was collapsing.</p><p>The gatekeeper, Ryan and Kelly decided, was that the woman perceived her spouse “as dogmatic, fundamentalist – but not spiritual”. They needed to change her mind about her husband.</p><p>So Ryan called an old friend of Kelly’s, a Jesuit priest who lived in a parish near the family’s home. Ryan asked the priest to meet the husband. The two men became friends and agreed to meet regularly – all according to Ryan and Kelly’s plan. Every so often, the husband would text his wife: “I’m coming home late tonight, meeting my priest friend.”</p><p>“She’s like, ‘What priest friend?’” Ryan said.</p><p>After a few months, the wife became curious enough to want to meet her husband’s new friend. The priest, who was genuinely thrilled, nearly veered off plan by offering to speak with her directly. He believed she was ready to hear his views on spirituality. But Ryan stopped him: “I told him, look, they hired us to be strategists. I have a strategy for this.”</p><p>Ryan mapped out the parish and planned a tour. He made sure the route passed through the library specifically, the section with many eastern religious books. “You’re gonna go through there,” Ryan told the priest.</p><p>On a Friday, the husband brought his wife along to visit. The priest greeted them warmly and showed her the grounds. They walked through the library. She saw the books.</p><p>Soon, the priest was coming over for barbecues. They all became friends. And she began openly talking with her husband about the group she was involved in: the good and the bad. They had passed the group’s gatekeeper. But the work was not finished.</p><p>All groups have a rhythm, like a pulse across the calendar year. We have holidays, and we have tax season. There are highs and lows. If you want to talk to someone about how dangerous their group is, you probably do not want to do it right after they have taken ayahuasca or gone on retreat. But the lows come just as reliably.</p><p>When the wife finally started to complain about the group, the husband called Ryan: “She’s going to leave!” But Ryan told him firmly: “No, she’s not. Don’t push it.”</p><p>By the third cycle, the third low point, when she was sleep deprived, working long hours and truly miserable, Ryan gave the husband a single line. “Just say to her this: ‘You gave it a good shot.’ And nothing more.”</p><p>“She said: ‘Yeah, I have. Will you help me get my stuff?’ And he said: ‘OK.’”</p><p>The whole time, the wife knew her husband had consulted Ryan and Kelly, though she did not know they had orchestrated his friendship with the priest. During the five years they worked on the case, she assumed they were anti-religious bad actors. A few months after she left the group, she met Ryan and Kelly for the first time.</p><p>In Ryan’s telling, she loved chatting with Kelly and himself because they so clearly understood what she appreciated about the group. But they also saw that she was being made to sleep only a few hours a night, drink toilet water, and work hundreds of hours recruiting members for a guru accused of sexual misconduct and labor law violations.</p><hr><p><strong>Ryan and Kelly started doing this work</strong> because when they were younger, they themselves had been in what would be described as cults. They were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/mar/01/transcendental-meditation-does-it-work" data-link-name="in body link">Transcendental Meditation (TM)</a> instructors in the 70s and 80s. After about a decade with TM, they felt disturbed by their relationship to the organization, and they sued – Kelly in 1986, and Ryan in 1989 – for negligence and fraud. Kelly joined a suit as a Doe along with six others, claiming the organization had “fraudulently promised that the practice … would confer certain personal and societal benefits”, which never materialized. Ryan says that during the course of his TM training he was constantly surveilled and led to believe that he would be able to levitate and save humanity.</p><p>The case Kelly joined, which dragged on for several years, included expert testimony from clinical psychologist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/02/guardianobituaries.highereducation" data-link-name="in body link">Margaret Singer</a>, a brainwashing specialist who had previously assessed Charles Manson. Neither case won, but their lawsuits eventually settled, and through the course of the litigation, Ryan and Kelly left the organization. (TM did not respond to a request for comment; however, Bob Roth, CEO of the TM-associated David Lynch Foundation, did let me know the American Heart Association recently named Transcendental Meditation an official stress reducer for treating high blood pressure.)</p><p>Kelly joined another group after leaving TM. He followed his new guru for five more years. Meanwhile, Ryan told me he got<strong> </strong>busy investigating and trying to expose cults, including the group Kelly had joined. In those early days, Ryan considered himself a sort of “cult fighter”, with a much more black and white view of what cults were and what it meant to be a part of one. They finally started working together when Kelly had a falling out with his second group, whose guru was eventually convicted for child sexual abuse.</p><figure id="9f28d11c-ada1-4df1-8b64-f3ac7ba2df1e" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man shows highlighted lines from a book in his home library while another man looks on" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f4d2c0ff706480a71061e14a3b74ba2cf18c2/0_0_4824_3216/master/4824.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Ryan holds William S Kroger’s 1976 book called Hypnosis and Behavior Modification: Imagery Conditioning.</span> Photograph: Nic Neves</figcaption></figure><p>They have had a close relationship ever since, working and living together with their dog and bird in a big house they told me was once used as a base of operations by the Philly mafia, which seems oddly fitting. They mostly prefer to keep details about their personal lives off-record. Often, the families they work with need to hear very hard things, and being a sort of blank slate makes it easier for them to be whoever their clients need them to be.</p><p>Throughout reporting this piece, privacy was an issue. Ryan and Kelly told me many more details about their cases off the record. All these cases are anonymized, with some crucial details changed, to protect the identities of their clients and their families. Furthermore, Kelly and Ryan urge their clients not to speak with the media. The firmest “no” I ever got was when I asked Ryan if I could speak to a former client. The second was when I asked if they could show me emails or letters to prove they had worked with government agencies. This made it difficult to verify all the details of their stories, though I found the situations they described were consistent with other accounts of ex-members from cults they say their clients were a part of. When cases did make it to court, the details Ryan and Kelly provided me matched the legal testimony I found.</p><p>But without being able to speak to their former clients, some of the stories told here remain just that: stories in the telling of Ryan and Kelly. I was, however, able to speak with many of their collaborators, who confirmed that they had seen Ryan and Kelly’s method work close up. One of the people I spoke with, Dr Janja Lalich, is a professor emerita of sociology at California University State, Chico and author of multiple books on cults including Bounded Choice: True Believers and Charismatic Cults. Lalich lectures and consults on cultic studies, and regularly testifies as a cult expert in court cases internationally. She started studying them because she, too, joined and left a cult when she was younger. It was a radical Marxist-Leninist cult that eventually “imploded”; a process she details in her book. The members collectively overthrew the leadership and all left at the same time, she explained, “which was great”.</p><p>Lalich worked on a couple of cases with Kelly and Ryan in the 90s, when they were starting out. She did not like the work. She found it stressful and difficult, and felt some reservations about the way the process interfered with people’s lives. But the three of them have remained close over the years and still collaborate in the broader cult-awareness space, attending conferences and teaching workshops. She confirmed for me a lot of the claims Kelly and Ryan made about the cults they have dealt with, including the idea that most people who join cultic groups leave on their own.</p><p>Ryan concedes that their work can look a lot like meddling in someone’s life. But he is also firm in that they are not “hired hitmen”. They work with psychologists, psychiatrists and social workers to provide oversight, several of whom I spoke with for this piece. “You can’t just interfere with someone’s life because you don’t like what they’re doing,” Ryan told me. When Kelly and Ryan take on a case, it’s because there is some dynamic in the family system that they think their expertise can help untangle. In every case, the group in question is offering something to the person involved that the family might not be able to understand or appreciate. But to Ryan and Kelly, this appreciation is exactly the point.</p><hr><p><strong>One of their cases in the 90s</strong> involved a cult leader who was systematically sexually assaulting the group’s members. “I can’t get into all the details,” Ryan said. “He was horrible, a horrible man.” Ryan and Kelly had been flying regularly to Australia to work on the case. The client’s niece, a girl in the group, was beginning to fall out with the cult. The leader had been arrested and was on trial for crimes related to the cult’s activities.</p><p>In their process, Ryan and Kelly require what they call 50 things: “You have to find 50 things that you could agree with the person on.” Ryan gestured to a painting on the wall in their living room. It was a strange, surrealist-looking canvas with a big Tesla coil in the center and lightning shooting out at some pigeons. Ryan said, “If you look at this piece of art and say, ‘That’s really ugly,’ then we’re going to start off … not on the right page, right?”</p><p>But if I could appreciate what he found appealing, then, he said: “I think you have the right to criticize it.” The number may seem arbitrary, but their goal is to find 50 things a family can appreciate about a cult before discussing what they do not agree with.</p><p>I put this number to Lalich and she said the notion of having to find 50 things seemed a bit extreme. “ I certainly could never find 50 things about my cult that I thought were good.” The spirit of it seemed right to her though, at least: that the family needs to tone down their rhetoric, or they will just push the cult-involved member away.</p><figure id="b75e8bd1-2f04-4830-b06c-d94ead8f7da4" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="a man sitting down " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d93decf9b9adad0f0ba94bc2669d2518cc758dd/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Ryan sits in front of a painting of a Tesla coil and pigeons in his living room.</span> Photograph: Nic Neves</figcaption></figure><p>In Kelly and Ryan’s case, the girl’s uncle, their client, had a very difficult time finding anything positive about the group or the leader who had allegedly raped his niece. When the trial came, the uncle wanted to testify against the leader, and Ryan and Kelly told him not to. “We said, if you testify, your niece … will cut you off.”</p><p>The uncle went to court anyway. Just as Ryan had predicted, the niece fell off the map entirely. She was scared they would kidnap her – try to deprogram or threaten her. Ryan and Kelly pulled some strings to find out that she had done some traveling, but otherwise, for “20 years”, Ryan said, “they didn’t know if she was alive or dead.”</p><p>On Ryan and Kelly’s counsel, the family made a social media account in the 2010s to post information about the family: weddings, births, etc. After nearly 30 years, the girl, now in middle age, finally reached out. The family had posted about how the grandfather was getting old, and she called to say she wanted to see him before he died.</p><hr><p><strong>Much has been written</strong> about the psychology of cults, the archetypes of cult leaders and the way they can create <a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/2018/nov/17/an-apocalyptic-cult-900-dead-remembering-the-jonestown-massacre-40-years-on" data-link-name="in body link">tragic</a>, abusive conditions for their members.

While Lalich says that to her, it is pretty clear what is or is not a cult, she also concedes that groups exist on a broad continuum ranging from extremely dangerous to “more or less” benign. She does not think that there is such a thing as a “harmless” cult – since all these groups exert some measure of coercion and manipulation. But for Ryan and Kelly, defining precisely what is or is not a cult is actually counterproductive, since so much of what they do is appeal to the person inside the cult who they are trying to reason with.</p><p>So, rather than labeling a group as a cult, Ryan and Kelly focus on “cultic relationships” that exist between a member and an organization. “Ten million people have learned Transcendental Meditation,” Ryan clarified. “Ten million people are not in a cult.” His voice rose and he shrugged. “I mean, they’ve been lied to. As a teacher, we lied to them. We told them things that were just absolutely not true.”</p><p>“Bonkers,” Kelly added from his rocking chair.</p><p>“Bonkers,” Ryan confirmed.</p><p>Over the course of their careers Ryan and Kelly have found that in order to mediate people’s relationships with these groups, they have to gain a better understanding of how they are drawn in to begin with. How is it that a cult leader can make a person seriously believe that they can levitate, or that drinking toilet water is acceptable? They have to understand how exactly a group manages to shake people’s fundamental assumptions about reality.</p><p>For example, Kelly described a case in which a leader would command people to have sex with one another: “‘You, woman, sleep with that woman.’ ‘You, sleep with that man.’” Even if participants were straight, the leader would ask them: “What is your limitation?” This is an archetype of cult leader that Kelly calls a “crazy adept”: “the disruptor, who comes in and destroys the norms in order to build up a better, purer reality.”</p><p>One of their close collaborators, Ashlen Hilliard, told me about a harrowing case whose details she preferred to keep tightly under wraps. She said they were referred to the case by a US government agency investigating the group, and it had proved extremely dangerous. If they were publicly known to be helping members leave, the group could retaliate. “I care about this,” Ryan said of this interview, “but I care more about not dying.”</p><figure id="6b72a36f-2c7b-4f32-9ba4-9ca117a1dfa7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Two men sit on a black couch in a house" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38cd60d4f43432e6c380aec159a2f3398cddb77f/0_0_5184_3456/master/5184.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Ryan: ‘The only way [some questions] can be answered, in my mind, is by a feeling. And, that feeling is so easily manipulated.’</span> Photograph: Nic Neves</figcaption></figure><p>Hilliard explained that in this group, words like “victim” were twisted out of shape. “Instead of assigning a negative meaning to a word like ‘victim’, they say: this is a word that indicates a badge of honor.” Then, when a member was subject to sexual violence or other abuse by the group, being a “victim” was reframed as something positive. Often, people in these groups have experienced past trauma, and this destabilization of the concept of victimhood can feel freeing – at least initially.</p><p>What Kelly and Ryan mean when they say these groups are “offering something” to people, it is exactly that. There is a hole a group fills: alienation from community, family, sexuality; pressure to follow a certain life plan, addiction, unrealized spirituality, economic catastrophe – all reasons to join a group. We all have deep pains that make us hope that maybe, if the world were different, we wouldn’t feel the way we do.</p><p>Part of why their work is so necessarily confidential is that there is always the possibility a person will go back to their group. These are people trying to make sense of a reality whose fundamental rules have been turned on its head. When is anyone ever “done” making sense of things, anyway?</p><p>Kelly still thinks about a moment with the guru he followed after leaving Transcendental Meditation, back in 1985. He had been meditating at the feet of the guru, Prakashanand Saraswati (who they called Swami-ji, or “guru”), for several days. When he looked up, he saw the Swami surrounded by “a golden light.” He was not seeing an illusion. It was a real experience, built on ideas and promises laid out by the guru: a supreme, divine, transcendent love. “The wave merging into the ocean,” Kelly said.</p><p>After that experience, Kelly felt Swami-ji could do no wrong. For the next three years, even when he saw the women visiting Swami-ji’s bedroom, the demands for thousands of dollars, the outbursts of rage; it all felt insignificant, or easily dismissed.</p><p>For that reason, Kelly and Ryan are not looking to convince people of any particular version of reality or truth. They do not seem to be interested in truth at all, really. When you use your experience to test whether or not something is true (the holiness of a guru, the righteousness of a cause) then, Ryan told me: “The person who gives you that experience will own you.” Their work is to usher people into a state of skepticism about the conclusion they have drawn from their experiences; beginning to open them up to the idea that individual experience is not the same as truth or reality.</p><figure id="2b3966c1-398d-4437-8402-97844920f0a0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:70,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Inside the LA ‘psychic reset’ bootcamp that promises happiness – at a price&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;2b3966c1-398d-4437-8402-97844920f0a0&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/may/15/mastery-transformational-training-los-angeles&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>This lighter touch approach is controversial. While interviewing people in the broader cult-awareness network, I found that Ryan and Kelly had drawn some criticism for affiliating with a certain group of academics that some people in their sphere disparage as “cult apologists”. This group belongs to a branch of cultic study that, like Ryan and Kelly, avoid the term “cult”, preferring the term “New Religious Movement”. Kelly and Ryan have consulted these academics over the years and have kept some as trusted contacts. Lalich and others say these apologists undermine survivors’ efforts to hold cults accountable for their abuses, by brushing over the harms such as child neglect and sexual abuse committed by groups like the Children of God (The Family International) or the Unification Church, even testifying in court on a cult’s behalf. It’s a bitter, complicated split in the field of cultic study, but these academics say, among other things, that they are speaking out for freedom of religion. When Ryan and Kelly mentioned these apologists, they said they understood Lalich’s criticism, but that there was a way in which they could see things “through their lens”.</p><p>Ryan and Kelly are not cult apologists, but in order to do their work they have had to keep an open mind. They neither fully endorse cults’ rights to exist, nor consider groups as bad per se. They arrive from as ideologically empty a place as they can, a skeptical place that is neither here, nor there. Doing work like this, the big question of epistemology, of what we can know and what to believe, become everyday practical quandaries.</p><p>“I just know what is not real,” Ryan told me once. Take even the broadest existential question: what are we doing here?</p><p>“The only way that can be answered, in my mind, is by a feeling,” he said. “And, that feeling is so easily manipulated.”</p><p>You have to be a certain kind of person to do this work. Though Lalich does not do interventions any more, she is glad there are people who do it in the “legitimate way”. When I asked her who she thought did it in the “legitimate way”, she only named four people. Of them, only three, including Ryan and Kelly, were still actively taking cases.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
												

				
<p>If your organization uses Microsoft Exchange-based email, you’ll be happy to hear that Thunderbird’s latest monthly <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/145.0/releasenotes/">Release version 145</a>, <strong>now officially supports native access via the Exchange Web Services (EWS) protocol.</strong> With EWS now built directly into Thunderbird, a third-party add-on is no longer required for email functionality. Calendar and address book support for Exchange accounts remain on the roadmap, but email integration is here and ready to use!</p>



<h2>What changes for Thunderbird users</h2>



<p>Until now, Thunderbird users in Exchange hosted environments often relied on IMAP/POP protocols or third-party extensions. With full native Exchange support for email, Thunderbird now works more seamlessly in Exchange environments, including full folder listings, message synchronization, folder management both locally and on the server, attachment handling, and more. This simplifies life for users who depend on Exchange for email but prefer Thunderbird as their client.</p>



<h2>How to get started</h2>



<p>For many people switching from Outlook to Thunderbird, the most common setup involves Microsoft-hosted Exchange accounts such as Microsoft 365 or Office 365. Thunderbird now uses Microsoft’s standard sign-in process (OAuth2) and automatically detects your account settings, so you can start using your email right away without any extra setup.</p>



<p>If this applies to you, setup is straightforward:</p>



<ol>
<li>Create a new account in Thunderbird <strong>145 or newer</strong>.</li>



<li>In the new Account Hub, select <strong>Exchange</strong> (or <strong>Exchange Web Services</strong> in legacy setup).</li>



<li>Let Thunderbird handle the rest!</li>

Also, some authentication configurations are not supported yet and you may need to wait for a further update that expands compatibility, please refer to the table below for more details.&nbsp;</p>







<h2>What functionality is supported now and what’s coming soon</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, EWS support in version 145 currently enables email functionality only. Calendar and address book integration are in active development and will be added in future releases. The chart below provides an at-a-glance view of what’s supported today.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Feature area</strong></td><td><strong>Supported now</strong></td><td><strong>Not yet supported</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Email – account setup &amp; folder access</td><td>✅ Creating accounts via auto-config with EWS, server-side folder manipulation&nbsp;</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Email – message operations</td><td>✅ Viewing messages, sending, replying/forwarding, moving/copying/deleting</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Email – attachments</td><td>✅ Attachments can be saved and displayed with detach/delete support.</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Search &amp; filtering</td><td>✅ Search subject and body, quick filtering</td><td>❌ Filter actions requiring full body content are not yet supported.</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts hosted on Microsoft 365</td><td>✅ Domains using the standard Microsoft OAuth2 endpoint</td><td>❌ Domains requiring custom OAuth2 application and tenant IDs will be supported in the future.</td></tr><tr><td>Accounts hosted on-premise</td><td>✅ Password-based Basic authentication</td><td>❌ Password-based NTLM authentication and OAuth2 for on-premise servers are on the roadmap.</td></tr><tr><td>Calendar support</td><td>–</td><td>❌ Not yet implemented – calendar syncing is on the roadmap.</td></tr><tr><td>Address book / contacts support</td><td>–</td><td>❌ Not yet implemented – address book support is on the roadmap.</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft Graph support</td><td>–</td><td>❌ Not yet implemented – Microsoft Graph integration will be added in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Exchange Web Services and Microsoft Graph</h2>



<p>While many people and organizations still rely on Exchange Web Services (EWS), Microsoft has begun gradually phasing it out in favor of a newer, more modern interface called Microsoft Graph. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/retirement-of-exchange-web-services-in-exchange-online/3924440?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Microsoft has stated</a> that EWS will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future, but over time, Microsoft Graph will become the primary way to connect to Microsoft 365 services.</p>



<p>Because EWS remains widely used today, we wanted to ensure full support for it first to ensure compatibility for existing users. At the same time, we’re actively working to add support for Microsoft Graph, so Thunderbird will be ready as Microsoft transitions to its new standard.</p>



<h2>Looking ahead</h2>



<p>While Exchange email is available now, calendar and address book integration is on the way, bringing Thunderbird closer to being a complete solution for Exchange users. For many people, having reliable email access is the most important step, but if you depend on calendar and contact synchronization, we’re working hard to bring this to Thunderbird in the near future, making Thunderbird a strong alternative to Outlook.</p>



<p>Keep an eye on future releases for additional support and integrations, but in the meantime, enjoy a smoother Exchange email experience within your favorite email client!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/what-killed-perl">https://entropicthoughts.com/what-killed-perl</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45977900">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
Trick question! Perl is not dead. I’ll show you what I mean, and then still
answer what I think killed Perl.
</p>


<p><img src="https://entropicthoughts.com/image/cpanreleasers.png" alt="cpanreleasers.png">
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://neilb.org/2023/07/13/cpan-report-2023.html"><abbr>cpan</abbr> Report 2023 put together by Neil Bowers</a> quite clearly illustrates
that Perl’s popularity is somewhere in the same range it was during the dotcom
bubble.<label for="fn.1">1</label><span><sup>1</sup> I realise <abbr>cpan</abbr> usage isn’t a perfect proxy. There are probably a
lot of people like me who use Perl specifically for things where they don’t need
to interact with third-party libraries. These wouldn’t show up in the <abbr>cpan</abbr>
records either, obviously. But it’s the best proxy I have.</span> If anything, it’s
higher: popularity increased ever so slightly after 2022, as next year’s <abbr>cpan</abbr>
report will show. (Neil says he will publish it in January, so follow his blog
for the latest news.) But it is also clear that newcomers make up a decreasing
portion of the Perl crowd, and this has been the case since 2011. Why is that?
</p>

<p>
Some people seem to think Raku (formerly known as “Perl 6”) sucked momentum out
of Perl, but I don’t believe that. Everyone I talked to back then knew Perl
wasn’t going anywhere. Humanity had chained too much of the infrastructure of
the growing internet to it. Even if Raku turned out to be a wild success,
someone would have to keep maintaining Perl for many years to come. There was
never any danger of obsolescence in starting a new project in Perl.
</p>

<p>
Besides, Raku was first announced in 2000, and the major burst of activity
around Raku implementations seems to have been at the end of that decade.
Through that period, Perl grew rapidly, as indicated by the graph.
</p>

<p>
I still struggle to understand why Perl went out of favour, which is
understandable if you know <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/why-perl.html">what I think about it</a>. But I have heard two reasons
that resonate with me.
</p>

<ol>
<li>The people who grew up on Unixy systems in the 1990s and early 2000s would
know shell, C, <abbr>awk</abbr>, sed, Vim, etc. To these people, Perl is a natural
extension of what they were already doing. Then in the 2000s came a new
generation of programmers brought up on … I don’t know, Microsoft systems,
Visual Basic and Java? These people were more attracted to something like
Python as a second language, which then became popular enough to become the
first language of the generation after that.</li>

<li>Back when people learned Perl, you didn’t just go online and download
development tools for a programming language on a whim. Binary package
managers that chase down dependencies on their own weren’t a thing until the
early 2000s, I think? And even then they didn’t have all that many packages.
So even if, I don’t know, Oberon or Eiffel would be a better fit for someone
in the 1990s, they might have opted to go with Perl anyway because that was
what they had. These days, this is not as much of a problem
anymore.<label for="fn.2">2</label><span><sup>2</sup> You’ll find that the invention of many of the popular languages
of today, such as Rust, Kotlin, Elixir, TypeScript, and Go happen to coincide
with the growth of the internet and increased power of package managers.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>
So to state my hypothesis briefly: people today are both less predisposed to
understand Perl, and have easy access to so many other alternatives. It’s a
rather unsatisfactory explanation, but it’s the closest I can get.
</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A cautionary tale about AWS VPC networking, NAT Gateways, and how a missing VPC Endpoint turned our S3 data transfers into an expensive lesson.</p><div><p>I've been using AWS since around 2007. Back then, EC2 storage was entirely ephemeral and stopping an instance meant losing all your data. The platform has come a long way since then.</p>
<p>Even after nearly two decades with the platform, there's always something new to learn. And sometimes those lessons come with a $1,000 price tag.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup"><a href="#the-setup" aria-label="the setup permalink"></a>The setup</h2>
<p>We recently moved over to using S3 for mirroring some large internal data files for Geocodio. We're talking about geographic datasets (things like address points, boundary data, and census information) that range from a few gigabytes to hundreds of gigabytes each. Some of these files are updated almost daily with fresh data, while others are refreshed less frequently. They need to be synced regularly from our ETL platform (which is hosted with Hetzner) to our processing infrastructure on AWS.</p>
<p>AWS has notoriously high data transfer costs. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress/">Cloudflare has written extensively about this</a>, and it's a common complaint across the industry. Corey Quinn from Last Week in AWS has also <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/the-aws-managed-nat-gateway-is-unpleasant-and-not-recommended/">called out the AWS Managed NAT Gateway</a> for being particularly expensive. AWS charges $0.09 per GB for data transfer out to the internet from most regions, which adds up fast when you're moving terabytes of data.</p>
<p>So before starting this project, I did my homework. I carefully researched the costs involved and confirmed two critical things:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>AWS still allows free transfer between EC2 instances and S3</strong> (as long as they're in the same region)</li>
<li><strong>Transfers <em>into</em> S3 are free</strong> (this was important since the data comes from our ETL platform hosted with Hetzner)</li>
</ol>
<p>Great! I had a clear picture of the costs.</p>
<p>...Or so I thought.</p>
<h2 id="the-surprise"><a href="#the-surprise" aria-label="the surprise permalink"></a>The surprise</h2>
<p>A few days after deploying the new S3 sync process, I got a notification from AWS Cost Anomaly Detection. (Boy, was I happy that I had that enabled!)</p>
<p>The alert showed something alarming: <strong>20,167.32 GB</strong> of "NAT Gateway" data transfers in a single day, which amounted to <strong>$907.53</strong>.</p>
<p>Month to date, this had already surpassed $1,000.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.geocod.io/img/blog/aws-traffic-cost.png" alt="AWS Cost Anomaly Detection showing unexpected NAT Gateway charges"></p>
<p>I stared at the dashboard in disbelief. How could this be happening? I had specifically confirmed that EC2-to-S3 transfers were free!</p>
<h2 id="but-why-oh-why"><a href="#but-why-oh-why" aria-label="but why oh why permalink"></a>But why oh why?</h2>
<p>After some frantic investigating (and a bit of panic), I discovered the culprit.</p>
<p>When you're using VPCs with a NAT Gateway (which most production AWS setups do), S3 transfers <strong>still go through the NAT Gateway</strong> by default. Even though you're making requests to an AWS service that's in the same region, the traffic is routed out through your NAT Gateway and back in, incurring data transfer charges at $0.045 per GB.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.geocod.io/img/blog/aws-nat-gateway-problem.png" alt="Architecture diagram showing traffic flowing from EC2 through NAT Gateway to S3"></p>
<p>The solution? <strong>VPC Endpoints for S3</strong>, specifically what AWS calls a "Gateway Endpoint."</p>
<p>A Gateway Endpoint is a special type of VPC endpoint that allows you to privately route traffic to S3 without going through your NAT Gateway or Internet Gateway. It's essentially a direct pipe from your VPC to S3.</p>
<p>Even better, Gateway Endpoints for S3 are <strong>completely free</strong>. No hourly charges, no data transfer charges. Nothing.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix"><a href="#the-fix" aria-label="the fix permalink"></a>The fix</h2>
<p>The solution is to create a VPC Gateway Endpoint for S3. This is a special type of VPC endpoint that creates a direct route from your VPC to S3, bypassing the NAT Gateway entirely.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.geocod.io/img/blog/aws-vpc-endpoint-solution.png" alt="Architecture diagram showing direct traffic flow from EC2 through VPC Gateway Endpoint to S3"></p>
<p>In our case, we manage infrastructure with Terraform, so it was just a matter of adding the Gateway Endpoint resource and associating it with our route tables. AWS automatically handles the routing updates to direct S3 traffic through the endpoint instead of the NAT Gateway.</p>
<h2 id="the-lesson"><a href="#the-lesson" aria-label="the lesson permalink"></a>The lesson</h2>
<p>I've built countless VPCs, configured security groups, set up load balancers, and optimized costs in dozens of ways over the years. But somehow, VPC Endpoints for S3 had slipped through the cracks of my knowledge.</p>
<p>AWS's networking can be deceptively complex. Even when you think you've done your research and confirmed the costs, there are layers of configuration that can dramatically change your bill.</p>
<p>Don't make my mistake. Here are a few things I'd suggest checking to help you avoid <em>your own</em> surprise $1,000 bill:</p>
<p><strong>AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is worth setting up.</strong> It caught this issue within days, saving us from an even larger surprise at the end of the month. If you haven't enabled it yet, <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/">do it <em>now</em></a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html">VPC Endpoints</a> are your friend.</strong> If you're using S3 or DynamoDB from EC2 instances in a VPC with a NAT Gateway, you absolutely need Gateway Endpoints. There's literally no reason not to use them. They're free and improve performance.</p>
<p><strong>Always validate your assumptions.</strong> I thought "EC2 to S3 is free" was enough. I should have tested with a small amount of data and monitored the costs before scaling up to terabytes.</p>
<p><strong>The cloud is complicated.</strong> There's always more to learn, even after nearly two decades. And that's okay. It just means we need to be careful and vigilant.</p>
<p>And we're not alone in this. Just last year, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2024/11/aws-websockets-costs/">Recall.ai discovered they were paying $1M annually in unexpected AWS WebSocket data processing fees</a>. Even experienced teams hit these surprises.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next" aria-label="whats next permalink"></a>What's next</h2>
<p>We've since audited our entire AWS infrastructure to make sure we have Gateway Endpoints configured for all VPCs that communicate with S3.</p>
<p>If you're using AWS and you haven't checked your VPC Endpoint configuration lately, I'd recommend taking a look. That $1,000 lesson doesn't need to be repeated.</p>
<p><em>TL;DR: NAT Gateways charge for ALL data processing, even for traffic to AWS services like S3 that have no data transfer fees. Use VPC Endpoints to bypass this.</em></p>

</div>
<p dir="auto">While thinking-aware generation aims to improve performance on complex tasks, we identify a critical failure mode where existing sequential, autoregressive approaches can paradoxically degrade performance due to error propagation.
To systematically analyze this issue, we propose <strong>ParaBench</strong>, a new benchmark designed to evaluate both text and image output modalities. Our analysis using ParaBench reveals that this performance degradation is strongly correlated with poor alignment between the generated reasoning and the final image.
To resolve this, we propose a parallel multimodal diffusion framework that enables continuous, bidirectional interaction between text and images throughout the entire denoising trajectory. This model, <strong>MMaDA-Parallel</strong>, is trained with supervised finetuning and then further optimized by Parallel Reinforcement Learning (<strong>ParaRL</strong>), a novel strategy that applies semantic rewards along the trajectory to enforce cross-modal consistency. Experiments validate that our approach significantly improves cross-modal alignment and semantic consistency, achieving a 6.9% improvement in <strong>Output Alignment</strong> on ParaBench compared to the state-of-the-art model, Bagel, establishing a more robust paradigm for thinking-aware image synthesis.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Note:</strong> Our model has been successfully validated on synthetic datasets focusing on <strong>environments, still life, architecture, and natural landscapes.</strong> Its performance on out-of-distribution inputs—such as human faces or real-world photographic imagery—has not yet been fully explored. We are actively expanding our training corpus to include more diverse datasets.</p>
