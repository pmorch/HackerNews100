the world use software developed by an Israeli cyber-arms company to spy on journalists, opposition politicians, and activists. Investigative journalists published a series of bombshell reports in July 2021 about the widespread abuse of Pegasus, a powerful tool marketed exclusively to state clients for use against only the grisliest criminals. Earlier this summer, Meduza learned that the iPhone of our co-founder and publisher, Galina Timchenko, was infected with Pegasus mere hours before she joined a private conference in Berlin attended by colleagues in the exiled Russian independent media. This is the first confirmed case of a Pegasus attack against a Russian journalist. With help from experts at Access Now and Citizen Lab, Meduza reports what we know about this notorious spyware, how it’s been used in Europe, and which states might have spent millions of dollars to hijack Ms. Timchenko’s phone.</p><blockquote><strong>Readers, please be aware of a possible conflict of interest in this report</strong>, which focuses on Meduza co-founder and publisher Galina Timchenko. She was not involved in the preparation of this article.</blockquote><p>Galina Timchenko hurried to Meduza’s Riga newsroom on June 23. She’d just gotten a call from <span data-id="1463706" data-title="Alexey the technical director" data-body="<p>To protect Alexey’s safety, Meduza is not disclosing his surname.</p>">Alexey</span>, the head of Meduza’s technical division, telling her to come in immediately. His voice was unusually stern, and he didn’t explain the urgency. “He simply spoke in such a way that I understood it as an order,” Timchenko later recalled. “It was clear that something had happened.”</p><p>En route to the office, Timchenko wondered if one of her passwords wasn’t secure or if she’d clicked on any suspicious hyperlinks. “I thought I’d done something wrong,” she says.</p><p>Alexey was waiting for her at the doorstep. He silently pointed at her bag, which held her phone and computer. “I can’t say anything just yet,” he informed her. “We’re looking into it.” He then took Timchenko’s iPhone and MacBook.</p><p>A day earlier, Timchenko had received a curious text message from Apple and forwarded it to Meduza’s tech division. The message was one of Apple’s “<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102174" rel="noopener" target="_blank">threat notifications</a>” about “state-sponsored attackers” — something the company sends to users who are “individually targeted because of who they are or what they do.” “State-sponsored attacks are highly complex, cost millions of dollars to develop, and often have a short shelf life,” Apple explains on its website.&nbsp;</p><p>The notification sent to Timchenko did not identify the state in question.</p><p>She says she put the message out of her mind after sharing it with Meduza’s technical team. Galina Timchenko has grown accustomed to such warnings. The Russian authorities have tried to hack or destroy her newsroom’s infrastructure for years. Meduza has weathered denial-of-service attacks and countless phishing attempts. Russia’s federal censor now even blocks the website outright.</p><p>To understand what Apple’s message didn’t explain, Meduza’s technical director turned to outside help to find out who these hackers were. First, he contacted human rights activists at <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/about-us/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Access Now</a>, a nonprofit organization committed to “defending and extending” the digital civil rights of people worldwide and helping improve digital security practices. Access Now has also <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/sanctions-undermining-human-rights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alerted</a> the public to the collateral damage of tech sanctions on civil rights activists, journalists, and dissidents from authoritarian countries, highlighting how targeted sanctions, mass corporate pullouts, and over-compliance in Russia have helped the Kremlin to silence its critics.</p><p>Alexey also reached out to researchers at <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Citizen Lab</a>, an interdisciplinary laboratory at the University of Toronto that investigates digital espionage against civil society, among many other things.&nbsp;</p><p>Experts at Access Now and Citizen Lab collected the data from Timchenko’s devices and performed what they call “a rapid COVID test.” The results were quick indeed, revealing that her smartphone was infected with the spyware Pegasus on February 10, 2023. This gave the hackers total access to Timchenko’s iPhone: its microphone, cameras, and memory. The attackers could see the device’s entire contents, including Timchenko’s home address, her scheduled meetings, her photographs, and even her correspondence in encrypted instant messengers. Pegasus lets you see a device’s screen directly, reading messages as they are written. It lets you download every email, text, image, and file.</p><h3><strong>Pegasus and NSO Group</strong></h3><p>NSO Group, the Israeli entity responsible for Pegasus, <a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/2023/01/19/pegasus-lifts-the-lid-on-a-sophisticated-piece-of-spyware" rel="noopener" target="_blank">insists</a> that it designed the product exclusively for the surveillance of “terrorists, criminals, and pedophiles.” The firm’s co-founders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">include</a> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/08/25/everything-we-know-about-nso-group-the-professional-spies-who-hacked-iphones-with-a-single-text/?sh=5ed8c94e3997" rel="noopener" target="_blank">veterans</a> of Israel’s military intelligence and the Mossad, and the company sells Pegasus only to state clients.</p><p>Despite its claims about “rigorous” human rights policies, NSO Group does big business with governments around the world that have regularly used Pegasus to target critics and political adversaries, from reform-minded bishops and priests in <a href="https://newnaratif.com/pegasus-spyware-in-southeast-asia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Togo</a> and women’s rights activists in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Saudi Arabia</a> to journalists in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/19/india-nso-pegasus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">India</a> and human rights defenders in <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/11/palestinian-human-rights-defenders-hacked-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Palestine</a>. Reporters and activists tracked by NSO Group’s spyware are often arrested and sometimes even killed. For example, Saudi operatives in Istanbul murdered and dismembered Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 after numerous members of his close entourage were selected for surveillance by NSO Group customers, while the Israeli firm <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/the-rise-and-fall-of-nso-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">denies</a> that its technology was used “to listen, monitor, track, or collect information regarding [Khashoggi] or his family members.”</p><p>States pay “tens of millions of dollars, if not more,” for access to Pegasus, Citizen Lab senior researcher John Scott-Railton told Meduza.</p><p>The Mexican government alone has spent at least <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pegasus-snooping-how-costly-is-the-israeli-spyware/articleshow/84893498.cms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$61 million</a> on the technology, which it has used to spy on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/21/shalev-hulio-nso-surveillance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dangerous criminals</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/09/mexico-pegasus-nso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">civil society members</a> alike, including journalist <a href="https://forbiddenstories.org/pegasus-the-new-global-weapon-for-silencing-journalists/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Cecilio Pineda</a>, who was assassinated in 2017, just a few weeks after his phone was infected with Pegasus.</p><p>Even researchers in this field aren’t sure what it costs to hack a single device using Pegasus. The spyware is more a service than anything; each NSO Group contract permits so many “simultaneous infections,” says Natalia Krapiva, Access Now’s tech-legal counsel. “For example, a client state can buy a package with 20 infections, which means it can have 20 people under surveillance at one time.”</p><p>Speaking to The Washington Post in July 2021, NSO Group co-founder Omri Lavie said attacks on journalists by his clients are “horrible,” but he argued that the main problem is a lack of regulation. “This is the price of doing business,” he explained. “Somebody has to do the dirty work.”</p><p>A kind of regulation arrived in November 2021, albeit not what Omri Lavie and his colleagues wanted. Months after an investigation by the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/07/18/takeaways-nso-pegasus-project/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pegasus Project</a> consortium exposed the spyware’s rampant, global abuse, the Biden administration added NSO Group to a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/03/pegasus-nso-entity-list-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">federal blacklist</a> that bans the company from receiving American technologies. NSO spokespeople expressed “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/03/pegasus-nso-entity-list-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dismay</a>” and said the firm would lobby to reverse the White House’s decision.</p><h3><strong>‘I felt dirty’</strong></h3><p>As soon as the Pegasus infection was confirmed, Meduza’s management locked itself in Timchenko’s office for an emergency meeting. “We were all terrified,” Alexey recalls, “but we pretended we weren’t.”</p><p>Meduza editor-in-chief Ivan Kolpakov, who was traveling then, joined the meeting by teleconference. He was visibly at a loss and kept listing aloud what could have leaked: corporate passwords and correspondence, bank account balances, the names of Meduza staff, and — most dangerously — the identities of Meduza’s collaborators inside Russia.&nbsp;</p><p>It was soon clear, however, that it was impossible to assess what had been compromised. “They got everything,” Kolpakov recalls. “Everything they wanted.”</p><p>Those at the meeting say Meduza’s technical director was the only one who remained calm, but he remembers it differently: “I sat there, plugging my ears, and I tried to write out a checklist for Galya: new password, new device, new Apple ID, new SIM card.” Timchenko tried at first to “laugh it off,” says Alexey, but eventually she burst into tears:</p><p>The most unpleasant questions came from Ivan: “What documents were you working with on your iPhone? Did you activate two-factor authentication everywhere?” I already felt like I’d been stripped naked in the town square. Like someone had reached into my pocket. Like I was dirty somehow. I wanted to wash my hands! And then my partner and best friend starts interrogating me as if I’d put everyone at risk. It really hurt… But I’d have demanded the same if I were in his shoes. Ivan was just very nervous.</p><p>It is virtually <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/pegasus-spyware-and-citizen-surveillance-what-you-need-to-know/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">impossible</a> to prevent infection by Pegasus; it can hack any gadget running a single application vulnerable to the software, including apps preinstalled by Apple itself. A device hijacked by Pegasus isn’t easy to spot, either. For instance, Timchenko had no reason to suspect anything was amiss with her iPhone, except for moments when it seemed warmer than usual, which she attributed to her new charger.</p><p>Citizen Lab’s analysis shows attackers likely infiltrated Timchenko’s iPhone through HomeKit and iMessage. Senior researcher John Scott-Railton says his team found digital footprints unique to Pegasus. “No other spyware would have left this,” he told Meduza.<em> </em>Researchers believe Timchenko’s hackers used the so-called “<a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/b1kaznhzh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PWNYOURHOME</a>” vulnerability, which targets iPhones’ built-in HomeKit functionality and exploits iMessage to install the spyware. Scott-Railton says this hack is possible even on devices where HomeKit was never activated.</p><p>Citizen Lab collected “forensic artifacts” from Timchenko’s iPhone showing that the device was infected with Pegasus on February 10, 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Wild timing</strong></h3><p>As managers crowded into Galina Timchenko’s office and scrambled to assess the worst intrusion in Meduza’s history, another event back in Russia suddenly demanded the newsroom’s complete attention: a mercenary leader shot down several helicopters, seized a military base, and announced a “march on Moscow.” It was June 23, 2023, and the Pegasus hack silently took a backseat to Yevgeny Prigozhin’s mutiny as Meduza mobilized its newsroom to cover the breaking story.</p><p>When the senior staff could later contemplate the possible reasons for Timchenko’s Pegasus infection, the date of the infiltration (February 10, 2023) wasn’t immediately significant to managers. But it should have been.</p><p>On February 11, one day after Pegasus hijacked Timchenko’s iPhone, she and Kolpakov joined other representatives of Russia’s exiled independent media in Berlin at a confidential seminar organized by the Redkollegia journalistic prize committee. Media managers and lawyers attended the private conference to discuss the legal aspects of operating in Russia under the conditions of total state censorship and the mass persecution of journalists and activists. Just two weeks earlier, Russia’s Prosecutor General formally outlawed Meduza’s reporting, designating the outlet an “undesirable organization.” Timchenko recalls that colleagues meeting in Germany expected the same thing would happen to them before long.</p><p>Pegasus was already running on Timchenko’s phone when she joined the meeting in Berlin. Whoever hacked the device could have used it as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/19/apple-iphone-nso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wiretap</a>, remotely activating the microphone to record anything said within earshot. The hackers might have turned on the camera just as easily. “They could have used Galina’s phone like a bug to listen in on what the Russian journalists were planning,” says Access Now’s Natalia Krapiva.</p><p>“My first thought was the Russian state and the Russian intelligence agencies, of course,” recalls Timchenko. “Who else cares about me?”</p><h3><strong>The first Russian journalist</strong></h3><p>The attack against Galina Timchenko is the <span data-id="1463701" data-title="First confirmed case" data-body="<p>Others have reported Pegasus attacks, but Timchenko’s is the first infection that researchers have verified. For example, investigative journalists uncovered a <a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/21/telegram-founder-pavel-durov-listed-spyware-targets-nso-leak-pegasus&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>list of individuals</a> selected by NSO Group’s client governments that included Telegram founder Pavel Durov’s British telephone number, but there is no public record of a forensic examination of Durov’s phone to confirm if the malware was ever installed.&amp;nbsp;</p>">first confirmed case</span> of Pegasus being used against a Russian journalist. Natalia Krapiva at Access Now confessed to Meduza that she’s actually somewhat comforted to see the spyware surface here because researchers have tested the phones of nearly two dozen journalists and activists from Russia and found all manner of malware but never Pegasus. “I was afraid that [they] were being tracked by something we couldn’t detect,” she explained. “The first confirmed case was shocking, thrilling, and a relief all at once. Now, at least, we have a thread to pull.”</p><p>Identifying Pegasus infections is challenging work, even for technical experts. “These spyware programs are capable of hiding logfiles and concealing traces of their own presence on a device,” explains John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab. “It’s a constant <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/04/nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-returns-in-2022/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">technological race</a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, it was researchers at Citizen Lab and Lookout Security who first uncovered traces of the existence of Pegasus, revealing in a <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2016/08/million-dollar-dissident-iphone-zero-day-nso-group-uae/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bombshell report</a> that NSO Group’s “remote monitoring solution” was used to spy on Ahmed Mansoor, an internationally recognized human rights defender based in the United Arab Emirates. In the years since this discovery, experts have <a href="https://newnaratif.com/pegasus-spyware-in-southeast-asia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tracked</a> Pegasus’s digital footprints and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learned</a> which states are NSO Group’s clients.</p><p>Much of Citizen Lab’s work is devoted to searching for the servers needed to run Pegasus. “It’s a service, and NSO Group sells access to it,” says Krapiva. “When it signs a contract, the company sends a whole team to the client state to organize training sessions on how to run the tool. All this requires technical infrastructure, and Citizen Lab is constantly trying to monitor it.”</p><p>Scott-Railton told Meduza that his team looks not just for the infrastructure used in attacks but also for what’s needed to extract data. “In other words,” he explained, “[we look for] all the servers where the information collected from infected devices ends up.”</p><hr><h4>A message from Galina Timchenko:</h4><p>Sometimes we become the heroes of our own stories: it's a rather strange experience to turn from the subject into the object. In my case, first as the object of an attack, and then as the object of an investigation. But it's at precisely these moments that you realize what good people you have in your corner: fellow journalists, developers, security specialists, and most importantly, readers. Millions of people in Russia who haven't give up, despite enormous pressure. Hundreds of thousands around the world who understand the value of freedom of speech. <strong>We need your help to continue our work. <a href="https://support.meduza.io/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Support Meduza</a>.</strong></p><hr><h3><strong>The no-no list</strong></h3><p>NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to vetted state agencies, but Israeli geopolitical interests often influence the company’s decision to work with particular partners. For these reasons, the firm reportedly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2021/07/19/us-phone-numbers-nso/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refuses</a> to use Pegasus against either American or Russian telephone numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>“Infected phones cannot even be physically located in the United States; if one does find itself within American borders, the Pegasus software is supposed to self-destruct,” the spyware’s designers said in 2020. A year earlier, when the Estonian government bought access to Pegasus, NSO Group informed its new client that using the spyware against Russian targets is prohibited. Israel has also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/israel-ukraine-pegasus-spyware-russia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reportedly blocked</a> Ukraine from acquiring Pegasus, fearing Moscow’s wrath. “According to people close to NSO and the Israeli government, they don’t approve such infections because it will disrupt relations with these countries,” says Natalia Krapiva.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has also <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/19/1006458/nso-spyware-controversy-pegasus-human-rights/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">claimed</a> that Russia and China are among the nations that will “never be customers,” citing internal due diligence that scrutinizes potential clients’ track records on human rights, corruption, safety, finance, and abuse. NSO Group chief executive <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/head-of-israeli-cyber-firm-nso-group-reaffirms-company-commitment-to-spyware-11674738269" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yaron Shohat</a> told The Wall Street Journal in January 2023 that the firm was “committed to its core business of supplying governments around the world who are allies of the U.S. and Israel,” despite downsizing after losing clients because of the Biden administration’s measures.</p><p>Moscow possibly has its own reasons for refusing to do business with NSO Group. Investigative journalist Andrey Soldatov has <a href="https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2021/07/21/why-is-russia-not-using-pegasus-spyware-a74572" rel="noopener" target="_blank">argued</a> that Russia’s intelligence community “is a seller, not a buyer,” on the world market for espionage technology. Soldatov says this is due both to the high quality of Russian spying tech and to the authorities’ “extreme paranoia about foreign spyware.” Revelations about Pegasus, moreover, have corroborated these concerns, showing that the data stolen from targets are transferred to servers in NSO Group’s ecosystem, meaning that Russian agencies would have to share this “information goldmine” with outsiders if they were to sign up as clients. Russia’s Federal Security Service did not respond to Meduza’s questions about Pegasus.</p><p>“We do not see evidence of Russia using NSO’s product, but that doesn’t mean we know everything,” says John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab.</p><p>A spokesperson for NSO Group told Meduza that the company’s technologies “are only sold to allies of the U.S. and Israel, particularly in Western Europe, for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror, aligned with the global interests of U.S. national security and governmental law enforcement agencies.”</p><p>“Pegasus systems log every attack in case there is a complaint, and — with the client’s permission — NSO can perform an after-the-fact forensic analysis,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/28/magazine/nso-group-israel-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> in January 2022. Six months later, NSO Group general counsel and chief compliance officer Chaim Gelfand told a European Parliament committee that these internal investigations have led to the termination of contracts in <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/eu-parliaments-pegasus-committee-fires-against-nso-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">eight cases</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A year earlier, however, when The Washington Post reported forensic data indicating multiple Pegasus intrusion attempts against Jamal Khashoggi’s wife in the months before his murder, NSO Group’s chief executive <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/interactive/2021/hanan-elatr-phone-pegasus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> a “thorough check of the firm’s client records” revealed no evidence of Pegasus used against Khashoggi or his loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>“After hundreds of victims, we have concluded that the internal review process either doesn’t exist or exists only for show,” says Natalia Krapiva at Access Now. “When a Human Rights Watch employee was infected, NSO responded to all the questions in just a few lines: ‘Thank you, we found nothing with our current customers. Goodbye.’ Of course, they said nothing about what their past clients could have done. It’s all gaslighting.”</p><h3><strong>Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan</strong></h3><p>In its study of Galina Timchenko’s phone infection, Access Now notes that either Kazakhstan or Azerbaijan — two suspected Pegasus clients — could have carried out the attack at Moscow’s request. (According to Access Now, Uzbekistan is not believed to have been a Pegasus customer during the period in question.) “There’s a provisional theory that Russia might have asked its partners,” says Krapiva. “Kazakhstan, for example, has already blocked Meduza <a href="https://tengrinews.kz/kazakhstan_news/meduzaio-snova-zablokirovali-v-kazahstane-410580/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">twice</a> without any requests.”</p><p>As far as researchers know, however, neither Kazakhstan nor Azerbaijan has ever executed a Pegasus attack in Europe, and Timchenko was in Germany when the infection occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, evidence collected by Citizen Lab shows that Kazakhstan does not use Pegasus beyond its borders. Scott-Railton told Meduza that Azerbaijan does use the spyware abroad, but researchers have recorded these attacks in no other country except Armenia, which could <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/publication/armenia-spyware-victims-pegasus-hacking-in-war/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">explain</a> how the phone numbers of Armenian human rights activists have been infected.</p><p>Natalia Krapiva says clients need a bonus package to use Pegasus beyond their borders: “We believe that different NSO customers can purchase different types of licenses. Some buy the rights to hack only within their country. Others buy the rights to infect a large number of countries. We still don’t understand a lot about these secret contracts, but infections outside a client’s state likely require special permission.”</p><h3><strong>Latvia, Estonia, and Germany</strong></h3><p>Timchenko’s hacked iPhone had a Latvian SIM card. Citizen Lab <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/09/hide-and-seek-tracking-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware-to-operations-in-45-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recorded</a> the first Pegasus-related activity in Latvia in 2018, and experts believe Riga still uses NSO Group’s products today, says Scott-Railton.&nbsp;</p><p>Access Now also does not rule out that the Latvian intelligence community carried out the attack on Meduza’s co-founder. Just two months before Timchenko’s phone was infected, Latvia <a href="https://meduza.io/en/feature/2022/12/06/meduza-s-statement-regarding-the-revocation-of-tv-rain-s-latvian-broadcasting-license" rel="noopener" target="_blank">declared</a> another Russian media organization in exile — TV Rain — to be “a threat to the national security and public order” and canceled its local broadcasting license. “Because of the invasion of Ukraine, there’s distrust of all Russians without exception,” says Natalia Krapiva. “If such surveillance is taking place, it’s very consistent with <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/petr-pavel-russia-czech-republic-surveillance/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">remarks</a> by the president of the Czech Republic, Petr Pavel, who said intelligence agencies should place all Russians living in the West under ‘strict surveillance’ as the price of Russia’s war against Ukraine.”</p><p>However, experts at Citizen Lab have never observed Riga using Pegasus against targets outside Latvia’s borders, and Galina Timchenko was in Berlin when her phone was compromised. (Whom exactly Riga has infected with Pegasus remains unknown.)</p><p>Ivars Ijabs, a European Parliament member from Latvia who participates in a committee investigating Pegasus in Europe, told <a href="https://www.baltictimes.com/latvian_mep_ivars_ijabs___unfortunately___spyware_has_been_sold_or_rented_out_to_some_eu_countries_and_some_use_it_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Baltic Times</a> in January 2023 that his home country is not among the E.U. members using the “famous Israeli spyware.” But NGOs that monitor Pegasus attacks treat such statements with skepticism. “He’s not the first official to say such things, even in the face of evidence,” notes Krapiva.</p><p>While there’s no proof that Lithuania has used Pegasus, researchers have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/israel-ukraine-pegasus-spyware-russia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that the Estonian authorities bought access to the spyware in 2019. Citizen Lab has corroborated these findings. More importantly, says Scott-Railton, his team has tracked Estonia “infecting targets beyond its borders in many E.U. countries, including in Germany.”</p><p>Acting under the “<a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-secretly-bought-nso-pegasus-spyware/a-59113197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">utmost secrecy</a>,” the German Federal Criminal Police Office procured its own Pegasus access in 2019 but <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/germany-admits-police-used-controversial-pegasus-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> the purchase only two years later. Natalia Krapiva says Germany has tried, albeit unconvincingly, to defend its actions as in step with European laws and democratic values:</p><p>The <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/papers/edps-preliminary-remarks-modern-spyware_en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a> by the European Data Protection Supervisor states explicitly that Pegasus in its original form is fundamentally incompatible with E.U. laws, so Germany, in its own words, is using a “special version that doesn’t violate privacy rights” — some kind of “Pegasus Lite.” But we’ve received no evidence of this, not even an idea of what a “lite” version might be. Also, the European Data Protection Supervisor <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/publications/papers/edps-preliminary-remarks-modern-spyware_en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">concludes</a> that Pegasus in any form is fundamentally incompatible with E.U. law.</p><p>Germany’s Pegasus access reportedly came with “certain functions blocked to prevent abuse,” sources in security circles told <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/german-police-secretly-bought-nso-pegasus-spyware/a-59113197" rel="noopener" target="_blank">journalists</a>, but officials have not explained how this works practically.</p><p>John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab says the infection of Timchenko’s phone in Berlin “is a reminder that Europe has an unresolved problem with Pegasus.” “Why Germany isn’t interested in solving this is a mystery to me,” he told Meduza. “For example, why hasn’t Berlin signed the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/03/30/joint-statement-on-efforts-to-counter-the-proliferation-and-misuse-of-commercial-spyware/#:~:text=Our%20efforts%20will%20allow%20us,rule%20of%20law%2C%20and%20civil" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joint Statement on Efforts to Counter the Proliferation and Misuse of Commercial Spyware</a>? It’s been signed by 11 countries, including Denmark, France, and Sweden.”&nbsp;</p><p>Access Now points out that the four E.U. members that have become new centers of Russian anti-war emigration — Latvia, Estonia, Germany, and the Netherlands — are all suspected Pegasus users. In fact, the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/committees/en/pega/home/highlights" rel="noopener" target="_blank">E.U. PEGA Committee</a> revealed at least <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/eu-pegasus-spyware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">14 E.U. states and 22 operators</a> of Pegasus in the European Union, and only NSO Group’s contracts with Hungary and Poland are no more. Access Now considers the attack on Galina Timchenko to be at least the fourth in a series of similar cases across Europe in the past year. (Meduza knows the details of these other attacks, but the victims have asked for privacy.)</p><p>The growing tendency in Europe to treat journalists as a threat has also started manifesting in E.U. laws, says Krapiva. The European Commission recently adopted new rules intended to protect reporters against malware, but some member states — mainly France and Sweden — watered down the language in the <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/22/draft-eu-plans-to-allow-spying-on-journalists-are-dangerous-warn-critics" rel="noopener" target="_blank">European Media Freedom Act</a> in such a way that the law actually legitimizes the surveillance of journalists on national security grounds, Krapiva warns.</p><h3><strong>The road ahead</strong></h3><p>“I’m absolutely shocked we’re seriously discussing that a European state could have done this,” says Ivan Kolpakov, Meduza’s editor-in-chief. “I’m probably naive, but this seemed impossible to me. The consequences could be devastating, and this concerns not just the news media in exile but the media in Europe generally. If such software could be installed on the phone of a journalist from Russia, who knows what’s stopping European intelligence agencies from infecting any journalist at all.”</p><p>“I can’t reconstruct the logic of European intelligence agencies that might have installed Pegasus, and I don’t want to make assumptions,” says Galina Timchenko. “Moving forward, we’ll act in accordance with what our lawyers advise. I won’t be silent.”&nbsp;</p><p>NSO Group declined to answer Meduza’s questions about whether it knew of the attack on Timchenko and which of its clients might have staged the intrusion. The company’s spokesperson also did not say if it is aware of cases in which Pegasus has been used against journalists in European countries or against Russian nationals, or if NSO Group knows of situations where one E.U. member state spied on a target in another E.U. member state.</p><p>In any case, NSO Group admits no responsibility for the attack on Timchenko. The company’s spokesperson stressed that the firm “investigates all credible allegations of misuse” but did not say if NSO is prepared to conduct an internal investigation into the use of Pegasus against Meduza’s co-founder and publisher.</p><p>Today, Ms. Timchenko carries two phones: a new one she bought after the intrusion and the formerly infected gadget (Citizen Lab confirmed that Pegasus is no longer installed on the device). She says she decided to keep it as a souvenir. “There’s nothing on it except messages with my hairdresser and manicurist,” she says. “Let it be. It will remind me to keep looking over my shoulder.”</p><p>Given the enormous cost of using Pegasus, Timchenko is still confounded that someone infected her with the spyware. “Just what were they planning to find? They put me under a magnifying glass, hoping to catch something… Go ahead and watch, you creeps! Feast your eyes.”</p><p>Whatever happens with Timchenko’s case, NSO Group currently faces multiple lawsuits, including one from <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-business/apple-to-add-lockdown-safeguard-on-iphones-ipads-macs/?email=2bd1ac6da700241a5d265ad2552e521de17fb0a4&amp;emaila=29a3bf909662b52e722ab9fa8cfe64ca&amp;emailb=7d7168def837475e171e85ff6c1d865452fcebe7dfd653fc8df6c0ec1815818f" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Apple</a>, which accuses the Israeli firm’s employees of being “amoral 21st-century mercenaries.” <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/nso-group-pegasus-spyware.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Amnesty International</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IUoH78802o" rel="noopener" target="_blank">members</a> of the European Parliament, former U.N.

That needs to change,” <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering.</p><p>NSO Group has turned to <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2023/04/03/dzho-bayden-v-2021-godu-nalozhil-sanktsii-na-kompaniyu-razrabotchika-shpionskogo-po-pegasus-a-cherez-pyat-dney-ona-poluchila-ot-vlastey-ssha-taynyy-kontrakt" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lobbying</a> as these pressures mount, especially in America. “They’re making a big effort to lift the U.S. sanctions,” Krapiva told Meduza. “Recently, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/nso-group-spyware-pegasus-takeover" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Robert Simonds</a>, a Hollywood producer who’s worked with Adam Sandler, was eyeing an investment in NSO Group. So, they’re staying the course.”</p><p>Since June 2023, experts have analyzed the phones of several dozen Meduza employees. It’s still unknown what specific information Timchenko’s attackers were after. This ambiguity worries Meduza’s technical director, Alexey, more than anyone.</p><p>“Until I know the motive, I have to expect the worst,” says Alexey. “I deal with our security not just in a technical but in the broadest sense of the word: every day, I think through how they’re going to kill us and bring us down. Surveillance, harassment, threats — I’ve already considered all these scenarios and experienced them myself, in a sense. As for Pegasus, until we have more details, we can’t rule out that Russia could have ordered the infection and that this spying could have the most serious consequences, right up to somebody being eliminated.”</p><p>Timchenko, meanwhile, says she hasn’t yet contemplated such consequences of being watched through Pegasus. “I already look back wherever I go and watch for anyone following me in a car.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-b32ae79894df0a16ce66">
  <h4>Introduction</h4><p>The introduction of diffusion-based generative models has revolutionized the field of generative AI over the last few years, leading to rapid improvements in the quality and controllability of generated images, video, and audio. Diffusion models working in the latent encoding space of a pre-trained autoencoder, termed “latent diffusion models”, provide significant speed improvements to the training and inference of diffusion models.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main issues with generating audio using diffusion models is that diffusion models are usually trained to generate a fixed-size output. For example, an audio diffusion model might be trained on 30-second audio clips, and will only be able to generate audio in 30-second chunks. This is an issue when training on and trying to generate audio of greatly varying lengths, as is the case when generating full songs.</p><p>Audio diffusion models tend to be trained on randomly cropped chunks of audio from longer audio files, cropped or padded to fit the diffusion model’s training length. In the case of music, this causes the model to tend to generate arbitrary sections of a song, which may start or end in the middle of a musical phrase.</p><p>We introduce Stable Audio, a latent diffusion model architecture for audio conditioned on text metadata as well as audio file duration and start time, allowing for control over the content and length of the generated audio. This additional timing conditioning allows us to generate audio of a specified length up to the training window size.</p><p>Working with a heavily downsampled latent representation of audio allows for much faster inference times compared to raw audio. Using the latest advancements in diffusion sampling techniques, our flagship Stable Audio model is able to render 95 seconds of stereo audio at a 44.1 kHz sample rate in less than one second on an NVIDIA A100 GPU.</p><h4>Audio Samples</h4><p><strong>Music</strong></p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1694584350812_37801">
  <p>The Stable Audio models are latent diffusion models consisting of a few different parts, similar to Stable Diffusion: A variational autoencoder (VAE), a text encoder, and a U-Net-based conditioned diffusion model.</p><p>The VAE compresses stereo audio into a data-compressed, noise-resistant, and invertible lossy latent encoding that allows for faster generation and training than working with the raw audio samples themselves. We use a fully-convolutional architecture based on the <a href="https://github.com/descriptinc/descript-audio-codec" target="_blank"><span>Descript Audio Codec</span></a> encoder and decoder architectures to allow for arbitrary-length audio encoding and decoding, and high-fidelity outputs.</p><p>To condition the model on text prompts, we use the frozen text encoder of a <a href="https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLAP/" target="_blank"><span>CLAP</span></a> model trained from scratch on our dataset. The use of a CLAP model allows the text features to contain some information about the relationships between words and sounds. We use the text features from the penultimate layer of the CLAP text encoder to obtain an informative representation of the tokenized input text. These text features are provided to the diffusion U-Net through cross-attention layers.</p><p>For the timing embeddings, we calculate two properties during training time when gathering a chunk of audio from our training data: the second from which the chunk starts (termed “seconds_start”) and the overall number of seconds in the original audio file (termed “seconds_total”). For example, if we take a 30-second chunk from an 80-second audio file, with the chunk starting at 0:14, then “seconds_start” is 14, and “seconds_total” is 80. These second values are translated into per-second discrete learned embeddings and concatenated with the prompt tokens before being passed into the U-Net’s cross-attention layers. During inference, these same values are provided to the model as conditioning, allowing the user to specify the overall length of the output audio.&nbsp;</p><div><p>The diffusion model for Stable Audio is a 907M parameter U-Net based on the model used in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11757" target="_blank"><span>Moûsai</span></a>. It uses a combination of residual layers, self-attention layers, and cross-attention layers to denoise the input conditioned on text and timing embeddings. Memory-efficient implementations of attention were added to the U-Net to allow the model to scale more efficiently to longer sequence lengths.</p></div><h4>Dataset</h4><p>To train our flagship Stable Audio model, we used a dataset consisting of over 800,000 audio files containing music, sound effects, and single-instrument stems, as well as corresponding text metadata, provided through a deal with stock music provider AudioSparx. This dataset adds up to over 19,500 hours of audio.</p><h4>Future work and open models</h4><p>Stable Audio represents the cutting-edge audio generation research by Stability AI’s generative audio research lab, Harmonai. We continue to improve our model architectures, datasets, and training procedures to improve output quality, controllability, inference speed, and output length.</p><p>Keep an eye out for upcoming releases from Harmonai, including open-source models based on Stable Audio and training code to allow you to train your audio generation models.</p>

A simple spectrometer can be built from a CD and a box.  Cut a slit on one side of the box.  Place the CD on the other side with about 60 degree angle.  Look down into the openning on the box.  The slit should not be too wide, otherwise the spectrum lines will be blurred.  It should not be too narrow either, otherwise the spectrum is too dim.  I use a 0.2mm wide slit.

</p><p>
Let's look at the spectra of some common light sources.  All photos by the authors with a Nikon coolpix 995 camera.
</p><p>
(1) Solar spectrum is continuous with dark lines, i.e. the famous Fraunhofer lines.  Several Fraunhofer lines can be seen with this simple spectroscope (1c, 1d): 
C line in dark red(H-alpha, 656nm), orange D(Na,589nm), 
green E(Fe,527nm) and b1,b2(Mg,518nm),
blue F(H-beta, 486nm), 
purple G(Fe and Ca, 431nm). 
</p><p>
Interestingly the solar spectrum changes with the Sun's altitude!  
As the Sun is lower its light passes more Earth atmosphere.
Comparing (1c) and (1d) we found a new dark line 'a' in red (molecular oxygen in Earth's atmosphere).  Who can tell me what the dark band under D is?
</p><p>
(2) Incandescent light is typical black body radiation, with continuous spectrum.  No black lines.  Same with tungsten halogen lamp.
</p><p>
(3) Fluorescent light has mercury gas emitting (mostly) ultraviolet light, which activates phosphor.  The latter emits broad band visible light.   Therefore we see bright mercury spectrum lines, most obviously green 546nm, on a continuous backgroud.
</p><p>
(4) The spectrum of high pressure sodium lights changes too!  When the lamp is just on, there are several bright spectrum lines including yellow sodium at 589nm (4c).  In a few seconds as the light gets brighter, the yellow line becomes wider, and a thin dark gap emerges at the center (4d, 4e).  After the lamp stablizes, cooler sodium vapor absorbs light at 589nm, and we see a thick gap (4f, 4b).  Note the camera settings for (4c--f) are the same.
</p><p>
(5) Spectrum of white screen on a computer display. 
</p><p>
(6) Laptop display is different from a CRT display.
</p><p>
(7) Red LED emits continuous spectrum in red.
</p><p>
(8) Neon bulb has many red and orange discrete bright spectrum lines.
</p><p>
(9) The night light uses phosphors and emits a continuous spectrum.
</p><p>
(10) Compact fluorescent light is similar to a normal fluorescent light but with tri-color phosphors.  Instead of a continuous backgroup, it emits bright lines of various colors.
</p><p>
(11) The green and purple neon tubes actually contain argon and mercury, with different phosphors produce different color.  The mercury line is visible.
</p><p>
(12) I took this photo before the 
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhuxj/astro/html/lunareclipse041027.html#lunareclipse041027">total lunar eclipse of 2004</a>
.  Moonlight from a full moon was collected with an 8" Dob telescope.  The spectroscope was held behind the eyepiece.  As moonlight is nothing but reflected sunlight, the spectrum looks the same as a solar spectrum (1). It is continuous with dark absort lines, i.e. the Fraunhofer lines (some of them are marked).
</p><p>
(13) Candle light has a continuous spectrum.  In the first few seconds after a candle (or a match) is lit, there is also the yellow sodium line which disappears thereafter.  If table salt is burnt, the yellow sodium line becomes prominent.  The sodium line should be double lines, but this simple device cannot resolve them.
</p><p>
(14) Metal halide lamp has a complex spectrum.
</p><p>
(15) The blue neon sign could be a mixture of argon and mercury (or phosphors).  The red neon sign truly contains NEON, which is the same as in the neon bulb (8).

          <div>
              <!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unity, one of the most common tools for making video games, announced additional fees yesterday that will charge game developers every time someone installs their game. It was instantly and universally rejected by many game developers, who said Unity’s announcement undercuts work they’ve been doing for years and could potentially bankrupt them.</p><p>Unity announced the new plan in a <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates?ref=404media.co">post</a> on its website, but more details emerged on <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/unity-to-start-charging-fee-pegged-to-game-installs?ref=404media.co">Game Developer</a>, a site catering to people working in the video game industry. The new fees are in addition to the annual cost of making commercial products with Unity, which are available at <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/pro-enterprise-new-pricing?ref=404media.co">a few tiers</a> between $2,000 and $5,000 per year. According to Game Developer, these new fees will be collected from game developers on a monthly basis, charging them between $0.01 to $0.20 per install, depending on how many copies they sold, in what region (emerging markets have lower fees), and what Unity plan the developer is paying for already. </p><p>The video game development community is still scrambling to unpack how Unity’s new pricing scheme will impact them, but some developers who spoke to 404 Media said that Unity’s changes are a “disaster” and that they are already eyeing open source alternatives for their next projects.</p><p>The news appears to hit the indie game developers especially hard because so many of them use Unity as an affordable, easy to use game engine. </p><p>Sam Barlow, writer and director of <em>Immortality </em>at game developer Half Mermaid, referenced a term coined by Cory Doctrow, “enshittification,” to describe what Unity is doing. Enshittification refers to companies that create a good product, then ramp up fees and deteriorate the service to take advantage of users who are locked into it. </p><p>“This feels like a real enshittification moment for indie game developers,” Barlow said. “It seems born of a focus on games-as-service and a live ops process of maximizing cost per install. That's not the world I make games for—a world where premium indie games are more and more looking to subscription to break even, there's a key disconnect between installs and actual revenue.”</p><p>“I've been a paying Unity user since 2010, starting with Unity 2.6. This is an incredibly damaging and poorly thought out policy, whose announcement raises a horde of questions,” Danny Day from QCF Design, a developer in South Africa, told me. “If Unity goes ahead with this change, it's going to impact many developers negatively, most notably those that started working on projects in Unity years ago, under the assumption that the company wouldn't suddenly spring new costs on them or make their work unattractive for certain platforms.”</p><p>The core issue is what Unity is calling “Unity Runtime Fee.” This pricing scheme will charge game developers a fee every time someone installs their game after the game developer reaches a certain revenue and install threshold. Specifically, Unity will start charging game developers under the Unity Personal and Unity Plus plans after they make $200,000 in the last 12 months and have at least 200,000 lifetime game installs. Game developers in the Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise plans will get hit with the fee once they’ve made $1 million and a million lifetime game installs. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Critically, Unity clarified to 404 Media in an email that “The counter for Unity Runtime fee installs starts on January 1, 2024 - it is not retroactive or perpetual. We will charge once for a new install; not an ongoing perpetual license royalty, like revenue share.” I say critically because I saw some developers interpret the policy to be retroactive, meaning they would suddenly be hit with a bill for years’ worth of installs. Unity says this is not the case. However, new installs on new games will apparently impact game developers, forcing a new business model they didn’t prepare for when they initially published the games. Regardless of when a game was released, it'll be subject to these new fees starting in 2024.</p><p>Even worse, Unity later <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=company_global_blog_2023-09-13_updated-forums-faq">clarified</a> that it will charge developers for multiple installs by the same user. This creates a nightmare scenario for developers where disgruntled gamers could install, delete, and reinstall games as many times as they can stand just to inflict fees on developers they don’t like, a scary possibility in an industry where users are known to review bomb and send death threats to game developers.</p><p>Unity is not clear in its <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/unity-plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates.1482750/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=company_global_blog_2023-09-13_updated-forums-faq">FAQ</a> how it’s keeping track of who is installing Unity games. To the question “Is software made in unity going to be calling home to unity whenever it's ran, even for enterprice [sic] licenses?” Unity says: “We use a composite model for counting runtime installs that collects data from numerous sources. The Unity Runtime Fee will use data in compliance with GDPR and CCPA. The data being requested is aggregated and is being used for billing purposes.”</p><p>“I think this is worse in some key ways than a revenue share agreement like Unreal's, which serves a similar purpose. Downloads are not a good proxy for revenue, and the gap between them creates some real risk for developers,” Andre Infante, a game developer at Meta, told me. Infante said he was only speaking for himself, not his employer. “People have raised the specter of being charged for piracy, or people installing the game on virtual machines over and over again to punish developers who displease them.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->  <div>

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Unity has not responded to 404 Media’s questions about how this system might be abused, but Stephen Totilo of Axios <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1701679722873127404?ref=404media.co">said</a> Unity told him it plans to use fraud detection tools and allow developers to report possible instances of fraud.</p><p>“In all my years of working on products for developers, I simply cannot think of any instance where this would have made it to the drawing board, let alone the general public, because it requires a fundamental misunderstanding of what a middleware company <em>is</em> to even try to enter that territory,” Ethan Lee, <a href="https://www.404media.co/meet-the-guy-preserving-the-new-history-of-pc-games-one-linux-port-at-a-time/">a developer who specializes in maintaining and porting games to Linux</a>, told me. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/AndreTI/status/1701614046653649128?ref=404media.co">On Twitter</a>, Infante said “I'm pretty upset about having to learn a new engine. I've spent the last ten years getting pretty good at Unity. Most of those skills will transfer, but not all of them.”</p><p>Some developers also wondered if Unity was expecting game developers to self-report their revenue, as Unity would not have a clear picture of exactly how much money their games are making. Unity told 404 Media, “We leverage our own proprietary data model, so you can appreciate that we won’t go into a lot of detail, but we believe it gives an accurate determination of &nbsp;the number of times the runtime is distributed for a given project.”</p><p>"In games at least, I can't think of a truly comparable example that would have the same scale of impact,” Laine Nooney, a media professor at New York University and the author of <em>The Apple II Age: How the Computer Became Personal</em>, told me. “These are monetization tactics basically only possible under platform capitalism – where software like Unity can leverage the surveillance capacities of networked computing to continue to slice out revenue for itself in ways that would have been previously impossible.”</p><p>Even if Unity’s proprietary model was accurate and developers were not subject to abuse by repeated installs, developers told 404 Media that the new pricing structure was a shocking and upsetting change. One big problem is that some Unity developers publish games for free and then earn money via in-game purchases. In these scenarios, only a fraction of people who install the game actually pay for anything. Another problem is that many indie games are sold via bundles, where they are included for a fraction of the price, or are also included for free. In these scenarios, game developers are racking up many installs without earning enough money to cover the fees. </p><p>“Certain traditional practices (bundling, discounting) combined with subscription models mean there are scenarios I can imagine where a dev *loses* money with certain types of success,” Barlow said. </p><p>“The policy seems to be completely unaware of how the market is currently structured, with massive impacts on bundle deals, subscription services, giveaways, f2p games and even piracy,” Day told me. “Do I, as a developer, have to pay Unity when pirates install my game? Platforms that have information security and privacy obligations are going to suddenly view Unity projects as potential risks rather than the favorable view they had previously... This is a disaster.”</p><p>Some developers told me that they are already looking at different game engines, like Unreal. One emerging alternative, seemingly as a reaction to what the profit seeking did to Unity, is an open source game engine called <a href="https://godotengine.org/?ref=404media.co">Godot</a>. Four game developers I talked to said they are looking to move to Godot in the future because of the Unity news. The other two told me they are looking at Unreal.</p><p>But that will take time. Until then, game developers have to deal with Unity’s new pricing scheme, which will impact their published games, or games that are too far into development to switch to a different engine. </p><p>“The absolute biggest issue for me is that their new terms apply retroactively to games already released, to older versions of Unity, where people released projects expecting and relying on unity's business model to remain the same and so throwing this curveball is a massive breach of trust,” Freya Holmér, who makes tools for Unity developers and has a popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvPPXbo87ds&amp;ab_channel=FreyaHolm%C3%A9r&amp;ref=404media.co">YouTube channel</a> on the subject, told me. </p><p>They told me that the news is especially hurtful because Unity was the technology so many of them used to get into game development in the first place. </p><p>“Unity's original mission was ‘<a href="https://unity.com/our-company/newsroom/unity-drives-democratization-development-2016-eight-unite-conferences-globally?ref=404media.co">Democratizing game development</a>,’” Andreia "shana" Gaita of Spoiled Cat told me. “Unity made game development accessible (not just being easy, but affordable) to everyone. There's a reason the majority of mobile games are Unity – small developers, small budgets, successful projects, people could make a living from games. This is not the same Unity as it was in those days.”</p><p>“If this was just the future of Unity, it'd still sound pretty upsetting and confusing, but the fact they are applying this retroactively to *every game every made in Unity* seems like a real slap around the face and stab in the back at the same time,” Barlow said. “My indie career started because of Unity and I guess that makes it even more confusing and painful.”</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->

            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ExLlamaV2</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a very initial release of ExLlamaV2, an inference library for running local LLMs on modern consumer GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">It still needs a lot of testing and tuning, and a few key features are not yet implemented. Don't be surprised if
things are a bit broken to start with, as almost all of this code is completely new and only tested on a few setups
so far.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview of differences compared to V1</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Faster, better kernels</li>
<li>Cleaner and more versatile codebase</li>
<li>Support for a new quant format (see below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Performance</h2>
<p dir="auto">Some quick tests to compare performance with V1. There may be more performance optimizations in the future, and
speeds will vary across GPUs, with slow CPUs still being a potential bottleneck:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to</h2>
<p dir="auto">Clone the repository and install dependencies:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2
cd exllamav2
pip install -r requirements.txt

python test_inference.py -m <path_to_model> -p &quot;Once upon a time,&quot;"><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2
cd exllamav2
pip install -r requirements.txt

python test_inference.py -m &lt;path_to_model&gt; -p "Once upon a time,"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">For now, a simple console chatbot is included. Run it with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python examples/chat.py -m <path_to_model> -mode llama"><pre><code>python examples/chat.py -m &lt;path_to_model&gt; -mode llama
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The <code>-mode</code> argument chooses the prompt format to use. <code>llama</code> is for the Llama(2)-chat finetunes, while <code>codellama</code>
probably works better for CodeLlama-instruct. <code>raw</code> will produce a simple chatlog-style chat that works with base
models and various other finetunes. You can also provide a custom system prompt with <code>-sp</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h3>
<p dir="auto">To install as a library (not required for the included examples), clone the repository and run:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python setup.py install --user"><pre><code>python setup.py install --user
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">ExLlamaV2 relies on a Torch C++ extension for its CUDA functions, which is compiled at runtime. This means the first
time the library is used it will take 10-20 seconds (depending on your hardware) to start, but the extension gets cached
for subsequent use. A PyPI package will evantually be available with an option to install a precompiled extension.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">EXL2 quantization</h2>
<p dir="auto">ExLlamaV2 supports the same 4-bit GPTQ models as V1, but also a new "EXL2" format. EXL2 is based on the same
optimization method as GPTQ and supports 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8-bit quantization. The format allows for mixing quantization
levels within a model to achieve any average bitrate between 2 and 8 bits per weight.</p>
<p dir="auto">Moreover, it's possible to apply multiple quantization levels to each linear layer, producing something akin to sparse
quantization wherein more important weights (columns) are quantized with more bits. The same remapping trick that lets
ExLlama work efficiently with act-order models allows this mixing of formats to happen with little to no impact on
performance.</p>
<p dir="auto">Parameter selection is done automatically by quantizing each matrix multiple times, measuring the quantization
error (with respect to the chosen calibration data) for each of a number of possible settings, per layer. Finally, a
combination is chosen that minimizes the maximum quantization error over the entire model while meeting a target
average bitrate.</p>
<p dir="auto">In my tests, this scheme allows Llama2 70B to run on a single 24 GB GPU with a 2048-token context, producing coherent
and mostly stable output with 2.55 bits per weight. 13B models run at 2.65 bits within 8 GB of VRAM, although currently
none of them uses GQA which effectively limits the context size to 2048. In either case it's unlikely that the model
will fit alongside a desktop environment. For now.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2/blob/master/doc/llama2_70b_chat.png"><img src="https://github.com/turboderp/exllamav2/raw/master/doc/llama2_70b_chat_thumb.png" alt="chat_screenshot"></a>

<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Conversion</h3>
<p dir="auto">A script is provided to quantize models. Converting large models can be somewhat slow, so be warned. To use it:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python convert.py \
    -i <input_HF_model> \
    -o <output_work_directory> \
    -c <calibration_data_file> \
    -b <target_bits_per_weight>"><pre><code>python convert.py \
    -i &lt;input_HF_model&gt; \
    -o &lt;output_work_directory&gt; \
    -c &lt;calibration_data_file&gt; \
    -b &lt;target_bits_per_weight&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The output directory should be empty when you start converting. The script will dump a bunch of files there as it
works, so it can resume an interrupted job if you point it to the same output directory a second time.</p>
<p dir="auto">After the first pass is completed, a <code>measurement.json</code> file will be written to the output directory. This can be
supplied (with the <code>-m</code> argument) to subsequent conversion jobs to skip the first pass and save some time when quantizing
the same model to different bitrates. Once complete, the quantized tensors will be compiled into <code>output.safetensors</code>,
and this file can replace the safetensors file in the original HF model.</p>
<p dir="auto">Roughly speaking, you'll need about 24 GB of VRAM to convert a 70B model, while 7B seems to require about 8 GB. There
are optimizations planned to accelerate conversion, utilizing more or larger GPUs.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">HuggingFace repos</h3>
<p dir="auto">I've uploaded a few EXL2-quantized models to HuggingFace to play around with, <a href="https://huggingface.co/turboderp" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that these were produced over a period of time with different calibration data, so they're not useful as a way to
measure quantization loss. Thorough perplexity and accuracy tests are coming, once I've had time to convert models for
that purpose.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">More to come</h2>
<p dir="auto">There are still things that need to be ported over from V1, and other planned features. Among them:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>PyPi package with prebuilt extensions</li>
<li>LoRA support</li>
<li>Example web UI</li>
<li>Web server</li>
<li>More samplers</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Updates</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2023-09-13</strong>: Preliminary ROCm support added, thanks to @ardfork. Bumped to 0.0.1</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5330183863364318465" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>PayPal now offers its customers two types of U.S. dollars. In addition to having the option of opening a traditional PayPal account to maintain a balance of dollars, PayPal customers can now hold <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin">something new</a> called <b>PayPal USD</b>, a crypto version of a dollar. Whereas PayPal USD uses a crypto database, Ethereum, to host U.S. dollar balances (which in industry-speak is sometimes known as a <i>stablecoin</i>), the first sort of dollar relies on a conventional database.</p><p>There are currently around $45 million worth of PayPal USD in circulation, as the chart below illustrates:</p><p>Which type of PayPal dollar is safer for the public to use?</p><p>If you listen to Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who in response to PayPal's announcement <a href="https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=410725">fretted that</a> PayPal's crypto-based dollars would not able to "guarantee consumer protections," you'd assume the traditional non-crypto version is the safer one. And I think that fits with most peoples' preconceptions of crypto.</p><p>Not so, oddly enough. It's the PayPal dollars hosted on crypto databases that are the safer of the two, if not along every dimension, at least in terms of the degree to which customers are protected by: 1) the quality of underlying assets; 2) their seniority (or ranking relative to other creditors); and 3) transparency. </p><p>Here is a bit of commentary on each factor:</p><p><b>The quality of underlying assets</b></p><p>PayPal's crypto dollars, which are managed by <a href="https://paxos.com/pyusd/">a third-party called Paxos</a>, are 100% backed by the safest sorts of short-term collateral: U.S. Treasury-bills, reverse repo (backed by U.S. government securities), and commercial bank deposits. In finance lingo, these assets are known as <i>cash and cash equivalents</i>. A big reason for this conservative investment approach is that Paxos is subject to a set of strict investment limits as determined by its regulator, the <i>New York State Department of Financial Services</i> (NYDFS). You can read about the NYDFS's stablecoin regulatory framework <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/industry_letters/il20220608_issuance_stablecoins">here</a>.</p><p>By contrast, PayPal's regular dollars, which are regulated piecemeal under each U.S. states' own peculiar version of a <i>money transmitter</i> license, can almost always be legally backed by riskier assets. (<a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/licenses">Here</a> is PayPal's list of state-issued licenses.)</p><p>For instance, if you comb <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/231198771/files/doc_financials/2023/ar/PayPal-Holdings-Inc-Combined-2023-Proxy-Statement-and-2022-Annual-Report.pdf">through the fine print</a> at the back of PayPal's annual report, the total amount of customer funds held in the form of regular PayPal dollars comes out to $36 billion at year-end 2022. Of this $36 billion, PayPal has invested $11 billion in "cash &amp; cash equivalents." Put differently, just 30% of its dollars are backed by top notch assets, far less than the 100% ratio for PayPal's crypto dollars. PayPal invests another $17 billion of its customer's billions in something called <i>available-for-sale debt securities</i> which, if you dig further, is made up of stuff like government bonds, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, and more. See the list below:</p><p>These available-for-sale securities assets are not as reliable as <i>cash and cash equivalents</i>, particularly treasury bills. First, they have riskier issuers, as is the case with commercial paper and corporate debt, both of which are emitted by companies. Second, they are characterized by longer terms-to-maturity, as is the case with government bonds and corporate debt securities. Prices of long-term debt are much more volatile than short term debt.&nbsp;</p><div><p>It would be illegal for PayPal to back its new crypto-based dollars with the assets listed above, yet for some reason it is fine if it backs its traditional dollars with them. </p><p><b>Customer's ranking relative to other creditors</b></p><p>The second drawback of PayPal's regular dollars is that the assets underlying them don't really "belong" to customers in any strong sense of the word. They belong to PayPal. </p><p>To understand what this means, let's say that PayPal goes bankrupt. You, a long time PayPal customer, hold $1000 worth of PayPal dollars. You might think that you are guaranteed to be made whole because there exists a corresponding set of underlying customer assets that has been specially earmarked for you and other PayPal customers. But that's not the case. Customers are what is referred to in finance as an <i>unsecured creditor </i>of PayPal, which means you'd be relegated to having to fight with PayPal's other creditors (banks, bond holders, etc) to get a piece of the pie, and that's only after PayPal's <i>secured creditors</i> – those highest in the pecking order – get first dibs. That could potentially mean getting maybe $600 or $700 instead of your original $1000. </p><p>The reason for this, as explained <a href="https://www.cornelllawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Dan-Awrey-Bad-Money.pdf">here</a> by Dan Awrey, is the fairly lax state-by-state regulatory frameworks under which PayPal's regular dollars are issued, which "often do not require that permissible investments be held in trust for the benefit of customers—thus potentially forcing customers to compete with an [money services business]’s other unsecured creditors in the event that it is forced into bankruptcy."</p><p>By contrast, the regulator of PayPal's crypto-based dollars, the NYDFS, specifies that the reserves backing any crypto-based dollar "shall be held at these depository institutions and custodians for the benefit of the holders of the stablecoin, with appropriate titling of accounts." To translate, the assets underlying your $1000 in PayPal USD cryptodollars are not PayPal's assets. Nor are they Paxos's. They are yours. No need to squabble with competing vultures for what's left.</p><p>But oddly, PayPal is under no legal obligation to extend these very sensible protections to all of its regular PayPal dollars. &nbsp;</p><p><b>Degree of transparency</b></p><p>The last big difference between the two types of PayPal dollars is that the crypto version offers far more transparency to customers. If you want to get current information about the assets underlying your crypto PayPal dollars, all you need to do is open up one of PayPal USD's soon-to-be published <a href="https://paxos.com/pyusd-transparency/">attestation reports</a>. Published monthly, these reports must include market values of the assets backing PayPal USD's, both in total and broken down by asset class. These values must be recorded on two separate days each month, or 24 times per year. Furthermore, these attestation reports must be prepared by an independent auditor.</p><p>By contrast, the only way to get vetted financial information about the assets backing traditional PayPal dollars is to read its audited financial statements, which come out just once a year. For the rest of the twelve months, customers are left in the dark.</p><p><b>So where am I going with all of this?</b></p><p>This illustrates the absurdity of some of the rules we've created surrounding monetary instruments. The fact that one type of PayPal dollar has robust protections while the other is only haphazardly protected, and only because the first is managed with a crypto database and not a traditional database, seems incredibly arbitrary to me.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Financial regulations exist, in part, to protect retail customers against shoddy financial providers. Shouldn't all PayPal customers, no matter what database technology they select, get to benefit from the same standard protections? What's the logic behind stipulating that one type of PayPal customer is to have the benefit of monthly attestation reports, for instance, while limiting the other type of customer to a black void of information?&nbsp;</p><div><p>The problem here isn't just one of having a few bad standards. Doesn't having multiple standards add to people's confusion about how they are protected?</p><p>Just to make things even more absurd, there's actually a third type of PayPal dollar. It comes in the form of balances held in a <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/paypal-savings-faqs-help777">PayPal Savings</a> accounts.&nbsp;</p></div><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Now you can save for rainy days and getaways with 0.85% APY*. No fees. No minimum balance. So hit the auto-save and achieve those savings <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/goals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#goals</a>. <a href="https://t.co/orHIhRlKX2">https://t.co/orHIhRlKX2</a> <a href="https://t.co/lxivOjqMoT">pic.twitter.com/lxivOjqMoT</a></p>— PayPal (@PayPal) <a href="https://twitter.com/PayPal/status/1534913309744451584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2022</a></blockquote>  <div><p>Unlike the two types of PayPal dollar described above, the third type is insured by the government up to $250,000. PayPal Savings dollars also pay interest, whereas the first two don't, or are prohibited from doing so. PayPal offers this product <a href="https://www.paypalobjects.com/marketing/ua/pdf/US/en/synchrony-deposit-acct-agreement.pdf?locale.x=en_US">in conjunction with</a> a bank, Synchrony Bank, which means this third type of PayPal dollar conforms to an entirely different set or rules than the other two: Federal banking law.</p><p>But this only reinforces what a Frankenstein of a monetary system we've created. Why are only PayPal Savings dollars protected by deposit insurance, whereas the other two types of PayPal dollars aren't? How does this cacophony of features (or lack of features) help retail customers who, amidst all their other duties in life, simply don't have time to peruse the fine print of each different dollar emitted into the economy?</p></div>

                        The Agence nationale des fréquences (ANFR) has demanded that Apple withdraw the iPhone 12 from the French market, effective 12 September 2023, as measures show the specific absorption rate (SAR) exceeds the set limits. The ANFR expects Apple to deploy all available means to put an end to the non-compliance. Failure to act will result in the recall of equipment that has already been made available to consumers.

                    <p>As market surveillance authority for radio equipment and responsible for controlling public exposure to electromagnetic fields, the ANFR runs inspections on mobile phones placed on the French market. 141 mobile phones, including Apple’s iPhone 12, have recently been tested to check compliance with limit SAR values. SAR is a measure of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from the equipment being measured.</p>
<p>The mobile phones were tested by an accredited laboratory, which allows the ANFR to ensure that the SAR values comply with European regulation. These requirements entail that the equipment be tested at touch-contact (0 mm) for limb-SAR measures – where the phone is handheld or in a trouser pocket – and at a distance of 5 mm for body-SAR – where the phone is in the pocket of a jacket or in a bag. The values must therefore respect maximum limits of 4 Watts/kg for limb-SAR and 2 W/kg for body-SAR. The ANFR’s measures show that the limb-SAR values exceed the limit, being at 5,74 W/kg. However, the body-SAR complies with the regulation.</p>
<p>Consequently, Apple must immediately adopt all necessary measures to prevent the iPhone 12 in the supply chain from being made available on the market. As for those telephones that are already in use, Apple must adopt all necessary corrective measures to bring the telephones into conformity as soon as possible, otherwise, Apple will have to recall the equipment.</p>
<p>If Apple chooses to update its telephones, it shall be verified by the ANFR.</p>
<p>Instruction has been given to the ANFR’s sworn officers to check that the iPhone 12 is no longer offered for sale in all distribution channels in France, from Tuesday 12 September 2023.</p>

<p>I've been thinking I should do more "short form" blogging. Something between microblogging and regular blogging. This is me doing that!</p>
<p>Anyway, I was thinking about ways to visualise the year 2038 problem, and this is what I came up with: <a href="https://retr0.id/stuff/2038/">https://retr0.id/stuff/2038/</a> (go check it out, it looks much better in motion)</p>

<p>It's pretty simple. The clock face has 256 "ticks" (annotated in hexadecimal), and four dials, each moving exactly 256 times slower than the previous. The longest and fastest moving dial moves at one tick per second, which means it takes very approximately 4 minutes to do a full revolution (4:16, actually). The next hand takes roughly 18 hours, the next roughly 6 months, and the smallest hand takes ~136 years - or exactly 2^32 seconds.</p>
<p>There's nothing particularly special about this arrangement, but I find it quite aesthetically pleasing, from a numerical perspective. Mathsthetically pleasing?</p>
<p>On the subject of aesthetics, I picked the colours for the clock hands using <a href="https://coolors.co/">https://coolors.co/</a></p>
<p>I wasn't joking about the "short form" blogging, so that's all I have to say!</p>

008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9

008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
</pre>
<p>It’s strange that we’re executing from someplace that has no name. If you look closely, you’ll see that we are executing code <i>from the stack</i>: <code>esp</code> is <code>008bf664</code>, so the code that went haywire is on the stack.</p>
<p>Who executes code from the stack?</p>
<p>Malware, that’s who.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this malware is trying to do.</p>
<p>Disassembling around the last known good code address gives us this:</p>
<pre>008bf6c4 call    dword ptr [esi+214h]
008bf6ca inc     dword ptr [ebp+8]
008bf6cd push    edi
008bf6ce call    dword ptr [esi+210h]   ; this called into space
008bf6d4 test    eax,eax
008bf6d6 je      008bf6b9
008bf6d8 xor     edi,edi
008bf6da cmp     dword ptr [esi+430h],edi
008bf6e0 je      008bf70d
</pre>
<p>It looks like the payload stored function pointers at <code>esi+210</code> and <code>esi+214</code>. Let’s see what’s there. This is probably where the payload stashed all its call targets.</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; dps @esi+200
008bf880  1475ff71
008bf884  00000004

008bf8b0  006f0072
008bf8b4  00720067
008bf8b8  006d0061
</pre>
<p>Yup, there’s a payload of function pointers here. It looks like this malware is going to wait for something, and then exit the process, or remove a directory, or exit Windows. Those bytes after <code>user32!ExitWindowsEx</code> look like a Unicode string, so let’s dump them as a string:</p>
<pre>0:000&gt; du 008bf8a8  
008bf8a8  "C:\Program Files\Contoso\contoso_update.exe"
</pre>
<p>Wait, what? It is trying to mess around with Contoso’s auto-updater?</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at more of the malware payload. Maybe we can figure out what it’s doing. It looks like it’s using <code>esi</code> as its base of operations, so let’s disassemble from <code>esi</code>.</p>

<p>Aha, this isn’t malware. This is an uninstaller!</p>
<p>The mystery function is almost certainly <code>DeleteFileW</code>. It’s waiting for the main uninstaller to exit, so it can delete the binary.</p>
<p>There is a page on CodeProject that shows how to write a self-deleting file, and it seems that multiple companies have decided to use that code to implement their own uninstallers. (Whether they follow the licensing terms for that code I do not know.)</p>
<p>Okay, so why did we crash? What went wrong with <code>DeleteFileW</code>?</p>
<p>According to the dump file, the spot where <code>DeleteFileW</code> was supposed to be instead holds <code>7077c100</code>. This is a function pointer into some mystery DLL that isn’t loaded. How did that happen?</p>
<p>My guess is that the <code>DeleteFileW</code> function was detoured in the Contoso uninstaller. When the uninstaller tried to built its table of useful functions, it ended up getting not the address of <code>DeleteFileW</code> but the address of a detour. It then tried to call that detour from its payload, but since the detour is not installed in Explorer (or if it is, the detour is in some other location), it ended up calling into space.</p>
<p>Neither code injection nor detouring is officially supported. I can’t tell who did the detouring. Maybe somebody added a detour to the uninstaller, unaware that the uninstaller is going to inject a call to the detour into Explorer. Or maybe the detour was injected by anti-malware software. Or maybe the detour was injected by Windows’ own application compatibility layer. Whatever the reason, the result was a crash in Explorer.</p>
<p>Which means that people like me spend a lot of time studying these crashes to figure out what is going on, only to conclude that they were caused by other people abusing the system.</p>
<p>If you want to create a self-deleting binary, please don’t use code injection into somebody else’s process. Here’s a way to delete a binary and leave no trace:</p>
<p>Create a temporary file called <code>cleanup.js</code> that goes like this:</p>
<pre>var fso = new ActiveXObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
fso.DeleteFile("C:\\Users\\Name\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\cleanup.js");

var path = "C:\\Program Files\\Contoso\\contoso_update.exe";
for (var count = 0; fso.FileExists(path) &amp;&amp; count &lt; 40; count++) {
    try { fso.DeleteFile(path); break; } catch (e) { }
    WSH.Sleep(500);
}
</pre>
<p>This script deletes itself and then tries to delete <code>contoso_update.exe</code> for 20 seconds. Run it with <code>wscript cleanup.js</code> and let it do its thing. No code injection, no detours, all documented.</p>

However, the top four categories were:</p><ul><li><p><strong>AI Ops</strong><span>: Tooling and platforms to help companies deploy working AI models. We'll discuss more below, but AI Ops has become a huge category, primarily focused on LLMs and taming them for production use cases.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Developer Tools</strong><span>: Apps, plugins, and SDKs making it easier to write code. There were plenty of examples of integrating third-party data, auto-generating code/tests, and working with agents/chatbots to build and debug code.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Healthcare + Biotech</strong><span>: It seems like healthcare has a lot of room for automation, with companies working on note-taking, billing, training, and prescribing. And on the biotech side, there are some seriously cool companies building autonomous surgery robots and at-home cancer detection.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Finance + Payments</strong><span>: Startups targeting banks, fintechs, and compliance departments. This was a wide range of companies, from automated collections to AI due diligence to "Copilot for bankers."</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Those four areas covered over half of the startups. The first two make sense: YC has always filtered for technical founders, and many are using AI to do what they know - improve the software developer workflow. But it's interesting to see healthcare and finance not far behind. </span><a href="https://www.ignorance.ai/p/analyzing-over-100-ai-startups-from-yc" rel="">Previously, I wrote</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>Large enterprises, healthcare, and government are not going to send sensitive data to OpenAI. This leaves a gap for startups to build on-premise, compliant [LLMs] for these verticals.</p></blockquote><p>And we're now seeing exactly that - LLMs focused on healthcare and finance and AI Ops companies targeting on-prem use cases. It also helps that one of the major selling points of generative AI right now is cost-cutting - an enticing use case for healthcare and finance.</p><p>​</p><p>​</p><p>In the last batch, a lot of startups positioned themselves as "ChatGPT for X," with a consumer focus. It seems the current trend, though, is "Copilot for X" - B2B AI assistants to help you do everything from KYC checks to corporate event planning to chip design to negotiate contracts.</p><p>Nearly two dozen companies were working on some sort of artificial companion for businesses - and a couple for consumers. It's more evidence for the argument that AI will not outright replace workers - instead, existing workers will collaborate with AI to be more productive. And as AI becomes more mainstream, this trend of making specialized tools for specific industries or tasks will only grow.</p><p>That being said - a Bing-style AI that lives in a sidebar and is only accessible via chat probably isn't the most useful form factor for AI. But until OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google change their approach (or until another company steps up), we'll probably see many more Copilots.</p><p>​</p><p>"AI Ops" has been a term for only a few years. "LLM Ops" has existed for barely a year. And yet, so many companies are focused on training, fine-tuning, deploying, hosting, and post-processing LLMs it's quickly becoming a critical piece of the AI space. It's a vast industry that's sprung up seemingly overnight, and it was pretty interesting to see some of the problems being solved at the bleeding edge. For example:</p><ul><li><p>Adding context to language models with as few as ten samples.</p></li><li><p>Pausing and moving training runs in real-time.</p></li><li><p>Managing training data ownership and permissions.</p></li><li><p>Faster vector databases.</p></li><li><p>Fine-tuning models with synthetic data.</p></li></ul><p><span>But as much </span><s>hype</s><span> enthusiasm and opportunity as there might be, the size of the AI Ops space also shows how much work is needed to really productionalize LLMs and other models. There are still many open questions about reliability, privacy, observability, usability, and safety when it comes to using LLMs in the wild.</span></p><p>​</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ignorance.ai/p/5-lessons-from-139-yc-ai-startups?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thank you for reading Artificial Ignorance.

At the beginning of the post-ChatGPT hype wave, it seemed like you just had to say "we're adding AI" to raise your next round or boost your stock price.</p><p><span>But competition is extremely fierce. Even </span><em>within this batch</em><span>, there were multiple companies with nearly identical pitches, including:</span></p><ul><li><p>Solving customer support tickets.</p></li><li><p>Negotiating sales contracts.</p></li><li><p>Writing drafts of legal documents.</p></li><li><p>Building no-code LLM workflows.</p></li><li><p>On-prem LLM deployment.</p></li><li><p>Automating trust and safety moderation.</p></li></ul><p>As it turns out, AI can be a competitive advantage, but it can't make up for a bad business. The most interesting (and likely valuable) companies are the ones that take boring industries and find non-obvious use cases for AI. In those cases, the key is having a team that can effectively distribute a product to users, with or without AI.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png" width="1456" height="772" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:772,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:165618,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8e47b446-122d-47a9-b329-7233d20e1a74_2979x1580.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I'll be honest - 139 companies is </span><strong>a lot</strong><span>.

Though there’s no formula for finding PMF, you can significantly increase your odds, and save yourself a lot of time and heartache, by studying the lessons of those who’ve made it.

The group that you haven’t achieved product-market fit with is the one you really want to target.</strong></p><p>It always surprises people to hear that, at YouTube, we never thought we had a product-market fit. We had 100 million DAUs and almost a billion monthly actives, and yet we did not have our desired audience. We had teenagers but not adults. We were envious of the satisfaction those folks were finding on Netflix, Facebook, or wherever. In my experience, you’re always stretching product-market fit. I don’t think there’s a moment where you’re done with product-market fit.”</p></blockquote><p>You may not feel like you have PMF even when you reach 100 customers:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I remember with the first 100 or so customers, every customer kind of felt like the last customer we would get, to be honest. </strong><span>We were like, I can’t believe DoorDash is using this product. That’s incredible! We were so proud. Unlike on the B2C side, there was no sort of viral loop that got going that made us think, ‘Okay, we found it.’ Instead, it really was kind of just pushing the boulder at a pretty steep trajectory uphill, over and over.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdhsu/" rel="">David Hsu</a><span>, founder and CEO of </span><strong>Retool</strong></p></blockquote><p>Or at $100M/year in revenue:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>The fear of hitting a wall and collapsing was always there. Even when we were at 100 million in revenue, there was always this fear that we were suddenly going to crash into a wall and everything would stop.</strong></p><p><span>There are all these horror stories in Silicon Valley of these companies who got to 150 or 200 million revenue and then didn’t grow. So there was always this fear that it was going to happen to us as well. </span><strong>Your product-market fit is always with respect to a particular market. </strong><span>It might be small companies, or medium-size companies, or enterprises. The small companies don’t want your stuff, or the U.S. market doesn’t want your stuff, or the Asian market, and so on. Eventually, at some point you become a multi-product company, so then the whole game repeats itself again and again and again. You have to revamp and change things significantly, which is its own challenge.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alighodsi/" rel="">Ali Ghodsi</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Databricks</strong></p></blockquote><p>In fact, you might never fully feel PMF:</p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I never felt at any point of time like, ah, now I have product-market fit.</strong><span> I always felt like there was always something for us to improve on—whether it was growth or product or customer care. I’m always seeing what more we can do to solve problems on behalf of our customers.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/" rel="">Tomer London</a><span>, co-founder and CPO of </span><strong>Gusto</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“I’ve spent most of the history of Hex paranoid that we’re not at PMF, or there’s more to do. I think our vision is big enough and that, at any point, even when I have thousands of people telling us this thing is awesome, I still feel like, ‘Yeah, but there’s this bigger thing we want to do.’ </span><strong>I don’t feel like we have product-market fit for the ultimate vision we have yet.</strong><span> And so that’ll take time, obviously.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrymccardel/" rel="">Barry McCardel</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of </span><strong>Hex</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>I don’t even know if today we have true product-market fit.</strong><span> If you’re going down the venture path, what I tell other founders is that anytime you raise, your product-market fit is gone, because whatever you raised, the next raise effectively demolished it. </span><strong>You now have to hit the next bar of product-market fit.</strong><span> What we have today at the series A and series B, I consider it strong product-market fit. But that’s because we were able to grow into the valuation and what the stature of the company should have been at those respective stages.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-song-25198b24/" rel="">Rick Song</a><span>, founder and CEO of </span><strong>Persona</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>PMF is never a binary yes-or-no moment. It’s instead a gradual process of finding fit with larger and larger segments, as </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorilallo/" rel="">Jori Lallo</a><span>, co-founder of </span><strong>Linear</strong><span>, describes:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“PMF has been so gradual; I might even say . . . linear. There’s not just one hump that we got over and thought, ‘Okay, now it’s clicking.’ </span><strong>It’s more like we’re chipping away at these obstacles and getting more and more people interested.</strong><span> It’s more like, ‘Oh, this is really working for certain segments.’”</span></p></blockquote><p>Though you may never feel everlasting product-market fit, you need to start somewhere. I asked every founder when they first felt product-market fit, and their answers fell along a spectrum that provides a useful guide to finding ever-increasing PMF:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><span> Get one company to love your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><span> Get one company to pay (a meaningful amount of money) for your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 3</strong><span>: Get more than one company to love and pay for your product</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong><span> Start noticing a shift from push to pull, and organic growth</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong><span> Keep growing consistently</span></p></li></ul><p>Below, I’ll explore each step in-depth, and share stories from founders of the moment they finally felt PMF.</p><p>Start your PMF journey by becoming obsessed with getting one company to love, use, and continue to use your product. Do whatever it takes to make them successful.</p><p><span>In the case of </span><strong>Figma</strong><span>, co-founder Dylan Field became obsessed with the success of their first real user, Coda (originally called Krypton):</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“There was a weekend when we had a bug and the product wasn’t working very well because it hadn’t been released yet; it was an alpha. And Dylan was freaking out. He’s like, ‘There’s a bug.’ And I’m like, ‘Yeah, we’ll fix it, but we’ve got other stuff going on.’ He’s like, ‘We have to call a red alert.’ I’m like, ‘Dude, what are you talking about? We haven’t shipped this thing yet. There’s no such thing as a red alert because it’s not shipped.’ </span><strong>And he’s like, ‘You don’t understand. There are customers depending on us.</strong><span> There’s this company called Krypton.’ So I was like, ‘Okay, they haven’t paid us any money, nobody even knows we exist, but I guess we’ll deal with it.’</span></p><p><span>I actually came to appreciate Dylan’s mindset, because a lot of founders don’t give a shit about their customers. They want to understand the customers, but just enough to figure out what features they would be willing to pay for. </span><strong>But at the end of the day, Dylan was thinking about it in terms of trust. He was like, ‘Look, I convinced this guy to use our product. They’re actually trying to use it for work, and if we fuck it up for them, I don’t want that on my conscience. I want to do whatever I can to make sure that we’re holding up our end of the bargain. Because they believed in me.’</strong></p><p>They’re still customers; they were our first customer.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shokuwamoto/" rel="">Sho Kuwamoto</a><span>, VP of Product</span></p></blockquote><p><strong>Coda</strong><span> itself went through this same journey with their first customer, Springful:</span></p><blockquote><p>“My former colleague Noam Lovinsky [now CPO at Grammarly] was starting a company called Springful. I said to him, ‘Hey, would you use Krypton [our name at the time]?’ They started using it, and for a while, it went well. They were getting a lot of use out of it. We had a chart of what the DAUs looked like, and because they had six employees, the chart basically sat at 6 every day, except for on the weekends.</p><p><strong>Then one day, it dropped to zero on a weekday, and the following day, it stayed at zero. And so I texted Noam and said, ‘Hey, what happened? Are you at an offsite?’ I was trying to find some other excuse. He said, ‘Oh man, I’ve been putting off calling you, but I have good news and bad news. The bad news is we had a team meeting and I asked the team how things were going, and they said that if we made them keep using Krypton, they were all going to quit.’ And I was like, ‘Well, that’s pretty terrible news.’ He said, ‘The good news is they all completely believe in the vision. They’ve made a list [in Krypton] saying, ‘If you do these things, we’ll come right back.’ The list was like 25 things, all completely reasonable.</strong></p><p>This led to a big internal debate. The team was basically divided in half. Half the folks had a mindset like, ‘What a gift. We have a customer and they have given us a clear list of requirements.’ The other half said, ‘He’s reacting to the wrong product—it’s not actually the shape of the thing we want. And if we do that, we’re going to dig a hole deeper and deeper into this part of the product.’</p><p>We decided not to finish his list. Instead, we built the doc that we originally envisioned. I thought it would take three or four months, but it took over a year to get back to his list.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shishirmehrotra/" rel="">Shishir Mehrotra</a><span>, co-founder and CEO</span></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dvdhsu/" rel="">David Hsu</a><span> at </span><strong>Retool </strong><span>built a tool to catch anyone running into issues with their early product so that they could fix the issues immediately:</span></p><blockquote><p>“At the beginning of any startup, no one knows about your product, nor does anyone use it. We came to a point where we’re like, given that no one’s using the product, every time somebody’s using the product, we should go see what they’re doing. So we built this custom analytics server along with FullStory, and anytime anyone was in the app and using the app, we got notified immediately on Slack.</p><p>Invariably, they’d run into a bunch of issues. And anytime they ran into any issue, we’d immediately reach out. We’d just call them. With sales, oftentimes when you call a customer, they don’t reply or they don’t want to talk to you. But in this case, they were literally using the product and they’re running into issues, and so they were super-likely to pick up.</p><p>With DoorDash, for example, the product went through multiple iterations over three weeks, where they’d uncover an issue and we’d respond, ‘No problem, we’re on it.’ We’d ship the feature, they’d come back the next day, it would work. They wanted an on-prem option, which is at that point a pretty big feature, as you can probably imagine, putting a cloud product on-prem. We’re like, ‘No problem.’ And we shipped it&nbsp;in just 36 hours. So we were iterating very rapidly, even if the core idea was the same.”</p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Gong</strong><span> did exactly the same thing:</span></p><blockquote><p>“During the beta process, we had a bunch of systems that recorded the users’ screens using Gong. And we were watching these like maniacs, every day. I would probably spend two hours watching people interact with the system, reverse engineering them based on their role or what they were trying to do, and then go on thinking, ‘So this is what this person is doing?’ And if needed, I would give them a call. This approach is an underutilized product management tool, because in some areas it gives you more information than a quantitative survey or a discussion, because this is what the person actually does versus what they tell you and what they think they’re doing.”</p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eilonreshef/" rel="">Eilon Reshef</a><span>, co-founder and CPO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Gusto </strong><span>literally sat next to their early customers watching them send payroll day after day:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“</span><strong>For the first 30 customers, I was with them in their offices seeing them do payroll, or I was on the phone with them, watching them and then seeing them send payroll, and their reactions and seeing feedback. </strong><span>What’s working, what’s not working, what’s intuitive, what’s not intuitive. Every time they added an employee, I was there on the phone with them or in their office.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomerlondon/" rel="">Tomer London</a><span>, co-founder and CPO</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The founders of </span><strong>Looker</strong><span> are famous for going even further and “forward deploying” their engineers to sit in the customer’s offices and work alongside their team to make sure they’re set up for success:</span></p><blockquote><p>“The best way to show a prospect or customer the real value of Looker was to show them on their own data. Its power came from being designed as both a language and a development platform, but that also came with a lot of overhead to learn how to be powerful with it. It wasn’t rocket science; it just took time. </p><p><span>Therefore, </span><strong>we created a team of data analysts to serve as our technical customer-facing teams (sales engineers, customer support, and implementation analysts) to quickly deploy and develop instances of Looker for our customer.</strong><span> Early on, this enabled us to see and know everything that our customers and prospects wanted to achieve with analytics. Having that insight, we were able to both develop features and ways to use Looker, almost daily, to ensure we would be the best choice for a powerful analytics platform. This also helped us ensure that our customers would find value from Looker on day 1 after purchasing.”</span></p><p><span>—</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keenanrice/" rel="">Keenan Rice</a><span>, founding team</span></p></blockquote><p><span>“You won’t be great for anyone. Just get the thing to be really damn useful for one customer.” —</span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/barrymccardel/" rel="">Barry McCardel</a><span>, co-founder and CEO of Hex</span></p><p><span>One of the biggest recurring lessons from my conversations is to talk to customers more. I know you hear this a lot, but you are probably </span><em>still</em><span> not talking to customers enough. Here’s </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spenserskates/" rel="">Spenser Skates</a><span>’s</span><em> </em><span>(co-founder and CEO of Amplitude) hard-won lesson:</span></p><blockquote><p>“We spent about a year building, when in retrospect, we should have spent half that time talking to customers. And if we had, we would’ve wasted a lot less time on customers who were never going to buy.</p><p><strong>The biggest thing I will tell founders is, you have to spend half your time talking to your customers. If you’re a B2B company, that means becoming a salesperson. Figure out how to spend the collective time of your founding team: 50% needs to be talking to customers. If you’re a consumer company, that just means talking to them and meeting them. Airbnb was very famous for doing this. And spend the other 50% of your time building.</strong></p><p>I’m an engineer. My two co-founders, Curtis [Liu] and Jeffrey [Wang], are engineers. And so our instinct is to always build the product because we know how to solve those problems. But we wasted a lot of time solving problems that didn’t really exist or didn’t have money or traction behind them. And so that was a huge lesson for us.”</p></blockquote><p><span>At this stage, you may not even have true “product”-market fit, if your product is early. Instead, you can look for “message”-market fit, as in the case of </span><strong>Ramp</strong><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“When we launched, in mid-2020, I think we had ‘message-market fit.’ We were able to differentiate and have people be interested in our unique messaging, but we didn’t have the product there yet.</p><p>I think it’s hard to have true product-market fit when you’re public. When you’re operating just on friends and founders you meet and VC introductions. You need to have people out in the world who you don’t know you but are using you, and the product is what’s doing the selling.</p><p>And in terms of the product itself, where suddenly it was spreading, that came later, probably fall of 2020, when it was finally delivering on the messaging we had.</p><p>In terms of feeling market-message fit, there’s a few ways you can test it. One, based on launch press coverage, e.g. who wants to talk about it. You send an email using cold outbound and look at response rates. SDRs can do that all the time, and we were testing that all the time, even in an elevator pitch. Would people get it or would they be turned off? You can be very technical about it.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>One interesting lens for understanding how industries work is looking at their <em>waste streams</em>. Every industry will by nature have both a stock and a flow of byproducts from their core processes. This waste has to be dealt with (or it will, figuratively or literally, clog the pipes of the industry) and frequently has substantial residual value.</p><p>Most industries develop ecosystems in miniature to collect, sift through, recycle, and dispose of their waste. These are often cobbled together from lower-scale businesses than the industry themselves, involve a lot of dirty work, and are considered low status. Few people grow up wanting to specialize in e.g. sales of used manufacturing equipment.</p><p>One core waste stream of the finance industry is charged-off consumer debt. Debt collection is a fascinating (and frequently depressing) underbelly of finance. It shines a bit of light on credit card issuance itself, and richly earns the wading-through-a-river-of-effluvia metaphor.</p><p>A disclaimer: I have had substantially more at-bats with debt collectors than most people, as a result of an old hobby of writing letters on behalf of debtors to their lenders and non-affiliated debt collectors. I did this over the Internet, on my own volition, because it seemed pro-social and I was extremely underused by my actual job at the time. This experience leaves me with <em>strong opinions </em>on the debt collection industry; a frequent archetypical person in need of a letter was a Kansan grandmother in diminished financial circumstances who had been harassed for months. I’m going to try to keep these views to a dull roar here, in the spirit of spending more mental energy on discussing <em>why</em> the system presents as so broken.</p><h2 id="the-lifecycle-of-a-defaulted-debt">The lifecycle of a defaulted debt</h2><p>The majority of debt which defaults in the United States is revolving credit card debt. (Without addressing the politics of it, the impression among many informed people that most defaulted debt is medically-related is the result of successful advocacy work rather than being substantially based in reality. <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Interactives/householdcredit/data/pdf/HHDC_2023Q1.pdf?sc_lang=en">Trustworthy numbers</a> are not hard to <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_medical-debt-burden-in-the-united-states_report_2022-03.pdf">come by</a>, due to a combination of regulatory supervision and the U.S.’s almost unique degree of population-wide debt surveillance via credit reporting agencies. We’ll return to credit reporting some other day.) Assume I’m talking about credit card debt below, though the mechanics for medical debt bear overwhelming similarity. (I’d address it specifically except that healthcare economics is a fractally complex topic once you bring e.g. insurers, public programs, and the like into the mix.)</p><p>Credit card issues bucket users into various archetypes, personas, and predicted lifecycles, because behavior is extremely heterogeneous and this is important from both a marketing and risk management perspective. Most users of credit cards, probably including readers of this column, believe they are the typical user of credit cards; <em>no bucket is typical</em>. If I were to make some informed guesses, relative to the population-wide distribution, you, reader, use credit cards in preference to debit cards as a payment instrument, do not routinely revolve balances, and hold some combination of student loan, auto, and mortgage debt which dwarfs your credit card debt. And so it is critical to understand that most defaulting credit card debt <em>is not held by people who act like you</em>.</p><p>Most credit card debt which defaults <em>non-fraudulently</em> was incurred in the relatively distant past. Credit cards are revolving accounts; one’s balance can increase (even as one successfully makes payments) for years as one pays off a portion of prior balances but continues purchasing with the card. This is normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly, much like never carrying a balance is also normal and expected use of the card, planned for thoroughly.</p><p>A small percentage of borrowers, carefully tracked and generally oscillating between 2.5% and 5% depending on the overall health of the economy, will go delinquent on credit card debt. (Some issuers specialize in certain parts of the credit spectrum and, as a result, will have sharply lower or sharply higher delinquency rates. American Express, for example, specializes at the high end and typically has delinquency close to 1%. Capital One made its name in so-called subprime credit cards, though it has diversified since, and typically tends towards the high end among banks whose names you know. There is a largely hidden ecosystem of banks you don’t know that issue very expensive products to poor people; you can accurately predict their default rates exceed anything mentioned above.)</p><p>Default typically begins by missing (or underpaying) a scheduled payment. That in itself is a theoretical breach of contract but not very outside the ordinary for a card issuer; they will generally automatically assess a fee but take very little action. Most borrowers will recover before they are 30 days late, which is the point at which most issuers start to treat an account as being a credit risk rather than a minor operational issue.</p><p>After 30 days, issuers will typically work the account internally, using a combination of communication methods to nudge the user into payment, until one of a few things happens. The happiest is the customer gets current on their account. An outright refusal to pay is substantially less likely, and can result in an issuer moving up timelines. But the most common is that the borrower ghosts the issuer for a few months.</p><p>Consumer debt issuance is generally, by law, an exclusive privilege of regulated financial institutions. (The other big one is taking deposits.) Society wants many things from regulated financial institutions; one of those things is having accurate books, because stealth losses cause financial institutions to fail and frequently leave society holding the bag. As a result, the Federal Reserve has a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/06/12/00-14704/uniform-retail-credit-classification-and-account-management-policy">Uniform Retail Credit Classification and Account Management Policy</a>.</p><p>This tail wags the dog. Many decisions about account servicing, which a naive conception of debt might assume are between borrower and lender, are done with the goal of aligning servicing to accounting standards. In this way, the books impose their will on reality, and where the books and reality differ, reality frequently adjusts itself to accommodate the books. (As my buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinriggle">Kevin</a> frequently muses, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-like-State-Certain-Condition/dp/0300078153">states are gonna see</a>. Organizations which are tightly tied to the state, like regulated financial institutions, will develop a vocabulary and processes for seeing like the state sees, and that edifice tends to capture non-state methods of seeing that they run in parallel.)</p><p>In particular, credit classification requires that financial institutions “charge off” delinquent debt. Mechanically, they have previously accumulated an allowance for delinquency on their books as a liability; they move a bit of that allowance to a bad debt expense. In principle, nothing has to happen to the actual debt. In practice, financial regulators encourage institutions to seek <em>certainty and finality</em> around this.</p><p>Financial institutions achieve certainty and finality by packaging portfolios of bad debt together and selling them to non-financial institutions. This durably moves them off of the books and realizes a very, very small residual value.</p><h2 id="the-debt-collection-industry">The debt collection industry<br></h2><p>There are essentially two halves of the debt collection industry. A portion of it works on an agency model: a lender can have e.g. a law firm or similar work a debt on its behalf during the several month period where the delinquent debt lingers on their books, in return for a performance fee (often 15-30% of face value) should the borrower make good on the debt.</p><p>But debts, much like people, only age in one direction. Unlike people, debts universally decline in value as they age. We’ll return to that topic in a moment. Most debt which is not being serviced successfully by the first party lenders will not long be worked by their agents. It is instead sold to debt buyers, who will then attempt to collect the contracted amount (plus fees provided for in the contract, which are legally legitimate, and not infrequently fees which were not provided in the contract, which are frequently <em>extremely questionable</em>). Subtract the original cost of buying the portfolio and their substantial operational costs and the remainder is profit.</p><p>Most defaults are <em>small</em>. This fact drives everything about debt collection; it has to be done scalably, by the cheapest labor available, with a minimum of customization or thoughtful weighing of competing interests. The average defaulted credit card debt is on the order of $2,000, the median is between $500 and $1,000. These are processed like McDonalds burgers, not like grant proposals.</p><p>Debts are sold as part of a portfolio, where (typically) thousands of relatively similarly situated debts in a cohort are sold as a packet. The value of portfolios is a huge discount to the face value of the debts; at the point where a lender has only worked it themselves and the debt is a few months delinquent, portfolios generally fetch about <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/structure-and-practices-debt-buying-industry/debtbuyingreport.pdf">5 cents on the dollar</a>. That value will continue to decay over time. There is an entire ecosystem of brokers supporting contractual infrastructure to convey these debts to buyers and insulate the issuing financial institutions from the actions of the debt buyers.</p><p>Partly, that is due to regulatory risk. (Particularly in recent years, regulators have begun using prudential regulation of financial institutions to <em>strongly suggest</em> that financial institutions adopt their social goals. There is a tortured argument by which a debt collector being unsavory in the process of debt collection would damage the reputation of the bank, which could damage an item on its balance sheet, which could damage its financial stability, which fact a regulator actually has jurisdiction over, and therefore regulators can discourage debt sales.)</p><p>Probably more surprisingly, financial institutions care acutely about brand damage, particularly to their own partners that can contractually obligate that. Many credit cards are co-branded; you, as an unsophisticated consumer, might think you have a credit card from Amazon, Best Buy, or Apple. You don’t, but those three firms are acutely aware of your miscomprehension, and they want to continue earning your business for the next 40 years. And so they might have hypothetically contractually bound Chase, Citibank, and Goldman Sachs (respectively) to never mention their co-branding partner in connection with debt collection and to bind subsequent debt buyers to the same.</p><p>This is a frequent cause of debtors mistakenly believing that debt collectors are confabulating debts against them. “But I haven’t ever done business with Citibank!” I’m slightly-more-than-unsympathetic to that, because of the relative sophistication of borrowers versus Best Buy’s marketing department. On the topic of true confabulation, oh yes, that happens minimally hundreds of thousands of times a year; debt collectors adopt business processes which simply <em>make debts up </em>because accuracy requires competence and costs money.</p><p>The debt collection industry is, and I say this as someone who is capitalist as the day is long and attempts to be non-political in public, among the most odious hives of scum and villainy as exists in the United States. The business is sordid and virtually immune to reform, despite decades of trying. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed <em>in 1978</em>! It is older than me! I learned to cite it in 2004 against the same abuses it was designed to prevent! The situation did not markedly improve in the last 20 years!</p><p>This is not because of a lack of virtue or a lack of laws; the <em>structure</em> of the industry colliding with the socioeconomic reality of defaulting debtors basically ensures that it will be a miserable place populated by miserable people who will project leveraged amounts of misery into the outside world in the hopes of collecting a tiny sliver of defaulted debts.</p><p>Debts are conveyed to the debt buyers as large CSV files with minimal supporting documentation. The legal reality of a credit card debt begins with a contractualized promise to pay. You might assume that the owner of the debt necessarily has read that contract. Reader, if the debt has been sold, they have not merely not read that contract, they have likely not received a copy of that contract. They <em>might</em> have the contractual right to ask the seller of the portfolio to ask the entity it bought the portfolio from to follow a few more links in the chain to eventually ask the financial institution for a copy of the contract. In principle, financial institutions always have the contract… somewhere. In practice, they will frequently not organize themselves to actually locate it; this business is off their books and Operations has better things to do than hunting in the archives for a paper copy of a low-value contract signed several years ago.</p><p>Again, we’re talking about promises frequently denominated in the hundreds of dollars. It is a consensual social fiction that there is actually a legal process operating here. That consensual social fiction has real consequences, and sometimes bubbles up uncomfortably in actual courts of law, which we will return to in a moment.</p><p>The rights of debtors are observed by both primary lenders and eventual debt buyers mostly in the breach. One of those rights is to a written “debt verification”, with specified information in it, and (surprisingly, if you haven’t worked in this field) despite that being the law many debts are sold in such a fashion that the buyer couldn’t produce a responsive verification even if they wanted to. That isn’t even a political claim; it’s just the engineering reality of which columns are in their CSV file.</p><p>The former advocate in me will observe that the single most effective method for resolving debts is carefully sending a series of letters invoking one’s rights under the FDCPA (and other legislation) to a debt collector who is <em>operationally incapable</em> of respecting those rights, then threatening them with legal or regulatory action when they inevitably infringe upon them in writing, leading to them abandoning further attempts at collection.</p><p>This effectively makes paying consumer debts basically optional in the United States, contingent on one being sufficiently organized and informed. That is likely a surprising result to many people. Is the financial industry unaware of this? Oh no. Issuing consumer debt is an enormously profitable business. The vast majority of consumers, including those with the socioeconomic wherewithal to walk away from their debts, feel themselves morally bound and pay as agreed.</p><p>Why are debt collectors <em>so bad at debt collection</em>? Partially it is because credit card issuers are large national institutions with large, automated processes sitting atop a legacy of corporate acquisitions, IT migrations, and similar that makes availability of non-critical information extremely fragmentary. They then want to dump that complexity through a very small pipe (CSV files) onto the debt collection industry.</p><p><em>That</em> industry is largely not characterized by large, nationally scaled, hypercompetent operators who happen to have decades of institutional inertia. Instead, it is heavily fragmented into strata of mid-market and smallest-of-small-business firms, governed by a patchwork of regulations on the national, state, and local levels, and runs (in large part) on faxes and post-it notes.</p><h2 id="the-operations-of-a-debt-collection-firm">The operations of a debt collection firm<br></h2><p>Roughly three quarters of debt is bought by ten large firms and one quarter is bought by so-called mom-and-pops, but this is complicated by the resale of portfolios which were worked by the majors. Mom-and-pops then buy them at a deep discount with the goal of getting the residual value which the majors did not successfully capture.</p><p>Suppose a debt collection firm has bought a portfolio. They will first "scrub" it, which means using automated or semi-automated processes to enhance the fragmentary data they have and prioritize the portfolio for collection efforts.</p><p>For example, one stage of the scrub will be associating a credit profile with as many debts as possible. Credit scores are extremely good predictors of who pays their debts; that is what they are designed to measure. You will get sharply better results on a per-call basis calling people with a 750 FICO versus a 450 FICO, accordingly, you should call all the 750s first and more frequently.</p><p>A second scrub will typically remove dead debtors, because they infrequently answer their phones. (Debts are not inherited in the United States, a fact which the debt collection industry frequently demonstrates strategic ignorance of.)</p><p>While reading government reports, I chanced across a mention that a novel form of scrub uses third party databases of so-called litigious debtors. This was surprising to me (as far as I know, it was Not A Thing when I was doing advocacy), but makes a lot of operational sense. You can trivially Google providers with [litigious debtor scrub] as a keyword.</p><p>The FDCPA and state legislation provides for automatic damages for illegal behavior from collectors, the incidence of illegal behavior is extremely high, and a debt collector with a high school education and three months of experience will frequently commit three federal torts in a few minutes of talking to a debtor then follow up with a confirmation of the same in writing. (You think I am exaggerating. Reader, I am not. “If you don’t pay me I will sue you and then Immigration will take notice of that and yank your green card” contains three separate causes of action: (frequently) a false threat to file a suit where that is not actually a business practice of the firm, a false alleged affiliation with a government agency, and a false alleged consequence for debt nonpayment not provided for in law.)</p><p>As a result, private companies compiled databases of (public in the U.S.) court filings and organized them by Social Security number, address, and similar to allow debt collectors to identify which debtors are aware of their legal rights. In principle, a debt collector could do anything they wanted with that fact, like being extra careful to follow the law in contacting them. But the economics of debt collection do not counsel careful, individualized consideration of credit card debt.</p><p>I will bet you that, in practice, they simply avoid collecting against anyone who demonstrates ability and financial resources to enforce their rights. This is one for the history books of borked equilibriums. We devoted substantial efforts to pro-consumer legislation to address abuse of (mostly) poor people. We gated redress behind labor that is abundantly available in the professional managerial class and scarce outside of it, like writing letters and counting to 30 days. (People telling me they were incapable of doing these two things is why I started ghostwriting letters for debtors.) We now have literal computer programs exempting heuristically identified professional managerial class members from debt collection,<em> inclusive of their legitimate debts</em>, so that debt collectors can more profitably conserve their time to do abusive and frequently illegal shakedowns of the people the legislation was meant to benefit.</p><p>After scrubbing their lists, debt collectors will attempt to locate contact information for the debtors. You would think this would be fairly straightforward, given that they were given that information in the CSV file they purchased. But information is fragmentary and outdated, and people likely to default on debts also have complicated and frequently changing relationships with their addresses and phone numbers. So there exists an ecosystem of “skip tracing” providers, delightfully (ugh) borrowing the jargon from the business of bounty hunters, to match up fragmentary information with current contact information.</p><p>Operational and IT issues at this stage create a lot of the harm in the debt collection industry. For example, to use an example ripped from my own experience (which was part of over $100,000 of confabulated debt that caused me to fall down the credit advocacy rabbit hole), consider a fragmentary piece of information identifies a P.J. MacKenzie at an unspecified town in Illinois as owning a debt in the few hundred dollar range. That name is a fuzzy match to one Patrick Johnathan McKenzie of Chicago, Illinois. Here you are welcome to your moral intuitions as to whether simply asserting that I owe you a few hundred dollars is legitimate. The debt collection industry frequently assumes, as a matter of business practice, “I mean, probably you do factually owe me, and if you don’t, oh well, then you won’t be one of the ~8% of people who we successfully collect from.” No individualized application of human labor is required to reach this conclusion. No one is accountable for the mistake; no one <em>made</em> it, not in the usual sense of people making mistakes. People architected a system which generates this outcome by default.</p><p>And then begin the calls. To you, if the above processes have successfully found you. To your friends and relatives, if they have not. (The FDCPA provides that debt collectors are only allowed to contact a debtor’s family to find current contact information. They do this with gusto, including when they have current contact information. It is used coercively, because many debtors will make sacrifices to find $250 so <em>their mother</em> stops getting calls.)</p><p>Debt collectors typically work in call center environments, assisted by technological improvements to greatly increase the number of calls per hour each collector can do. These include so-called predictive dialers, which (as a sketch) dial several debtors in parallel for each collector, since most calls will not be answered or will go to voicemail, then connect only those that pick up to a debt collector waiting in the queue. Maximizing the efficiency of callers is key to the economics of debt collection; labor frequently costs more than than underlying debt does, even when one is paying four cents on the dollar and hiring collectors straight out of high school. An unhappy consequence of this is that debt collection firms build extremely scaled systems to project externalities into the phone network and the people attached to it, including very many people who never owed them a dime. But for the (dubious) cover of law, this is what technologists would call a volumetric denial of service attack: a relatively small expenditure of resources allows a collector to disable a relatively large number of phones.</p><p>If there is one thing that unites debtors, it is <em>the cacophony</em>. The phones ring and ring and ring. They ring at all times legally permissible and many times not. They ring from the same collector calling you twice a day. They ring from the same debt being collected by multiple different agencies, several of which sold the debt on but neglected to update their internal systems to stop collecting on the debt they no longer own. They ring from dozens of different firms, because the circumstances which caused you to go delinquent on one debt caused you to go delinquent on several debts. Each of those is collected in parallel by a process which considers every other debt collector a competitor for your scarce dollars and must outcompete them by ringing you harder, faster, and more persistently.</p><h2 id="what-does-a-debt-collector-hope-to-get-from-a-call">What does a debt collector hope to get from a call?<br></h2><p>The goal of calls is to get a verbal promise to pay and payment credentials. The most useful payment credential, from the perspective of a debt collector, is a checking account number, but in a pinch they will also usually take debit cards or credit cards. (Many people who have defaulted on debts still have access to credit, because in deteriorating financial circumstances one could default on some but not all credit lines. There is also an extremely efficient financial industry capable of extending credit profitably at a wide variety of predicted repayment likelihoods.)</p><p>Many promises to pay are not promises to pay in full, but rather “a plan” to pay the face value of the debt plus accumulated (and accumulating) interest over time. Most debtors who agree to payment plans will not successfully complete those plans. This is, from the perspective of a debt collector, <em>not a problem</em>. If they paid five cents on the dollar for your loan, and successfully convince you to pay twenty cents today and the balance over monthly payments over a year, you know what they’re left with in month three when you default? Ability to collect from you again, or to sell your debt for more than they paid for it, because you are a better credit risk than most people in the portfolio. You proved that, by paying.</p><p>Many less sophisticated customers assume that they have substantial control over sending payments via check. All checks have the account number, printed on the face of them, and collectors will push aggressively to get that number over the phone versus waiting for a check to arrive. The goal of having the number is to present the bank holding the checking account with an electronic ACH debit or a “demand draft”, in both cases representing that the account holder has pre-authorized the debit. How many debits did a debtor agreeing to the above sketched plan pre-authorize? Not less than thirteen.</p><p>They will frequently be very surprised to learn that, and they will be frequently surprised when their financial institution backs the debt collector, who often has a sudden fit of competence and manages to record this part of the conversation.</p><p>The amount of gamesmanship that debt collectors get up to regarding payments could use its own column. The verbal authorization to debit your account (“payment plan”) was probably silent on timing, so they will use their substantial experience in dealing with people in poor economic circumstances to target the dates and times of day when benefits payments or paychecks have posted to your account. They’ll surge collection attempts at 3 AM on the 1st of the month, learn the differences between various banks as to when Social Security payments post, etc. They’ll also do things like e.g. splitting the agreed upon payment into smaller payments, with the goal of getting at least one rather than having the payment declined for insufficient funds (NSF, in financial industry parlance). This has frequently magnified fees assessed by banks to debtors, because NSF fees are frequently assessed per-occurrence.</p><h2 id="why-does-this-continue-being-so-broken">Why does this continue being so broken?<br></h2><p>Incentives rule everything around us. The structure of the industry, technical issues, and similar alluded to above cause most of this, and they have continued causing it despite decades of effort to correct.</p><p>There are also human capital issues at play. Discussing them is a bit difficult, because the people who physically make phone calls for debt collectors share many of the life challenges of debtors as a class. They are poorly educated, poorly paid, poorly managed, and churned through viciously. The work is <em>soul crushing</em>; turnover at the large firms is 75-100% annually. Call centers are <em>already</em> generally a high-stress, terrible working environment even when one is doing routine customer service or order entry work; a debt collector is the type of call center worker that <em>no one wants to talk to</em>. Successful debt collectors need to both harden their hearts against tales of woe (and personal abuse) from debtors and also successfully execute on some combination of moral suasion and threats to eke out a few percentage points at the margin in collections. Success in the field is the difference between e.g. 7% and 8% collection.</p><p>Few competent people remain in this field over an extended period of time; an effective, morally upright debt collector would be a better telephone sales rep at a tenth the stress and two to five times the total compensation. As a result, most calls being made today are not by effective, morally upright debt collectors. Illegal threats may be more effective than diligent suasion and management frequently, through incompetence or careful refusal to watch the sausage being made, ignores that collectors are making threats but tracks per-collector productivity very carefully. Solve for the equilibrium.</p><p>As a former advocate, I’d report that it is never in a debtor’s interest to verbally speak to a debt collector under any circumstances. One’s likelihood of being abused or lied to, including in financially consequential fashions, is high, and one’s ability to counter that is minimal. Instead, force them to do all correspondence on paper, where lies are self-documenting, illegal threats are immediately admissible to regulatory processes or court, etc.</p><p>The incentives and hiring pool available to debt collection firms cause them to put most of their limited competence into scaling phone teams and very little competence into individualized written correspondence. That would require them to successfully keep a folder about a debtor for a month and route communications to the desk with that folder; this is an edge case for them and uneconomical to do at the hundreds of dollar range. This means they will, through a combination of incompetence and strategic decisions by management, frequently simply abandon collection activity where that would require them to read and write.<br></p><h2 id="suing-people-with-robots">Suing people with robots</h2><p>Most debts are not litigated, but various debt collection firms have various strategies here. Almost no consumer debts are worth serious amounts of professional attention, but above about $1,000 or so (depending heavily on jurisdiction), they can be worth doing high-frequency lawyering on.</p><p>Basically, the debt collector will either itself or, through use of a law firm, file hundreds or thousands of lawsuits in a single court against its roster of uncollected debtors. Those lawsuits will be entirely templated. A frequent detail that emerges in news reporting is that they’ll often be physically robosigned, so that the relevant lawyers don’t give themselves repetitive stress injuries by needing to affix their name to all of the things they are swearing to under penalty of perjury.</p><p>You might have a view of the judicial system where two highly educated advocates joust in front of a neutral finder of fact like a judge or jury. This ain’t that.</p><p>The goal of this business process is generating so-called <em>default judgements</em>. They’re both judgment that a default happened and also the judgment that happens by default; the overwhelming case for issuance is when one party is summoned to court and does not show up. Many debtors will ignore correspondence about court cases believing that ignoring them will make the problem go away; this is the opposite of the truth. Many will lack transportation, not be able to take off work, etc. In any event, filling 100 court cases means that, in <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-consumer-protection-staff-report-repairing-broken-system-protecting/debtcollectionreport.pdf">expectation</a>, your lawyer will collect 60-95 default judgements or more. Not a bad day’s work.</p><p>Default judgements turn a debt that hasn’t been collected voluntarily into a financial asset with value. They can be used to garnish the contents of bank accounts or wages paid to debtors, in many jurisdictions. For debtors who own property, which is a fact pattern that occurs much more commonly than you probably would guess, a default judgment can frequently be turned into a lien against the property. This swaps an unsecured consumer debt for a senior claim against the debtor’s home equity. That claim is itself salable into an ecosystem of lien investors, and the debt collector will frequently sell it for (say) 80 cents on the dollar, realizing a profit over their low basis in the debt and collection costs.</p><p>Should a debtor actually show up to the courthouse, the lawyer will almost invariably offer an on-the-spot settlement. Fifty cents on the dollar seems to be popular, anecdotally. Avoid the expense and stress of a legal proceeding, etc etc, this is obviously incentive compatible.</p><p>When debtors actually contest their debts, or have competent legal representation, the debt collectors frequently get beaten like drums. Many judges take an unsurprisingly dim view of lawyers who profess to have personal knowledge of the facts of the case then can’t locate the contract they are suing over. (Again: they do not and never did possess a copy of the contract. The lawyer does not actually know any facts of the debt other than that the firm purchased a name, address, and perhaps a Social Security number in a CSV file. They don’t have the contents of any previous correspondence about the debt, owing to some combination of incompetence and unwillingness to present evidence of crimes in court.) Then comes some gamesmanship, where the debt collector will attempt to ask for an extension to get their paperwork in order and the debtor’s attorney will push for dismissal, claims under the FDCPA and similar, and costs.</p><p>This makes for good human interest pieces occasionally, but the economics make the lawsuit machine very profitable to run even accounting for losses, and accordingly it continues robosigning cases by the tens and hundreds of thousands.</p><h2 id="what-can-be-done-about-this">What can be done about this?<br></h2><p>Many people have suggestions for obvious improvements here, which might rhyme with the Federal Trade Commission’s suggestions <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-bureau-consumer-protection-staff-report-repairing-broken-system-protecting/debtcollectionreport.pdf">from 2010</a> or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/rules-policy/final-rules/">spate of rulemaking</a> from 2021 through 2023 or the FDCPA from 1978.</p><p>I’ll leave rulemaking to the rulemakers, as this essay has gone on long enough. The state of reality is very bad, not because any single person woke up this morning attempting to maximize evil, but because a complex interaction of structural factors over multiple different parts of society got us to where we are.</p><div><p>Untangling that Gordian knot is hard and has empirically eluded us.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>We’re once again at the end of our internship season, and it’s my task
to provide a few highlights of what the dev interns accomplished while
they were here.</p>

<p>The program was big! We had 152 software engineering interns, drawn
from 58 schools across 19 different countries.  And that’s not even
counting the 31 tech interns in areas like production engineering, IT
engineering, network engineering, and more.</p>

<p>The intern program is so big and diverse that it’s impossible to
faithfully summarize it with just a few projects. But, something is
better than nothing, so here are the projects I’ll discuss this time
around:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Rajeev Godse wrote a query language based on Linear Temporal Logic
for querying complex events out of system logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Semyon Savkin worked on our AI Assistants team, building an
efficient tokenizer in OCaml.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sasha Hydrie added concurrency support to our tracing syntax, making
it suitable for use with our asynchronous programming frameworks.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now let’s dive into the details!</p>

<h2 id="a-temporal-query-language">A temporal query language</h2>

<p>Concord (which we’ve
<a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/building-an-exchange/">talked</a>
<a href="https://signalsandthreads.com/state-machine-replication-and-why-you-should-care/">about</a>
before) is a platform for building systems that let counterparties
connect to us to trade directly with or through us.</p>

<p>Concord’s architecture is built around a single, totally-ordered
stream of transactions.  One nice thing about this approach is that
the transaction stream is a great debugging aid: an incredibly
detailed source-of-truth that you can dive into when you’re trying to
figure out why the system is misbehaving.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the tooling we had for digging into this treasure trove
was a bit limited.  All we really had was the ability to find and grab
individual messages.  But sometimes you want more than that! You want
to search for sequences of events that match some specified criteria.</p>

<p>We did have <em>some</em> tooling for this. In particular, one of our
engineers had built a stream query system based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_temporal_logic">linear temporal
logic</a>, or, LTL
for short.  LTL is a well-studied logic that takes basic propositional
logic and adds to it two key operators: <code>next</code> and <code>until</code>.</p>

<p>Roughly, <code>p next q</code> means that predicate <code>p</code> holds currently, and that
predicate <code>q</code> holds thereafter.  And <code>p until q</code> means that <code>p</code> holds
currently, and will continue to hold until <code>q</code> starts holding.</p>

<p>If it’s not obvious to you how to use these two operators to build
meaningful queries, well, join the club.  It can be a bit of a puzzle
to figure out how to convert meaningful queries into the fairly
low-level logical statements that LTL is built on.  To make matters
worse, the only syntax we had for writing these queries was a fairly
awkward s-expression based format.  As a result, almost no one used
the LTL query engine.</p>

<p>That’s where Rajeev’s project came in. Rajeev’s goal was to build an
easier-to-use, SQL-like query language to act as a frontend to the
LTL query engine.  The language wouldn’t be quite as expressive as
LTL, but it would be a lot easier to use.</p>

<p>We don’t really have space to go into detail on how the language
works, but here’s an example of a query for retrieving and printing
out retail orders paired with the first execution received by each
order:</p>

<div><pre><code>FIND wholesaling.retail_order.new Retail_order
THEN FIRST wholesaling.route.fill.external Fill
  WHERE .retail_order_id = Retail_order.retail_order_id;
PRINT
, Fill.time - Retail_order.time AS order_to_fill_time
, Retail_order.retail_order_id AS retail_order_id
, Retail_order.time AS arrival_time
;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>He built the parser for this new language on top of
<a href="https://github.com/inhabitedtype/angstrom">Angstrom</a>, a
parser-combinator library for OCaml.  It wasn’t too hard to get a
working parser; the biggest challenge was getting good error
messages.  But after some careful wrestling with the system, Rajeev
was able to get it to track enough context to generate good error
messages in the cases that mattered.</p>

<p>In addition to getting the basic system in place, Rajeev had time to
add a few interesting temporal operators to the language, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code>LAST p BEFORE q</code>, which matches messages <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> such that
<code>M2</code> satisfies <code>q</code> and <code>M1</code> is the last message satisfying <code>p</code>
before <code>M2</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code>NO MESSAGE p BEFORE q</code>, which matches <code>M</code> satisfying <code>q</code> such that
no messages before <code>M</code> satisfy <code>p</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All in, the project was a real success. The new temporal query
language has become the go-to tool on the team for debugging
performance problems, and there have been requests from other teams to
generalize the language so it can be used against other systems as
well. This feels like an exciting new part of our toolkit for
supporting production systems.</p>

<h2 id="efficient-token-counting-in-ocaml">Efficient token-counting in OCaml</h2>

<p>If you’ve ever used an AI chatbot you’ll appreciate the importance of
keeping track of your token usage—both as a way to keep costs in
order and to mind rate limits. Surfacing these token counts in real
time to users helps them understand and moderate their own usage.</p>

<p>The project we needed tokenization for is our own web front-end to the
various AI chatbots out there.  We started off using OpenAI’s
tokenization library, <a href="https://github.com/openai/tiktoken">tiktoken</a>, which we set up by
starting a Python server that we could hit over HTTP.</p>

<p>But, this was a bit of a grungy setup, and we only had access to the
token counter from the server, not the client. A pure OCaml
implementation would solve both problems at once, since our client is
an OCaml program too.</p>

<p>Semyon Savkin’s intern project was to write such an
implementation. Token counting is not trivial—it’s not like you just
split your input string on spaces—and an early challenge was finding
an OCaml regex library that supported all the features used by the
regex in tiktoken. Nothing that we found was suitable, especially
given the constraint that it had to work in the browser. Fortunately,
the regex was simple enough that it was not too difficult for Semyon
to handcraft the code for the automaton.</p>

<p>The goal at first was to check that the program’s behavior conformed
100% with the reference implementation, so Semyon wrote a stress test
program to spot any differences.  But it soon became clear that this
was too strict of a requirement, since even a slight difference in the
unicode version can cause (very rare) tokenization differences. So
Semyon needed to find a way to relax the tests enough to allow for
small deviations, without losing too much bug-finding power.</p>

<p>Our initial implementation used a very functional style, with lists
and maps. The code was nice and simple, but just not fast enough. So,
Semyon spent some time profiling and experimenting, and ended up with
a more imperative implementation leveraging hash-tables and arrays,
which, along with algorithmic improvements, made a big difference.</p>

<p>By the end of the internship, Semyon had produced two fully
functioning tokenizers. We compared the results against both the
Python server and also the reference implementations as accessed
through the Python API, which were written in Rust. When measured in
bytes per microsecond, we blew the Python server out of the water for
short messages, due to network latency. But even doing an
apples-to-apples comparison with the Rust implementations, we found
that our implementation was marginally faster on average for OpenAI
tokenization, and a bit less than twice as fast on average for
Anthropic tokenization:</p>

<p><img alt="Tokenizer performance" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/tokenizer-perf.png">
</p>

<p>One thing to note about the above graph is that, despite being faster,
our variance was worse, which is probably due to GC pauses.  This
could probably be brought down by being more careful about allocation,
but the variance just wasn’t a problem for this application.</p>

<p>We didn’t really expect to beat the performance of OpenAI’s
implementation, so that was a pleasant surprise!</p>

<h2 id="async-tracing">Async tracing</h2>

<p><code>ppx_tracing</code> is an OCaml syntax extension that provides
high-performance introspection capabilities for OCaml programs. To use
it, all you have to do is add a small <code>@trace</code> annotation to an
existing function:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span><span>[@</span><span>trace</span> <span>"demo"</span> <span>"compute"</span> <span>~</span><span>n</span><span>:(</span><span>n</span> <span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>)]</span> <span>compute</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>(* ... *)</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then, you just have to call <code>Tracing_probes.start</code> somewhere in your
executable, and at runtime you’ll get a UI for viewing traces, built
on top of Perfetto:</p>

<p><img alt="ppx_tracing UI" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/perfetto.png">
</p>

<p>When we released ppx_tracing internally, there was one main issue that
kept people from really wanting to use it: it didn’t work with
asynchronous code.  In particular, it couldn’t represent suspending
execution in one function and resuming in another.</p>

<p>This was a significant limitation, since most real-world programs do
<em>something</em> asynchronous, say writing to a file or fetching data over
the network.  These operations are provided by the <code>Async</code> library,
which lets us wrap asynchronous computations in “deferreds”—the
OCaml equivalent of a Promise in Javascript.  Let’s consider the
following <code>Async</code> program for checking disk space usage:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span><span>[@</span><span>trace</span> <span>"demo"</span> <span>"process"</span><span>]</span> <span>rec</span> <span>process_directory</span> <span>path</span> <span>=</span>

  <span>let</span> <span>num_bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>Int63</span><span>.</span><span>to_int</span> <span>stat</span><span>.</span><span>size</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Option</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>~</span><span>default</span><span>:</span><span>0</span> <span>in</span>

  <span>|</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>return</span> <span>0</span>
<span>;;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Running the program with tracing enabled produces a confusing
result. Here, spans representing calls to <code>process_directory</code> only
capture the time taken to allocate a new deferred.  Further, since the
trace only keeps track of one pending function call, we can’t know
which invocation of <code>process_directory</code> generated each instant event.</p>

<p><img alt="Confusing asynchronous trace" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/async-1.png">
</p>

<p>The crux of Sasha Hydrie’s intern project was to figure out how to
integrate with the Async scheduler to keep track of multiple
concurrent execution contexts.  This required associating a unique ID
with each async function call.</p>

<p>Luckily, the <code>Async</code> scheduler can store metadata along with each
deferred computation.  When switching to a new task, the scheduler
makes its data (known as the “execution context”) globally accessible.
Therefore, upon entering an async function, we can store a unique
“correlation ID” in the context.  This gives us the ability to
distinguish between multiple invocations of <code>process_directory</code>.
Later on, when the task actually executes, we can query the current ID
to see which function we’re in.</p>

<p>Sasha extended the PPX with a new annotation (<code>@trace.async</code>)
implementing this behavior.  The resulting IDs must end up in the
final trace file, so he also updated our Fuchsia trace format tooling
to support the relevant event types.  Now, updating our example with
<code>@trace.async</code> gives a much more sensible result—we can see how long
each call is actually in flight, and how many are executing in
parallel.  Further, instant events are able to query the active
correlation ID to determine which call they are a part of.</p>

<p><img alt="Better asynchronous trace" src="https://blog.janestreet.com/what-the-interns-have-wrought-2023/async-2.png">
</p>

<p>However, not all functions are asynchronous. We don’t want every
synchronous function to create a new track, but we also don’t want to
mix them all together.  Therefore, Sasha added a new async mode to the
PPX, where synchronous function calls will also query the current
correlation ID and dynamically attach to a parent async call.</p>

<p>Already Sasha’s work has enabled wider adoption of ppx_tracing; the
tool should now work in most real-world programs. The team behind
<a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/code-review-that-isnt-boring/">Iron</a>, our in-house code review system, used it to improve
their server’s startup time by about 50%, within days of the final
project being released.</p>

<p>Given the success of the project, there is, of course, more work yet
to do: we’re hoping to integrate ppx_tracing with a new distributed
tracing system we’ve built, as well as perform more detailed tracing
of the Async scheduler itself.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-are-you-waiting-for">So, what are you waiting for?</h2>

<p>Summarizing the whole summer in just a handful of projects is an
impossible task, but I hope this gives you a flavor of the kinds of
things that our interns do.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few months ago in June, I attended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Local-First+Meetup+Berlin+%231">a local-first meetup in Berlin</a> organized by Johannes Schickling, formerly the founder of Prisma. An intellectual crackle filled the air as we watched demos of new libraries and products. Many of us had been independently playing around with local-first development ideas for a while — in my case, over a decade — and the in-person meetup gave us the chance to trade notes late into the night.</p>

<p>In the months since, I’ve continued to tinker with these technologies and collected some point-in-time notes on significant developments and what might happen in the years to come.</p>

<h2 id="whats-happening"><a href="#whats-happening" aria-label="whats happening permalink"></a>What’s Happening?</h2>
<p>The web feels ready for a major upgrade. We had tightly coupled web frameworks in the Rails/Django years and lost them with the shift to API-powered SPAs. The developing database-grade sync technology will tightly recouple our application stacks allowing for a new era of framework innovation.</p>
<p>I see “local-first” as shifting reads and writes to an embedded database in each client via“sync engines” that facilitate data exchange between clients and servers. Applications like Figma and Linear pioneered this approach, but it’s becoming increasingly easy to do. The benefits are multiple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplified state management for developers</li>
<li>Built-in support for real-time sync, offline usage, and multiplayer collaborative features</li>
<li>Faster (60 FPS) CRUD</li>
<li>More robust applications for end-users</li>
</ul>
<p>(Some good reading material: this local-first case study on <a href="https://riffle.systems/essays/prelude/">building reactive, data-centric apps</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxuXGeMJsBU&amp;t=1s">Johannes’ talk in Berlin</a>; I will include some more links later.)</p>
<p>Like the shift to componentized JavaScript UI over the last decade, I believe local-first will be the next large paradigm shift for rich client apps and work its way through the application world over the next decade</p>
<h2 id="why-is-local-first-happening-now"><a href="#why-is-local-first-happening-now" aria-label="why is local first happening now permalink"></a>Why is Local-First Happening Now?</h2>
<p>I’ve read about and played with local-first type ideas for a decade or so but only now does it seem to be gaining steam with many young startups rushing to productize its ideas.</p>
<p>Figma, Superhuman, and Linear are good examples of pioneering startups in the local-first paradigm and all rely on local-first ideas and bespoke sync engines to support their speed and multiplayer UX.</p>
<p>Many builders now see local-first as a key way to differentiate their applications.</p>
<p>Why is this happening now?</p>
<p>My general model for change in technology is that a given community of practice (like application developers) can only adopt one large paradigm shift at a time. While local-first ideas have been floating around for decades, practitioners have so far been focused on more fundamental changes.</p>
<p>What we’ve seen over the last decade is that application speed and collaboration features are powerful vectors to shake up an incumbent industry. Figma used local-first to displace Sketch and InVision; Linear is using local-first to displace Jira.</p>
<p>We’ve shifted from Rails-type server-rendered apps, to single-page-apps powered by APIs. A core lesson from this transition is that while standard REST and GraphQL APIs are very easy to get started with for solving client/server sync, they require significant effort and skill to scale and refine and they struggle with use-cases like multiplayer and offline support.</p>
<p>Sync engines are a robust database-grade syncing technology to ensure that data is consistent and up-to-date. It’s an ecosystem-wide refactor that many talented groups are exploring to attempt to simplify the application stack.</p>
<p>Assuming they succeed, they’ll provide a solid substrate for new types of framework that can rely on local data and rock solid sync.</p>
<h2 id="will-most-rich-client-apps-use-local-first"><a href="#will-most-rich-client-apps-use-local-first" aria-label="will most rich client apps use local first permalink"></a>Will Most Rich Client Apps Use Local-First?</h2>
<p>I’ve chatted with a number of developers who — frustrated at maintaining the homegrown bespoke sync systems they wrote — are replacing it with new local-first tooling. The tooling feels a lot better and having standard primitives make it easier to build great experiences.</p>
<p>Local-first is developing into an ecosystem similar to authentication services but for handling data and features that need to be real-time, collaborative, or offline.</p>
<p>The key question for us technologists is whether local-first will remain a niche technology or if it’ll gradually replace the current API-based approach.</p>
<p>It’s still early but I’m confident that at a minimum, we’ll see multiple breakout startups along with a few healthy open-source ecosystems around the different approaches. And if local-first becomes the new default paradigm for handling data,, it will be much larger and reshape many parts of the cloud ecosystem.</p>
<p>But: there are many issues to solve first! Let’s look in detail at one of the first issues that people encounter: handling CRUD operations.</p>
<h3 id="crud-with-crdt-based-sync-engines"><a href="#crud-with-crdt-based-sync-engines" aria-label="crud with crdt based sync engines permalink"></a>CRUD with CRDT-based Sync Engines</h3>
<p>To fully replace client-server APIs, sync engines need robust support for fine-grained access control and complex write validation.</p>
<p>The most basic use case for an API is <em>state transfer</em> from the server to the client. The client wants to show information about an object so reads the necessary data through the API.</p>
<p>Local-first tools all handle this perfectly. They ensure the latest object data is synced correctly to the client db for querying from the UI.</p>
<p>But while reads are generally easy, support for complex writes is still immature in local-first tooling. Clients tend to have unrestricted write access and updates are immediately synced to other clients. While this is generally fine for text collaboration or multiplayer drawing, this wouldn’t work for a typical ecommerce or SaaS application.</p>
<p>Local-first tools need somewhere to put arbitrary business logic written in code, because real-world systems start out elegant and simple and, over time, accumulate lots of messy, important chunks of logic.</p>
<p>A data property might normally be limited to 20 but Acme Corp paid $50k to get a limit of 100. Or write access needs to be restricted for sensitive information like account balances. Or writes need validation by third party APIs, like a calendar booking system that needs to ask an external calendar API if a time slot is open.</p>
<p>Normally, these inevitable chunks of code and logic live on the server behind an API. And we still need somewhere to put them in a local-first world.</p>
<p>Put differently: local-first CRDT-based sync engines can drive consistency within a system but real-world systems also need an authoritative server which can enforce consistency within external constraints and systems.</p>
<p>Or as Aaron Boodman, a <a href="https://replicache.dev/">Replicache</a> co-founder, put it: “CRDTs converge, but to where?”</p>
<h3 id="using-a-distributed-state-machine-to-handle-complex-writes"><a href="#using-a-distributed-state-machine-to-handle-complex-writes" aria-label="using a distributed state machine to handle complex writes permalink"></a>Using a Distributed State Machine to Handle Complex Writes</h3>
<p>I asked Anselm Eickhoff and James Arthur (founders of <a href="https://jazz.tools/">Jazz</a> and <a href="https://electric-sql.com/">ElectricSQL</a> respectively, both CRDT-based tools) about how they suggest handling writes that need an authoritative server.</p>
<p>They both suggested emulating API request/response patterns through a distributed state machine running on a replicated object.</p>
<p>So let’s say a client wants to update the user name. It creates the following object:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>"updateUserName"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"state"</span><span>:</span> <span>"requestedUpdate"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"request"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Fred"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"timestamp"</span><span>:</span> <span>1694122496</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"response"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// User 123</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Bob"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The server listens for writes and upon receiving this one, validates the request and updates the state machine object along with the name on the user object (which again are synced back to clients as the “server” is just another client):</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"machine"</span><span>:</span> <span>"updateUserName"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"state"</span><span>:</span> <span>"finished"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"request"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Fred"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"timestamp"</span><span>:</span> <span>1694122496</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>"response"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"error"</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"timestamp"</span><span>:</span> <span>1694122996</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// User 123</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Fred"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"id"</span><span>:</span> <span>123</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This has the interesting and useful implication that in-flight requests are synced to other clients and it’s trivial for the server to emit progress updates. E.g. an app that supports a team of users uploading images for some nifty AI enhancements. The client can emit progress updates on the upload and the server as it works through enhancements.</p>
<p>In other words, requests/responses have the same multiplayer, offline, real-time sync properties as the rest of the app.</p>
<p>This pattern can be wrapped up in a standard mutation function e.g. <code>const {res, error} = await updateName({ name: "fred" })</code></p>
<p>Jazz also lets you restrict writes to certain object fields to a specific role. Sensitive information would be marked read-only for clients who would need to request the server to update them.</p>
<h3 id="local-first-dx-is-still-being-explored"><a href="#local-first-dx-is-still-being-explored" aria-label="local first dx is still being explored permalink"></a>Local-First DX is Still Being Explored</h3>
<p>Beyond the question of <em>can</em> you build any application with local-first tools, there’s still the question of whether devs will <em>want</em> to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do advantages make it worth learning a new stack and migrating applications?</li>
<li>There’s a lot of missing components still — what will a full production DX for a local-first toolchain look like?</li>
<li>How complex will it feel to build a simple app?</li>
<li>Is there enough demand to fund all the new libraries and products that’ll need to be built?</li>
</ul>
<p>The success of Figma, Superhuman, and Linear suggest these issues will get solved in time.</p>
<h2 id="what-approaches-are-people-exploring-now"><a href="#what-approaches-are-people-exploring-now" aria-label="what approaches are people exploring now permalink"></a>What Approaches are People Exploring Now?</h2>
<p>I’m grouping approaches I see into three broad categories.</p>
<h3 id="1-replicated-data-structures"><a href="#1-replicated-data-structures" aria-label="1 replicated data structures permalink"></a>1. Replicated Data Structures</h3>
<p>These projects provide support for replicated data structures. They are convenient building blocks for any sort of real-time or multiplayer project. They typically give you APIs similar to native Javascript maps and arrays but which guarantee state updates are replicated to other clients and to the server.</p>
<p>It feels like magic when you can build a simple application and and see changes instantly replicate between devices with no additional work.</p>
<p>Most replicated data structures rely on CRDT algorithms to merge concurrent and offline edits from multiple clients.</p>
<p>There’s a number of open source and hosted projects offering replicated data structures, including the granddaddy in this space, Firebase, plus many newer ones.</p>
<p>These services are great for making parts of an app real-time / multiplayer. E.g. a drawing surface, a chat room, a notification system, presence, etc. They’re very simple to get started with and the shared data structures approach offers a much better DX than manually passing events through with websockets or push messaging services.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="2-replicated-database-tables"><a href="#2-replicated-database-tables" aria-label="2 replicated database tables permalink"></a>2. Replicated Database Tables</h3>
<p>An approach several projects are taking is to sync from Postgres to a client db (generally SQLite). You pick tables (or materialized views) to sync to the client and then they get loaded along with real-time updates as writes land in Postgres.</p>
<p>SQLite in the browser is one big advantage of this approach as it gives you the rich, familiar querying power of SQL in the client.</p>
<p>Given Postgres’ widespread usage and central position in most application architectures, this is a great way to start with local-first. Instead of syncing data in and out of replicated data structures, you can read and write directly to Postgres as normal, confident that clients will be in sync.</p>
<p>I’ve built a number of job queues and notification systems over the years and they’ve all struggled with their version of the Byzantine Generals problem. Clients would miss an update (usually due to being offline), and then users would complain about zombie jobs that never finished. In contrast, replicated database tables mean the background process can simply write updates to Postgres, confident all connected clients will get the update.</p>

<h3 id="3-replication-as-a-protocol"><a href="#3-replication-as-a-protocol" aria-label="3 replication as a protocol permalink"></a>3. Replication as a Protocol</h3>
<p>The startup <a href="https://replicache.dev/">Replicache</a> has a unique “replication as a protocol” approach. Replicache is a client JS library along with a replication protocol — which lets you integrate arbitrary backends, provided you follow the spec. It’s more upfront work, as the sync engine is “some assembly required”, but as Replicache is mostly your own code, it gives the most flexibility and power of any local-first tool I’ve seen to date. The startup behind Replicache is also building Reflect, a hosted backend for Replicache.</p>
<h2 id="soshould-you-go-local-first"><a href="#soshould-you-go-local-first" aria-label="soshould you go local first permalink"></a>So…Should You Go Local-First?</h2>
<p>I think it depends on your use case and risk tolerance.</p>
<p>For the right people and teams, it’s an exciting time to jump in. Realtime, multiplayer, and offline features will significantly improve much of our day-to-day software.</p>
<p>For almost any <strong>real-time use case</strong>, I’d choose <em>replicated data structures</em> over raw web sockets as they give you a much simpler DX and robust guarantees that clients will get updates.</p>
<p>For <strong>multiplayer and offline</strong>, again you’ll almost certainly want to pick an open source <em>replicated data structure</em> or hosted service. There’s a lot of difficult problems that they help solve.</p>
<p>The <em>Replicated Database</em> approach also works for the real-time, multiplayer, offline use cases. It should be especially useful for data-heavy applications and ones with many background processing writing into Postgres.</p>
<p>But in general, I’d still be wary of using local-first outside real-time / multiplayer / offline use cases. Local-first is definitely still bleeding-edge. You will hit unexpected problems. A good community has rapidly developed, but there’ll still be some stretches on the road where you’ll have to solve novel problems.</p>
<p>So: if you need local-first, see if it makes sense to isolate the local-first parts and architect the rest of the app (for now) in a more conventional fashion.</p>
<p>I’ve found that most of the major tools have plenty of examples and demos to play with and active Discord channels. There’s also a general local-first community over at <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">https://localfirstweb.dev/</a> and they hold regular meetups.</p>
<p>Following along, I’m getting a lot of the same vibes that I got in the then-nascent React community circa 2014 or 2015.</p>
<p>There are also a lot of interesting implications of local-first development in the realm of privacy, decentralization, data control and so on, but I’ll leave it to others more well-versed in these topics to flesh them out.</p>

													<p>Over the last few years, Linux machines have become a more and more prominent target for all sorts of threat actors. According to our telemetry, 260,000 unique Linux samples appeared in the first half of 2023. As we will demonstrate in this article, campaigns targeting Linux can operate for years without being noticed by the cybersecurity community.</p>
<p>We discovered one such long-lasting attack when we decided to investigate a set of suspicious domains, among them:</p>

</ul>
<p>To a security researcher’s eye, these domains look alarming, as they can be a sight of malware using domain-generation algorithms for C2 communications. We thus decided to take a close look at the <span>fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain.</p>
<h2 id="a-malicious-debian-repository">A malicious Debian repository</h2>
<p>We identified that the domain in question has a <span>deb.fdmpkg[.]org</span> subdomain. Going there in the browser shows the following web page:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01.png" alt="" width="654" height="153" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01.png 654w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01-300x70.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31143412/FDM_story_01-370x87.png 370w" sizes="(max-width: 654px) 100vw, 654px"></a></p>
<p>As suggested by the page, this subdomain claims to host a Debian repository of a piece of software called ‘Free Download Manager’. We further discovered a Debian package of this software available for download from the <span>https://deb.fdmpkg[.]org/freedownloadmanager.deb</span> URL. This package turned out to contain an infected <span>postinst</span> script that is executed upon installation. This script drops two ELF files to the paths <span>/var/tmp/crond</span> and <span>/var/tmp/bs</span>. It then establishes persistence by creating a cron task (stored in the file <span>/etc/cron.d/collect</span>) that launches the /var/tmp/crond file every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>The version of Free Download Manager installed by the infected package was released on January 24, 2020. Meanwhile, the postinst script contains comments in Russian and Ukrainian, including information about improvements made to the malware, as well as activist statements. They mention the dates 20200126 (January 26, 2020) and 20200127 (January 27, 2020).</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/06153905/FDM-malware-story-02.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/06153905/FDM-malware-story-02.png" alt="" width="860" height="122"></a></p>
<h2 id="a-dns-based-backdoor">A DNS-based backdoor</h2>
<p>Once the malicious package is installed, the executable <span>/var/tmp/crond</span> gets launched on every startup through cron. This executable is a backdoor, and it does not import any functions from external libraries. To access the Linux API, it invokes syscalls with the help of the statically linked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietlibc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dietlibc</a> library.</p>
<p>Upon startup, this backdoor makes a type A DNS request for the <span>&lt;hex-encoded 20-byte string&gt;.u.fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain. In response to this request, the backdoor receives two IP addresses that encode the address and port of a secondary C2 server. The following addresses were returned at the time of our research:</p>
<ul>
<li>172.111.48[.]101</li>
<li>172.1.0[.]80</li>
</ul>
<p>The first IP address in the list above is the address of the secondary C2 server, while the second address contains the connection port (encoded in the third and fourth octets) and the connection type (encoded in the second octet).</p>
<p>After parsing the response of the DNS request, the backdoor launches a reverse shell, using the secondary C2 server for communications. The communication protocol is, depending on the connection type, either SSL or TCP. In the case of SSL, the crond backdoor launches the <span>/var/tmp/bs</span> executable and delegates all further communications to it. Otherwise, the reverse shell is created by the <span>crond backdoor</span> itself.</p>
<h2 id="a-bash-stealer">A Bash stealer</h2>
<p>Having found out that the crond backdoor creates a reverse shell, we decided to check how this shell is used by attackers. To do that, we installed the infected Free Download Manager package in a malware analysis sandbox. Having analyzed the traffic generated by crond, we determined that the attackers deployed a Bash stealer to the sandbox. This stealer collects data such as system information, browsing history, saved passwords, cryptocurrency wallet files, as well as credentials for cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, Azure).</p>

<p>After collecting information from the infected machine, the stealer downloads an uploader binary from the C2 server, saving it to <span>/var/tmp/atd</span>. It then uses this binary to upload stealer execution results to the attackers’ infrastructure.</p>
<p>We did not observe any other activity performed via the reverse shell, and thus the whole infection chain can be described with the graph below:</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/05134135/FDM-malware-scheme-01.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/05134135/FDM-malware-scheme-01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="576"></a></p>
<h2 id="mystery-of-the-infection-vector">Mystery of the infection vector</h2>
<p>After analyzing all components in the chain, we wanted to find out how the infected Debian package was distributed to victims. We checked the official website of Free Download Manager (<span>freedownloadmanager[.]org</span>). Packages available for download from this website turned out to be hosted on the <span>files2.freedownloadmanager[.]org</span> domain, and they were not backdoored.</p>
<p>We then decided to conduct an open-source check on the <span>fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain. This check revealed a dozen posts on websites such as StackOverflow and Reddit, where users have been discussing problems caused by the infected Free Download Manager distribution, not realizing they actually became victims of malware. These posts were made over the course of three years – from 2020 to 2022.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/590510/kubuntu-20-04-shutdown-reboot-hangs-at-waiting-for-process-crond" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one such post</a> on Unix Stack Exchange, the author complains about the message ‘Waiting for process: crond’ that prevents the computer from shutting down:</p>

<p>The responses to this post, which came from users dealing with the same problem, suggest that this issue is caused by the Free Download Manager software. They advise to remove the files <span>/etc/cron.d/collect, /var/tmp/crond</span> and <span>/var/tmp/bs</span>. However, none mention that these three files are malicious.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SolusProject/comments/hqxuxo/free_download_manager_installation_help/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another post</a> created in 2020, a Reddit user asked whether it is OK to install Free Download Manager without running the postinst script, which, unbeknownst to the user, contained malware.</p>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/11085422/FDM-malware-story-071.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/09/11085422/FDM-malware-story-071.png" alt="" width="1024" height="973"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, the post author pasted the contents of the script, and another Reddit user pointed out in the comments that it may be malicious. However, these users did not identify the website distributing the infected package or find out what this script does.</p>
<p>We additionally found a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Malware/comments/2zmqzz/free_download_manager_serving_up_malware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> on Reddit mentioning that the official website of this software was distributing malware in 2015. However, the malware described in this post turned out to be unrelated to the campaign that we discovered.</p>

<p>All these posts on social networks made us think that the malicious Debian package could have been distributed via a supply chain attack, through the <span>freedownloadmanager[.]org</span> website. So, we decided to look for further facts that could prove or disprove this claim.</p>
<h3 id="an-unexpected-redirection">An unexpected redirection</h3>
<p>While checking videos on Free Download Manager that are hosted on YouTube, we identified <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtJPC8dscy4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several tutorials</a> demonstrating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVZdxYfn95s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how to install</a> this software on Linux machines. We observed the following actions that happen in all these videos:</p>
<ul>
<li>The video makers opened the <strong>legitimate</strong> website of Free Download Manager (<span>freedownloadmanager[.]org</span>) in the browser;</li>
<li>They afterwards clicked on the Download button for the Linux version of the software;</li>
<li>They were redirected to the <strong>malicious</strong> <span>https://deb.fdmpkg[.]org/freedownloadmanager.deb</span> URL that hosts the infected version of Free Download Manager.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-1024x856.png" alt="" width="1024" height="856" srcset="https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-1024x856.png 1024w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-300x251.png 300w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-768x642.png 768w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-209x175.png 209w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-370x309.png 370w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-335x280.png 335w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09-800x669.png 800w, https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2023/08/31144036/FDM_story_09.png 1097w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></a></p>
<p>We also noted that the redirection to the malicious <span>deb.fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain was not occuring in all cases. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqW6cNZY9DA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another video</a> posted within the same timeframe, , a user clicked on the ‘Download’ button hosted on the software website and ended up downloading Free Download Manager from the legitimate website.</p>
<p>Thus, it is possible that the malware developers scripted the malicious redirection to appear with some degree of probability or based on digital fingerprint of the potential victim.</p>
<p>We further inspected the legitimate Free Download Manager website, wanting to find out if the software developers were aware their website was potentially compromised. In one of the comments made on the software’s <a href="https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/blog/?p=131#comment-311040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog</a> in 2021, a user complains about observing access to the <span>5d6167ef729c91662badef0950f795bf362cbb99.u.fdmpkg[.]org</span> domain. A reply to this comment from the user ‘blogadmin’ says that Free Download Manager is not related to this domain and advises to make use only of official versions of the software:</p>

<p>However, nobody bothered to discover how this user ended up installing this suspicious version of Free Download Manager. As such, the official website of this software continued distributing the malicious Debian package until at least 2022.</p>
<h2 id="origins-of-the-backdoor">Origins of the backdoor</h2>
<p>Having established how the infected Free Download Manager package was distributed, we decided to check whether the implants discovered over the course of our research have code overlaps with other malware samples. It turned out that the crond backdoor represents a modified version of a backdoor called Bew. <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/small-to-medium-business-security/endpoint-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaspersky security solutions</a> for Linux have been detecting its variants since 2013.</p>

<h2 id="why-wasnt-the-malicious-package-discovered-earlier">Why wasn’t the malicious package discovered earlier?</h2>
<p>The malware observed in this campaign has been known since 2013. In addition, the implants turned out to be quite noisy, as demonstrated by multiple posts on social networks. According to our telemetry, victims of this campaign are located all over the world, including Brazil, China, Saudi Arabia and Russia. Given these facts, it may seem paradoxical that the malicious Free Download Manager package remained undetected for more than three years.</p>
<p>We assess that this is due to the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>As opposed to Windows, Linux malware is much more rarely observed;</li>
<li>Infections with the malicious Debian package occurred with a degree of probability: some users received the infected package, while others ended up downloading the benign one;</li>
<li>Social network users discussing Free Download Manager issues did not suspect that they were caused by malware.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the campaign is currently inactive, this case of Free Download Manager demonstrates that it can be quite difficult to detect ongoing cyberattacks on Linux machines with the naked eye. Thus, it is essential that Linux machines, both desktop and server, are equipped with reliable and efficient security solutions.</p>
<p><em>We additionally contacted the developers of Free Download Manager and notified them about this campaign. At the time of publishing this article, we had not received a response from them.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Unity was once heralded as the savior of the video game industry. It was relatively easy to use, and provided an engine/framework for multiple games rather than just one. Even as late as the early 2000s, some game companies, especially in Japan, weren't even sharing similar engines within their own teams! Before the popularity of commercial game engines, each game was built bespoke, which had some advantages, but took a lot of time, and made each port a chore. One of the greatest things Unity provided was a relatively easy pipeline to console releases, making ports more about platform quirks than full recoding.</p>
<p>I remember countless interviews I did as a journalist in 2005 where the interviewee said "now that there's engines like Unity, things are getting easier." My game company Necrosoft has used Unity for every commercial project it has ever made.</p>
<p>But now I can say, unequivocally, if you're starting a new game project, do not use Unity. If you started a project 4 months ago, it's worth switching to something else. Unity is quite simply not a company to be trusted.</p>
<p>What has happened? Across the last few years, as John Riccitiello has taken over the company, the engine has made a steady decline into bizarre business models surrounding an engine with unmaintained features and erratic stability.</p><figure>

        </picture>
        <figcaption>This did not age well.</figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll talk about eroding features first. Unity has internal champions for its features. Once those champions leave the company, that feature languishes and falls apart. Unity buys competing products, and then if the owner of that product leaves the company, it is no longer supported. Unity has a "stable" version of its product called the "LTS" version. More experimental features are pushed to a beta which developers can use if they're curious. Currently we are on an LTS version that requires us to open a blank page before doing anything else, otherwise the engine simply crashes. This is because of an error Unity introduced recently which they have not fixed. It adds a couple minutes every time we open the project, and is anything but stable.</p>
<p>The latest and final straw is <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/plan-pricing-and-packaging-updates?ref=insertcredit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this announcement</a>, which you may have seen some developer friends talking about.</p>
<p>I'll break down some of the most important factors in this discussion:</p><ul><li>Unity personal, which is free, now cannot be used offline.</li><li>all tiers of unity now require developers to pay a flat fee of a few cents for every game that's installed</li><li>Unity plus (which is going away), and pro, and enterprise levels all cost a subscription, and most professional developers have to use it.</li><li>different tiers of downloads and income determine how much you pay.</li><li>Unity has never made money off subscriptions, it has always made money off its ads platform (which you see in f2p mobile games, etc)</li><li>There's a discount if you use Unity Services.</li><li>This money is meant to help with runtime issues when they can't even get their base stable version to run without crashing.</li></ul>
<p>So the problem becomes this: they are already charging a subscription, and now a per install cost on top of that. What's the point of the subscription if we're also paying another charge on top of that? Why wouldn't it be free at that point?
</p><div><p>Also, it's on developers to sort through these two types of costs, meaning Unity has added a bunch of admin work for us, while making it extremely costly for games like Vampire Survivor to sell their game at the price they do. Vampire Survivor's edge was their price, now doing something like that is completely unfeasible. Imagine releasing a game for 99 cents under the personal plan, where Steam takes 30% off the top for their platform fee, and then unity takes 20 cents per install, and now you're making a maximum of 46 cents on the dollar. As a developer who starts a game under the personal plan, because you're not sure how well it'll do, you're punished, astoundingly so, for being a breakout success. Not to mention that sales will now be more costly for developers since Unity is not asking for a percentage, but a flat fee. If I reduce the price of my game, the price unity asks for doesn't decrease.</p><p>This all comes out of the developer's pocket, but publishers won't want to be on the hook for it either - expect fewer games to be pitched with Unity going forward.</p></div>
<p>And NOW consider bundles. Each install or activation counts as something that must be paid. We did the itch.io bundle for ukraine. That was approximately a million games given out per developer. If all those were installed, developers would owe $200,000 just for having given their game to charity. It makes charity bundles completely unfeasible.</p>
<p>On top of this there is no minimum cooldown period after they change their fee, so they can raise it as they like, whenever they like. Effectively we're all locked into an upward-only, per-install pricing model that can change whenever Unity decides they need extra revenue to make their stock look healthy. No developer would have decided to use Unity if this was the business model from the start.<br>It proves that they're willing to completely change things up with no notice. January is barely 4 months away, and this decision will affect titles that have been in development for years, and haven't factored this into their budgets. If we had the option, we'd change now, but we're too far into development. Unreal Engine, to their credit, only holds you to the EULA you signed up for, not whatever they've decided most recently.</p>
<p>I want to double down on this point - we did not sign up for this. Frankly the Unity Plus tier, which we currently use, which is going away presently, wasn't even around when we signed up. Oh, and did I mention we're automatically being switched to the more expensive Pro from Plus if we don't cancel our subscription? If the agreement changes underneath you as you're making the game, you can't budget for it, and trust is completely lost. We did not plan for this, and it screws us massively on Demonschool, which is tracking to be our most successful game. You might say poor you, but again, <em>we did not sign up for this</em> and have no option to say no, since we're close to release and this change is 4 months out. You can't simply remake an entire game in another engine when you've been working on it for 4+ years.</p>

        <figcaption>It is clear that Riccitiello never considered that people might make games for reasons other than money. At least the attitude is consistent.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There is one other critical element here - developers are being offered a reduced price if they use Unity Services. This is basically monopolistic and anti-competitive, and they will likely get sued over it. At the very least it certainly won't encourage any technology companies to make services for Unity. What's the point when Unity will undercut you and still force devs into licensing their own product? Expect far less offerings from third parties in the future.</p>
<div><p>Ultimately, it screws over indies and smaller devs the most. If you can afford to pay for higher tiers, you don't pay as much of this nickle and dime fee, but indies can't afford to on the front end, or often it doesn't make sense in terms of the volume of games you'll sell, but then you wind up paying more in the long term. It'll squash innovation and art-oriented games that aren't designed around profit, especially. It's a rotten deal that only makes sense if you're looking at numbers, and assume everyone will keep using your product. Well, I don't think people will keep using their product unless they're stuck. I know one such developer who is stuck, who's estimating this new scheme will cost them $100,000/month on a free to play game, where their revenue isn't guaranteed.</p><p>Unity is desperately digging its own grave in a search for gold. This is all incredibly short-sighted and adds onto a string of rash decisions and poorly thought through schemes from Unity across the last few years. It's no wonder Riccitiello sold 2,000 shares last week.</p></div>

Giving an element a fixed height can prevent certain margins from collapsing:</p><p>The empty space between the two margins stops them from collapsing, like a moat filled with hungry piranhas.</p><p>Note that this is on a <em>per-side basis</em>. In this example, the child's <em>top</em> margin could still collapse.

The child margin is getting “absorbed” into the parent margin. The two are combining, and are subject to the same rules of margin-collapse we've seen so far (eg. the biggest one wins).</p><p>This can lead to big surprises. For example, check out this common frustration:</p><div><header><h3>Code Playground</h3></header></div><p>In this scenario, you might expect the two sections to be touching, with the margin applied inside each container:</p><div><p>Paragraph One</p><p>Paragraph Two</p></div><p>This seems like a reasonable assumption, since the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s have no margin at all! The intention seems to be to increase the space within the top of each box, to give the paragraphs a bit of breathing room.</p><p>The trouble is that <strong>0px margin is still a collapsible margin.</strong> Each section has 0px top margin, and it gets combined with the 32px top margin on the paragraph. Since 32px is the larger of the two, it wins.</p><div id="more-than-two-margins-can-collapse"><h2><a name="more-than-two-margins-can-collapse-9" id="more-than-two-margins-can-collapse-9" href="#more-than-two-margins-can-collapse-9"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg><p>Link to this heading</p></a>More than two margins can collapse</h2></div><p>Margin collapse isn't limited to just two margins!

It lets us pull a child outside its parent's bounding box, or reduce the space between siblings until they overlap.</p><p>How do negative margins collapse? Well, it's actually quite similar to positive ones! The negative margins will share a space, and the size of that space is determined by the most significant negative margin. In this example, the elements overlap by 75px, since the more-negative margin (-75px) was more significant than the other (-25px).</p><p>What about when negative and positive margins are mixed? In this case, the numbers are <spicy>added together</spicy>. In this example, the -25px negative margin and the 25px positive margin cancel each other out and have no effect, since -25px + 25px is 0.</p><p>Why would we want to apply margins that have no effect?! Well, sometimes you don't control one of the two margins. Maybe it comes from a legacy style, or it's tightly ensconced in a component. By applying an inverse negative margin to the parent, you can "cancel out" a margin.</p><p>Of course, this is not ideal. Better to remove unwanted margins than to add even more margins!

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15/" target="_blank">iPhone 15</a> and iPhone 15 Plus, featuring an industry-first color-infused back glass with a stunning, textured matte finish, and a new contoured edge on the aluminum enclosure. Both models feature the Dynamic Island, and an advanced camera system designed to help users take fantastic photos of everyday moments in their lives. A powerful 48MP Main camera enables super-high-resolution photos and a new 2x Telephoto option to give users a total of three optical zoom levels — like having a third camera. The iPhone 15 lineup also introduces the next generation of portraits, making it easier to capture portraits with great detail and low-light performance. Building on Apple’s innovative satellite infrastructure, Roadside Assistance via satellite can connect users to AAA if they have car trouble while off the grid. With A16 Bionic for powerful, proven performance; a USB‑C connector; Precision Finding for Find My friends; and industry-leading durability features, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus represent a huge leap forward.

The Super Retina XDR display is great for watching content, streaming Apple Fitness+ workouts, and playing games. Peak HDR brightness now reaches up to 1600 nits so HDR photos and videos look better than ever. And when it is sunny, peak outdoor<strong> </strong>brightness reaches up to 2000 nits — twice as bright as the previous generation.

The back glass is strengthened with an optimized dual-ion exchange process before being polished with nanocrystalline particles and etched to create a luxurious, textured matte finish. A new contoured edge on the aerospace-grade aluminum enclosure feels even nicer in users’ hands, and the Ceramic Shield front cover continues to be tougher than any other smartphone glass. With a water- and dust-resistant design<sup>2</sup> and industry-leading durability features, iPhone lasts and holds its value longer than any other smartphone. Plus, the internal design provides powerful sustained performance, while improving ease and affordability of repairs.

By intelligently integrating hardware and software, an additional 2x Telephoto option gives users three optical-quality zoom levels — 0.5x, 1x, 2x — for the first time on an iPhone dual-camera system.

        <div>Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and improved low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken. Shooting at night gets better with improvements to Night mode, including sharper details and more vivid colors. When lighting is bright or uneven, new Smart HDR captures subjects and the background with more true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have brighter highlights, richer midtones, and deeper shadows when viewed in the Photos app. This advanced HDR rendering is also available to third-party apps, so images can look even better when shared online. These improvements benefit the 48MP Main camera, Ultra Wide camera, and TrueDepth front camera.

                 <div>The fast and efficient A16 Bionic chip brings proven performance to iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, powering the Dynamic Island, computational photography capabilities, and more. With two high-performance cores that use 20 percent less power and four high-efficiency cores, the 6-core CPU is faster than the previous generation and easily handles intensive tasks while delivering extraordinary battery life. The 5-core GPU has 50 percent more memory bandwidth for smooth graphics when streaming videos and playing games. A new 16-core Neural Engine is capable of nearly 17 trillion operations per second, enabling even faster machine learning computations for features like Live Voicemail transcriptions in iOS 17 and third-party app experiences — all while protecting critical privacy and security features using the Secure Enclave.&nbsp;

This groundbreaking safety service will come to Spain and Switzerland later this month.

                 <div>Building on this innovative satellite infrastructure, iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus introduce Roadside Assistance via satellite. Beginning in the U.S., when a user has car trouble and cellular and Wi-Fi coverage are not available, they can now connect to AAA, the country’s largest roadside assistance provider.<sup>5</sup> An intuitive interface, including a short questionnaire to capture important details, will transmit the information via satellite so AAA can message with the user directly and dispatch help to their exact location. Access to Roadside Assistance via satellite will be included for free for two years. Service is covered according to AAA membership, but is also available separately for nonmembers.<sup>6</sup>

                 <div>iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus now use even more recycled content, with 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery and 100 percent recycled copper in the main logic board, copper wire in the Taptic Engine, and copper foil in the inductive charger in MagSafe — all firsts for iPhone. Both models also include 75 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets, and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. The iPhone 15 lineup meets Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and is free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span></strong>&nbsp;Apple today debuted iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, designed with aerospace-grade titanium that’s strong yet lightweight to deliver Apple’s lightest Pro models ever. The new design also features contoured edges and a customizable Action button, allowing users to personalize their iPhone experience. Powerful camera upgrades enable the equivalent of seven pro lenses with incredible image quality, including a more advanced 48MP Main camera system that now supports the new super-high-resolution 24MP default, the next generation of portraits with Focus and Depth Control, improvements to Night mode and Smart HDR, and an all-new 5x Telephoto camera exclusively on iPhone 15 Pro Max.

                 <div>Available in 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch display sizes,<sup>2</sup> iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature a strong and lightweight titanium design — a first for iPhone. This premium alloy — the same used in spacecraft — has one of the highest strength-to-weight ratios of any metal, making this Apple’s lightest Pro lineup ever. Both models feature a new refined brush texture, contoured edges, and the thinnest borders on iPhone. The Pro lineup is built to last, combining the strength of titanium with the toughest back glass in a smartphone and the industry-leading Ceramic Shield on the front. Using an industry-first thermo-mechanical process, the titanium bands encase a new substructure made from 100 percent recycled aluminum, bonding these two metals with incredible strength through solid-state diffusion. The aluminum frame helps with thermal dissipation and allows the back glass to be easily replaced. This new design highlights the Super Retina XDR display with Always-On and ProMotion technologies for an exceptional viewing experience.

                 <h2>A17 Pro: A New Generation of Apple Silicon for iPhone
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Bringing pro performance and capabilities, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are powered by A17 Pro, the industry’s first 3-nanometer chip. Continuing Apple’s leadership in smartphone silicon, A17 Pro brings improvements to the entire chip, including the biggest GPU redesign in Apple’s history. The new CPU is up to 10 percent faster with microarchitectural and design improvements, and the Neural Engine is now up to 2x faster, powering features like autocorrect and Personal Voice in iOS 17. The pro-class GPU is up to 20 percent faster and unlocks entirely new experiences, featuring a new 6-core design that increases peak performance and energy efficiency. Now with hardware-accelerated ray tracing — which is 4x faster than software-based ray tracing — iPhone 15 Pro offers smoother graphics, as well as more immersive AR applications and gaming experiences. iPhone 15 Pro brings true-to-life gaming to the palm of users’ hands with console titles never before seen on a smartphone, like Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4, Death Stranding, and Assassin’s Creed Mirage.<sup>4</sup>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>A17 Pro includes a dedicated AV1 decoder, enabling more efficient, high-quality video experiences for streaming services. Additionally, a new USB controller enables USB 3 speeds on iPhone for the first time, now supporting much higher transfer speeds and video output up to 4K at 60 fps HDR.

                 <h2>A Powerful Pro Camera System for More Creative Control
</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Through a deep integration of hardware and software, the advanced camera systems on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max both pack the equivalent of seven pro lenses — all enabled by A17 Pro. With the power of computational photography, the 48MP Main camera, built exclusively for the Pro lineup, gives users even more flexibility with a new 24MP super-high-resolution default, offering incredible image quality at a practical file size ideal for storing and sharing. The Main camera allows users to switch between three popular focal lengths — 24 mm, 28 mm, and 35 mm — and even choose one as a new default. In addition to 48MP ProRAW, the Main camera also supports 48MP HEIF images with 4x more resolution. iPhone 15 Pro features an expansive 3x Telephoto camera, and iPhone 15 Pro Max provides the longest optical zoom ever on iPhone: 5x at 120 mm. Great for close-ups, wildlife photos, and catching the action from further distances, the new Telephoto camera on iPhone 15 Pro Max has an innovative tetraprism design with a combined optical image stabilization and autofocus 3D sensor-shift module, Apple’s most advanced stabilization system yet.

        <div>Next-generation portraits on iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max feature sharper detail, more vivid colors, and better low-light performance. For the first time, users can take portraits without having to switch to Portrait mode. When there’s a person, dog, or cat in the frame, or when a user taps to focus, iPhone automatically captures depth information, so users can turn photos into stunning portraits later in the Photos app on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. For greater creative control, users can also adjust the focus point after the photo has been taken.

                 <div><ul>
<li>The <strong>Phone app</strong> gets major updates, with <strong>Contact Posters</strong> that allow users to customize how they appear to their contacts, and <strong>Live Voicemail</strong>, which leverages the power of A17 Pro to see real-time on-device transcription as someone leaves a voicemail. Users can even pick up the call while the caller is leaving their message.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>Messages</strong> gets a new stickers experience, more powerful search, transcription of audio messages, and <strong>Check In</strong>, which allows users to automatically notify friends and family when they have made it to their destination safely.</li>
</ul>
</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>NameDrop</strong> gives users a new way to use AirDrop to more easily share contact information by simply bringing two iPhone devices together.

                 <div><ul>
<li><strong>StandBy</strong> gives users a customizable full-screen experience with glanceable information designed to be viewed from a distance when iPhone is on its side and charging.

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are designed with the environment in mind. As Apple continues to work toward its 2030 goal of making every product carbon neutral — from design to manufacturing to customer use — the company is prioritizing clean electricity across the entire supply chain and designing products with recycled and other low-carbon materials. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max now use more recycled content, with a 100 percent recycled aluminum substructure and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery — both firsts for Apple. iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max also include 100 percent recycled rare earth elements in all magnets and 100 percent recycled gold in the USB‑C connector as well as the gold plating and tin soldering in multiple printed circuit boards. Both models meet Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and are free of mercury, PVC, and beryllium. Over 99 percent of the packaging is fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of completely removing plastic from its packaging by 2025.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>To further reduce impact on the planet, Apple will no longer use leather in any new Apple products, including iPhone accessories. Apple is introducing a new FineWoven Case with MagSafe and FineWoven Wallet with MagSafe, made from a durable and elegant microtwill with a soft, suedelike feel. The material is made from 68 percent post-consumer recycled content and has significantly lower carbon emissions compared to leather.

<p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/twitter/">short clip on X</a> shows a single blue flash on the top left corner of the shot, followed by a second burst of light seconds later.</p>
<p>A similar phenomenon has been observed before the earthquake in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/turkey/">Turkey</a> earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/turkey-earthquake/">claimed the lives of 45,000 people.</a></p>
<p>The first recorded instance of earthquake lights on camera dates back to 1965 during a Japanese earthquake, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-758370">The Jerusalem Post</a> reports.</p>
<p>The mysterious lights have also been observed in <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/china/">China</a> in 2008, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/italy/">Italy </a>in 2009, and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/where/mexico/">Mexico</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>The cause of earthquake lights, or EQLs, remains shrouded in mystery, leaving unanswered questions about whether it serves as some sort of ominous sign of impending disasters.</p>
<p>Scientists suggest that this may be the release of energy as a result of the movement of lithospheric plates, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment/2019/04/earthquake-lights-explained">National Geographic</a> reports.</p>
<p>Analysing 65 earthquake light incidents for patterns in a 2014 study, adjunct physics professor and and <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/nasa/">NASA</a> researcher Friedemann Freund described the phenomenon "as if you switched on a battery in the Earth's crust".</p>
<p>On Saturday, Morocco woke up to devastating damage following a major 7.2-magnitude earthquake - making it one of the deadliest disasters the country has seen for over 120 years.</p>

<p>More than 2,900 people are dead and 2,059 are injured after the monster tremor struck just after 11pm local time on Friday.</p>
<p>People were sent fleeing in terror from buildings, and those who could not escape were killed as houses collapsed in the quake in Morocco.</p>
<p>The shaking lasted several seconds and a 4.9-magnitude aftershock was recorded 19 minutes later.</p>
<p>The city of Marrakesh was shaken - but the villages in the country's remote High Atlas mountains bore the brute of the devastation.</p>
<p>Morroco is also popular with tourists, with the country welcoming some 700,000 Brits every year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/23892372/morocco-earthquake-relief-efforts-brits/">Dozens of Brits broke off from holidays and business trips to queue for hours to give blood</a>, with others planning supply runs into areas worst hit by the shocks.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>There has been a lot of interest on HN in fine-tuning open-source LLMs recently (eg. Anyscale's post at <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37090632">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37090632</a>). I've been playing around with fine-tuning models for a couple of years, and wanted to share some insights and practical code. I’ve condensed what I’ve learned into a small set of notebooks at <a href="https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/classify-recipes">https://github.com/OpenPipe/OpenPipe/tree/main/examples/clas...</a>, covering labeling data, fine-tuning, running efficient inference, and evaluating costs/performance. The 7B model we train here matches GPT-4’s labels 95% of the time on the test set, and for the 5% of cases where they disagree it’s often because the correct answer is genuinely ambiguous.</p><p>What is fine-tuning? You can think of it as a more-powerful form of prompting, where instead of writing your instructions in text you actually encode them in the weights of the model itself. You do this by training an existing model on example input/output pairs that demonstrate the task you want your fine-tuned model to learn. Fine-tuning can work with as few as 50 examples but I usually try to get 1000+ if possible.</p><p>Prompting still has some big advantages over fine-tuning. It's way easier/faster to iterate on your instructions than label data and re-train a model. And operationally it's easier to deploy one big model and just adjust its behavior as necessary vs deploying many small fine-tuned models that will likely each get lower utilization.</p><p>Fine-tuning has one huge advantage though: it is far more effective at guiding a model's behavior than prompting, so you can often get away with a <i>much</i> smaller model. That gets you faster responses and lower inference costs. A fine-tuned Llama 7B model is 50x cheaper than GPT-3.5 on a per-token basis, and for many use cases can produce results that are as good or better!</p><p>For example, classifying the 2M recipes at <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/corbt/all-recipes" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://huggingface.co/datasets/corbt/all-recipes</a> with GPT-4 would cost $23k. Even with GPT-3.5 it would cost over $1k. The model we fine-tuned performs similarly to GPT-4 and costs just $19 to run over the entire dataset.</p><p>Disclaimer: My brother David and I are working on an open-source product called OpenPipe (<a href="https://github.com/openpipe/openpipe">https://github.com/openpipe/openpipe</a>) to help engineers adopt fine-tuning as simply as possible. But none of the information above depends on our startup. The current post is just about sharing information that we’ve learned about fine-tuning. I hope it’s useful!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>
