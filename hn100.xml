                <p>It’s here, the future of masonry layouts on the web! After the groundwork laid by Mozilla, years of effort by Apple’s WebKit team, and many rounds debate at the CSS Working Group with all the browsers, it’s now clear how it works.</p>
<p>Introducing CSS Grid Lanes.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>250px</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>16px</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Try it today in Safari Technology Preview 234.</p>
<h2>How Grid Lanes work</h2>
<p>Let’s break down exactly how to create this classic layout.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-dark.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light.png" alt="Classic masonry-style layout of photos of various aspect ratios, all the same width, aligned in six columns" width="2000" height="1311" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-300x197.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-1024x671.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-768x503.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-classic-light-1536x1007.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></picture><figcaption>You can try out this <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/photos/">demo of photo gallery layouts</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p>First, the HTML.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>main</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"container"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-1.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-2.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-3.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;!-- etc --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Let’s start by applying <code>display: grid-lanes</code> to the <code>main</code> element to create a Grid container ready to make this kind of layout. Then we use <code>grid-template-columns</code> to create the “lanes” with the full power of CSS Grid.</p>
<p>In this case, we’ll use <code>repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))</code> to create flexible columns at least 250 pixels wide. The browser will decide how many columns to make, filling all available space.</p>
<p>And then, <code>gap: 16px</code> gives us 16 pixel gaps between the lanes, and 16 pixel gaps between items within the lanes.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>250px</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>16px</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That’s it! In three lines of CSS, with zero media queries or container queries, we created a flexible layout that works on all screen sizes.</p>
<p>Think of it like a highway of cars in bumper-to-bumper traffic.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234.png" alt="Cartoon drawing of a highway from above. Nine cars fill four lanes of traffic, bumper to bumper. Each car has a number labeling it, showing the order these would be in HTML." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-in-STP234-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>Just like the classic <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry library</a>, as the browser decides where to put each item, the next one is placed in whichever column gets it closest to the top of the window. Like traffic, each car “changes lanes” to end up in the lane that gets them “the furthest ahead”.</p>
<p>This layout makes it possible for users to tab across the lanes to all currently-visible content, (not down the first column below the fold to the very bottom, and then back to the top of the second column). It also makes it possible for you to build a site that keeps loading more content as the user scrolls, infinitely, without needing JavaScript to handle the layout.</p>
<h2>The power of Grid</h2>
<h3>Varying lane sizes</h3>
<p>Because Grid Lanes uses the full power of CSS Grid to define lanes using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/grid-template-columns"><code>grid-template-*</code></a>, it’s easy to create creative design variations.</p>
<p>For example, we can create a flexible layout with alternating narrow and wide columns — where both the first and last columns are always narrow, even as the number of columns changes with the viewport size. This is accomplished with <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(8rem, 1fr) minmax(16rem, 2fr)) minmax(8rem, 1fr)</code>.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-dark.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light.png" alt="Demo layout of photos, where the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th column are narrow, while the 2nd, 4th and 6th columns are twice as wide. " width="2000" height="1311" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-300x197.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-1024x671.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-768x503.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-varying-widths-light-1536x1007.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></picture><figcaption>Try out the <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/photos/">demo of photo gallery layouts</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p>There’s a whole world of possibilities using <code>grid-template-*</code> syntax.</p>
<h4>Spanning items</h4>
<p>Since we have the full power of Grid layout, we can also span lanes, of course.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-dark.png" type="image/png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light.png" alt="A complex layout of titles with teaser text for over two dozen articles — telling people what they'll experience if they open the article. The first teaser has a very large headline with text, and spans four columns. Five more teasers are medium-sized, bowl and next to the hero. The rest of the space available is filled in with small teasers. None of the teasers have the same amount of content as the rest. The heights of each box are random, and the layout tucks each box up against the one above it." width="2000" height="1394" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light.png 2000w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-300x209.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-1024x714.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-768x535.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-newspaper-demo-light-1536x1071.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></picture><figcaption>Try out the <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/newspaper/">demo of newspaper article layout</a> today in Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>20</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>2</span><span>lh</span>;
}
<span>article</span> { 
  <span>grid-column</span>: <span>span</span> <span>1</span>; 
}
<span>@media</span> (1250<span>px</span> &lt; <span>width</span>) {
  <span>article</span>:<span>nth-child</span>(<span>1</span>) { 
    <span>grid-column</span>: <span>span</span> <span>4</span>;             
  }
  <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(2), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(3), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(4), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(5), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(6), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(7), <span>article</span><span>:nth-child</span>(8) { 
    <span>grid-column</span>: <span>span</span> <span>2</span>; 
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>All the article teasers are first set to span 1 column. Then the 1st item is specifically told to span 4 columns, while the 2nd – 8th to span 2 columns. This creates a far more dynamic graphic design than the typical symmetrical, everything the same-width, everything the same-height layout that’s dominated over the last decade.</p>
<h3>Placing items</h3>
<p>We can also explicitly place items while using Grid Lanes. Here, the header is always placed in the last column, no matter how many columns exist.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-museum.png" alt="A layout of paintings —&nbsp;each has a bit of text below the painting: title, etc. The paintings are laid out in 8 columns. Over on the right, spanning across two columns is the header of the website.

<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>24</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
}
<span>header</span> {
  <span>grid-column</span>: <span>-3</span> / <span>-1</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Changing directions</h2>
<p>Yes, lanes can go either direction! All of the examples above happen to create a “waterfall” shape, where the content is laid out in columns. But Grid Lanes can be used to create a layout in the other direction, in a “brick” layout shape.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout.png" alt="Contrasting cartoon drawings: on the left, waterfall layout with boxes lined up in columns, falling down the page. And &quot;brick&quot; layout, with boxes flowing left to right, stacked like bricks in rows." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-waterfall-v-brick-layout-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>The browser automatically creates a waterfall layout when you define columns with <code>grid-template-columns</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want a brick layout in the other direction, instead define the rows with <code>grid-template-rows</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid-lanes</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span> <span>1</span><span>fr</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This works automatically thanks to a new default for<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/grid-auto-flow"><code>grid-auto-flow</code></a>, the <code>normal</code> value.  It figures out whether to create columns or rows based on whether you defined the lanes using <code>grid-template-columns</code> or <code>grid-template-rows</code>.</p>
<p>The CSS Working Group is still discussing which property will explicitly control the flow orientation, and what its syntax will be. The debate is over whether to reuse <code>grid-auto-flow</code> or create new properties like <code>grid-lanes-direction</code>. If you’re interested in reading about the options being considered or chime in with your thoughts, see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/12803#issuecomment-3643945412">this discussion</a>.</p>
<p>However, since <code>normal</code> will be the initial value either way, you don’t have to wait for this decision to learn Grid Lanes. When you define only one direction — <code>grid-template-rows</code> <em>or</em> <code>grid-template-columns</code> — it will Just Work™. (If it doesn’t, check if <code>grid-auto-flow</code> is set to a conflicting value. You can<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/unset"><code>unset</code></a> it if needed.)</p>
<h2>Placement sensitivity</h2>
<p>“Tolerance” is a new concept created for Grid Lanes. It lets you adjust just how picky the layout algorithm is when deciding where to place items.</p>
<p>Look at the next drawing. Notice that Car 4 is a tiny bit shorter than Car 1. When the “tolerance” is zero, Car 6 ends up in the right-most lane, while Car 7 is on the left. Car 6 ends up behind Car 4 on the right because that gets it a tiny bit closer “down the road” (closer to the top of the Grid container). Car 7 then takes the next-closest-to-the-top slot, and ends up behind Car 1 on the left. The end result? The first horizontal grouping of content is ordered 1, 2, 3, 4, and the next is 7, 5, 6.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1.png" alt="Same cartoon drawing of the highway of bumper to bumper traffic from above." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-1-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>But the difference in length between Car 1 and Car 4 is tiny. Car 6 isn’t meaningfully closer to the top of the page. And having item 6 on the right, with item 7 on the left is likely an unexpected experience — especially for users who are tabbing through content, or when the content order is somehow labeled.</p>
<p>These tiny differences in size don’t matter in any practical sense. Instead, the browser should consider item sizes like Car 1 and Car 4 to be a tie. That’s why the default for <code>item-tolerance</code> is <code>1em</code> — which means only differences in content length greater than 1 em will matter when figuring out where the next item goes.</p>
<p>If you’d like the layout of items to shuffle around less, you can set a higher value for <code>item-tolerance</code>. In the next digram, the tolerance is set to half-a-car, causing the cars to lay out basically from left to right and only moving to another lane to avoid the extra-long limo. Now, the horizontal groupings of content are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2.png" alt="Now the highway has the cars ordered in a fashion that's less chaotic." width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2.png 1920w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Grid-Lanes-tolerance-2-1536x864.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>Think of tolerance as how chill you want the car drivers to be. Will they change lanes to get just a few inches ahead? Or will they only move if there’s a lot of space in the other lane? The amount of space you want them to care about is the amount you set in <code>item-tolerance</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that people tabbing through the page will see each item highlighted as it comes into focus, and may be experiencing the page through a screenreader. An item tolerance that’s set too high can create an awkward experience jumping up and down the layout. An item tolerance that’s too low can result in jumping back and forth across the layout more than necessary. Adjust <code>item-tolerance</code> to something appropriate for the sizes and size variations of your content.</p>
<p>Currently, this property is named <code>item-tolerance</code> in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-3/#placement-tolerance">specification</a> and in Safari Technology Preview 234. However, there is still a chance this name will change, perhaps to something like <code>flow-tolerance</code> or <code>pack-tolerance</code>. If you have a preference, or ideas for a better name, you can <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10884#issuecomment-3658059682">chime in here</a>. Keep an eye out for updates about the final name before using this property on production websites.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>A few days ago, consumer products company iRobot, the maker of iconic Roomba automated vacuum cleaner, </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/roomba-dream-home-robotics/685293/" rel="">declared bankruptcy</a><span>. The CEO, a branding and mergers expert named </span><a href="https://investor.irobot.com/board-member/gary-cohen" rel="">Gary Cohen</a><span>, sadly announced that the firm could not continue as a going concern. </span></p><p>The board, full of lawyers and financiers but not robotics experts, voted to sell iRobot off to Shenzhen Picea Robotics, the Chinese company to which it had offshored manufacturing. There are about 20 million active Roomba vacuum cleaners in operation, and unless Trump regulators or antitrust enforcers act, now all the data harvested from our homes will go to China.</p><p><span>The co-founder of iRobot, Colin Angle, was not introspective about this collapse, nor did he associate it within the broader context of the many firms who have had their technology transferred to China. Instead, he, like much of Wall Street, </span><a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/irobot-co-founder-says-ftcs-opposition-amazon-deal-wrong-minded-following-bankruptcy-filing" rel="">blamed</a><span> the bankruptcy on Lina Khan. Why? Well she ran the Federal Trade Commission when it investigated Amazon’s possible acquisition of the company in 2022, a deal the two companies ultimately called off. Here’s Angle:</span></p><blockquote><p>“I bet if you asked almost anyone prior to the blocking of the deal with iRobot: Would you rather see iRobot innovating like crazy, coming out with new and better robots for your home, or would you like to see it file for Chapter 11 in the process of being sold to a Chinese manufacturer?” he said. “The wrong thing probably happened.”</p></blockquote><p>Many Wall Street dealmakers and foes of antitrust enforcement echoed this sentiment. For instance, former Obama chief economist Jason Furman, who is now the Aetna Professor of the Practice of Economic Policy at Harvard, used it as an example of the problem with populist economics. Blocking mergers, he believes, leads to destructive outcomes and national security problems.</p><a href="https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/2000680885234925896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-component-name="Twitter2ToDOM"><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/jasonfurman/status/2000680885234925896&quot;,&quot;full_text&quot;:&quot;Regulators in the United States &amp;amp; Europe blocked Amazon's bid to acquire iRobot.\n\niRobot has not filed for bankruptcy and will be acquired by its main creditor, a Chinese company.\n\nThis is not a good outcome from the perspective of consumers, competition or the national interest.&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;jasonfurman&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Jason Furman&quot;,&quot;profile_image_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2025-12-15T21:34:28.000Z&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;reply_count&quot;:0,&quot;retweet_count&quot;:36,&quot;like_count&quot;:347,&quot;impression_count&quot;:0,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:null,&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false}"><div><div title="User"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_40,h_40,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 40w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 80w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_120,h_120,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 120w" sizes="40px"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_40,h_40,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png" sizes="40px" alt="X avatar for @jasonfurman" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_40,h_40,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 40w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_80,h_80,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 80w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!TnFC!,w_120,h_120,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack.com%2Fimg%2Favatars%2Fdefault-light.png 120w" width="40" height="40" draggable="false"></picture></div><p><span>Jason Furman</span><span>@jasonfurman</span></p><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px;" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-width="1.8" stroke="#000" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path stroke="none" fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M13.2879 19.1666L8.66337 12.575L2.87405 19.1666H0.424805L7.57674 11.0258L0.424805 0.833252H6.71309L11.0717 7.04577L16.5327 0.833252H18.982L12.1619 8.59699L19.5762 19.1666H13.2879ZM16.0154 17.3083H14.3665L3.93176 2.69159H5.58092L9.7601 8.54422L10.4828 9.55981L16.0154 17.3083Z"></path></g></svg></div><p>Regulators in the United States &amp; Europe blocked Amazon's bid to acquire iRobot.

iRobot has not filed for bankruptcy and will be acquired by its main creditor, a Chinese company.

This is not a good outcome from the perspective of consumers, competition or the national interest.</p><div><p><span>9:34 PM · Dec 15, 2025</span></p><p><span>36 Reposts</span><span> · </span><span>347 Likes</span></p></div></div></a><p>So is Furman right? This critique matters, because the goal here is to return to the economic statecraft of Bush and Obama, a time when the consensus was that concentrating capital would generate positive outcomes, while restraints on capital would hinder growth. The modest burst of populism around antitrust under Joe Biden deeply shook Furman. With iRobot’s bankruptcy, there is now an opportunity to make the claim that any attempt to restrain Wall Street is a mistake. So what exactly happened with iRobot? And what kinds of lessons should we draw? </p><p><span>I first came upon iRobot years before the Amazon merger, when I edited a </span><a href="https://www.promarket.org/2021/01/28/wall-street-danger-national-security-roomba-hedge-fund/" rel="">piece</a><span> by defense analyst Lucas Kunce on Wall Street and national security. I had gotten interested in the collapse of the defense base, a crisis which is now widely discussed, but at the time wasn’t well-understood. Part of that collapse was a result of a phenomenon where financiers would force technology companies to stop innovating.</span></p><p>iRobot fit perfectly in that story. I watched a 2017 hearing in the House Armed Services Committee where a former Vice Admiral for the Navy, Joe Dyer, testified. After leaving the Navy, Dyer worked in operations at the robotics firm, when the company was far more than a consumer firm focused on importing automated cleaning tools from China. Here’s Kunce:</p><blockquote><p><span>iRobot, which started in 1990 as a spinoff of MIT, was founded by three experts in robotics, artificial intelligence, and man-machine interface. In 1998, the company got </span><a href="http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/Company-Information/History.aspx" rel="">a grant</a><span> from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), </span><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/5-inventions-darpa-gps-irobot-roomba-internet-2017-5" rel="">the government agency that financed the creation of the internet, SIRI, the predecessor to GPS, and other conveniences of modern life</a><span>. Their mission was to build an advanced robot that eventually came to be known as the PackBot. Packbot helped search the rubble after 9/11 and aided US troops in clearing mines in Iraq and Afghanistan. iRobot’s robotic technology has gone to Mars on rovers and was deployed in the Fukushima nuclear reactor meltdown to measure radioactivity. Its iRobot Seaglider was used to peer underwater after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</span></p><p><span>But iRobot no longer makes anything for the military. It now focuses, instead, on branding and manufacturing vacuum cleaners in </span><a href="https://roboticsandautomationnews.com/2020/01/06/irobot-begins-manufacturing-operations-in-malaysia/28231/" rel="">China and Malaysia</a><span>. </span></p></blockquote><p>In the mid-2010s, during Furman’s tenure running economic policy under Obama, the company sold its defense business, offshored production, and slashed research, a result of pressure from financiers on Wall Street.</p><blockquote><p><span>An iRobot shareholder and former Goldman Sachs partner running a hedge fund called Red Mountain Capital, Willem Mesdag, sent </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1159167/000119312515392141/d24166dsc13da1.pdf" rel="">a letter</a><span> demanding that the company sell or shut down every part of its business that didn’t have to do with robots that clean things. </span></p><p><span>He demanded that the company slash its research budget, use the excess cash for dividends, and focus on branding and extending its near-monopoly in automated vacuum cleaners (68 percent of the global market share, according to Mesdag’s letter). Mesdag engaged in a proxy fight to wrest control of the company from its engineering founders, accusing one of its founders and iRobot Chairman Colin Angle of engaging in “egregious and abusive use of shareholder capital” for </span><a href="https://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/01/27/after-12-years-of-roomba-irobot-eyes-startups-for-sector-growth/" rel="">investing in research</a><span>. </span></p><p>Research that, according to an iRobot spokesman, was intended “to spur innovation in robotics and robotics-related areas.” Mesdag argued that the money should have been used for share buybacks to boost the stock value instead of for research…</p><p>“In my trips to Wall Street,” Dyer told the panel, “one of my analyst friends took me to lunch one day and said, ‘Joe, you have to get iRobot out of the defense business. It’s killing your stock price.’ And I countered by saying ‘Well, what about the importance of DARPA and leading-edge technology? What about the stability that sometimes comes from the defense industry? What about patriotism?’ And his response was, ‘Joe, what is it about capitalism you don’t understand?’”</p></blockquote><p><span>This is a sad story, it’s also a common one. China has captured technology and key process leadership from American and European firms, across everything from rare earths to batteries to chemicals to robotics. And the driver is that the American model of running corporations is to focus on “asset light” cream-skimming, which is to say, </span><a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2021/08/the-value-of-nothing-capital-versus-growth/" rel="">focusing</a><span> on lines of business where the return on capital is exceptionally high. </span></p><p><span>Conversely, the Chinese government, to preserve and extend its particular authoritarian model, actually suppresses the return on capital for its financiers, forcing an “asset heavy” approach. They overly emphasize factories and engineering. The net effect of these two complementary forces used to be celebrated as “</span><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/5424112/The-trillion-dollar-question-China-or-America.html" rel="">Chimerica</a><span>,” where China produces and the U.S. consumes. </span></p><p>The consequence of this dynamic is the movement of production from America to China; iRobot is just one example out of many. But there’s another dynamic aside from trade, and that has to do with a peril of market power. Like a lot of firms with seeming dominance, such as Boeing and Intel, iRobot had a big market share, but its operational capacity degraded quickly as financiers forced the company to harvest its monopoly and add nothing back. Under a trade regime overseen by men like Furman, the company offshored production, thus teaching its future rivals in China how to make robot cleaners. </p><p>At any rate, by 2022, iRobot still had a dominant share of robot vacuum cleaners, but competition had become meaningful. </p><p><span>Enter Amazon. In the late 2010s and early 2020s, big tech firms were seeking to dominate the “smart home” market, as well as building out networks around the “internet of things” and cloud computing. Amazon was engaged in a roll-up of the smart home space. It had built out the Alexa audio device, and bought the Ring security/doorbell firm (which had acquired smart lighting firm </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/08/ring-acquires-smart-led-light-company-mr-beams/" rel="">Mr. Beams</a><span>), as well as the wifi firm Eero in 2019, and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22704290/amazon-blink-ring-camera-doorbell-brands-smart-home-why" rel="">video camera firm Blink</a><span>. It was a very expensive strategy; Ring was nearly bankrupt when Amazon overpaid for the company. According to the Wall Street Journal, between 2017 and 2021, Amazon </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-alexa-devices-echo-losses-strategy-25f2581a?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdfXRSaceVjg_5A9Lo_20Wf30Xh_EQyLk1MS7weaLCB8GO5ZiX2ruw8qOupjUk%3D&amp;gaa_ts=694423f0&amp;gaa_sig=4RIOPDy4JL9FJ44zG_mF-QV0SLfN0oBvr8AUTtS9cFI_Xf4cqCc15_p4o1s-DsvLe6PSAHWZWS766CRa7v_vDQ%3D%3D" rel="">lost</a><span> more than $25 billion in losses from its devices business.” </span></p><p><span>But Amazon continued.

In late 2023, the Europeans issued a </span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5990" rel="">preliminary statement of objections</a><span>, which isn’t a formal challenge but a note to Amazon suggesting there might be problems. The EU argued that Amazon might self-preference its robot vacuum cleaners on its ubiquitous marketplace, and thwart competition. </span></p><p><span>The FTC didn’t bring a challenge, but nevertheless, in 2024, Amazon and iRobot </span><a href="https://investor.irobot.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-and-irobot-agree-terminate-pending-acquisition" rel="">called</a><span> off the deal. The FTC issued a vague statement announcing it was pleased with the end of the transaction. “The Commission’s probe focused on Amazon’s ability and incentive to favor its own products and disfavor rivals’,” it </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/01/statement-regarding-termination-amazons-proposed-acquisition-irobot" rel="">wrote</a><span>, “and associated effects on innovation, entry barriers, and consumer privacy. The Commission’s investigation revealed significant concerns about the transaction’s potential competitive effects.” </span></p><p>I don’t know what the FTC found, that’s confidential. But I spoke with a former employee of Ring and Latch who explained Amazon’s monopolization strategy. This person’s view is that Amazon wasn’t trying to dominate the robot vacuum cleaner market for its own sake, but as part of a much bigger plan. With Ring, Eero, Alexa, and iRobot devices, Amazon would have the largest network of consumer internet of things (IoT) devices in the world. Here’s what this person argued about this set of acquisitions:</p><blockquote><p>Amazon wanted Ring for Iotera, a company Ring acquired in late 2017. Iotera built a proprietary protocol for smart devices. Internally, it was known as RingNet, but now it is known as Amazon Sidewalk. Unlike Wifi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, or Z-Wave, Sidewalk requires users to use the Alexa ecosystem. Amazon has grown its Sidewalk network via Alexa and Ring devices sold below cost and acquisitions of companies like Eero and soon, iRobot.</p></blockquote><p>As these devices can connect with each other, they would become the “basis of a physical network connecting devices and sensors all over the world.”  This argument isn’t speculation; my source was the first Ringnet/sidewalk product manager at Ring, directly responsible for integrating Iotera technology into Ring camera, Mr. Beams, and Ring Alarm. This person wrote strategy docs, organized legal/business requirements, and coordinated hardware and software development across all the different units. </p><p><span>There’s also a lot of public evidence.

Amazon is now selling </span><a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/2023/3/amazon-invites-developers-to-test-sidewalk-and-build-the-next-billion-connected-devices" rel="">access</a><span> to Sidewalk to industrial customers, linking access to Sidewalk to its cloud computing service Amazon Web Services. In other words, Amazon was seeking to become the proprietary backbone for any industrial firm who wants to link a device with 90% of America, outside of cellular networks, and that could include maps of most homes and neighborhoods. Amazon spent $25 billion on its device network, and would have been perfectly happy to engage in self-preferencing and predatory pricing of iRobot products to further its aims. </span></p><p>After this acquisition, Amazon would add iRobot’s suite of products and IP to its own portfolio, as well as the rich network and stream of data. But such a merger likely wouldn’t have helped prevent national security problems or kept robotics capacity in the U.S. Amazon is known to be aggressive about ensuring that production happens in China, so it’s almost a certainty manufacturing would continue there, and Chinese firms would likely still come to dominate most non-U.S. and European markets. For Amazon, the goal was the network, not to make robots.</p><p><span>When the deal fell apart, Amazon </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/14/how-irobot-lost-its-way-home/" rel="">paid</a><span> iRobot a $94 million break-up fee, which could be significantly more than the cost of litigating a case, so it is clear the two firms thought the FTC could have challenged it and might have won. After the failed merger, Angle stepped down as CEO, but expressed optimism, saying that “iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better, and that our customers around the world love.”</span></p><p><span>In 2024, when the two firms decided not to move forward with the deal, iRobot hired a “turnaround” specialist named Gary Cohen to run iRobot. The Carlyle Group </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/carlyle-loses-over-100-million-on-soured-loan-to-roomba-maker" rel="">had lent</a><span> $200 million to iRobot to help the company get through the merger, and when that merger fell apart, it </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amazons-abandoned-acquisition-leaves-irobot-carlyle-debt-straightjacket-2024-01-31/" rel="">ended</a><span> up taking nearly 80% of the breakup fee. </span></p><p>Could iRobot have continued as a viable firm? Well Angle publicly said it could, and iRobot executives almost certainly framed it that way to the FTC. Had iRobot truly been insolvent, they could have used a legal argument known as a “failing firm” defense, meaning explaining to regulators they would have gone out of business without a merger. But that would have likely caused Amazon to reduce the price it would have paid to shareholders, including, presumably, the golden parachutes going to the executive team of iRobot. </p><p>By 2025, the board likely concluded that iRobot could never get the high returns on capital that its board of financiers expected. The losing battle with Red Mountain Capital in 2016 had taught Angle not to build robots and innovative products, but to asset strip. When his company actually had to once again build, they threw in the towel. Carlyle sold the remaining debt at a loss to Shenzhen, which then seized the remaining branding and intellectual property. </p><p>There’s an interesting question about whether Shenzhen should be allowed to acquire iRobot, but which involves not only antitrust, but foreign acquisitions and national security. There is a government body that makes such decisions. It’s called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. And CFIUS, which presumably allowed this acquistion, is led by… Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. </p><p>In other words, the story here is Wall Street destroying a promising robotics enterprise through financial engineering, aiding the Chinese in the process, and then demanding a bailout via amnesty from antitrust laws so that shareholders wouldn’t lose any money, while refusing to acknowledge that a key Trump ally of Wall Street facilitated the transfer of the firm to China.</p><p>Of course, this bad faith is routine. None of the critics of antitrust enforcement, including Furman, care if U.S. technology flows to China or if companies fail. They in fact celebrated offshoring when it happened to 90,000 manufacturing plants from 2000 onward, and they often make the point that failure is part of capitalism. But when it comes to one specific company, where they can cherry pick information to make a case against antitrust, well then, all of a sudden iRobot’s bankruptcy is a disaster. </p><p>All that said, there is an important lesson here for anti-monopolists. Antitrust is a useful tool, but it cannot substitute for a broader national economic development strategy. Right now, America, through a whole set of policy choices, from bailouts to government contracts to pro-speculation regulations to attacks on the rights of labor and creators, ensures that financiers get an unfairly high return on capital. We can see the consequences in everything from the collapse of iRobot to the destruction of America’s cattle herd to the erosion of capacity in Hollywood to the financialized AI data center build-out. The business of America right now is extraction, not creation.</p><p>To reverse this strategy, a more assertive antitrust regime is necessary, but it’s not enough. We also have to reduce the many other public levers of support for elevated returns on capital. Only then will it make sense for companies like iRobot to invest in robots instead of share buybacks. </p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

    <p>Hi friends and welcome to the last post for this year! Whenever someone asks me how to get started with reverse engineering, I always give the same advice: buy the cheapest IP camera you can find. These devices are self-contained little ecosystems - they have firmware you can extract, network protocols you can sniff, and mobile apps you can decompile. Chances are, you’ll find something interesting. At worst, you’ll learn a lot about assembly and embedded systems. At best, you’ll find some juicy vulnerability and maybe learn how to exploit it!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/header.jpg" alt="tp-link tapo c200"></p>
<p>I own several TP-Link Tapo C200 cameras myself. They’re cheap (less than 20 EUR from Italy), surprisingly stable, and I genuinely like them - they just work. One weekend, I decided just for fun to take my own advice. The Tapo C200 has been around for a while and has had <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-11936/product_id-83493/Tp-link-Tapo-C200-Firmware.html">a few CVEs</a> discovered and more or less patched over the years, so I honestly wasn’t expecting to find much in the latest firmware. However, I wanted to use this chance to perform some <strong>AI assisted reverse engineering</strong> and test whether I could still find anything at all.</p>
<p>I documented the entire process live on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/channels/1100085665766572142/1396102661257957396">Arcadia</a> - my thought process, the dead ends, the AI prompts that worked and the ones that didn’t. If you want the raw, unfiltered version with screenshots and videos of things crashing, go check that out.</p>
<p>This post is the cleaned-up version of that journey, where I wanted to show how I approach firmware analysis these days, now that we have AI. You will notice that in several instances I will be particularly lazy and delegate to AI things I could have done manually and/or inferred myself after some more work. Keep in mind that while I <em>am</em> generally lazy, this was also an experiment in integrating and documenting how effective AI can be for security research and reverse engineering, and especially in making them accessible to less experienced/sophisticated researchers/attackers.</p>
<p>What started as a lazy weekend project turned into finding a few security vulnerabilities that affect about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zoomeye.ai/searchResult?q=IlRQUkktREVWSUNFIg==">25,000 of these devices directly exposed on the internet</a>.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Old friend <a href="https://java-decompiler.github.io/" target="_blank">JD-GUI</a> to reverse the Android app and get a sense of things
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/" target="_blank">The AWS CLI</a> to download the firmware image.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/ReFirmLabs/binwalk" target="_blank">binwalk</a> for firmware inspection.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://grok.com/" target="_blank">Grok</a> to give a quick AI assisted look into prior research.   
    </li>
</ul>
</small></p><p>The first step is always obtaining the firmware binary file and this time it was super easy! After some <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2017/04/27/Android-Applications-Reversing-101/">basic reversing</a> of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.iot&amp;hl=it">Tapo Android app</a>, I found out that TP-Link have their entire firmware repository in an open S3 bucket. No authentication required. So, you can list and download every version of every firmware they’ve ever released for any device they ever produced:</p>
<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span><br></pre></td><td><pre><span>$ aws s3 ls s3://download.tplinkcloud.com/ --no-sign-request --recursive</span><br></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/bucket_contents.txt">The entire output is here, for the curious</a>. This provides access to the firmware image of every TP-Link device - routers, cameras, smart plugs, you name it. A reverse engineer’s candy store.</p>
<p>I grabbed version <strong>1.4.2 Build 250313 Rel.40499n</strong> for the C200 (Hardware Revision 3), named <code>Tapo_C200v3_en_1.4.2_Build_250313_Rel.40499n_up_boot-signed_1747894968535.bin</code>, and started poking around. However, the first attempt at identifying its format via binwalk was not successful, indicating that some sort of encryption or obfuscation was in place.</p>
<p>And here is where I started using AI. I used Grok to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://x.com/i/grok/share/t9RzvgCRwIluVGnXMu39VVxDx">do some deep research</a> on how to decrypt the firmware for these cameras. Since I knew other hackers worked on this before, I delegated searching into hundreds of relevant web pages to the AI:</p>

<p>Loading Ghidra and giving a quick look at the <code>tp_manage</code> binary, revealed the first interesting thing:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/certs.webp" alt="tp_manage"></p>
<p>This private key is not generated at boot. Similarly to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-1099">CVE-2025-1099 for the C500</a>, the C200 embeds in its firmware the private key that serves the SSL for a few APIs. If you’re on the same network as a camera, you can MitM and decrypt their HTTPS traffic with keys you extracted from the firmware image - without ever touching the hardware. For a <em>security</em> camera streaming video of people’s homes, this is… not ideal.</p>
<p>I kept loading the other interesting binaries and exploring them in Ghidra using AI to quickly get a sense of the main features and possible entry points for an attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Asking AI to explain a function</strong> and its relation to the other functions proved to be very useful for instance to understand encryption / obfuscation routines and network protocol handlers. This allows you to go from here:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/decompiled.webp" alt="decompiled"></p>
<p>To a higher level understanding that the AI can provide:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/udpcrc.webp" alt="udp crc"></p>
<p>Another technique I found particularly effective is asking the AI to analyze a given function of interest and <strong>rename its variables and parameters to something meaningful based on context</strong>. Then do the same for the functions it calls, recursively following the branches you’re interested in. After a few iterations, what started as <code>FUN_0042eb7c(undefined2 *param_1, undefined4 param_2, int param_3)</code> becomes <code>handleConnectAp(connection *conn, int flags, json *params)</code> - and suddenly the decompiled code reads almost like the original source. </p>
<p>This iterative refinement approach, which I find a great example of human-AI collaboration where neither alone would be as efficient, is how I mapped most of the HTTP handlers, discovery protocol, and so on. What follows is the bottom line of my findings. For more details on the process, refer to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://discord.com/channels/1100085665766572142/1396102661257957396">the original Discord thread</a>.</p>
<p>As a side note, I did not investigate (much) the exploitability of the following bugs to achieve code execution, mostly because I’m not familiar with MIPS, and it was not my intent. You can however do it relatively easily once <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.hacefresko.com/posts/tp-link-tapo-c200-unauthenticated-rce">obtained a shell via physical access</a>, due to the presence of the <code>/bin/gdbserver</code> binary in the firmware.</p>

The problem is in how it parses SOAP XML requests.</p>
<p>When processing XML elements, the parser (<code>soap_parse_and_validate_request</code> at <code>0x0045ae8c</code>) calls <code>ds_parse</code> without any bounds checking on the number of elements or total memory allocation. Send it enough XML elements, and you’ll overflow allocated memory.</p>

<p>A test on one of the devices exposed on the internet:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.evilsocket.net/images/2025/tapo/aps.png" alt="aps"></p>
<p>This is particularly concerning given the number of these devices exposed on the internet. An attacker can remotely enumerate WiFi networks in the camera’s vicinity, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSIDs</strong> of nearby networks</li>
<li><strong>BSSIDs</strong> (MAC addresses of access points)</li>
<li><strong>Signal strength</strong> (useful for triangulation)</li>
<li><strong>Security configurations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s where it gets worse: tools like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/darkosancanin/apple_bssid_locator">apple_bssid_locator</a> can query Apple’s location services API with a BSSID and return precise GPS coordinates.</p>
<p>This means an attacker can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an exposed Tapo camera via services like ZoomEye, Shodan or similar indexes</li>
<li>Use <code>scanApList</code> to retrieve nearby WiFi BSSIDs</li>
<li>Query Apple’s location database with those BSSIDs</li>
<li><strong>Pinpoint the camera’s physical location to within a few meters</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Remote attackers can not only see what WiFi networks exist around a camera - they can determine exactly where that camera (and by extension, the home or business it’s monitoring) is located on a map.</p>

This means they have the authority to assign CVE identifiers for vulnerabilities in their own products - at least for the ones reported directly to them. And they <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tp-link.com/it/press/security-advisory/">actively encourage responsible disclosure directly to their security team</a>, which means they control a considerable pipeline of vulnerability reports.</p>
<p>On their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/landing/security-commitment/">Security Commitment page</a>, TP-Link prominently displays charts comparing their CVE count to competitors. They explicitly market themselves as having fewer CVEs than Cisco, Netgear, and D-Link. They state they “aim to patch vulnerabilities within 90 days.”</p>
<p>There’s an obvious and structural conflict of interest when a vendor is allowed to be their own CNA while simultaneously using their CVE count as a marketing metric.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploum">Ploum</a> on 2025-12-19</p>
<p>You probably heard about the Wall Street Journal story where they had a snack-vending machine run by a chatbot created by Anthropic.</p>
<p>At first glance, it is funny and it looks like journalists doing their job criticising the AI industry. If you are curious, the video is there (requires JS).</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/anthropic-claude-ai-vending-machine-agent-b7e84e34">We Let AI Run Our Office Vending Machine. It Lost Hundreds of Dollars.(www.wsj.com)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But what appears to be journalism is, in fact, pure advertising. For both WSJ and Anthropic. Look at how WSJ journalists are presented as "world class", how no-subtle the Anthropic guy is when telling them they are the best and how the journalist blush at it. If you are taking the story at face value, you are failing for the trap which is simple: "AI is not really good but funny, we must improve it."</p>
<p>The first thing that blew my mind was how stupid the whole idea is. Think for one second. One full second. Why do you ever want to add a chatbot to a snack vending machine? The video states it clearly: the vending machine must be stocked by humans. Customers must order and take their snack by themselves. The AI has no value at all.</p>
<p>Automated snack vending machine is a solved problem since nearly a century. Why do you want to make your vending machine more expensive, more error-prone, more fragile and less efficient for your customers?</p>
<p>What this video is really doing is normalising the fact that "even if it is completely stupid, AI will be everywhere, get used to it!"</p>
<p>The Anthropic guy himself doesn’t seem to believe his own lies, to the point of making me uncomfortable. Toward the ends, he even tries to warn us: "Claude AI could run your business but you don’t want to come one day and see you have been locked out." At which the journalist adds, "Or has ordered 100 PlayStations."</p>
<p>And then he gives up:</p>
<p>"Well, the best you can do is probably prepare for that world."</p>
<figure>
<a href="https://ploum.net/files/prepareworld.png"><img alt="Still from the video where Anthropic’s employee says &quot;probably prepare for that world&quot;" src="https://ploum.net/files/prepareworld.png" width="450"></a>
<figcaption>Still from the video where Anthropic’s employee says "probably prepare for that world"</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>None of the world class journalists seemed to care. They are probably too badly paid for that. I was astonished to see how proud they were, having spent literally hours chatting with a bot just to get a free coke, even queuing for the privilege of having a free coke. A coke that cost a few minutes of minimum-wage work.</p>
<p>So the whole thing is advertising a world where chatbots will be everywhere and where world-class workers will do long queue just to get a free soda.</p>
<p>And the best advice about it is that you should probably prepare for that world.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-529044">

				


				


				<h3>from the <i>mission-accomplished!</i> dept</h3>
				


				<p>There were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/09/17/tiktok-to-be-sold-to-trumps-right-wing-billionaire-buddies-and-converted-into-a-propaganda-mill/">rumblings about this for a while</a>, but it looks like the Trump TikTok deal is done, and it’s somehow the <em>worst of all possible outcomes</em>, amazingly making all of the <em>biggest criticisms about TikTok significantly worse</em>. Quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has signed off on the deal, which involves offloading a large chunk of TikTok to billionaire <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/tiktok-sale-done-oracle-silver-lake-buyers-1236454493/">right wing Trump ally Larry Ellison</a> (fresh off his acquisition of CBS), the private equity firm Silver Lake (which has broad global investments in Chinese and Israeli hyper-surveillance), and MGX (Abu Dhabi’s state investment firm), while still somehow having large investment involvement by the Chinese:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The new U.S. operations of TikTok will have three “managing investors” that will collectively own 45 percent of the company: Oracle Corporation, Silver Lake, and MGX. Another 5 percent will be owned by other new investors, 30.1 percent will be “held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9 percent will be retained by ByteDance.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s also a smattering 5% of investors that may or may not include folks like right wing media mogul Rupert Murdoch. It’s worth noting that none of this was really legal; the law technically stated that TikTok shouldn’t have been allowed to exist for much of this year. Everyone just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/822164/tiktok-deal-trump-china">looked the other way while Trump and his cronies repeatedly ignored deadlines and hammered away at the transfer</a>. </p>
<p>The deal purportedly involves “retraining the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data to ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation,” but given you can’t trust any of the companies involved, the Trump administration, or what’s left of U.S. regulators, that means absolutely nothing. Oracle will be “overseeing data protection,” but that means nothing as well given Oracle is run by an authoritarian-enabling billionaire with a <a href="https://nationalcioreview.com/articles-insights/extra-bytes/oracle-pays-115m-to-settle-massive-privacy-lawsuit/">long history</a> of his own <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/class-action-against-oracle/">privacy abuses</a>.</p>
<p>Also, this seems to ignore that three years ago, during the Biden administration, it was already announced that <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/08/18/oracle-now-reviewing-tiktok-algorithms-and-content-moderation-practices/">Oracle was overseeing TikTok’s algorithms and data protection</a>. It’s kinda weird that everyone seems to have forgotten that. This is all, more or less, what was already agreed to years ago. Just shifting around the ownership structure to give Trump and his friends a “win.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t subtle that the goal was always for Trump’s buddies to just basically steal a big ownership chunk of a Chinese short form video company that U.S. tech companies <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/31/facebook-hired-pr-firm-coordinated-anti-tiktok-campaign-to-spread-bogus-moral-panics/">couldn’t out innovate</a>. Offloading the company to his friends at Oracle and Walmart was Trump’s stated goal during the first administration, only thwarted <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/02/10/trump-oracles-dumb-tiktok-cronyism-falls-apart/">because he lost the 2020 election</a>. Everything else was decorative. </p>
<p>You might recall that Democrats made a point to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2024/03/15/a-tiktok-ban-is-a-pointless-political-turd-for-democrats/">join forces with Republicans during election season</a> in support of a ban unless a big chunk of ownership was divested. Now that it’s happened, it’s basically shifting ownership of TikTok to a huge chunk of Trump’s authoritarian allies, while somehow still maintaining the supposed problematic tethers to the Chinese? Impressive. Great job. </p>
<p>You might also recall that folks like Brendan Carr spent literally <strong>years</strong> whining about the propaganda, privacy, and surveillance threats posed by TikTok. And their solution was ultimately just to shift a small part of ownership over to Trump’s autocratic buddies <em>while still retaining Chinese involvement</em>. Now, with the problem <strong>made worse</strong>, you can easily assume that Carr <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/11/02/fcc-commissioner-brendan-carr-still-doesnt-understand-that-banning-tiktok-doesnt-fix-the-actual-problem/">will probably never mention the threat again</a>. </p>
<p>Republicans obviously take majority responsibility for this turd of a deal and the corrupt shifting of TikTok ownership to Trump’s buddies. But <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/the-tiktok-ban-continues-to-be-one-of-the-biggest-turds-in-tech-policy-history/">it can’t be overstated what an own-goal supporting this whole dumb thing was for Democrats</a>, who not only helped Trump’s friends steal partial ownership of TikTok, they saber-rattled over a ban during an election season where they desperately needed young people to vote. </p>
<p>As I’ve <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/11/20/the-tiktok-ban-continues-to-be-one-of-the-biggest-turds-in-tech-policy-history/">spent years arguing</a>, if these folks were all so concerned about U.S. consumer privacy, they should have passed a functional modern internet privacy law applying to all U.S. companies and their executives. </p>
<p>If they cared about propaganda, they could have fought media consolidation, backed creative media literacy reform in schools, or found new ways to fund independent journalism. </p>
<p>If they cared about national security, they wouldn’t have helped elect a New York City real estate conman sex pest President, and they certainly wouldn’t have <em>actively aided his cronyism</em>. </p>
<p>This was never about addressing privacy, propaganda, or national security. It was always about the U.S. stealing ownership of one of the most popular and successful short form video apps in history because companies like Facebook were <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/03/31/facebook-hired-pr-firm-coordinated-anti-tiktok-campaign-to-spread-bogus-moral-panics/">too innovatively incompetent to dethrone them</a> in the open market. Ultimately this bipartisan accomplishment not only makes everything worse, it demonstrates we’re absolutely no better than the countries we criticize.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I’m thrilled to announce that Graphite has signed a definitive agreement to join <a target="_blank" href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a>. This deal brings together the best-in-class tools for creating, reviewing, and merging code in the age of AI. Graphite will continue to operate as an independent product, now with even greater resources to help our customers ship faster.</p><h3 id="defining-the-new-developer-toolchain">Defining the new developer toolchain</h3><p>Tomas, Greg, and I started building Graphite almost five years ago because the world’s best engineering teams demanded a better code review platform. What we never expected was how dramatically tools like Cursor would transform our industry, empowering engineers to build features in hours or minutes that would have typically taken days or weeks without AI. Previously, we were limited by how quickly we could write code, but now the bottleneck is how quickly we can review it. Leading engineering orgs like Shopify, Snowflake, Robinhood, Figma, and Ramp have realized that the age of AI demands an entirely new developer toolchain, and these companies have turned to Graphite to help them review and merge code at the new speed of creation.</p><p>Listening to our customers’ journeys of AI adoption has helped us sharpen and refine our ultimate vision for Graphite: one integrated platform where humans and agents create, review, and merge code changes collaboratively. A future where PRs become self-driving, where the inner and outer loops collapse into one iterative process, and where speed and quality are no longer at odds. But realizing that vision required deep integrations with the tools our customers use to generate code, and, naturally, Cursor was our first stop.</p><h3 id="why-cursor">Why Cursor</h3><p>From our first conversations with the Cursor team, we were deeply impressed by their thoughtfulness, ambition, and craft. We quickly found that we had a lot more in common than just our largest customers and investors; we shared both a nearly identical vision for the future of software development and set of values around talent density, urgency, and craft. An acquisition wasn’t on our radar; Graphite’s growth curve, product, and team are stronger than ever, and the future of code review has never been more exciting.</p><p>We chose to join forces with Cursor because of the opportunity to create something phenomenal together: the end-to-end platform for building with AI.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way developers write code looks different than it did a few years ago. But reviewing those changes, merging them safely, and collaborating on them has increasingly become the bottleneck for building production-grade software.</p>
<p>The team at <a href="https://graphite.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Graphite</a> has spent the past few years thinking deeply about these workflows and have built a code review platform used by hundreds of thousands of engineers at top engineering organizations. The boundary between where you write code and where you collaborate on it feels increasingly arbitrary, and there's a lot we think we can build by collapsing that distance.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that Graphite has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Cursor.</p>
<p>Graphite will continue to operate independently with the same team and product. Over the coming months, we'll explore connecting the two products in ways that we hope will feel natural: tighter integrations between local development and pull requests, smarter code review that learns from both systems, and some more radical ideas we can't share just yet.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Anthropic’s AI agent was the <a href="https://bun.com/blog/bun-joins-anthropic">most prolific code contributor to Bun’s GitHub repository, submitting more merged pull requests than any human developer</a>. Then Anthropic paid millions to acquire the human team anyway. The code was MIT-licensed; they could have forked it for free. Instead, they bought the people.</p>
<hr>
<p>Everyone’s heard the line: <strong>“AI will write all the code</strong>; engineering as you know it is finished.”</p>
<p>Boards repeat it. CFOs love it. Some CTOs quietly use it to justify hiring freezes and stalled promotion paths.</p>
<p>The Bun acquisition <strong>blows a hole in that story</strong>.</p>
<p>Here’s a team whose project was open source, whose most active contributor was an AI agent, whose code Anthropic legally could have copied overnight. No negotiations. No equity. No retention packages.</p>
<p>Anthropic still fought competitors for the right to buy that group.</p>
<p>Publicly, AI companies talk like engineering is being automated away. Privately, they deploy millions of dollars to acquire engineers who already work with AI at full tilt. That contradiction is not a PR mistake. It is a <em>signal</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The key constraint is obvious once you say it out loud. <strong>The bottleneck isn’t code production, it is <em>judgment</em>.</strong></p>
<p>Anthropic’s own announcement barely talked about Bun’s existing codebase. It praised the team’s ability to <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-acquires-bun-as-claude-code-reaches-usd1b-milestone">rethink the JavaScript toolchain “from first principles”</a>.</p>
<p>That’s investor-speak for: we’re paying for how these people think, what they choose not to build, which tradeoffs they make under pressure. They didn’t buy a pile of code. They bought a track record of correct calls in a complex, fast-moving domain.</p>
<p>AI drastically increases the volume of code you can generate. It does almost nothing to increase your supply of people who know which ten lines matter, which pull request should never ship, and which “clever” optimization will explode your latency or your reliability six months from now.</p>
<p>So when Anthropic’s own AI tops the contribution charts and they still decide the scarce asset is the human team, pay attention. <strong>That’s revealed preference.</strong></p>
<p>Leaders don’t express their true beliefs in blog posts or conference quotes. They express them in hiring plans, acquisition targets, and compensation bands. If you want to understand what AI companies actually believe about engineering, <strong>follow the cap table, not the keynote.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>So what do you do with this as a technical leader?</p>
<p>Stop using AI as an excuse to devalue your best knowledge workers. Use it to give them more leverage.</p>
<p>Treat AI as force multiplication for your highest-judgment people. The ones who can design systems, navigate ambiguity, shape strategy, and smell risk before it hits. They’ll use AI to move faster, explore more options, and harden their decisions with better data.</p>
<p>Double down on developing judgment, not just syntax speed: architecture, performance modeling, incident response, security thinking, operational literacy. The skills Anthropic implicitly paid for when it bought a team famous for rethinking the stack, not just writing another bundler.</p>
<p>Be careful about starving your junior pipeline based on “coding is over” narratives. As AI pushes routine work down, the gap between senior and everyone else widens. Companies that maintain a healthy apprenticeship ladder will own the next generation of high-judgment engineers while everyone else hunts the same shrinking senior pool at auction.</p>
<p>Most important: <strong>calibrate your strategy to revealed preferences</strong>, not marketing copy. When someone’s AI writes more code than their engineers but they still pay millions for the engineers, believe the transaction, not the tweet.</p>

<p dir="auto">In total, $750,000 has been committed to a program of work to improve the experience of laptop users who run FreeBSD.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How long is this program due to run?</h3><a id="user-content-how-long-is-this-program-due-to-run" aria-label="Permalink: How long is this program due to run?" href="#how-long-is-this-program-due-to-run"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The program will start in Q4, 2024 and will likely run for 1-2 years.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How was the scope of the work decided?</h3><a id="user-content-how-was-the-scope-of-the-work-decided" aria-label="Permalink: How was the scope of the work decided?" href="#how-was-the-scope-of-the-work-decided"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The high-level scope was outlined by the FreeBSD Foundation with input from the community, including users such as program co-funder, Quantum Leap Research, and from laptop vendors including Dell, AMD and Framework.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What exactly is covered in the planned work?</h3><a id="user-content-what-exactly-is-covered-in-the-planned-work" aria-label="Permalink: What exactly is covered in the planned work?" href="#what-exactly-is-covered-in-the-planned-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The scope will be unpacked month by month as we make progress, focusing on where the most high-value functionality can be achieved with the resources and support that we have available. Our roadmap will contain work items that are candidates for future months.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Are the dates on the roadmap guaranteed?</h3><a id="user-content-are-the-dates-on-the-roadmap-guaranteed" aria-label="Permalink: Are the dates on the roadmap guaranteed?" href="#are-the-dates-on-the-roadmap-guaranteed"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">No, these are high-level placeholders to help us visualise our intended order of work and to help share our plans with the community. The actual date of delivery on any item will be subject to change based on project progress and other factors.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who will be doing the work?</h3><a id="user-content-who-will-be-doing-the-work" aria-label="Permalink: Who will be doing the work?" href="#who-will-be-doing-the-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Foundation will be managing staff and a group of contracted FreeBSD developers to work on different functional areas to deliver regular updates to the laptop experience.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How can I share my views on what would make the laptop experience better?</h3></p>
<p dir="auto">The FreeBSD community hosts a <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/LaptopDesktopWorkingGroup" rel="nofollow">Laptop and Desktop Working Group</a> where all interested parties can share their experiences, work in progress, and offer and receive help and support. You can also <a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/subscription/freebsd-desktop" rel="nofollow">join the Desktop mailing list</a> for more general updates. At present there is not a dedicated Laptop mailing list, this may change if there is community support for it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who is the target user for the functionality being delivered?</h3><a id="user-content-who-is-the-target-user-for-the-functionality-being-delivered" aria-label="Permalink: Who is the target user for the functionality being delivered?" href="#who-is-the-target-user-for-the-functionality-being-delivered"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Our target user is developers. However, we hope to be able to improve the experience for all users by reducing the need to "go under the hood" to set up, manage, and use FreeBSD on a laptop.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Are desktop users being considered as part of this work?</h3><a id="user-content-are-desktop-users-being-considered-as-part-of-this-work" aria-label="Permalink: Are desktop users being considered as part of this work?" href="#are-desktop-users-being-considered-as-part-of-this-work"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Broadly speaking this work is focused on laptop user experience. However, many of the areas that apply to laptops will also benefit the desktop user experience. We recommend engaging with the Laptop and Desktop Working Group to advocate for any desktop-specific work items.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Is overall UX being considered, or is it mainly just technical updates?</h3><a id="user-content-is-overall-ux-being-considered-or-is-it-mainly-just-technical-updates" aria-label="Permalink: Is overall UX being considered, or is it mainly just technical updates?" href="#is-overall-ux-being-considered-or-is-it-mainly-just-technical-updates"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We are mindful that UX is an important part of making FreeBSD functional and enjoyable for laptop users. We are framing the work as “<a href="https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories" rel="nofollow">user stories</a>” that describe what a user wants to be able to accomplish and why. This is a user-focused approach to defining functional requirements.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How can I keep up to date with the work in progress and any new releases?</h3><a id="user-content-how-can-i-keep-up-to-date-with-the-work-in-progress-and-any-new-releases" aria-label="Permalink: How can I keep up to date with the work in progress and any new releases?" href="#how-can-i-keep-up-to-date-with-the-work-in-progress-and-any-new-releases"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are several ways to keep yourself in the loop.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Some stats and details</h2>

<ul>
<li>9 hours and 42 minutes of footage</li>
<li>52 mixer channels</li>
<li>13 neck- and bowties</li>
<li>9 different instruments</li>
<li>1 crazy automaton</li>
<li>0 regrets</li>
</ul>

<p>This project took me a bit over half a year to finish.</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy the video as much as I enjoyed making it! There are many
little details that I'll let you discover on your own.</p><p><a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/bolero/automaton-large.jpg"><img src="https://linusakesson.net/music/bolero/automaton-small.jpg"></a></p>

<p>It was fun to put my tools and methods to the test with this huge
undertaking. When I started out I had no idea if my mixing and video-editing
process would work at this scale, but it turned out to only need a few tweaks
here and there.</p>

<p>The nine instruments are: The <a href="https://linusakesson.net/qweremin/index.php">Qweremin</a> (breadbin / regular&nbsp;C64C
/ dark&nbsp;C64C), <a href="https://linusakesson.net/software/qwertuoso/index.php">Qwertuoso</a>
(breadbin), the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/paulimba/index.php">Paulimba</a>, the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/tenor.php">Tenor&nbsp;Commodordion</a>, the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/family-bass/index.php">Family&nbsp;Bass</a> (albeit not as a bass
this time), my still unnamed <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/partita-prelude/index.php">floppy-drive noise instrument</a> (1541
/ 1541-II), the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/music/glyptodont-live/index.php">C=TAR</a>, the <a href="https://linusakesson.net/chipophone/index.php">Chipophone</a>, and a newcomer: NES timpani.</p>

<p>The timpani sound is based on the famous NES staircase triangle wave. But
there is no register for controlling its volume, and yet we can hear an
envelope with a release phase. To achieve this, I rely on a neat trick that was
used already in Super Mario Bros.: It turns out that the triangle channel is
mixed with the ADPCM sample-playback channel and then fed through a non-linear
resistor network (the output is proportional to ((adpcm&nbsp;+&nbsp;triangle)⁻¹
+ C)⁻¹). Therefore, adding a constant DC offset via the sample channel makes
the triangle more or less compressed.</p>

<p>In nearly every part of this video, what you see is what you hear; the audio
and video were recorded at the same time. But the automaton is different:
Thanks to its 100% repeatable performance I could capture the sound of each
individual section of the hardware, with the microphone up close, and then mix
the parts according to taste and combine them with the visuals from a separate
take.</p>

<p>Fun fact: You can't see it in the video but the automaton is supported by
original C64 boxes:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/announcing-gotatun-the-future-of-wireguard-at-mullvad-vpn">https://mullvad.net/en/blog/announcing-gotatun-the-future-of-wireguard-at-mullvad-vpn</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46324543">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p><a href="https://github.com/mullvad/gotatun" rel="nofollow">GotaTun</a> is a WireGuard® implementation written in Rust aimed at being fast, efficient and reliable.</p>
<p>GotaTun is a fork of the <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/boringtun" rel="nofollow">BoringTun</a> project from Cloudflare. This is not a new protocol or connection method, just WireGuard® written in <a href="https://rust-lang.org/" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>. The name GotaTun is a combination of the original project, BoringTun, and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6tatunneln" rel="nofollow">Götatunneln</a>, a physical tunnel located in Gothenburg. We have integrated privacy enhancing features like <a href="https://mullvad.net/vpn/daita">DAITA</a> &amp; <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/multihop-wireguard">Multihop</a>, added first-class support for Android and used Rust to achieve great performance by using safe multi-threading and <a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-copy" rel="nofollow">zero-copy</a> memory strategies.</p>
<p>Last month we rolled it out to all our Android users, and we aim to ship it to the remaining platforms next year.</p>
<h2>Why GotaTun?</h2>
<p>Our mobile apps have relied on wireguard-go for several years, a cross-platform userspace implementation of WireGuard® in Go. wireguard-go has been the de-facto userspace implementation of WireGuard® to this date, and many VPN providers besides Mullvad use it. Since mid-2024 we have been maintaining a fork of <br>wireguard-go to support features like DAITA &amp; Multihop. While wireguard-go has served its purpose for many years it has not been without its challenges.</p>
<p>For Android apps distributed via the Google Play Store, Google collects crash reports and makes them available to developers. In the developer console we have seen that more than 85% of all crashes reported have stemmed from the wireguard-go. We have managed to solve some of the obscure issues over the years (<a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/6727" rel="nofollow">#6727</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/pull/7728" rel="nofollow">#7728</a> to name two examples), but many still remain. For these reasons we chose Android as the first platform to release GotaTun on, allowing us to see the impact right away.</p>
<p>Another challenge we have faced is interoperating Rust and Go. Currently, most of the service components of the Mullvad VPN app are written in Rust with the exception of wireguard-go. Crossing the boundary between Rust and Go is done using a&nbsp;<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface" rel="nofollow">foreign function interface</a> (FFI), which is inherently unsafe and complex. Since Go is a managed language with its own separate runtime, how it executes is opaque to the Rust code. If wireguard-go were to hang or crash, recovering stacktraces is not always possible which makes debugging the code cumbersome. Limited visibility insight into crashes stemming from Go has made troubleshooting and long-term maintenance tedious.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The impact has been immediate. So far not a single crash has stemmed from GotaTun, meaning that all our old crashes from wireguard-go are now gone. Since rolling out GotaTun on Android with version 2025.10 in the end of November we’ve seen a big drop in the metric <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/crash#android-vitals" rel="nofollow">user-perceived crash rate</a>, from 0.40% to 0.01%, when comparing to previous releases. The feedback from users' have also been positive, with reports of better speeds and lower battery usage.</p>
<p><img src="https://mullvad.net/media/uploads/2025/gotatun.png" alt="" width="640" height="293"></p>
<p><em>User-perceived crash rate</em></p>
<h3>Looking ahead</h3>
<p>We’ve reached the first major milestone with the release of GotaTun on Android, but we have a lot more exciting things in store for 2026.</p>
<ul>
<li>A third-party security audit will take place early next year.</li>
<li>We will replace wireguard-go&nbsp;with GotaTun across all platforms, including desktop and iOS.</li>
<li>More effort will be put into improving performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you are as excited as we are for 2026!</p><!----></div></div>]]></description>

            <guid>46322732</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:10:02 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://design.google/library/google-sans-flex-font">https://design.google/library/google-sans-flex-font</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46322732">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>When Google Sans rolled out in 2018, designers were initially ecstatic. “It meant we could finally use typography for a stronger brand statement,” recalls UX Designer Miche Alvarez. “But it also created a dual-font system using Google Sans for larger display text and Roboto for smaller text. It ended up being a compromise.”</p>
<p>Designers fought for a Google Sans version that would work at smaller sizes. So the team collaborated with designers in Search and at Colophon Foundry to refine the font, ultimately launching Google Sans Text (GST) in 2020.</p>
<p>Unlike the geometric Google Sans, the characters in Google Sans Text are taller, more condensed, and less circular. The typeface also includes more spacing between characters to aid readability. The numerals are less geometric, and the angled cuts on terminals are less severe, creating a more uniform and readable experience, even at small sizes. It was also designed to match the proportions of Roboto, Android’s default typeface, to make switching from Roboto a smoother process.</p>
<p>Google Sans Text rolled out on the Pixel 3, creating a more unified typographic experience.</p></div><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>Google Sans Mono was created in 2020 to support contexts that needed fixed-width characters for editorial design, at medium and large text sizes. Despite this, it soon got its first big product integration, replacing Roboto Mono in Google Chat. The only problem? Developers hated it.</p>
<p>Because the font wasn’t intended to be used at smaller sizes, the letterforms weren’t legible. It was especially difficult to tell the a and o apart. “That can actually be catastrophic for code,” says Tobias Kunisch. “One misplaced character can break an entire program.”</p>
<p>Recognizing this critical need, a dedicated effort was launched to craft Google Sans Code, a monospaced typeface specifically designed to make code more readable. This involved thorough research into the 20 most common programming languages and how developers interact with code, aiming to make the new coding typeface more visually appealing while reducing the ambiguity of similar-looking letterforms. Based on these insights, Google tasked the <a target="_blank" aria-label="Universal Thirst (opens in a new tab or window)" data-link-style="default" href="https://universalthirst.com/">Universal Thirst</a>  foundry to meticulously focus on specific letters, numbers, and operators to meet these requirements. The result is an eminently readable and surprisingly playful typeface.</p>
<p>Google Sans Code launched as an open-source font in 2025, and is the typeface used to display code in <a target="_blank" aria-label="Gemini (opens in a new tab or window)" data-link-style="default" href="https://gemini.google.com/">Gemini</a>.</p></div><div data-y-start="20" data-testid="column" data-link-style="default"><p>The story of Google Sans is a masterclass in need-based design — it was created not by a single flash of inspiration, but a thoughtful, human-centered evolution. Each problem, from misaligned lockups to illegible code, revealed an unmet need and ultimately led to innovation and improved user experience.</p>
<p>By making Google Sans Flex open-source, we’re extending that commitment beyond our walls. It’s an invitation to designers and developers worldwide: Use these tools, contribute to their growth, and together, let’s build clearer, more accessible, and more beautiful digital experiences for everyone. With your help, we can shape a more legible future, one character at a time.</p>

You don’t need to change your campaign in order to be eligible for any new positions. Your ad will run in either the existing position — at the top of search results — or further down in search results. If you have a search results campaign running, your ad will be automatically eligible for all available positions, but you can’t select or bid for a particular one.
</p><p>
The ad format will be the same in any position, using a default product page or custom product page, and an optional deep link. You’ll be billed as usual based on your pricing model: cost per tap or cost per install.</p></div>

Whether a search results ad displays over other advertisers bidding on that same query is determined by a combination of factors, including your app’s relevance to the search query and the amount of your&nbsp;keyword bid.

      <p>I recently came into possession of an old Dell Precision T3610 workstation and promptly installed Proxmox to
add it to my Proxmox cluster. After performing some ludicrously silly RAM and storage upgrades (how about 96
GB of DDR3, plus a 13-disk array of 500 GB SSDs?), I decided I wanted to max out the CPU as well.</p>
<p>The Precision T3610 shipped with an <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/75780/intel-xeon-processor-e51650-v2-12m-cache-3-50-ghz/specifications.html">Intel Xeon E5-1650 v2</a>.
According to the linked Intel product page, this CPU uses the FCLGA2011 socket. <em>Easy enough,</em> I thought to
myself. <em>Just find the best CPU that supports FCLGA2011, make sure you have the latest BIOS installed, and
everything should be all hunky dory.</em> So I did some research and landed on the
<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/93790/intel-xeon-processor-e78890-v4-60m-cache-2-20-ghz/specifications.html">Xeon E7-8890 v4</a>.
It’s several years newer than the E5-1650 v2, has a whopping 24 cores (and hyperthreading bumps it to 48 logical
cores!), and can support having not one, not two, but <em>eight</em> of itself installed in a single motherboard! Most
crucially, the Intel product page says it uses the FCLGA2011 socket. When I stumbled across one of these monsters
on eBay for just $15, I snapped it up.</p>
<p>Cue my massive shock and disappointment when, a few days later, I found myself unable to install the E7-8890 v4
in my T3610. The new CPU, despite being the same physical size as the old CPU, had extra contacts on the bottom
and had a different physical keying. What? I thought Intel said this was the same socket!</p>
<p>Some amount of research later, I discovered that Intel’s LGA2011 socket has many variations. One of these
variations is also called Socket R (or LGA2011-0). The T3610, and by extension the old E5-1650 v2 CPU, uses
Socket R. The newer E7-8890 v4, meanwhile, uses a different variation called Socket R2 (or LGA2011-1). As if
this wasn’t confusing enough, there’s even a third variation of the LGA2011 socket! I’ll refer you to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA_2011#Physical_design_and_socket_generations">Wikipedia</a> page for more info
on that.</p>
<p>This is obviously not a great naming scheme. Why not use unique numbers for each version of the socket instead of
tacking on a suffix? But the real kicker here is that Intel itself doesn’t seem to be able to keep up with its own
naming scheme! It appears that its CPU specifications pages refer to all variants of the LGA2011 socket as
FCLGA2011. This leaves folks like myself wondering what went wrong when their new-to-them CPUs don’t fit in their
motherboards.</p>
<p>So where does that leave me? Well, I now have a fancy paperweight. I could have returned the CPU, but return
shipping costs would have been half of what I paid for the CPU itself, so I’m hanging onto it for now in case I
ever come into possession of a server with a Socket R2 motherboard that could use a nicer CPU. At least it wasn’t
a super expensive CPU, so all in all, this isn’t the worst learning experience ever.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's not quite Christmas time yet, but since these are the days of Keen's 35th anniversary, I thought it was a good opportunity to finally release this to the public:</p><p>

<strong><a href="https://k1n9duk3.shikadi.net/files/modding/keensource123.zip">Reconstructed Commander Keen 1-3 Source Code</a></strong>  <img src="https://pckf.com/images/smilies/emotikeen-birthday.gif" width="70" height="24" alt=":birthday" title="Happy Birthday"></p><p>

This package contains full source code for all versions of Keen 1-3 that I know, from the November 1990 beta version of Keen 1 to the relatively obscure Precision Software Applications release (version 1.34). Compiling the source code with the correct compiler and assembler versions and compressing the resulting executables with LZEXE or PKLITE (if necessary) generates executables that are 100% identical to the original files.</p><p>

You will need Turbo C++ 1.00 (<strong>not</strong> 1.01!) and Turbo Assembler (2.0 or above) to compile exact copies of most versions of Keen 1-3 (versions 1.31 and earlier). The later special releases (the "pre-registered" Gravis version 1.32 and the PSA release version 1.34) require Borland C++ 2.0 for a fully identical copy.</p><p>

---</p><p>

If you have read the timeline.txt file I released along with my <a href="https://pckf.com/viewtopic.php?p=111897#p111897">Reconstructed BioMenace Source Code</a> last year, you might have noticed an entry that said "got side-tracked revisiting another old project". This is that project.</p><p>

Most of the Keen 1-3 code reconstruction was done back in early 2021, before I started preparing my reconstructed Keen 4-6 source code for release. The big problem that prevented me from getting my Keen 1-3 code to compile and compress into 100% identical copies of the original executables was the fact that I didn't have access to the right compiler back then. I only had Turbo C++ 1.01, which generates slightly different code than Turbo C++ 1.00. It was impossible to get Turbo C++ 1.01 to produce the code that I needed.</p><p>

Another contributing factor is that the order of the uninitialized variables in the so-called BSS segment depends on the names of the variables when using Turbo C++ 1.x to compile the code. And since some of these variables need to be accessed from within the assembly code, I couldn't simply group the variables into a struct like I did elsewhere. I had to find names that would allow the variables to appear in the correct order. So after some trial and error, I wrote a small throw-away program that generated a bunch of variables with random names and ran that list of variables through the Turbo C++ compiler. Disassembling the generated .OBJ file showed me which order these variable names would produce, so all I had left to do was to let the compiler (and the assembler) rename the variables internally. This is done in the BSSCHEAT.H and BSSCHEAT.EQU files.</p><p>

A word of advice for those attempting to use a similar trick to modify the order of the variables in the BSS segment: If two names produce the same hash value for whatever hash function the compiler uses, the order of the variable declarations can have an effect on the order of the variables in the generated code. This includes "extern" declarations as well, not just the actual declaration of the variable. One way to detect hash collisions in a list of randomly generated variable names would be to reverse the order of the variables and compile the file again. If the order of certain names changes after that, those names have the same hash values and you are probably better off using only one of those names to avoid having to move (extern) declarations around to get the result you want.</p><p>

---</p><p>

If you check out IDLIB.C and IDLIB.ASM, you will see that I based the code in these files on The Catacomb and Hovertank. This is the code that got the team in trouble. They used the same routines they wrote for their day jobs at Softdisk in the Keen code. No matter what those old letters posted by Scott Miller said, the boys were in serious trouble.</p><p>

Most of the IDLIB.C code must have come directly from the PC version of Dangerous Dave. I don't think the Dave source code has been released to the public, so you'll just have to take my word for it. But there is some extremely strong evidence showing that the id founders used Softdisk's code in their own game. Sure, it's not the code responsible for the smooth scrolling, but it is code they probably didn't have the rights to use.</p><p>

---</p><p>

That's all for now. Have fun messing with the code.</p></div></div>]]></description>
