  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I am an AI hater. This is considered rude, but I do not care, because I am a hater.</p>

<p>To speak politely about AI, you put disclaimers before criticism: of course I’m not against it entirely; perhaps in a few years when; maybe for other purposes, but. You are supposed to debate how and when it should be used. You are supposed to take for granted that it must be useful somewhere, to someone, for something, eventually. People who are rich and smart and respected are saying so, and it would be arrogant to disagree with such people.</p>

<p>But I am a hater, which is a kind of integrity. It means I am willing to disagree with anyone, even if it is rude. “But I only use it to–” “Actually if you just—” “The new models–” “I was making fun–” Stop. You’re embarrassing yourself. I am embarrassed for you.</p>

<p>Critics have already written thoroughly about the <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chatgpt-is-everywhere-environmental-costs-oped">environmental</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8gy7lv448o">harms</a>, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-health-business-90020cdf5fa16c79ca2e5b6c4c9bbb14">reinforcement</a> of <a href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-exploited-labor-behind-artificial-intelligence/">bias</a> and generation of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">racist output</a>, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/ai-eroded-doctors-ability-to-spot-cancer-within-months-in-study?embedded-checkout=true">cognitive harms</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/26/technology/chatgpt-openai-suicide.html">AI supported suicides</a>, the problems with <a href="https://www.404media.co/deepfake-harassment-ohio-undress-clothoff-nudify-apps/">consent</a> and <a href="https://jskfellows.stanford.edu/theft-is-not-fair-use-474e11f0d063">copyright</a>, the way AI tech companies further the <a href="https://karendhao.com/">patterns of empire</a>, how <a href="https://thecon.ai/">it’s a con</a> that enables <a href="https://voiceofsandiego.org/2025/04/14/as-bot-students-continue-to-flood-in-community-colleges-struggle-to-respond/">fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/04/1080801/generative-ai-boosting-disinformation-and-propaganda-freedom-house/">disinformation</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-artificial-intelligence-being-used-sextortion-harassment-2023-06-07/">harassment</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/machine-surveillance-is-being-super-charged-by-large-ai-models">surveillance</a>, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/millions-of-workers-are-training-ai-models-for-pennies/">exploitation of workers</a>, as an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688679/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-ai-efficiency">excuse to fire workers</a> and de-skill work, how they <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/illusion-of-thinking">don’t actually reason</a> and probability and association are <a href="https://thegradient.pub/machine-learning-wont-solve-the-natural-language-understanding-challenge/">inadequate to the goal of intelligence</a>, how people think it makes them faster when it <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">makes them slower</a>, how it is inherently mediocre and fundamentally conservative, how it is at its core a <a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/">fascist technology</a> rooted in the <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/toolmen">ideology of supremacy</a>, defined not by its technical features but <a href="https://ali-alkhatib.com/blog/defining-ai">by its political ones</a>.</p>

<p>But I am more than a critic: I am a hater. I am not here to make a careful comprehensive argument, because people have already done that. If you’re pushing slop or eating it, you wouldn’t read it anyway. You’d ask a bot for a summary and forget what it told you, then proceed with your day, unchanged by words you did not read and ideas you did not consider.</p>

<p>I am here to be rude, because this is a rude technology, and it deserves a rude response. Miyazaki said, “<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/insult-life-itself-studio-ghiblis-193724631.html">I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.</a>” Scam Altman said we can <a href="https://fight.fudgie.org/search/show/tpw/episode/20250723_Wed#line3691">surround the solar system with a Dyson Sphere</a> to hold data centers. Miyazaki is right, and Altman is wrong. Miyazaki tells stories that blend the ordinary and the fantastic in ways people find deeply meaningful. Altman tells lies for money.</p>

<p>And I’m glad they’re lies. Because the makers of AI aren’t damned by their failures, they’re damned by their goals. They want to build a genie to grant them wishes, and their wish is that nobody ever has to make art again. They want to create a new kind of mind, so they can force it into mindless servitude. Their dream is to invent new forms of life to enslave.</p>

<p>And to what end? In a kind of nihilistic symmetry, their dream of the perfect slave machine drains the life of those who use it as well as those who turn the gears. What is life but what we choose, who we know, what we experience? Incoherent empty men want to sell me the chance to stop reading and writing and thinking, to stop caring for my kids or talking to my parents, to stop choosing what I do or knowing why I do it. Blissful ignorance and total isolation, warm in the womb of the algorithm, nourished by hungry machines.</p>

<p>And even as it consumes those who use it, even as the scammers become their own marks, even as it is sustained by exploited workers slotted in as human filters for algorithmic abuse – some people want to have a little, as a treat. As a joke. Just to make fun of it, just for the busywork, because it’s good enough, right? You understand.</p>

<p>I do understand: you want permission. There’s a machine in the corner wrapped in human skin that makes things out of shit and blood to look like whatever you want (as long as you don’t look too closely). You gave one to your teacher and they didn’t notice. Your boss told you to use it after they laid off half the team and it was fine. You fed one to your kids and they liked it. You want to know you can use it sometimes without me thinking less of you. You don’t need me to believe it’s useful, you just want me to be polite about it.</p>

<p>But I am a hater, and I will not be polite. The machine is disgusting and we should break it. The people who build it are vapid shit-eating cannibals glorifying ignorance. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.</p>

<p>I became a hater by doing precisely those things AI cannot do: reading and understanding human language; thinking and reasoning about ideas; considering the meaning of my words and their context; loving people, making art, living in my body with its flaws and feelings and life. AI cannot be a hater, because AI does not feel, or know, or care. Only humans can be haters. I celebrate my humanity.</p>

                                -                                A failure of security systems at PayPal is currently causing concern for numerous German banks and private customers. A vast number of payments are reportedly being blocked, with merchants waiting on funds in the billions.

                                                                                    <p>                The US payment service provider PayPal has been quite popular in Germany for years. However, currently both private customers and banks are grappling with a problem. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), certain security systems at PayPal have reportedly failed. These are the systems designed to filter out fraudulent transactions. As a result, various German banks are said to have blocked payments from PayPal as early as Monday. The SZ estimated the amount involved to be more than ten billion euros.</p>
                            	<h3>PayPal security systems down - direct debits submitted unchecked</h3>
                                                        <p>PayPal is regularly exploited by fraudsters to get hold of citizens' money. The payment service's security systems are supposed to check and prevent such activity. However, these systems reportedly failed at the end of last week, causing PayPal to submit direct debits without verification.</p>
                        	    	            
                            
                                                                    <p>Portals like "Netzwelt" also report disruptions with the payment service. The blog "Cashys Blog" mentioned technical issues over the weekend. For days, customers have allegedly experienced difficulties processing transactions. Payments via direct debit are primarily being rejected, despite the accounts reportedly having sufficient funds.</p>
                                                        <p>However, this might not be directly related to the PayPal disruption but rather due to the banks' reactions. According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung," banks noticed the unusually high volume of direct debits from PayPal on Monday, which appeared suspicious or fraudulent.</p>
                                                        <h3>Banks halted all PayPal transactions</h3>
                                                        <p>To prevent a potentially multimillion-euro fraud, several banks reportedly temporarily halted all PayPal transactions.</p>
                                                        <p>According to information from the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (SZ), these banks include "Bayerische Landesbank", "Hessische Landesbank", and "DZ-Bank".</p>
                        	    	            
                                                                    <p>As a result, numerous merchants did not receive their funds. The newspaper reports that the banks may have frozen more than ten billion euros. As stated by the news agency News5, not only online shop payments were affected; customers are currently experiencing difficulties using PayPal at supermarket checkouts and in retail stores as well.</p>
                                                        <p>According to PayPal, it was a "temporary service disruption." The company's site states: "Over the weekend, there was a temporary service interruption that led to delays in transactions for a small number of accounts. The issue has since been resolved."</p>
                                                        <p>Even though PayPal claims to have fixed the problem, the effects of the outage are still noticeably impacting merchants and consumers, as reported by News5. PayPal lists several services as "under maintenance" on its status page. When payments will resume smoothly remains unclear.</p>
                                                        <h3>PayPal security systems down - impact across Europe</h3>
                                                        <p>According to information from the German Press Agency (dpa), the incident has been confirmed by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association (DSGV). In recent days, there have been "incidents involving unauthorized direct debits from PayPal affecting various financial institutions," the association stated. "These incidents had a significant impact on payment transactions throughout Europe, particularly in Germany. This was noticeable to customers of the Savings Banks Finance Group institutions for several hours last Monday."</p>
                        	    	            
                                                                    <p>Consumer advocates recommend that PayPal customers check their accounts for unauthorized debits.</p>
                                                        <p>Focus Online also reports on a major update that PayPal has presumably been implementing since August 25. Whether there is a connection between the disruption and the planned update remains unclear at this time.</p>
                                                        <p>PayPal is by far the most important online payment service in the German market, accounting for just under 30 percent of online purchases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<h2>GMP damaging Zen 5 CPUs?</h2>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p> We have fried two Ryzen 9950X CPUs in a few months by running GMP tests.
This is not expected, of course.  In this page, we provide as much information
as possible to help analysing the problem.
</p>
<p>
What causes these CPUs to die while running GMP is unknown to us.  While
similar, it is not the widely reported Asrock motherboard problem, as the
motherboards we use are of a different make (see below).  It might be that the
Zen 5 CPUs pull more power than specified when running GMP, or it might be that
our cooling solutions are inadequate.
</p>
<p>
The 1st failure happened in late winter 2025 (February IIRC).  The system was
located in a dedicated room in a flat in Stockholm, Sweden.  The ambient
temperature in the room was low, less than 20°C.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd failure happened 2025-08-24 in a dedicated computer room, with ambient
temperature just over 20°C.
</p>
<p>

After both failures, we took out the CPUs and found a discoloured area of
perhaps 25mm² on the pin side.  Here are two picture from different angles of the 2nd CPU:
</p>
<img src="https://gmplib.org/cpu-backside.jpg">
<img src="https://gmplib.org/cpu-backside2.jpg">

<p>
We use a Noctua cooling solution for both systems. For the 1st system, we
mounted the heat sink centred.  For the 2nd system, we followed Noctua's advice
of mounting things offset towards what they claim to be the hotter side of the
CPU.  Below is a picture of the 2nd system without the heat sink which shows
that offset.  Note the brackets and their pins, those pins are where the heat
sink's pressure gets centred.  Also note how the thermal paste has been
squeezed away from that part, but is quite thick towards the left.
</p>

<img src="https://gmplib.org/mbd.jpg">
<p>
Here is a closeup on the heat sink, indicating how the off-centre mounting
squeezed the paste to one end.
</p>

<p>
This is the cleaned front side of the CPU.  Nothing much to see here, the visible damage is on its back.

  We really don't know what is wrong here.  Let us list some observations and
  thoughts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The ambient temperature was in both cases quite low.

  </li><li> These are supposedly top-quality motherboard (We've had about 50 ASUS
  motherboard over the years, and only had one failure).

  </li><li> The offset mounting does not look right to us.  But this is how things
  are supposed to be done.

  </li><li> It is possible that we caused the 2nd CPU failure by inadequate mounting
  of the heat sink.  It surely seems bizarre to have the thermal paste squeezed
  like shown on the pictures above!

  </li><li> But note that the 1st failure happened with a more centred heat sink.
  We only made the off-centre mounting for the 2nd system as to minimise the
  risk of a repeated system failure.

  </li><li> The so-called TDP of the Ryzen 9950X is 170W.  The used heat sinks are
  specified to dissipate 165W, so that seems tight.  We have extra fans in the
  cases and a low ambient temperature, making these 5W seem negligible.  But of
  course, this is not completely kosher.

  </li><li> We have a sister system for the 9950X, a 7950X which is similarly
  configured and built.  That system actually seems to run slightly hotter, but
  it has been stable for a long time (under the same crazy load!).

  </li><li> The systems were under maximal load at the time their CPUs died, running
  very tight handcrafted asm loops sustaining one MULX per cycle.  That might
  be a "hot" instruction.

  </li><li> Did the CPUs die of heat stroke? Modern CPUs measure their temperature
  and clock down if they get too hot, don't they?

  </li><li> We don't overclock or overvolt or play other teen games with our
  hardware.

  </li><li> The extremely thin layer of thermal paste which resulted from the
  off-centre heat sink mount, might seem fine.  We however suspect that there
  might be a problem, as when the system heats and cools, things bend a little.
  With a remaining layer of thermal paste, such bending will not create any
  void as the paste's elasticity will maintain some contact.  When the thermal
  paste is squeezed away as with the suggested Noctua mounting, an
  ever-so-slight void between the CPU and the heat sink might be created.

  </li><li> Neither of the 9950X CPUs died immediately, instead they died the exact
  same way after a couple of months at high load.  This seems to suggest a
  gradual but predictable degradation.
</li></ul>

                    Under EU law, Apple is required to give its users more freedom to install apps that are not listed in the official App Store. This allows for easier access to software that's typically prohibited by Apple, including the popular iTorrent BitTorrent client. The iTorrent client built a steady user base over the past year, but that came to an abrupt end when Apple decided to revoke the developer's alternative distribution rights. 
        </p>

In the EU, however, these types of apps have been available for more than a year through third-party app stores. </p>
<p>This breakthrough was a direct result of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Markets_Act">DMA</a>) that went into effect last year, requiring Apple to allow apps to be installed through third-party stores.</p>
<p><a href="https://altstore.io/">AltStore Pal</a> is one of the most popular altstores in the EU. Soon after it launched, two torrent clients were <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/224724/eerste-ios-torrentclients-komen-beschikbaar-voor-europese-iphone-gebruikers.html">made available</a>: iTorrent and qBitControl. This was a notable milestone that AltStore actively <a href="https://www.threads.com/@altstoreio/post/C90CNunJIY8/">promoted</a> on social media.</p>

<p>AltStore PAL assured its users that these apps were put through a vetting process to ensure that they are secure. And indeed, in the months that followed, many people installed and used the torrent clients without problems. </p>
<h2>Apple Bars iTorrent Distribution</h2>
<p>While alternative app stores operate independently and are required by EU law, Apple is still in a position to exert some control. This became apparent a few weeks ago, when <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent">iTorrent</a> users suddenly ran into trouble when installing the app. </p>
<p>In July, several users <a href="https://github.com/XITRIX/iTorrent/issues/401">complained</a> that they were unable to download iTorrent from AltStore PAL. Initially the cause of the problem was unclear but the app’s developer, XITRIX, later confirmed that Apple itself had stepped in.</p>
<p>Apparently, Apple had revoked the developer’s “alternative distribution” right, which is required to publish apps in alternative stores, including AltStore PAL.</p>
<center><em>Rights revoked</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">

<p>Given Apple’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/apple-bans-bittorrent-software-090511/">long history</a> of <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/apple-boots-bittorrent-app-from-iphone-store-101006/">banning</a> torrent apps from its own store, it’s tempting to conclude that the company stepped in for the same reason here. For now, however, there’s no confirmation that’s indeed the case.</p>
<h2>Developer Responds</h2>
<p>Speaking directly with TorrentFreak, iTorrent developer Daniil Vinogradov (XITRIX) says that Apple did not reach out to him regarding the revocation of his alternative EU distribution rights. </p>
<p>Soon after the issues appeared, Vinogradov sent a support request to Apple seeking clarification, but that wasn’t helpful either. Instead, Apple responded with a generic message related to App Store issues. </p>
<p>After another follow-up last week, Apple informed the developer that their escalation team is looking into it, but nothing further. “I still have no idea if it was my fault or Apple’s, and their responses make no sense,” Vinogradov says. </p>
<h2>AltStore in the Dark, Apple remains quiet</h2>
<p>AltStore PAL is not responsible for the issues, but it has also sprung into action. Co-founder Shane Gill informs TorrentFreak that they requested clarification from Apple but are still in the dark about the company’s reasons to intervene. </p>
<p>“I can confirm that we are in communication with Apple about this issue. We’ve told them what’s going wrong, and they said they’re looking into it, but we haven’t gotten any further information as of yet,” Gill says.</p>
<p>For now, there is no evidence that the ‘BitTorrent’ link is the cause of the problem. According to Gill, Apple has never provided AltStore with any guidelines or warnings on specific app categories.</p>
<p>Apple has not responded publicly yet either. When we reached out, the company asked us to call them, but our call went unanswered. The same applies to the follow-up requests we sent via email over the past few days.</p>
<p>While there may be a perfectly logical explanation for iTorrent’s revoked rights, Apple’s handling of the matter so far only fuels speculation. Some might even argue that the lack of transparency in revoking distribution rights violates the letter or the spirit of the EU’s Digital Markets Act. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>I first ran into Forth about 20 years ago when reading a book about
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-embedded-hardware/0596007558/">designing embedded hardware</a>.
The reason I got the book back then was to actually learn more about the HW
aspects, so having skimmed the Forth chapter I just registered an "oh, this is neat"
mental note and moved on with my life. Over the last two decades I
heard about Forth a few more times here and there, such as that time when
<a href="https://factorcode.org/">Factor</a> was talked about for a brief period, maybe
10-12 years ago or so.</p>
<p>It always occupied a slot in the "weird language" category inside my brain, and
I never paid it much attention. Until June this year, when a couple of factors
combined fortuitously:</p>
<ul>
<li>After spending much of the <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/archives/2025">earlier part of 2025</a>
exploring the inner workings
of LLMs and digging in random mathy and algorithmic topics, I had an itch
to just write some code.</li>
<li>I somehow found <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html">Dave Gauer's page about Forth</a>
and also the one on <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/implementing">Implementing a Forth</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>And something clicked. I'm going to implement a Forth, because... why not?</p>
<p>So I spent much of my free hacking time over the past two months learning
about Forth and implementing <em>two</em> of them.</p>
<div id="forth-the-user-level-and-the-hacker-level">
<h2>Forth: the user level and the hacker level</h2>
<p>It's useful to think of Forth (at least <a href="https://forth-standard.org/">standard Forth</a>,
not offshoots like Factor) as having two different "levels":</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User</strong> level: you just want to use the language to write programs. Maybe
you're indeed bringing up new hardware, and find Forth a useful
calculator + REPL + script language. You don't care about Forth's
implementation or its soul, you just want to complete your task.</li>
<li><strong>Hacker</strong> level: you're interested in the deeper soul of Forth. Isn't it
amazing that even control flow constructs like <tt><span>IF...THEN</span></tt> or loops like
<tt><span>BEGIN...UNTIL</span></tt> are just Forth words, and if you wanted, you could implement
your own control flow constructs and have them be first-class citizens, as
seamless and efficient as the standard ones?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another way to look at it (useful if you belong to a certain crowd) is that
user-level Forth is like Lisp without macros, and hacker-level Forth has macros
enabled. Lisp can still be great and useful without macros, but macros take
it to an entire new level and also unlock the deeper soul of the language.</p>
<p>This distinction will be important when discussing my Forth implementations
below.</p>
</div>
<div id="goforth-and-ctil">
<h2>goforth and ctil</h2>
<p><img alt="Logo of goforth" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/pages/goforth-logo-sm.png"></p><p>There's a certain way Forth is supposed to be implemented; this is how it was
originally designed, and if you get closer to the hacker level, it
becomes apparent that you're pretty much required to implement it this way -
otherwise supporting all of the language's standard words will be very
difficult. I'm talking about the classical approach of a linked dictionary,
where a word is represented as a "threaded" list <a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1">[1]</a>, and this dictionary is
available for user code to augment and modify. Thus, much of the Forth
implementation can be written in Forth itself.</p>
<p>The first implementation I tried is stubbornly different. Can we just make a
pure interpreter? This is what <a href="https://github.com/eliben/goforth">goforth</a>
is trying to explore (the Go implementation located in the root directory of
that repository). Many built-in words are supported - definitely enough to
write useful programs - and compilation
(the definition of new Forth words using <tt>: word ... ;</tt>) is implemented by
storing the actual string following the word name in the dictionary, so it can
be interpreted when the word is invoked.</p>
<p>This was an interesting approach and in some sense, it "works". For the user
level of Forth, this is perfectly usable (albeit slow). However, it's
insufficient for the hacker level, because the host language interpreter (the
one in Go) has all the control, so it's impossible to implement <tt><span>IF...THEN</span></tt> in
Forth, for example (it has to be implemented in the host language).</p>
<p>That was a fun way to get a deeper sense of what Forth is about, but I did want
to implement the hacker level as well, so the second implementation -
<a href="https://github.com/eliben/goforth/tree/main/ctil">ctil</a> - does just that.
It's inspired by the <a href="http://git.annexia.org/?p=jonesforth.git">jonesforth</a>
assembly implementation, but done in C instead <a href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>ctil actually lets us implement major parts of Forth in Forth itself. For
example, <tt>variable</tt>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>variable</span><span> </span><span>create</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span> </span><span>cells</span><span> </span><span>allot</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Conditionals:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>\ IF, ELSE, THEN work together to compile to lower-level branches.</span><span></span>
<span>\</span><span></span>
<span>\ IF ... THEN compiles to:</span><span></span>
<span>\   0BRANCH OFFSET true-part rest</span><span></span>
<span>\ where OFFSET is the offset of rest</span><span></span>
<span>\</span><span></span>
<span>\ IF ... ELSE ... THEN compiles to :</span><span></span>
<span>\   0BRANCH OFFSET true-part BRANCH OFFSET2 false-part rest</span><span></span>
<span>\ where OFFSET is the offset of false-part and OFFSET2 is the offset of rest</span><span></span>
<span>:</span><span> </span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>immediate</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>branch</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>here</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>0</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>:</span><span> </span><span>then</span><span> </span><span>immediate</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>dup</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>here</span><span> </span><span>swap</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>swap</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>

<span>:</span><span> </span><span>else</span><span> </span><span>immediate</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>'</span><span> </span><span>branch</span><span> </span><span>,</span><span></span>

<span>  </span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>These are actual examples of ctil's "prelude" - a Forth file loaded before any
user code. If you understand Forth, this code is actually rather mind-blowing.
We compile <tt>IF</tt> and the other words by directly laying our their low-level
representation in memory, and different words communicate with each other
using the data stack <em>during compilation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="thoughts-on-forth-itself">
<h2>Thoughts on Forth itself</h2>
<p>Forth made perfect sense in the historic context in which it was created in
the early 1970s. Imagine having some HW connected to your computer (a telescope
in the case of Forth's creator), and you have to interact with it. In terms
of languages at your disposal - you don't have much, even BASIC wasn't invented
yet. Perhaps your machine still didn't have a C compiler ported to it; C
compilers aren't simple, and C isn't very great for exploratory scripting
anyway. So you mostly just have your assembly language and whatever you build
on top.</p>
<p>Forth is easy to implement in assembly and it gives you a much higher-level
language; you can use it as a calculator, as a REPL, and as a DSL for pretty
much anything due to its composable nature.</p>
<p>Forth certainly has interesting aspects; it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_programming_language">concatenative language</a>,
and thus inherently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_programming">point-free</a>.
A classical example is that instead of writing the following in a more
traditional syntax:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>eat(bake(prove(mix(ingredients))))
</pre></div>
<p>You just write this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>ingredients mix prove bake eat
</pre></div>
<p>There is no need to explicitly pass parameters, or to explicitly return results.
Everything happens implicitly on the stack.</p>
<p>This is useful for REPL-style programming where you use your language not
necessarily for writing large programs, but more for interactive instructions to
various HW devices. This dearth of syntax is also what makes Forth simple
to implement.</p>
<p>All that said, in my mind Forth is firmly in the "weird language" category;
it's instructive to learn and to implement, but I wouldn't actually use it
for anything real these days. The stack-based programming model is cool for
very terse point-free programs, but it's not particularly readable and hard
to reason about without extensive comments, in my experience.</p>
<p>Consider the implementation of a pretty standard Forth word: <tt>+!</tt>. It expects
and address at the top of stack, and an addend below it. It adds the addend to
the value stored at that address. Here's a Forth implementation from
ctil's prelude:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>+!</span><span>        </span><span>( addend addr -- )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>tuck</span><span>      </span><span>( addr addend addr )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>@</span><span>         </span><span>( addr addend value-at-addr )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>+</span><span>         </span><span>( addr updated-value )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>swap</span><span>      </span><span>( updated-value addr )</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>!</span><span> </span><span>;</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Look at that stack wrangling! It's really hard to follow what goes where without
the detailed comments showing the stack layout on the right of each instruction
(a common practice for Forth programs). Sure, we can create additional words
that would make this simpler, but that just increases the lexicon of words to
know.</p>
<p>My point is, there's fundamental difficulty here. When you see this C code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>func</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span>
<span>  </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>b</span><span>));</span><span></span>
<span>}</span><span></span>
</pre></div>
<p>Even without any documentation, you can immediately know several important
things:</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>bar</tt> has one parameter and one return value</li>
<li><tt>foo</tt> has two parameters and one return value</li>
<li><tt>func</tt> also has two parameters and one return value</li>
<li>It's immediately obvious how the various values flow from one function call
to the next.</li>
</ul>
<p>Written in Forth <a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3">[3]</a>:</p>

<p>How can you know the arity of the functions without adding explicit comments?
Sure, if you have a handful of words like <tt>bar</tt> and <tt>foo</tt> you know like the
back of your hand, this is easy. But imagine reading a large, unfamiliar code
base full of code like this and trying to comprehend it.</p>

<p>Implementing Forth is a great self-improvement project for a coder; there's a
pleasantly challenging hump of understanding to overcome, and you gain valuable
insights into stack machines, interpretation vs. compilation and mixing these
levels of abstraction in cool ways.</p>
<p>Also, implementing programming languages
from scratch is fun! It's hard to beat the feeling of getting to interact with
your implementation for the first time, and then iterating on improving it
and making it more featureful. <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=One+More+Turn+Syndrome">Just one more word</a>!</p>

Once again, SpaceX aimed to perform several experiments with Super Heavy, including a fuel-conserving controlled flip during descent and a landing burn that featured "unique engine configurations," according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.spacex.com/launches/starship-flight-10" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">company mission preview</a>.</p><p>That all seemed to go according to plan today, as did Super Heavy's final move: It made a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico about seven minutes after launch, just as SpaceX drew it up.</p><p>Ship came through today as well — and it had considerably more work to do. The upper stage separated from Super Heavy on time and achieved its desired suborbital trajectory. The, during a five-minute stretch that began about 20 minutes after launch, Ship deployed eight dummy versions of SpaceX's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-satellites.html">Starlink</a> internet satellites, a critical capability it tried but failed to demonstrate on all three of this year's previous Starship flights.</p><p>"Just a reminder, we're on a suborbital trajectory," SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot said during live commentary. "These satellites on that exact same suborbital trajectory, they're going to burn up entirely."</p><p>And there will be many satellite deployments from Ship in the future, if all goes to plan: SpaceX is counting on Starship to finish building out its Starlink megaconstellation, which is already the biggest satellite network ever assembled. The giant rocket should carry at least 60 Starlinks at a time, Huot said.</p><p id="68e9928b-16f9-4cc8-80ac-a10167443cce">Then, about 38 minutes into the flight, Ship briefly ignited one of its engines. This was another big milestone for SpaceX; such in-space re-lights will be needed on operational Starship flights, to help power the vehicles to their distant destinations and to guide them down to Earth for safe touchdowns and reuse.</p><p>"Looks like we confirmed the relight of one of those center raptor engines second time we've done that," Lee said during live commentary. "Super exciting. Huge congrats to the team on this milestone."</p><p>"That was a cool light show," Huot added.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="307469cf-fbdd-4ab4-aa20-96cf6a089484"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>Most research on programming language performance asks a variation of a single question: how can we make some specific program faster?
Sometimes we may even investigate how we can use less memory.
This means a lot of research focuses solely on reducing the amount of resources needed to achieve some computational goal.</p>

<p>So, why on earth might we be interested in slowing down programs then?</p>

<h2 id="slowing-down-programs-is-surprisingly-useful">Slowing Down Programs is Surprisingly Useful!</h2>

<p>Making programs slower can be useful to find race conditions,
to simulate speedups, and to assess how accurate profilers are.</p>

<p>To detect race conditions,
we may want to use an approach similar to fuzzing.
Instead of exploring a program’s implementation
by varying its input,
we can explore different instruction interleavings, thread or event schedules,
by slowing down program parts to change timings.
This approach allows us to identify concurrency bugs
and is used by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi08/tech/full_papers/musuvathi/musuvathi.pdf">CHESS</a>, <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/paper/eurosys23.pdf">WAFFLE</a>, and <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/storage/00lipics/lipics-vol333-ecoop2025/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.9/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.9.pdf">NACD</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz">Coz profiler</a> is an example of how slowing down programs can be used to simulate speedup.
With Coz, we can estimate whether an optimization is beneficial
before implementing it.
Coz simulates it by slowing down <em>all other</em> program parts.
The part we think might be optimizable stays at the same speed
it was before, but is now <em>virtually sped up</em>, which allows us to see
whether it gives enough of a benefit to justify a perhaps lengthy optimization project.</p>

<p>And, as mentioned before, we can also use it to assess how accurate profilers are.
Though, I’ll leave this for the next blog posts. :)</p>

<p>The current approaches to slowing down programs for these use cases are
rather coarse-grained though. Race detection often adapts the scheduler or uses, for example, APIs such as <code>Thread.sleep()</code>.
Similarly, Coz pauses the execution of the other threads.
<a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/papers/mytkowicz-pldi10.pdf">Work</a> on measuring whether profilers give actionable results,
inserts bytecodes into Java programs to compute Fibonacci numbers.</p>

<p>By using more fine-grained slowdowns,
we think we could make race detection, speedup estimation, and profiler accuracy assessments more precise. Thus, we looked into inserting slowdown instructions into basic blocks.</p>

<h2 id="which-x86-instructions-allow-us-to-consistently-slow-down-basic-blocks">Which x86 Instructions Allow us to Consistently Slow Down Basic Blocks?</h2>

<p>Let’s assume we run on some x86 processor, and we are looking at programs
from the perspective of processors.</p>

<p>When running a benchmark like <a href="https://github.com/smarr/are-we-fast-yet/blob/master/benchmarks/Java/src/Towers.java#L74">Towers</a>,
the OpenJDK’s HotSpot JVM may compile it to x86 instructions like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td><td><pre><span>mov</span> <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>+</span><span>0x18</span><span>],</span> <span>r8d</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>],</span> <span>ecx</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>qword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsp</span><span>+</span><span>0x20</span><span>],</span> <span>rsi</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>ebx</span><span>,</span> <span>dword</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rsi</span><span>+</span><span>0x10</span><span>]</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>r9d</span><span>,</span> <span>edx</span>
<span>cmp</span> <span>edx</span><span>,</span> <span>0x1</span>
<span>jnz</span> <span>0</span><span>x...</span> <span>&lt;</span><span>Bl</span><span>ock</span> <span>55</span><span>&gt;</span>	
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is one of the basic blocks produced by HotSpot’s C2 compiler.
For our purposes, it suffices to see that there are some memory accesses
with the <code>mov</code> instructions, and we end up checking whether the <code>edx</code> register
contains the value 1. If that’s not the case, we jump to Block 55.
Otherwise, execution continues in the next basic block.
A key property of a basic block is that there’s no control flow inside of it,
which means once it starts executing, all of its instructions will execute.</p>

<p>Though, how can we slow it down?</p>

<p>x86 has many many different instructions one could try to insert into the block,
which each will probably consume CPU cycles.
However, modern CPUs try to execute as many instructions
as possible at the same time using out-of-order execution.
This means, instructions in our basic block
that do not directly depend on each other
might be executed at the same time.
For instance, the first three <code>mov</code> instructions access neither the same register
nor memory location. This means the order in which they are executed here does not matter.
Though, which optimizations CPUs apply depends on the program and the specific CPU generation,
or rather microarchitecture.</p>

<p>To find suitable instructions to slow down basic blocks,
we experimented only on an Intel Core i5-10600 CPU,
which has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Lake">Comet Lake-S microarchitecture</a>.
On other microarchitectures, things can be very different.</p>

<p>For the slowdown that we want, 
we can use <code>nop</code> or <code>mov regX, regX</code> instructions on Comet Lake-S.
This <code>mov</code> would move the value from register <code>X</code> to itself, so basically does nothing.
These two instructions give us a slowdown
that is small enough to slow down most blocks accurately to a desired target speed,
and the slowdown seems to affect only the specific block it is meant for.</p>

<p>Our basic block from earlier would then perhaps end up with <code>nop</code> instructions
interleaved after each instruction.
In practice, the number of instructions we need to insert
depends on how much time a basic block takes in the program.
Though, for illustration, it might look like this:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>

<p>We tried six different candidates, including a <code>push</code>-<code>pop</code> sequence, to get a better impression
of how Comet Lake-S deals with them.
For more details of how and what we tried, please have a look at our <a href="#paper">short paper below</a>, which we will present at the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025/vmil-2025#event-overview">VMIL workshop</a>.</p>

<p>When inserting these instructions into basic blocks,
so that each individual basic block
takes about twice as much time as before,
we end up with a program that indeed is overall twice as slow, as one would hope.
Even better, when we look at the Towers benchmark with the <a href="https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler">async-profiler</a> for HotSpot, and compare the proportions of run time it
attributes to each method, the slowed-down and the normal version
match almost perfectly, as <a href="#fig1">illustrated below</a>.
The same is not true for the other candidates we looked at.</p>

<figure id="fig1">

<figcaption><strong>Figure 1:</strong> A scatter plot per slowdown instruction with the median run-time percentage for the top six Java methods of Towers. The <em>X=Y</em> diagonal indicates that a method’s run‐time percentage remains the same with and without slowdown.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The paper has a few more details, including a more detailed analysis
of the slowdown each candidate introduces,
how precise the slowdown is for all basic blocks
in the benchmark, and whether it makes a difference when we put the slowdown
all at the beginning, interleaved, or at the end.</p>

<p>Of course, this work is merely a stepping stone to more interesting things,
which I will look at in a bit more detail in the next post.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slowing down programs has surprisingly many use cases: it helps finding race conditions, enables speedup estimation, and allows us to assess a profiler’s accuracy. Yet, slowing down a program is complicated because today’s CPUs and runtime systems can optimize execution on the fly, making it challenging to preserve a program’s performance behavior to avoid introducing bias.</p>

<p>We evaluate six x86 instruction candidates for controlled and fine-grained slowdown including NOP, MOV, and PAUSE. We tested each candidate’s ability to achieve an overhead of 100%, to maintain the profiler-observable performance behavior, and whether slowdown placement within basic blocks influences results. On an Intel Core i5-10600, our experiments suggest that only NOP and MOV instructions are suitable. We believe these experiments can guide future research on advanced developer tooling that utilizes fine-granular slowdown at the machine-code level.</p>

	<h2>Harness the Power and Simplicity of Plain Text</h2>

	<p>
		Plain text has been around for decades and it's here to stay. <strong>Monodraw</strong> allows you to easily create text-based art (like diagrams, layouts, flow charts) and visually represent algorithms, data structures, binary formats and more. Because it's all just text, it can be easily embedded almost anywhere. Of course, exporting as images is also supported (PNG and SVG).
	</p>

        <h2><img src="https://monodraw.helftone.com/static/images/diagram-icon.png" width="44px"> Diagrams</h2>
        <p>
          A picture is worth a thousand words. A diagram is probably worth twice as much. Enhance your technical <a href="https://github.com/dguerri/vagrant-ansible-openstack#architecture---network-diagram">documentation</a> (code, specs) with easy to comprehend textual art. Visualisation of data structures, algorithms and data formats plays a crucial role in understanding. You will be reading the code more often than writing it, so why not make it much easier to grasp.

        <p>
          Combine the simplicity of plain text with the power of mind mapping. Monodraw gives you the freedom to manage your textual data exactly the way you want. Move text around anywhere in the infinite canvas – no need to be constrained by the linear structure of a text file.

        <p>
      Monodraw includes a command-line interface (<a href="#cli-tool-direct-store">Direct version only</a>). For example, you can use it to automatically generate docs when committing by leveraging version control hooks. The tool can also output JSON, for easier programmatic manipulation.

    <div><p>
      Monodraw is designed for the Mac from the ground up – everything from the text layout engine to the interface is made to take advantage of macOS. Like all native apps, it just works the way you expect. When you make a mistake, undo is always ready to come to the rescue. Exporting your text art could not get any easier – just copy and paste it into your favourite text editor. </p><p><a href="http://blog.helftone.com/ascii-art-unicode/">Not displaying correctly?</a></p></div>

<h3 dir="auto">Body</h3>
<p dir="auto">Over the past few months, Github has been getting slower and slower on Safari. It has now reached a point where it is unusable.</p>
<p dir="auto">Displaying any pull request with more than a thousand lines changed or even browsing any file with a thousand or more lines of code is fully broken.</p>
<p dir="auto">What happens:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In Activity Monitor, the rendering process is running at 100%.</li>
<li>Rendering the page is so slow, Safari displays blank space when scrolling up and down.</li>
<li>Any interactive features like search is so slow it doesn't work.</li>
<li>Pull request review is extremely painful (scrolling back and forth is impossible to do quickly, posting comments is extremely slow, even checking the "Viewed" checkbox sometimes takes several seconds, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I have a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a 16-cores Apple M4 Max and 48GB of RAM, using it plugged in with performance mode enabled. It's one of the most powerful laptop on the market today. Github is the only website I know that doesn't run on it.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is Safari specific, Google Chrome on the same machine performs way better (although it still struggles with very large pull requests).</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, someone noted in the comments that they hadn't heard about the Therac-25 incident. I was surprised, and went off to do an informal survey of developers I know, only to discover that only about half of them knew what it was without searching for it.<br>
I think it's important that everyone in our industry know about this incident, and upon digging into the details I was stunned by how <em>much</em> of a WTF there was.<br>
Today's article is not fun, or funny. It describes incidents of death and maiming caused by faulty software engineering processes. If that's not what you want today, <a href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/random">grab a random article</a> from our archive, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you're strapping a patient to an electron gun capable of delivering a 25MeV particle beam, <em>following procedure</em> is vitally important. The technician operating the Therac-25 radiotherapy machine at the East Texas Cancer Center (ETCC) had been running this machine, and those like it, long enough that she had the routine down.</p>
<p>On March 21, 1986, the technician brought a patient into the treatment room. She checked their prescription, and positioned them onto the bed of the Therac-25. Above the patient was the end-point of the emitter, a turntable which allowed her to select what kind of beam the device would emit. First, she set the turntable to a simple optical laser mode, and used that to position the patient so that the beam struck a small section of his upper back, just to one side of his spine.</p>
<p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Therac_25_54.gif#/media/File:Therac_25_54.gif"><img itemprop="image" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Therac_25_54.gif" alt="Therac 25 54.gif" width="640" height="360"></a><br>By <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ajzh2074&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Ajzh2074 (page does not exist)">Ajzh2074</a> - <span lang="en">Own work</span>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0" title="Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=90428203">Link</a></p>
<p>With the patient in the correct position, she rotated the turntable again. There were two other positions. One would position an array of magnets between the beam and the patient; these would shape and aim the beam. The other placed a block of metal between the beam and the patient. When struck by a 25MeV beam of electrons, the metal would radiate X-rays.</p>
<p>This patient's prescription was for an electron beam, so she positioned the turntable and left the room. In the room next door, shielded from the radiation, was the control terminal. The technician started keying in the prescription to begin the treatment.</p>
<p>If things were <em>exactly</em> following the routine, she'd be able to communicate with the patient via an intercom, and monitor the patient via a video camera. Sadly, that system had broken down today. Still, this patient had already had a number of treatments, so they knew what to expect, so that communication was hardly necessary. In fact, the Therac-25 and all the supporting equipment were always finicky, so "something doesn't work" practically <em>was</em> part of the routine.</p>
<p>The technician had run this process so many times she started keying in the prescription. She'd become an extremely fast typist, at least on this device, and perhaps <em>too</em> fast. In the field for beam type, she accidentally keyed in "X", for "x-ray". It was a natural mistake, as most patients got x-ray treatments, and it wasn't much of a problem: the computer would see that the turntable was in the wrong position and refuse to dose the patient. She quickly tapped the "UP" arrow on the keyboard to return to the field, corrected the value to "E", for electron, and confirmed the other parameters.</p>
<p>Her finger hovered over the "B" key on the keyboard while she confirmed her data entry. Once she was sure everything was correct, she pressed "B" for "beam start". There was no noise, there never was, but after a moment, the terminal read: "Malfunction 54", and then "Treatment Pause".</p>
<p>Error codes were no surprise. The technicians kept a chart next to the console, which documented all the error codes. In this case, "Malfunction 54" meant a "dose input 2" error.</p>
<p>That may not have explained anything, but the technician was used to the error codes being cryptic. And this was a "treatment pause", which meant the next step was to resume treatment. According to the terminal, no radiation had been delivered yet, so she hit the "P" key to unpause the beam.</p>
<p>That's when she heard the screaming.</p>
<p>The patient had been through a number of these sessions already, and knew they shouldn't feel a thing. The first time the technician activated the beam, however, he felt a burning sensation, which he later described like "hot coffee" being poured on his back. Without any intercom to call for help, he started to get off the treatment table. He was still extricating himself, screaming for help, when the technician unpaused the beam, at which point he felt something like a massive electric shock.</p>
<p>That, at first, was the diagnosis. A malfunction in the machine must have delivered an electric shock. The patient was sent home, and the hospital physicist examined the Therac-25, confirming everything was in working order and there were no signs of trouble. It didn't seem like it would happen again.</p>
<p>The patient had been prescribed a dose of 180 rads as part of a six-week treatment program that would deliver 6,000 rads in total. According to the Therac-25, the patient had received an <em>underdose</em>, a fraction of that radiation. No one knew it yet, but the malfunction had actually delivered between 16,000 and 25,000 rads. The patient seemed fine, but in fact, they were already dead and no one knew it yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>The ETCC incident was not the first, and sadly was not the last malfunction of the Therac-25 system. Between June 1985 and July 1987, there were six accidents involving the Therac-25, manufactured by Atomic Energy Canada Limited (AECL). Each was a severe radiation overdose, which resulted in serious injuries, maimings, and deaths.</p>
<p>As the first incidents started to appear, no one was entirely certain what was happening. Radiation poisoning is hard to diagnose, especially if you don't <em>expect</em> it. As with the ETCC incident, the machine reported an underdose despite overdosing the patient. Hospital physicists even contacted AECL when they suspected an overdose, only to be told such a thing was impossible.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, there was a <em>second</em> overdose at ETCC, and it was around that time that the FDA and the press started to get involved. Early on, there was a great deal of speculation about the cause. Of interest is <a href="https://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/3/11#subj1.1">this comment</a> from the RISKS mailing list from 1986.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is my speculation of what happened: I suspect that the current in the electron beam is probably much greater in X-ray mode (because you want similar dose rates in both modes, and the production of X-rays is more indirect).  So when you select X-rays, I'll bet the target drops into place and the beam current is boosted.  I suspect in this case, the currentwas boosted before the target could move into position, and a very high current electron beam went into the patient.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How could this be allowed to happen?  My guess is that the software people would not have considered it necessary to guard against this failure mode. Machine designers have traditionally used electromechanical interlocks to ensure safety.  Computer control of therapy machines is a fairly recent development and is layered on top of, rather than substituting for, the old electromechanical mechanisms.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The Therac-25 was the first <em>entirely</em> software-controlled radiotherapy device. As that quote from Jacky above points out: most such systems use hardware interlocks to prevent the beam from firing when the targets are not properly configured. The Therac-25 did not.</p>
<p>The software included a number of key modules that ran on a PDP-11. First, there were separate processes for handling each key function of the system: user input, beam alignment, dosage tracking, etc. Each of these processes was implemented in PDP-11 Assembly. Governing these processes was a real-time OS, <em>also</em> implemented in Assembly. All of this software, from the individual processes to the OS itself, were the work of a single software developer.</p>
<p>AECL had every confidence in this software, though, because it wasn't <em>new</em>. The earliest versions of the software appeared on the Therac-6. Development started in 1972, and the software was adapted to the Therac-25 in 1976. The same core was also used on the Therac-20. Within AECL, the attitude was that the software <em>must</em> be safe because they'd been using it for so long.</p>
<p>In fact, when AECL performed their own internal safety analysis of the Therac-25 in 1983, they did so with the following assumptions:</p>
<blockquote>
1) Programming errors have been reduced by extensive testing on a hardware simulator, and under field conditions on teletherapy units. Any residual software errors are not included in the analysis.
2) Program software does not decay due to wear, fatigue, or reproduction errors.
3) Computer software errors are caused by faulty hardware components, and "soft" (random) errors induced by alpha particles or electromagnetic noise.
</blockquote>
<p>In other words: we've used the software for a long time and software always copies and deploys perfectly. So, any bugs we see would have to be transient bugs caused by radiation or hardware errors.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the second incident at ETCC, the hospital physicist took the Therac-25 out of service and worked with the technician to replicate the steps that caused the overdose. It wasn't easy to trigger the "Malfunction 54" error message, especially when they were trying to methodically replicate the exact steps, because as it turned out, if you entered the data <em>slowly</em>, there were no problems.</p>
<p>To trigger the overdose, you needed to type quickly, the kind of speed that an experienced operator might have. The physicist practiced until he could replicate the error, then informed AECL. While he was taking measurements to see how large the overdoses were, AECL called back. They couldn't replicate the issue. "It works on my machine," essentially.</p>
<p>After being coached on the required speed, the AECL technicians went back to it, and confirmed that they could trigger an overdose. When the hospital physicist took measurements, they found roughly 4,000 rads in the overdose. AECL, doing similar tests, triggered overdoses of 25,000 rads. The reality is that, depending on the timing, the output was potentially random.</p>
<p>With that information, the root cause was easier to understand: there was a race condition. Specifically, when the technician mistyped "X" for x-ray, the computer would calculate out the beam activation sequence to deliver a high-energy beam to create x-rays. When the technician hit the "UP" arrow to correct their mistake, it <em>should've</em> forced a recalculation of that activation sequence—but if the user typed too quickly, the UI would update and the recalculation would never happen.</p>
<hr>
<p>By the middle of 1986, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was involved, and demanded that AECL provide a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). What followed was a lengthy process of revisions as AECL would provide their CAP and the FDA would follow up with questions, resulting in new revisions to the CAP.</p>
<p>For example, the FDA reviewed the first CAP revision and noted that it was incomplete. Specifically, it did not include a test plan. AECL responded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>no single test plan and report exists for the software since both hardware and software were tested and exercised separately together for many years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The FDA was not pleased with that, and after more back and forth, replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We also expressed our concern that you did not intend to perform the [test] protocol to future modifications to the software. We believe that rigorous testing must be performed each time a modification is made to ensure the modification does not adversely affect the safety of the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While AECL struggled to include complex tasks like <em>testing</em> in their CAP, they had released instructions that allowed for a temporary fix to prevent future incidents. Unfortunately, in January, 1987, there was another incident, caused by a <em>different</em> software bug.</p>
<p>In this bug, there was a variable shared by multiple processes, meant as a flag to decide whether or not the beam collimator in the turntable needs to be checked to ensure everything is in the correct position. If the value is non-zero, the check needs to be performed. If the value is zero, it does not. Unfortunately, the software would <em>increment</em> the field, and the field was only one byte wide. This meant every 256th increment, the variable would be zero when it should have been non-zero. If that incorrect zero lined up with an operator action, the beam would fire at full energy without the turntable in the right position.</p>
<p>AECL had a fix for that (stop incrementing and just set the value), and amended their CAP to include that fix. The FDA recognized that was probably going to fix the problem, but still had concerns. In an internal memo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are in the position of saying that the proposed CAP can reasonably be expected to correct the deficiencies for which they were developed (Tyler). We cannot say that we are [reasonably] confident about the safety of the entire system…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This back-and-forth continued through a number of CAP revisions. At each step in the process, the FDA found issues with testing. AECL's test process up to this point was simply to run the machine and note if anything went wrong. Since the software had been in use, in some version, for over a decade, they did not see any reason to test <em>the software</em>, and thus had no capacity or plan for actually testing the software when the FDA required it.</p>
<p>The FDA, reviewing some test results, noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, the test data presented to show that the software changes to handle the edit problems in the Therac-25 are appropriate prove the opposite result. … I can only assume the fix is not right, or the data were entered incorrectly.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Eventually, the software <em>was</em> fixed. Legislative and regulatory changes were made to ensure incidents like this couldn't happen in the future, at least not the same way.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that there was <em>one developer</em> who wrote all of this code. They left AECL in 1986, and thankfully for them, no one has ever revealed their identity. And while it may be tempting to lay the blame at their feet—they made every technical choice, they coded every bug—it would be wildly unfair to do that.</p>
<p>With AECL's continued failure to explain how to <em>test</em> their device, it should be clear that the problem was a <em>systemic</em> one. It doesn't matter how good your software developer is; software quality doesn't appear because you have good developers. It's the end result of a process, and that process informs both your software development practices, but also your testing. Your management. Even your sales and servicing.</p>
<p>While the incidents at the ETCC finally drove changes, they <em>weren't</em> the first incidents. Hospital physicists had already reported problems to AECL. At least one patient had already initiated a lawsuit. But that information didn't propagate through the organization; no one put those pieces together to recognize that the device was faulty.</p>
<p>On this site, we joke a lot at the expense of the <a href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Brillant_Paula_Bean">Paula Bean</a>s and <a href="https://thedailywtf.com/articles/coming-to-grips">Roy</a>s of this world. But no matter how incompetent, no matter how reckless, no matter how ignorant the antagonist of a TDWTF article may be, they're part of a system, and that system <em>put them</em> in that position.</p>
<p>Failures in IT are rarely <em>individual</em> failures. They are process failures. They are systemic failures. They are organizational failures. The story of AECL and the Therac-25 illustrates how <em>badly</em> organizational failures can end up.</p>
<p>AECL did not have a software process. They didn't view software as anything more than a component of a larger whole. In that kind of environment, working on safety critical systems, <em>no</em> developer could have been entirely successful. Given that this was a situation where <em>lives</em> were literally on the line, building a system that produced safe, quality software seems like it should have been a priority. It wasn't.</p>
<p>While the Therac-25 incident is ancient history, software has become even more important. While we would hope safety-critical software has rigorous processes, we know that isn't always true. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/09/boeing_737_max_software_fixes/">The 737MAX</a> is an infamous, recent example. But with the importance of software in the modern world, even more trivial software problems can get multiplied at scale. Whether it's <a href="https://www.datascienceexamples.com/racism-and-gender-bias-in-machine-learning-fixes-not-always-easy/">machine learning reinforcing racism</a>, <!-- I could have grabbed thousands of links there -->social networks <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/01/how-social-medias-obsession-with-scale-supercharged-disinformation">turning into cesspools of disinformation</a> or poorly secured IoT devices <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/internet-of-things/into-the-battlefield-a-security-guide-to-iot-botnets">turning into botnets</a>, our software exists and interacts with the world, and has real world consequences. <!-- Full Life Consequences? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxyZaZlaOs --></p>
<p>If nothing else, I hope this article makes you think about the <em>process</em> you use to create software. Is the <em>process</em> built to produce quality? What obstacles to quality are there? Is quality a priority, and if not, <em>why</em> not? Does your process consider quality <em>at scale</em>? You may know your software's failure modes, but do you understand your <em>organization</em>'s failure modes? Its blind spots? The assumptions it makes which may not be valid in all cases? <!-- Not to drift off topic, but one of the most important reasons why we need to encourage diversity in this industry is because the only way to really question assumptions is to *get people involved who don't share those assumptions* --></p>

<p>Let's return for a moment to the race condition that caused the ETCC incidents. This was caused by users hitting the up arrow too quickly, preventing the system from properly registering their edits. While the FDA CAP process was grinding along, AECL wanted to ensure that people could still use the Therac-25 safely, and that meant publishing quick fixes that users could apply to their devices.</p>
<p>This is the letter AECL sent out to address that bug:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SUBJECT: CHANGE IN OPERATING PROCEDURES FOR THE THERAC-25 LINEAR ACCELERATOR<br>
Effective immediately, and until further notice, the key used for moving the cursor back through the prescription sequence (i.e., cursor "UP" inscribed with an upward pointing arrow) must not be used for editing or any other purpose.<br>
To avoid accidental use of this key, the key cap must be removed and the switch contacts fixed in the open position with electrical tape or other insulating material.<br>
For assistance with the latter you should contact your local AECL service representative.<br>
Disabling this key means that if any prescription data entered is incorrect, than "R" reset command must be used and the whole prescription reentered.<br>
For those users of the Multiport option, it also means that editing of dose rate, dose, and time will not be possible between ports.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On one hand, this is a simple instruction that would effectively prevent the ETCC incidents from reoccurring. On the other, it's terrifying to imagine a patient's life hanging on a ripped up keycap and electrical tape.</p>
<hr>
<p>This article is intended as a brief summary of the incident. Most of the technical details in this article come from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041128024227/http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Misc/therac.pdf">this detailed account</a> of the Therac-25 incident. That is <em>the</em> definitive source on the subject, and I recommend reading the whole thing. It contains much more detail, including deeper dives into the software choices and organizational failures.</p>

<p>Oil-funded groups are engaging in strategic harassment to stop scientists from revealing the nature of their politically-linked disinformation networks – in what should be a surprise to nobody.</p>



<p>A new report came out last week from the Climate &amp; Development Lab (CDL) at Brown University, titled “<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/post/legal-entanglements-mapping-connections-of-anti-offshore-wind-groups-and-their-lawyers-in-the-easte">Legal Entanglements: Mapping Connections of Anti-Offshore Wind Groups and their Lawyers in the Eastern United States</a>.”</p>



<p>The study focuses on several examples of law firms with connections to anti-wind groups, the fossil fuel industry, and the American political right wing. These fossil-funded groups have spread disinformation to slow the adoption of clean and cheap wind power, in order to keep America addicted to the poison that the fossil fuel industry wants to keep selling us.</p>



<p>The lab is headed by J Timmons Roberts, but the research was done by various students and faculty at at the lab. The new report builds on<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/anti-offshorewindnetwork"> former research by the CDL</a> cataloguing extensive connections between these groups and the dark money networks that fund the anti-wind movement.</p>	
	



<h2 id="h-why-the-east-coast-needs-offshore-wind">Why the East Coast needs offshore wind</h2>



<p>Offshore wind, especially in the North Atlantic, is a cheap and abundant form of energy that is heretofore relatively untapped in the US. It also has very little environmental cost, given that its carbon emissions and land use are both zero, and wind tends to be quite consistent over the ocean, making it more reliable as a power source.</p>



<p>Many other countries have successfully implemented offshore wind projects to bring this cheap and clean power to their populaces, with particular booms in China, the UK, Vietnam, Germany and several other Northern European countries (like Denmark, where many large wind power companies are based).</p>



<p>And wind is important for the global transition to renewable energy and the fight against climate change. As a zero-emission power source, it’s essential for meeting the US East Coast’s climate and renewable energy goals, and could provide a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/we.1524">huge chunk of the power needs</a> for the entire US Eastern seaboard, where the country’s population is clustered.</p>



<p>However, offshore wind has recently encountered setbacks due to the spread of disinformation from fossil-funded networks, which has made its way into the popular conception and into right-wing politics. (Nevertheless, Americans of all political stripes <a href="https://turnforward.org/june-2025-tarrance-poll/">still support greater deployment of offshore wind</a>)</p>



<h2 id="h-how-and-why-fossil-fuel-companies-oppose-wind">How and why fossil fuel companies oppose wind</h2>



<p>Fossil fuel companies oppose wind power because it would help to wean America off of fossil fuels, displacing coal and methane generation for electricity and enabling greater electrification of the vehicle fleet to wean us off of oil. All of these would result in air quality improvements, cost reductions, health improvements and avoidance of climate change – which are all anathema to the<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38030155/"> most deadly industry the world has ever seen</a>.</p>



<p>So, fossil fuel companies have developed and funded a complicated network of fake public interest groups, politicians and lawyers to oppose wind power by spreading disinformation. And the CDL’s report highlights how certain legal firms have received funding from fossil fuel companies and/or given support to these fake public interest groups in attempts to sue wind projects out of existence.</p>

<p>While many of these lawsuits have been unsuccessful, they can still add delays to a project, making it more expensive and slower to deploy (which then makes your electricity more expensive). In some cases, the delays can result in project cancellation, like when oil billionaire William Koch sued Cape Wind out of existence via a fake public interest group called the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound.</p>



<p>In the report, five specific legal networks are highlighted in particular, showing how each is related to fossil fuels and science denial. The networks have provided representation, written comments, filed lawsuits and otherwise spread disinformation in an attempt to stop the public good that offshore wind power represents.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nature-of-the-disinformation">The nature of the disinformation</h2>



<p>The disinformation largely focuses on the North Atlantic Right Whale, a whale whose population is currently experiencing an “unusual mortality event” due to changing climate and Atlantic shipping and fishing.</p>



<p>Anti-wind groups have invoked laws like the Endangers Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, despite the fact that the products of the industry they are funded by are <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/12/12/oil-funded-lobbyists-are-trying-to-trick-you-into-killing-more-whales/">the deadliest thing for marine life</a>.</p>



<p>Burning oil raises both the temperature and <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html">acidity</a> of our oceans, disrupting marine ecosystems in profound ways. For example, North Atlantic krill populations have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02159-1">dropped by 50%</a> due to ocean warming driven by fossil fuel use. Krill are the main food source for the North Atlantic Right Whale, which anti-wind groups claim to be interested in protecting, but are in fact aiding the decline of.</p>



<p>Further, whale populations are directly harmed by vessel strikes, which are <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2017-2025-north-atlantic-right-whale-unusual-mortality-event">the leading direct cause of death</a> for North Atlantic Right Whales in recent years. And<a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints"> 29% of those vessels are carrying oil across the globe</a> – shipments that would be unnecessary if transportation were powered by clean renewable energy instead of deadly oil. Not only that, but some of the exact same groups that oppose wind also opposed <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/01/2022-16211/amendments-to-the-north-atlantic-right-whale-vessel-strike-reduction-rule">draft regulations to reduce vessel strikes</a>, showing that they are actually interested in continuing to harm whales, not protecting them.</p>



<h2 id="h-law-firm-responds-to-the-truth-by-pressuring-university-to-hide-it">Law firm responds to the truth by pressuring university to hide it</h2>



<p>One of the law firms highlighted in the report, Marzulla Law, sent a letter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/climate/brown-university-offshore-wind-marzulla.html?unlocked_article_code=1.g08.cAcd.MyLJWrRWdIhk&amp;smid=url-share">threatening its authors</a>. Marzulla Law said it would complain to mommy… I mean, Brown’s funding sources, including the US Department of Energy which a former oil executive is currently squatting as the head of, in an attempt to get the entirety of Brown University’s funding pulled if the CDL doesn’t self-censor its research findings.</p>



<p>The CDL itself is not funded by the Department of Energy, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-25/offshore-wind-opponents-target-work-of-brown-university-researcher?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjEzMzE2MCwiZXhwIjoxNzU2NzM3OTYwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUpUS05HUEZIT0EwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIxMjIyNkM4MjZDN0Q0REM1OUFDRDFGQkVERjdENEFEMCJ9.K2jKVgvuogRnmk49m-UBSS4mDgVMhj8tb8zQA3E7vkw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Roberts said to Bloomberg</a>, so the threat isn’t even related to CDL’s funding sources, but to Brown University’s as a whole.</p>







<p>Marzulla Law represented one of the disinformation groups which the CDL has <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/falmouth/anti-wind-group-uses-deceit-delay-denial-sabotage-clean-energy">highlighted before</a>, the deceptively-named “Green Oceans.” Green Oceans opposed the Revolution Wind project, which was <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm">halted on Friday</a> over fake national security concerns by a convicted felon who is <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-3/?wpmobileexternal=true">Constitutionally barred from holding office in the US</a>, despite the project already being 80% finished, costing the US billions in waste and increased utility bills.</p>



<p>Mike Herr, a spokesman for Green Oceans said “these oft-repeated lies are designed to discredit the messenger while preventing the public from absorbing the substance of our valid and well-researched concerns,” which <strong>is itself an example of the very thing he’s wrongly accusing the researchers of</strong>.</p>



<p>Herr’s organization<a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/falmouth/anti-wind-group-uses-deceit-delay-denial-sabotage-clean-energy"> lies about offshore wind</a>, and their attack on science (through their law firm) is designed to discredit the messenger while preventing the public from absorbing the substance of valid and well-researched concerns: the connection between fossil fuels, the republican party, and disinformation that keeps us from embracing superior forms of cheaper, cleaner energy like wind.</p>

<p>Discrediting science and knowledge is increasingly becoming a feature of the American right wing, which is currently on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-14/princeton-plans-new-budget-cuts-as-pressure-from-trump-builds?srnd=undefined">crusade against universities</a> as it <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/08/19/the-growing-partisan-divide-in-views-of-higher-education-2/">tries to make America stupider</a>.</p>



<p>Roberts called Marzulla’s response “strategic harassment&nbsp;to shut me up and waste my time and make me more cautious,” which is a common reaction faced by truth-tellers in this day and age, particularly when funding from the largest and most deadly industry on the planet, which has <a href="https://commonhome.georgetown.edu/topics/climateenergy/defense-denial-and-disinformation-uncovering-the-oil-industrys-early-knowledge-of-climate-change/">repeatedly shown its interest in propaganda</a>, is involved.</p>




	<p>For its part, Brown University did not comment on Marzulla’s demands, but did state that “Scholars shape their own research and course of instruction at Brown. One principle that is core to research at Brown is the ability for scholars to discuss contested topics and themes and to have those topics openly debated.”</p>



<p>However, Brown is one of the universities which recently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5486581/brown-university-agreement-restore-federal-funding">kowtowed to the idiotic demands of an inept moron</a>, making its words about academic independence ring somewhat hollow. We’ll have to see if they step up to defend truth this time around, or bend the knee to one of the dumbest people on the planet once again, if it comes to that.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 05:14:19 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/2025/08/26/uncomfortable-questions-android-developer-verification.html">https://commonsware.com/blog/2025/08/26/uncomfortable-questions-android-developer-verification.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45035699">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p><a href="https://www.iceblock.app/">ICEBlock</a> “is an innovative, completely anonymous crowdsourced platform that allows users to report Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity with just two taps on their phone.”</p>

<p>The developer of ICEBlock <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/business/video/iceblock-app-immigration-duffy-digvid">disclosed his identity</a>. In addition to receiving threats of federal prosecution over the app, the developer has faced other backlash, including
<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/iceblock-app-founder-wife-fired-doj-carolyn-feinstein-2102214">his wife being fired from a federal government job</a>.</p>

<p>This is one recent example demonstrating that app developer anonymity has impacts and that the lack of such anonymity can cause harm.</p>

<hr>

<p>With that example in mind, and in the spirit of <a href="https://commonsware.com/blog/2020/09/23/uncomfortable-questions-app-signing.html">a previous issue</a>, I have some questions with regards to their proposed
<a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification/guides">developer verification program</a>. To Google, these questions might be uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1. What considerations were taken into account with regards to developers with legitimate reasons for anonymity?</strong></p>

<p>For example, suppose that a developer creates an ICEBlock-like app, but one that supports
Android, which <a href="https://www.iceblock.app/android">ICEBlock does not</a>. Let’s call this workalike app “ICE Scream”. Given the experiences of ICEBlock’s developer, the developer of ICE Scream may have concerns over their identity being disclosed. How would Google like to address such scenarios?</p>

<p><strong>Question 2. Which civil society organizations (e.g., EFF and AccessNow in the US) did Google engage with to review your plans, and what were the results of those engagements?</strong></p>

<p>Organizations such as these have a long track record of dealing with the balance of equities related to privacy and security. A theoretical developer of “ICE Scream” would be well-advised to try reaching out (anonymously) to such organizations for advice. Similarly, their expertise and outside opinions should be of value to Google while drafting programs such as developer verification, and so one hopes that Google availed themselves of such assistance. How did that go?</p>

<p><strong>Question 3. Why does <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s privacy policy</a> allow Google to share “personal information” with any “businesses or persons”?</strong></p>

<p>Google’s privacy policy states that it provides “personal information to [Google’s] affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us”, with no obvious restrictions on who or what constitutes “trusted businesses or persons” and no obvious restrictions on what those parties can do with the personal information. How does Google wish developers, such as the ICE Scream developer, to interpret that policy?</p>

<p><strong>Question 4. How will apps be developed starting in 2027, as app development uses <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#debug-mode">debug keystores</a>, and those keystores do not seem to be part of the Android Developer Verification process? Will it no longer be possible to test apps under development on Google-certified production hardware?</strong></p>

<p>Debug keystores are designed to be transient, as there are few repercussions from replacing those keystores as needed. As such, debug keystores can come and go, especially in environments like classrooms and continuous integration (CI) servers. It seems unrealistic to have these all be registered on a Google-supplied Web site, and it seems hostile to require anyone who wants to <em>learn</em> Android app development to file “papers, please”. How does Google wish for this to work?</p>

<p><strong>Question 5. Similarly, how will apps be developed starting in 2027, as app development often uses duplicate package names (e.g., in educational settings), and duplicate package names are banned? For example, how will developers be able to build and run Google’s own sample projects?</strong></p>

<p>I have a particular interest here, as I am <a href="https://commonsware.com/catalog">the author of many books on Android app development</a>. I expected readers to be able to download and run the samples, but under this program, it seems like at most one person on the entire planet can do that. Everybody else will get error messages until they go in and change the package name… which will be beyond the skills of many people just learning Android app development. How does Google wish for this to work?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<header><p>26 Aug 2025</p></header><p>In 2020, Apple
released the M1 with a custom GPU. We got to work reverse-engineering
the hardware and porting Linux. Today, you can run Linux on a range of
M1 and M2 Macs, with almost all hardware working: wireless, audio, and
full graphics acceleration.</p>
<p>Our story begins in December 2020, when <a href="https://marcan.st/">Hector Martin</a> kicked off <a href="https://asahilinux.org/">Asahi Linux</a>. I was working for <a href="http://collabora.com/">Collabora</a> working on Panfrost, the open
source Mesa3D driver for Arm Mali GPUs. Hector put out a public call for
guidance from upstream open source maintainers, and I bit. I just
intended to give some quick pointers. Instead, I <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">bought myself a Christmas present</a> and
got to work. In between my university coursework and Collabora work, I
poked at the <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html">shader
instruction set</a>.</p>
<p>One thing led to another. Within a few weeks, I <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-2.html">drew a
triangle</a>.</p>
<p>In 3D graphics, once you can draw a triangle, you can do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKmzEgpEdNw">anything</a>.</p>
<p>Pretty soon, I started work on a <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-3.html">shader
compiler</a>. After my final exams that semester, I took a few days off
from Collabora to bring up <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-4.html">an OpenGL
driver</a> capable of spinning gears with my new compiler.</p>
<p>Over the next year, I kept <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-5.html">reverse-engineering</a>
and improving the driver until <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-6.html">it could run 3D
games on macOS</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://lina.yt/">Asahi Lina</a> wrote a kernel
driver for the Apple GPU. My userspace OpenGL driver ran on macOS,
leaving her kernel driver as the missing piece for an open source
graphics stack. In December 2022, we <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-7.html">shipped graphics
acceleration in Asahi Linux</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2023, I started my final semester in my Computer Science
program at the <a href="https://www.utoronto.ca/">University of
Toronto</a>. For years I juggled my courses with my part-time job and my
hobby driver. I faced the same question as my peers: what will I do
after graduation?</p>
<p>Maybe Panfrost? I started reverse-engineering of the Mali Midgard GPU
back in 2017, when I was still in high school. That led to an internship
at Collabora in 2019 once I graduated, turning into my job throughout
four years of university. During that time, Panfrost grew from a kid’s
pet project based on blackbox reverse-engineering, to a professional
driver engineered by a team with Arm’s backing and hardware
documentation. I did what I set out to do, and the project succeeded
beyond my dreams. <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/passing-reins-panfrost.html">It was
time to move on</a>.</p>
<p>What <em>did</em> I want to do next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish what I started with the M1. Ship a great driver.</li>
<li>Bring full, conformant OpenGL drivers to the M1. Apple’s drivers are
not conformant, but we should strive for the industry standard.</li>
<li>Bring full, conformant Vulkan to Apple platforms, disproving the
myth that Vulkan isn’t suitable for Apple hardware.</li>
<li>Bring Proton gaming to Asahi Linux. Thanks to Valve’s work for the
Steam Deck, Windows games can run better on Linux than even on Windows.
Why not reap those benefits on the M1?</li>
</ul>
<p>Panfrost was my challenge until we “won”. My next challenge? Gaming
on Linux on M1.</p>
<p>Once I finished my coursework, I started full-time on gaming on
Linux. Within a month, we shipped <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/opengl3-on-asahi-linux.html">OpenGL 3.1
on Asahi Linux</a>. A few weeks later, we passed <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/first-conformant-m1-gpu-driver.html">official
conformance for OpenGL ES 3.1</a>. That put us at feature parity with
Panfrost. I wanted to go further.</p>
<p>OpenGL (ES) 3.2 requires geometry shaders, a legacy feature not
supported by either Arm or Apple hardware. The proprietary OpenGL
drivers emulate geometry shaders with compute, but there was no open
source prior art to borrow. Even though multiple Mesa drivers need
geometry/tessellation emulation, nobody did the work to get there.</p>
<p>My early progress on OpenGL was fast thanks to the mature common code
in Mesa. It was time to pay it forward. Over the rest of the year, I
implemented geometry/tessellation shader emulation. And also the rest of
the owl. In January 2024, I passed conformance for the full <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/conformant-gl46-on-the-m1.html">OpenGL
4.6</a> specification, finishing up OpenGL.</p>
<p>Vulkan wasn’t too bad, either. I polished the OpenGL driver for a few
months, but once I started typing a Vulkan driver, I passed <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vk13-on-the-m1-in-1-month.html">1.3
conformance</a> in a few weeks.</p>
<p>What remained was wiring up the geometry/tessellation emulation to my
shiny new Vulkan driver, since those are required for Direct3D. Et
voilà, <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/aaa-gaming-on-m1.html">Proton
games</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, <a href="https://chaos.social/@karolherbst">Karol
Herbst</a> passed OpenCL 3.0 conformance on the M1, running my compiler
atop his “rusticl” frontend.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when the Vulkan 1.4 specification was published, we were
ready and <a href="https://rosenzweig.io/blog/vulkan-14-sur-asahi-linux.html">shipped
a conformant implementation on the same day</a>.</p>
<p>After that, I implemented sparse texture support, unlocking Direct3D
12 via Proton.</p>
<p>…Now what?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ship a great driver? <strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Conformant OpenGL 4.6, OpenGL ES 3.2, and OpenCL 3.0?
<strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Conformant Vulkan 1.4? <strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Proton gaming? <strong>Check</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a wrap.</p>
<p>We’ve succeeded beyond my dreams. The challenges I chased, I have
tackled. The drivers are fully upstream in Mesa. Performance isn’t too
bad. With the Vulkan on Apple myth busted, conformant Vulkan is now
coming to macOS via <a href="https://www.lunarg.com/a-vulkan-on-metal-mesa-3d-graphics-driver/">LunarG’s
KosmicKrisp</a> project building on my work.</p>
<p>Satisfied, I am now stepping away from the Apple ecosystem. My
friends in the Asahi Linux orbit will carry the torch from here. As for
me?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introduction-to-the-xe-hpg-architecture.html">Onto
the next challenge!</a></p>
<p><a href="https://rosenzweig.io/">Back to home</a></p>

    <h2 dir="auto">Summary</h2>
<p dir="auto">Malicious versions of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nx" rel="nofollow"><code>nx</code> package</a>, as well as some supporting plugin packages, were published to npm, containing code that scans the file system, collects credentials, and posts them to GitHub as a repo under user's accounts.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Affected Versions of <code>nx</code></h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>21.5.0
<ul dir="auto">

<p dir="auto">These versions have since been removed from NPM as of 6:20 AM EDT</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Attack Vector</h2>
<p dir="auto">At this time, we believe an npm token was compromised which had publish rights to the affected packages.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Malicious Behavior</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">Credentials published as a Github repo</h3>
<p dir="auto">The compromised package contained a <code>postinstall</code> script that scanned user's file system for text files, collected paths, and credentials upon installing the package. This information was then posted as an encoded string to a github repo under the user's Github account.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Modification to <code>$HOME/.zshrc</code> and <code>$HOME/.bashrc</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">The malicious <code>postinstall</code> script also modified the <code>.zshrc</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> which are run whenever a terminal is launched to include <code>sudo shutdown -h 0</code> which prompt users for their system password and if provided, would shutdown the machine immediately.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Timeline</h2>
<p dir="auto">All of the following times are in EDT.</p>
<p dir="auto">August 26, 2025:<br>
<strong>6:32 PM</strong> - v21.5.0 of <code>nx</code>, <code>@nx/devkit</code>, <code>@nx/js</code>, <code>@nx/workspace</code>, <code>@nx/node</code> and <code>@nx/eslint</code> was published, as well as v3.2.0 of <code>@nx/key</code> and <code>@nx/enterprise-cloud</code><br>

<strong>8:33 PM</strong> - Another <a href="https://github.com/nrwl/nx/issues/32523" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/nrwl/nx/issues/32523/hovercard">GitHub issue</a> was posted which was closed in favor of the first issue.<br>
<strong>8:37 PM</strong> - v21.8.0 of only <code>nx</code> was published<br>
<strong>8:37 PM</strong> - v20.12.0 of only <code>nx</code> was published<br>
<strong>9:54 PM</strong> - A GitHub user reported the issue to NPM support.<br>
<strong>9:58 PM</strong> - A member of the team noticed the GitHub issue and posted it on Slack. Other members started to get involved and tried to get in contact with the token owner and the owner of nrwl org.<br>
<strong>10:44 PM</strong> - NPM removed the affected versions and all publish tokens from all users from the registry, preventing any further publishes to any <code>nx</code> or related packages</p>
<p dir="auto">August 27, 2025:<br>
<strong>5:05 AM</strong> - Github started making the repositories private somehow so that they do not show up in the search<br>
<strong>6:20 AM</strong> -  NPM removed affected versions of other identified packages<br>
<strong>11:57 AM</strong> -  All NPM packages under Nx (affected or not) have been set to require 2FA and CANNOT be published with npm tokens any longer. All NPM packages have also been changed to use the new <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers" rel="nofollow">Trusted Publisher</a> mechanism which does not utilize npm tokens.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Immediate Actions Required</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">For all users, check if you were impacted</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Check this <a href="https://github.com/%5BGithubSlug%5D?tab=repositories&amp;q=s1ngularity-repository">https://github.com/[GithubSlug]?tab=repositories&amp;q=s1ngularity-repository</a> to see if your a repo was published to your Github account.</li>
<li>Download the file in the repo for your own records.</li>
<li>Then, remove the repo from GitHub.</li>
<li>E-mail <a href="mailto:security@nrwl.io">security@nrwl.io</a> and we will instruct you on how to decode the file so you are aware what information was leaked</li>
<li>Rotate your credentials and tokens on all of your accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h3 dir="auto">For all users, stop using the malicious versions</h3>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Check if the version of nx you are using was a malicious version
npm ls nx

# If using affected versions, update immediately:
npm uninstall nx &amp;&amp; npm install nx@latest

# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force"><pre><span><span>#</span> Check if the version of nx you are using was a malicious version</span>
npm ls nx

<span><span>#</span> If using affected versions, update immediately:</span>
npm uninstall nx <span>&amp;&amp;</span> npm install nx@latest

<span><span>#</span> Clear npm cache</span>
npm cache clean --force</pre></div>
<h3 dir="auto">For Users Who were compromised:</h3>
<p dir="auto">Refer to the section above to see if you were compromised. If so, do the following.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Rotate npm tokens:</strong> Visit <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.npmjs.com/</a> and rotate your tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Rotate Github Tokens:</strong> Visit <a href="https://www.github.com/">https://www.github.com/</a> and rotate your tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Change Github Credentials:</strong> Change passwords for Github</li>
<li><strong>Change your passwords</strong> for any other services you use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Preventative measures implemented before the incident</h2>
<p dir="auto">We had several preventative measures in place before the incident some of which include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>2FA Enforcement:</strong> All maintainers under the nrwl org had to have 2FA enabled on their accounts. (2FA was not required to publish but it was required to login to the accounts)</li>
<li>Provenance was attached to recent versions of Nx
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This does not prevent installing the package but it did provide a way to verify the integrity of new versions of <code>nx</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Remediation and Preventative Measures Taken</h2>
<p dir="auto">We have taken the following actions to remediate this issue, prevent further issues, also ensure validity of future packages.</p>
<ul>
<li> Deprecated all malicious package versions</li>
<li> Restored <code>21.4.1</code> (a valid version) as <code>latest</code></li>
<li> Revoked possibly compromised personal account access, even though single compromised token seems most likely at this time</li>
<li> Rotated all team NPM and GitHub tokens</li>
<li> Audit GitHub and NPM activities across the organization for suspicious activities</li>
<li> Updated Publish access for <code>nx</code> to require 2FA or automation</li>
<li> Posted this advisory</li>
<li> The <code>nx</code> package now requires <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers#supported-cicd-providers" rel="nofollow">Trusted Providers</a> methodology of publishing via our <code>.github/publish.yml</code> workflow in the <code>nrwl/nx</code> repo.</li>
<li> Remove NPM tokens from our pipeline now that we're using Trusted Providers on NPM</li>
<li> All NPM packages under Nx (the company) including <code>nx</code> have been set to require 2FA and cannot be published with access tokens</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This advisory will be updated when there is more information available.</p>

Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.</span><span id="piano-gate"><p>On August 15, 1977, at the Big Ear radio telescope observatory at Ohio State University, a narrowband radio signal was received. A few days later, astronomer Jerry Ehman reviewed the data and noticed the signal sequence, which lasted for a full 72 seconds. In the margin next to the printout, he simply wrote <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/what-was-the-wow-signal-and-why-is-it-so-famous-74576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Wow!"</a>, and thus the puzzling signal had a name that would stick for the next 43 years at least.</p><p>The signal has, so far, defied explanation, and that's not for a lack of trying. Researchers argued the case for it being a <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-wow-signal-was-likely-the-radio-emission-of-a-comet-42054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">comet passing through</a> the area Big Ear was listening to, only for that to be <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-wow-signal-sorted-not-so-fast-42099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completely refuted</a> about two days later by the team that detected the Wow! signal in the first place, as a comet would have produced a diffuse signal given the large area they cover, rather than the abruptly cut-off signal that was received.</p><p>The signal has been a source of speculation in the "aliens are out there" community, and not without reason. No other signal like it has been detected before or since. It was in a range of frequencies close to the <a href="http://www.setileague.org/askdr/hydrogen.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydrogen line</a>, which is relatively free from background noise, making it a good range to pick were we to try and <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/if-aliens-really-do-exist-how-can-we-find-them-36181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communicate with other civilizations ourselves</a>. On top of that, the team themselves believed it to be a good candidate for extraterrestrial life.</p><p>&nbsp;"The 'Wow!' signal is highly suggestive of extraterrestrial intelligent origin," Ohio State University Radio Observatory director John Kraus wrote in a <a href="https://technosearch.seti.org/sites/default/files/2018-09/WOW%20official.pdf" target="_blank" id="isPasted">letter to Carl Sagan in 1994</a>, "but little more can be said until it returns for further study."</p><p><span contenteditable="false" draggable="true"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r6rPNPVQp0Y?&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span><span class="fr-mk" style="display: none;">&nbsp;</span></iframe></span></p><p>Since then, the signal has been the subject of many studies, but it has never returned. In a new attempt to narrow down what it might be, a team of scientists re-analyzed decades of data from the Big Ear telescope using modern signal analysis techniques, as well as analyzing data which had previously been unpublished, producing two not as yet peer-reviewed papers on the topic.</p><p>First up, the team found that the signal was very unlikely to have been the result of interference in the telescope itself, or of terrestrial origin. The team found strong statistical evidence that the signal was not the result of radio frequency interference (RFI).</p><p id="isPasted">"If this RFI is persistent, it would take approximately six millennia of uninterrupted observations to achieve a signal analogous to the Wow! Signal from random RFI occurrences," the team explains in paper II.</p><p>Looking at other possible sources, including <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/87-satellites-sent-to-space-in-the-last-24-hours-space-is-becoming-ever-more-crowded-78997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">satellites</a>, the team found this to be unlikely as well. Most satellites of the time were not in the area of the sky identified by the team, orbiting on different planes. While the team suggested that satellites which have slowly come out of orbit could be a source, or a Soviet satellite occupying this orbit, they believe this is unlikely too. This is because they would spend only a few fractions of a second in front of the telescope, rather than the 72 seconds necessary to replicate the Wow! signal.</p><p>"A continuous signal from an orbiting satellite will need to be at an orbit beyond the Moon to reproduce the pattern," they added.</p><p>So, what is it? While the team don't yet have an answer, they have made a lot of progress, for instance finding that the signal was much more powerful than had previously been predicted at 250 Janskys, four times larger than had previously been estimated.</p><p>“Our results don’t solve the mystery of the Wow! Signal,” lead author Professor Abel Méndez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo, explained in a <a href="https://phl.upr.edu/wow?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>. “But they give us the clearest picture yet of what it was and where it came from. This new precision allows us to target future observations more effectively than ever before.”</p><p>The main clue identified by the team from the "Aricebo Wow" project were two similar signals in 1977 and 1978 (dubbed Wow2 and Wow3) which showed similar characteristics to the original "Wow!" signal, though far less intense. The team believes that the original team studying the Wow! signal were intrigued by these signals as well, looking at their own notes.</p><p id="isPasted">"It is clear that the Ohio SETI team were interested in these signals, as evidenced by their circling. We believe that they recognized these signals as compact cold Hi clouds, after corroborating their appearance in multiple scans," the team write in paper II. "We searched for the coordinates of these signals in the HI4PI survey and confirmed their association with compact Hi clouds."</p><p>For the team, this suggests that the Wow! signal could have a common origin in these cold clouds of hydrogen in the interstellar medium (ISM). In paper I from the Aricebo Wow project, they go further and suggest a possible cause of the signal.</p><p id="isPasted">"We postulate that the Wow! Signal was a superradiance event that produced a maser-like flare from a small cold Hi cloud," the team writes in their study.&nbsp;</p><p>"We observed from the Arecibo Observatory narrowband signals (∆ν ≤ 10 kHz) similar to the Wow! Signal near the hydrogen line, though significantly weaker. These signals are attributed to small cold Hi cloud regions within the galactic ISM. We propose that the Wow! Signal was caused by the abrupt brightening of the hydrogen line of these clouds triggered by an intense radiation source, such as a magnetar flare or a soft gamma repeater," they add.</p><div data-asset-id="86035" data-reactroot=""><div><picture title=""><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-l.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-l.png" type="image/png"><source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-m.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width: 600px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-m.png" type="image/png"><source media="(max-width: 300px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-s.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(max-width: 300px)" srcset="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi-cloud-s.png" type="image/png"><img data-asset-id="86035" src="https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/80561/iImg/86035/hi%20cloud.png" alt="Figure explaining how a distant magnetar could excite a cold HI cloud and result in the Wow signal." title="Figure explaining how a distant magnetar could excite a cold HI cloud and result in the Wow signal." loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><p>One hypothesis for the cause of the signal.</p><p>Image credit: PHL @ UPR Aricebo (Méndez et al., 2024), <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CC BY 4.0</a></p></figcaption></div><p>Though this is an intriguing possibility – and magnetars are often suspected for <a href="https://www.iflscience.com/brightest-fast-radio-burst-yet-discovered-130-million-light-years-away-in-our-cosmic-neighborhood-80516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">producing weird signals</a> – the team cannot rule out other potential causes in the cosmos.

<p>Sometimes a merge request (MR) doesn't merit a code review (CR) because AI was used in a bad way that harms the team or the project. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Code deletion would improve the MR a lot.</li>
<li>You don't know the basics of the language you submitted.</li>
<li>Documentation spam.</li>
<li>Blatantly inconsistent.</li>
<li>Edge case overload.</li>
<li>Adding pointless or deprecated dependencies without knowing why.</li>
</ol>
<p>If I decline your AI code MR with no further comments and send you this page then some of these conditions were met.</p>
<p>Despite some <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/">recent research</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iHjZGjRFtW3KiQ73U8T0n">discussions on it</a> I know that AI can be helpful in writing code. However AI misuse is also a new phenomenon and we need guidelines to help identify it. This page was written in 2025 and I expect the tools and guidelines to evolve.</p>
<h2>Vocabulary</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge Request (MR)</strong>: when a programmer submits proposed changes to a project in a structured way. This makes it easy for anyone to see the differences and review the changes. Also called a <strong>Pull Request</strong> like on GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Code Review (CR)</strong>: when another programmer reviews a MR, provides feedback or improvements, and approves or rejects the changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why me?</h2>
<p>I feel like I'm in a good position to write about this because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm a senior computer scientist for AI and cloud. I've been a technical supervisor to about 20 students and juniors.</li>
<li>I have degrees and work experience in both computer science and education.</li>
<li>I know code and AI. My AI project has a million installs and monthly income.</li>
<li>I spend a lot of personal time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCghJTNTO9kcDeUFXMuSDGLQ">enjoying</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lastweekinai/videos">exploring</a>, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/montreal-ai-ml-meetup-group/">discussing</a> AI news and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TwoMinutePapers">breakthroughs</a>.</li>
<li>I don't need a job and I'm not selling anything. I'm not an investor or CEO shilling AI slop and I don't get ad revenue for flaming AI.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Why do code reviews?</h2>
<p>There's thousands of opinions and articles. Here's a <a href="https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html">good one from Google</a>. Instead of rehashing that, let's focus on what AI misuse threatens. With good code reviews:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authors learn and improve.</li>
<li>Reviewers learn and improve.</li>
<li>We sanity check important changes.</li>
<li>We minimize mental load for both humans and AI.</li>
<li>We get consistent and simple code.</li>
<li>Every MR makes the project better.</li>
<li>Authors take responsibility for their code and can justify it.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Reasons for no CR</h2>
<h3>1) Code deletion would improve the MR a lot.</h3>
<p>Can code be trivially deleted?</p>
<p>This violates the CR goals "sanity check" and "mental load". For example a setup script handling operating systems that we don't even have in our org. Not only should the author do this basic cleanup, but now they're placing an added burden on the reviewer to do it for them. In 2025 AI is not in a state where I'm comfortable running it in production with zero human review.</p>
<h3>2) You don't know the basics of the language you submitted.</h3>
<p>This violates the CR goal "authors learn". How can my feedback improve you as a software developer if you don't understand your own code? Going through you is not the best way for me to give feedback to your AI.</p>
<h3>3) Documentation spam.</h3>
<p>One example I've seen is two nearly identical copies of documentation in two different formats.</p>
<p>This violates "reviewers learn" and "make the project better". </p>
<p>If an author didn't trim or even read the AI generated documentation I think "they don't value my time or the time of my team". It's not the responsibility of a reviewer to edit 300 words of AI slop because the author didn't write the 3 words "keep it short" in their prompt.</p>
<h3>4) Blatantly inconsistent.</h3>
<p>Common examples I see are using new frameworks or styles for logging and unit tests.</p>
<p>This violates the CR goals "consistency" and "mental load". To understand a software project humans and AI may need to understand 50 concepts at once. Do we want them to have to consider 200 instead? Failing to manage complexity and consistency paralyzes a project once no human or AI is smart enough to improve it further.</p>
<h3>5) Edge case overload.</h3>
<p>This violates the CR goals "sanity check" and "make the project better". Handling many new unusual edge cases likely means the author didn't test all the code.</p>
<p>If we implement a feature at the cost of introducing twenty bugs with untested edge cases, that does not make the project better. It's like taking one step forward (progress) but falling into a mud pit.</p>
<p>Similarly, AI slop may desperately catch an exhaustive list of all exceptions to "handle all cases". But the AI isn't handling the cases. It's just suppressing the valid exception or writing a non-standard error message.</p>
<h3>6) Adding pointless or deprecated dependencies without knowing why.</h3>
<p>This violates the CR goal "reviewers learn" and "take responsibility for your code". A reviewer might ask "why are we using this new thing here?" The author shouldn't respond "I have no idea, the AI did it." This may teach the team to use a deprecated tool, or the wrong tool for the job.</p>
<h2>Maybe this is fine.</h2>
<p><img alt="ai slop this is fine" src="https://blog.stuartspence.ca/images/ai-slop-this-is-fine.webp" width="40%"></p>
<p>None of these are hard rules. I'm more inclined to accept an AI generated MR or give a CR to one if:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code is temporary or a one-shot analysis with no long term maintenance requirements. If it works it works!</li>
<li>The MR includes an explanation of why AI was used, how much, why, and what extra steps the author took to validate it.</li>
<li>This is an edge feature and not a core component.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenging Times</h2>
<p>As a team lead, teacher, and I think nice guy I'm struggling with how to confront juniors when I feel their MR harms them, or the team, or the project. Why did the junior submit AI code? Was it a smart decision or just laziness? Do I harshly confront them and call it AI slop or do something else?</p>
<p>It's not always clear to me when it's a good use of AI that I should support with a full CR, or when it's a bad use of AI that I need to confront by rejecting it entirely. For me, just writing this page has helped.</p>
<p>Nobody has years of experience understanding how AI slop impacts technical debt or learning. If software development is changing in a good way then team leads need to change with it. If software development is changing in a bad way then we need to resist.</p>
