      <div itemprop="articleBody"><p>TAMPA, Fla. — The FDA released a report saying that marijuana does have a legitimate use for medical purposes and recommended the US Drug Enforcement Agency change its classification from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3.</p><p>“The definition of a schedule 1 drug says it has no health benefits to it, and, so, obviously, there’s been plenty of research that has documented the multitudes of ways that cannabis can be helpful,” said Dr. David Berger with Wholistic ReLeaf.</p><p>Though not all in the medical community agree, many people swear by the medicinal effects of marijuana to help treat symptoms of cancer, anxiety, PTSD and epilepsy. </p><p>“It’s no longer appropriate to say that there’s no medical benefit when there are hundreds if not thousands of medical studies that show the opposite,” explained Dr. Berger.</p><p>As a Schedule 1 drug, marijuana is in the same category as some of the hardest drugs like heroin and LSD, which means it’s classified as being more dangerous than fentanyl and methamphetamine. </p><p>“What happens after this is the federal government has more decisions to make as to what they’re going to do next,” said Dr. Berger.</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services formally recommended that the DEA classify marijuana as Schedule 3 in August of last year after the Biden Administration asked them to review how the drug is classified under federal law. </p><p>Earlier this year, Senate Democrats urged Biden to deschedule the drug entirely, meaning you would not need a doctor’s authorization to use marijuana.</p>

The discovery, experts say, could pave the way for new treatments and possibly new methods of screening.</p><p>Colon cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States and is expected to kill more than 53,000 people in the nation in 2024, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank">American Cancer Society</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rates are rising sharply among younger people: The percentage of people younger than 55 diagnosed with colon cancer <a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21772" target="_blank">almost doubled</a> between 1995 and 2019, leaping from 11% to 20% of cases. What’s more, these cases are often diagnosed at <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-deaths-younger-men-women-report-rcna134084" target="_blank">later, more aggressive stages</a>.</p><p>Experts are still struggling to explain the shift.</p><p>“Colorectal cancer is very treatable when caught early, but the cases in younger people are increasing and we don’t know why,” said Dr. Flavio Rocha, a surgical oncologist and physician in chief at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University’s Knight Cancer Institute, who was not involved in the study.&nbsp;</p><p>The new research doesn’t answer that question; it’s far too early to implicate this bacteria in the rise in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-early-signs-symptoms-young-adults-rcna82629" target="_blank">cases in younger people</a>. What’s more, most of the patients in the study were over the age of 50.</p><p>But the findings raise “the question as to whether there are elevated levels of this bacterium in young onset colorectal cancer which is on the rise globally for unknown reasons,” said co-lead study author Susan Bullman, an assistant professor of human biology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.</p><h2><strong>Bacteria with a secret</strong></h2><p>Scientists have suspected a link between the bacteria, called Fusobacterium nucleatum, and colorectal cancer growth for almost a decade. The bacteria is usually only found in the mouth, far from the colon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the mouth, it’s one of the most common types of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bad-breath-certain-types-probiotic-bacteria-may-help-rcna62671" target="_blank">disease-causing bacteria</a>, linked to gum disease and plaque buildup. But it was unclear how it could withstand the journey through the gut and eventually invade tumor cells in places in the body where these types of bacteria usually don’t survive.</p><p>In the study, Bullman and her colleagues looked at the bacterial makeup of almost 200 colorectal tumors, as well as stool samples from more than 1,200 people, half of whom did not have cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>What they learned was that the bacteria was a bit more complicated than once thought. Namely, it has two distinct subspecies, one of which appears to shield colorectal tumors from cancer-fighting drugs.&nbsp;</p><p>“It acts like a cloak,” Bullman said.&nbsp;</p><p>Normally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/two-early-trials-blood-cancer-treatment-appears-promising-deadly-brain-rcna143216" target="_blank">immune cells called T-cells</a> recognize and attack tumor cells. But this bacteria recruits another type of immune cell into the cancer cells, one that lets them escape the T-cells. </p><p>The stealthy subspecies was present in 50% of the colorectal tumors collected in the study. The corresponding stool samples also had elevated amounts of the subspecies, compared to their healthy counterparts.&nbsp;</p><p>“Patients who have high levels of this bacteria in their colorectal tumors have a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/colon-cancer-advanced-younger-symptoms-rcna72983" target="_blank">far worse prognosis</a>,” Bullman said. “They don’t respond as well to chemotherapy and they have an increased risk of recurrence.”&nbsp;</p><p>The subspecies may also cause cancer to form in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>When Bullman and her team transplanted the subspecies to mice, they appeared to cause precancerous polyps to form, one of the first warning signs of colorectal cancer, though she added that this causation hasn’t yet been proven in humans.</p><p>The researchers also found clues that may answer the question as to how Fusobacterium nucleatum can get to the colon in the first place: The bacterium appears to be able to survive the journey through the stomach, withstanding what scientists previously thought would be a toxic dose of stomach acid.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>New targets for treatment</strong></h2><p>The discovery of the subspecies has huge consequences for targeted therapies that are already underway, said Dr. Michael White, an assistant professor of colorectal surgery at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.</p><p>“There is evidence that if you clear these bacteria, there is more response during treatment,” said White, who was not involved with the new research. Clinical trials are slated to soon test whether treating a patient with antibiotics prior to chemotherapy will induce a better response, he said.</p><p>Knowing more about which bacterial subspecies, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, are dangerous will allow for a more targeted approach, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>That could potentially include prevention.</p><p>It’s possible that scientists could identify the subspecies while it’s still in the mouth and give a person antibiotics at that point, wiping it out before it could&nbsp; travel&nbsp; to the colon, Bullman said. Even if antibiotics can’t successfully eliminate the bacteria from the mouth, its presence there could serve as an indication that someone is at higher risk for aggressive colon cancer, she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Rocha agreed. In the future, part of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/colon-cancer-screening-blood-test-coming-approval-rcna143066" target="_blank">colorectal cancer screening</a> could be as simple as a mouth swab, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the newly identified subspecies could also lead to the development of new antibiotics that would specifically target this bacterial subtype, rather than wiping out both forms of the bacteria or all of the bacteria in the mouth.</p><p>There’s also the possibility of harnessing the bacteria to do the cancer-fighting work.&nbsp;</p><p>The subtype has already proven that it can enter cancer cells quite easily, so it might be possible to genetically modify the bacteria to carry cancer-fighting drugs directly into the tumors, Bullman said.</p><p>Researchers are just beginning to scratch the surface of the ways a person’s microbiome plays a role in the individual’s cancer risk, Rocha said, but it’s one of the most important concepts being explored in cancer research today.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p><span data-testid="byline-thumbnail"></span><span data-testid="byline-name">Kaitlin Sullivan</span><span></span></p><p>Kaitlin Sullivan is a contributor for NBCNews.com who has worked with NBC News Investigations.&nbsp;She reports on health, science and the environment and&nbsp;is a graduate of the&nbsp;Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at City University of New York.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>Recently, I’ve been interested in the <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> project (like a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> geared towards data applications). And one of the amazing features is that it has many data importers included without requiring extra dependencies. This means it can natively read and parse JSON as a database table, among many other formats.</p>

<p>I work extensively with JSON day to day, and I often reach for <a href="https://jqlang.github.io/jq/">jq</a> when exploring documents. I love <code>jq</code>, but I find it hard to use. The syntax is super powerful, but I have to study the docs anytime I want to do anything beyond just selecting fields.</p>

<!-- I love [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) for wrangling JSON data, but I find it hard to use. The syntax is super powerful, but I have to read the docs anytime I want to do anything beyond just selecting fields. -->

<p>Once I learned DuckDB could read JSON files directly into memory, I realized that I could use it for many of the things where I’m currently using <code>jq</code>. In contrast to the complicated and custom <code>jq</code> syntax, I’m very familiar with SQL and use it almost daily.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<p>First, we fetch some sample JSON to play around with. I used the GitHub API to grab the repository information from the golang org:</p>

<div><pre><code>% curl <span>'https://api.github.com/orgs/golang/repos'</span> <span>&gt;</span> repos.json
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now, as a sample question to answer, let’s get some stats on the types of open source licenses used.</p>

<p>The JSON structure looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>[</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1914329</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"gddo"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"license"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"bsd-3-clause"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"BSD 3-Clause </span><span>\"</span><span>New</span><span>\"</span><span> or </span><span>\"</span><span>Revised</span><span>\"</span><span> License"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"id"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>11440704</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"glog"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"license"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"apache-2.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Apache License 2.0"</span><span>,</span><span>
      </span><span>...</span><span>
    </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>...</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span>
  </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This might not be the best way, but here is what I cobbled together after searching and reading some docs for how to do this in <code>jq</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code> % <span>cat </span>repos.json | jq <span>\</span>
  <span>'group_by(.license.key)
  | map({license: .[0].license.key, count: length})
  | sort_by(.count)
  | reverse'</span>
<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"bsd-3-clause"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 23
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"apache-2.0"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 5
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: null,
    <span>"count"</span>: 2
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And here is what it looks like in DuckDB using SQL:</p>

<div><pre><code>% duckdb <span>-c</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) as count </span><span>\</span><span>
  from 'repos.json' </span><span>\</span><span>
  group by 1 </span><span>\</span><span>
  order by count desc"</span>
┌──────────────┬───────┐
│   license    │ count │
│   varchar    │ int64 │
├──────────────┼───────┤
│ bsd-3-clause │    23 │
│ apache-2.0   │     5 │
│              │     2 │
└──────────────┴───────┘
</code></pre></div>

<p>For me, this SQL is much simpler and I was able to write it without looking at any docs. The only tricky part is querying nested JSON with the <code>-&gt;&gt;</code> operator. The syntax is the same as the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html">PostgreSQL JSON Functions</a>, however, so I was familiar with it.</p>

<p>And if we do need the output in JSON, there’s a DuckDB flag for that:</p>

<div><pre><code>% duckdb <span>-json</span> <span>-c</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) as count </span><span>\</span><span>
  from 'repos.json' </span><span>\</span><span>
  group by 1 </span><span>\</span><span>
  order by count desc"</span>
<span>[{</span><span>"license"</span>:<span>"bsd-3-clause"</span>,<span>"count"</span>:23<span>}</span>,
<span>{</span><span>"license"</span>:<span>"apache-2.0"</span>,<span>"count"</span>:5<span>}</span>,
<span>{</span><span>"license"</span>:null,<span>"count"</span>:2<span>}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>We can still even pretty print with <code>jq</code> at the end, after using DuckDB to do the heavy lifting:</p>

<div><pre><code>% duckdb <span>-json</span> <span>-c</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>"select license-&gt;&gt;'key' as license, count(*) as count </span><span>\</span><span>
  from 'repos.json' </span><span>\</span><span>
  group by 1 </span><span>\</span><span>
  order by count desc"</span> <span>\</span>
  | jq
<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"bsd-3-clause"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 23
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: <span>"apache-2.0"</span>,
    <span>"count"</span>: 5
  <span>}</span>,
  <span>{</span>
    <span>"license"</span>: null,
    <span>"count"</span>: 2
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>JSON is just one of the many ways of importing data into DuckDB. This same approach would work for CSVs, parquet, Excel files, etc.</p>

<p>And I could choose to create tables and persist locally, but often I’m just interrogating data and don’t need the persistence.</p>

This model, in our opinion, provides an optimal balance for performance:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fast Initial Load</strong></p><p>The initial visit to any page will be served the static, pre-rendered HTML for fast loading speed and optimal SEO. The page then loads a JavaScript bundle that turns the page into a Vue SPA ("hydration"). Contrary to common assumptions of SPA hydration being slow, this process is actually extremely fast thanks to Vue 3's raw performance and compiler optimizations. On <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fvitepress.dev%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PageSpeed Insights</a>, typical VitePress sites achieve near-perfect performance scores even on low-end mobile devices with a slow network.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fast Post-load Navigation</strong></p><p>More importantly, the SPA model leads to better user experience <strong>after</strong> the initial load. Subsequent navigation within the site will no longer cause a full page reload. Instead, the incoming page's content will be fetched and dynamically updated. VitePress also automatically pre-fetches page chunks for links that are within viewport. In most cases, post-load navigation will feel instant.</p></li><li><p><strong>Interactivity Without Penalty</strong></p><p>To be able to hydrate the dynamic Vue parts embedded inside static Markdown, each Markdown page is processed as a Vue component and compiled into JavaScript. This may sound inefficient, but the Vue compiler is smart enough to separate the static and dynamic parts, minimizing both the hydration cost and payload size. For the initial page load, the static parts are automatically eliminated from the JavaScript payload and skipped during hydration.</p></li></ul><hr><p>The path to VitePress 1.0 wouldn't have been possible without the hard work of <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/graphs/contributors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">our contributors</a>. In particular, shout out to <a href="https://github.com/kiaking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kia King Ishii (@kiaking)</a> for creating the beautiful design for the default theme, and <a href="https://github.com/brc-dd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Divyansh Singh (@brc-dd)</a> for tirelessly leading the maintenance and pushing new features.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When thousands of security researchers descend on Las Vegas every August for what's come to be known as “hacker summer camp,” the back-to-back <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/black-hat/">Black Hat</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/defcon/">Defcon</a> hacker conferences, it's a given that some of them will experiment with hacking the infrastructure of Vegas itself, the city's elaborate array of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/card-shuffler-hack/">casino</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elevator-phone-phreaking-defcon/">hospitality</a> technology. But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually <em>invited</em> to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.</p><p>One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room's door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and a half later, they're finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.</p><p>Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call <a data-offer-url="https://unsaflok.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://unsaflok.com/&quot;}" href="https://unsaflok.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.</p><p>By exploiting weaknesses in both Dormakaba's encryption and the underlying RFID system Dormakaba uses, known as MIFARE Classic, Carroll and Wouters have demonstrated just how easily they can open a Saflok keycard lock. Their technique starts with obtaining any keycard from a target hotel—say, by booking a room there or grabbing a keycard out of a box of used ones—then reading a certain code from that card with a $300 RFID read-write device, and finally writing two keycards of their own. When they merely tap those two cards on a lock, the first rewrites a certain piece of the lock's data, and the second opens it.</p><p>“Two quick taps and we open the door,” says Wouters, a researcher in the Computer Security and Industrial Cryptography group at the KU Leuven University in Belgium. “And that works on every door in the hotel.”</p><figure><p><span>A video of the researchers demonstrating their lock-hacking technique. (The pattern of lights shown on the lock is redacted at one point at the researchers’ request to avoid revealing a detail of their technique they agreed with Dormakaba not to make public.)</span><span>Video: Ian Carroll</span></p></figure><p>Wouters and Carroll, an independent security researcher and founder of travel website Seats.aero, shared the full technical details of their hacking technique with Dormakaba in November 2022. Dormakaba says that it's been working since early last year to make hotels that use Saflok aware of their security flaws and to help them fix or replace the vulnerable locks. For many of the Saflok systems sold in the last eight years, there's no hardware replacement necessary for each individual lock. Instead, hotels will only need to update or replace the front desk management system and have a technician carry out a relatively quick reprogramming of each lock, door by door.</p><p>Wouters and Carroll say they were nonetheless told by Dormakaba that, as of this month, only 36 percent of installed Safloks have been updated. Given that the locks aren't connected to the internet and some older locks will still need a hardware upgrade, they say the full fix will still likely take months longer to roll out, at the very least. Some older installations may take years.</p><p>“We have worked closely with our partners to identify and implement an immediate mitigation for this vulnerability, along with a longer-term solution,” Dormakaba wrote to WIRED in a statement, though it declined to detail what that “immediate mitigation” might be. “Our customers and partners all take security very seriously, and we are confident all reasonable steps will be taken to address this matter in a responsible way.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The technique to hack Dormakaba's locks that Wouters and Carroll's research group discovered involves two distinct kinds of vulnerabilities: One that allows them to write to its keycards, and one that allows them to know <em>what</em> data to write to the cards to successfully trick a Saflok lock into opening. When they analyzed Saflok keycards, they saw that they use the MIFARE Classic RFID system, which has been known for more than a decade to have vulnerabilities that allow hackers to write to keycards, though the brute-force process can take as long as 20 seconds. They then cracked a part of Dormakaba's own encryption system, its so-called key derivation function, which allowed them to write to its cards far faster. With either of those tricks, the researchers could then copy a Saflok keycard at will, but still not generate one for a different room.</p><p>The researchers' more crucial step required them to obtain one of the lock programming devices that Dormakaba distributes to hotels, as well as a copy of its front desk software for managing keycards. By reverse engineering that software, they were able to understand all the data stored on the cards, pulling out a hotel property code as well as a code for each individual room, then create their own values and encrypt them just as Dormakaba's system would, allowing them to spoof a working master key that opens any room on the property. “You can make a card that really looks as if it was created by the software from Dormakaba, essentially,” says Wouters.</p><p>And how did Carroll and Wouters obtain Dormakaba's front desk software? “We nicely asked a few people,” Wouters says. “Manufacturers assume that no one will sell their equipment on eBay, and that no one will make a copy of their software, and those assumptions, I think everyone knows, are not really valid.”</p><p>Once they'd managed all that reverse engineering work, the final version of their attack could be pulled off with little more than a $300 Proxmark RFID read-write device and a couple of blank RFID cards, an Android phone, or a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-flipper-zero-tiktok/">Flipper Zero radio hacking tool</a>.</p><figure><p><span><p>A Saflok branded lock.</p>
</span><span>Photograph: Dormakaba</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The biggest caveat to the hackers' Unsaflok technique is that it still requires that they have a keycard—even an expired one—for a room somewhere in the same hotel as the room they're targeting. That's because each card has a property-specific code they need to read and then duplicate on their spoofed card, as well as a room-specific one.</p><p>Once they have that property code, the technique also requires using an RFID read-write device to write two cards—one card that reprograms a target lock as well as the second spoofed card that unlocks it. (An Android phone or a Flipper Zero could also be used to emit one signal after another instead of the two cards, the researchers say.) The researchers hint that the first card allows them to open a target room without guessing its unique identifier in the hotel's system, but declined to say exactly what that first card does. They're holding that element of the technique in confidence to avoid giving too clear a set of instructions to would-be intruders or thieves.</p><p>By contrast, one security researcher presented a similar hotel keycard hack that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/23/hacker-will-expose-potential-security-flaw-in-more-than-four-million-hotel-room-keycard-locks/?sh=78d51b9eeb85">opened locks sold by the firm Onity</a> at the Black Hat conference in 2012 with no such obfuscation, and allowed any hacker to build a device that opened any of Onity's 10 million locks worldwide. When Onity refused to pay for the hardware upgrades necessary to solve the problem and instead put the onus on its customers, the issue remained unfixed in many hotels—and eventually was exploited in at least <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/08/the-hotel-hacker/">one hacker's cross-country burglary spree</a>.</p><p>Carroll and Wouters say that they're trying to avoid that scenario by taking a more cautious approach, while still warning the public about their technique, given that hundreds of properties will likely remain vulnerable to it even now that Dormakaba has offered its fix. “We're trying to find the middle ground of helping Dormakaba to fix it quickly, but also telling the guests about it," says Carroll. “If someone else reverse engineers this today and starts exploiting it before people are aware, that might be an even bigger problem.”</p><p>To that end, Carroll and Wouters point out that hotel guests can recognize the vulnerable locks most often—but not always—by their distinct design: a round RFID reader with a wavy line cutting through it. They suggest that if hotel guests do have a Saflok on their door, they can determine if it's been updated by checking their keycard with the NFC Taginfo app by NXP, available for <a data-offer-url="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596&quot;}" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android</a>. If the lock is manufactured by Dormakaba, and that app shows that the keycard is still a MIFARE Classic card, it's likely still vulnerable.</p><p>If that's the case, the two researchers say, there's not much to do other than avoid leaving valuables in the room and, when you're inside, bolt the chain on the door. They warn that the deadbolt on the room is also controlled by the keycard lock, so it doesn't provide an extra safeguard. “If someone locks the deadbolt, they’re still not protected,” says Carroll.</p><p>Even without a perfect or fully implemented fix, Wouters and Carroll argue, it's better for hotel guests to know the risks than to have a false sense of security. After all, they point out, the Saflok brand has been sold for more than three decades, and may have been vulnerable for much or all of those years. Though Dormakaba says it's not aware of any past use of Wouters and Carroll's technique, the researchers point out that doesn't mean it never happened in secret.</p><p>“We think the vulnerability has been there for a long time,” says Wouters. “It's unlikely that we are the first to find this.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

								<p>
									The GoFetch attack is based on a CPU feature 
									called data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), 
									which is present in the latest Apple processors. 
									We reverse-engineered DMPs on Apple m-series CPUs 
									and found that the DMP activates (and attempts to dereference) 
									data loaded from memory that "looks like" a pointer. 
									This explicitly violates a requirement 
									of the constant-time programming paradigm, 
									which forbids mixing data and memory access patterns. 
								</p>
								<p>
									To exploit the DMP, we craft chosen inputs to cryptographic operations, 
									in a way where pointer-like values only appear 
									if we have correctly guessed some bits of the secret key. 
									We verify these guesses by monitoring whether the DMP performs 
									a dereference through cache-timing analysis. 
									Once we make a correct guess, we proceed to guess the next batch of key bits. 
									Using this approach, we show end-to-end key extraction attacks on popular 
									constant-time implementations of classical 
									(OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Go RSA decryption) 
									and post-quantum cryptography (CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium).
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDifference" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDifference">
							<p>
								We have mounted end-to-end GoFetch attacks on Apple hardware equipped with m1 processors. 
								We also tested DMP activation patterns on other Apple processors 
								and found that m2 and m3 CPUs also exhibit similar exploitable DMP behavior. 
								While we have not tested other m-series variants (e.g., m2 Pro, etc), 
								we hypothesize that since these parts have the same microarchitecture as their simpler counterparts, 
								they are likewise equipped with exploitable DMPs. 
								Finally, we found that Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake microarchitecture also features a DMP. 
								However, its activation criteria are more restrictive, making it robust to our attacks.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseCacheAttack" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingCacheAttack">
								<p>
									The Apple m-series DMP was first discovered by <a href="https://www.prefetchers.info/">Augury</a>, 
									which suggested that DMPs might mix data and addresses under some conditions. 
									However, we found that the DMP activation criteria outlined by Augury are overly restrictive. 
									This prevents Augury's findings from being sufficient to mount attacks on real-world constant-time cryptography. 
								</p>
								<p>
									GoFetch shows that the DMP is significantly more aggressive than previously thought, 
									and thus poses a much greater security risk. 
									Specifically, we find that any value loaded from memory is a candidate for being dereferenced (literally!). 
									This allows us to sidestep many of Augury's limitations and demonstrate end-to-end attacks on real constant-time code.
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseConstantTime" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingConstantTime">
							<p>
								Modern processors use caches to reduce a program's memory access latency. 
								If data has been accessed before, it gets cached, which makes subsequent accesses to it faster. 
								Since the cache is shared by processes running on the same machine, 
								attackers co-located to the same machine can monitor the cache's state to deduce a victim's access pattern.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDMP" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDMP">
								<p>
									Constant-time programming is a paradigm that aims to harden code against side-channel attacks by ensuring that all operations take the same amount of time, regardless of their operands. In particular, constant-time code cannot contain secret-dependent branches, loops, or other control structures. Moreover, as the CPU caches different addresses with attacker-observable latency, constant-time code cannot mix data and addresses in any way and prohibits the use of secret-dependent memory accesses or array indices.
								</p>
								<p>
									We show that even if a victim correctly separates data from addresses by following the constant-time paradigm, the DMP will generate secret-dependent memory access on the victim's behalf, resulting in variable-time code susceptible to our key-extraction attacks. 
								</p>
							</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseOther" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingOther">
							<p>
								Prefetchers are a hardware optimization that predicts memory addresses accessed in the near future and fetch the data into the cache accordingly from the main memory. To make a prediction, classical prefetchers use the address trace of previous demand accesses. This strategy performs poorly when it comes to irregular access patterns like linked-list traversals. Aiming to handle such irregular patterns, data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs) also consider the content of memory to determine what to fetch, which is capable of capturing those indirect access patterns. Unfortunately, this behavior inherently mixes data and memory addresses at the hardware level, making the entire compute stack non-constant-time, enabling our attack.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseOthers" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingOthers">
							<p>
								We don't know. Our attack relies on the fact that it is possible to craft inputs to control specific intermediate states, making them contain memory addresses in a key-dependent way. The DMP then serves as an oracle, allowing us to learn if the intermediate state indeed looks like a pointer and thus leaks secret key bits. Unfortunately, to assess if an implementation is vulnerable, cryptanalysis and code inspection are required to understand when and how intermediate values can be made to look like pointers in a way that leaks secrets. This process is manual and slow and does not rule out other attack approaches. 
							</p>

					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseDisable" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingDisable">
							<p>
								Yes, but only on some processors.
								We observe that the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms#Enable-DIT-for-constant-time-cryptographic-operations">DIT bit</a>
								set on m3 CPUs effectively disables the DMP.
								This is not the case for the m1 and m2.
								Also, Intel's counterpart, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/data-operand-independent-timing-isa-guidance.html">DOIT bit</a>, 
								can be used to disable DMP on the Raptor Lake processors.
							</p>
						</div>
					<div id="panelsStayOpen-collapseCountermeasure" aria-labelledby="panelsStayOpen-headingCountermeasure">
							<p>
								For users, we recommend using the latest versions of software, 
								as well as performing updates regularly. 
								Developers of cryptographic libraries can either set the 
								<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/best-practices/data-operand-independent-timing-isa-guidance.html">DOIT bit</a>
								and 
								<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms#Enable-DIT-for-constant-time-cryptographic-operations">DIT bit</a> 
								bits, which disable the DMP on some CPUs. 
								Additionally, input blinding can help some cryptographic schemes avoid having attacker-controlled intermediate values, 
								avoiding key-dependent DMP activation. 
								Finally, preventing attackers from measuring DMP activation in the first place, 
								for example by avoiding hardware sharing, can further enhance the security of cryptographic protocols.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://xata.io/blog/introducing-pgzx">https://xata.io/blog/introducing-pgzx</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39779024">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of the <a href="https://xata.io/launch-week-unleash-the-elephant">Xata launch week</a>, we are introducing <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx">pgzx</a>, an open-source framework for developing PostgreSQL extensions written in Zig. It provides a set of utilities (e.g. error handling, memory allocators, wrappers) as well as a build and development environment to simplify integrating with the Postgres codebase.</p>

<p><a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a> is described on its website as a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining <strong>robust</strong>, <strong>optimal</strong> and <strong>reusable</strong> software. Zig is a new language (pre 1.0), but it has been gaining popularity in the systems programming community. It is fair to think of it as a "modern C", providing safer memory management, compilation time code execution (comptime), and a rich standard library. We'll show some of these features in the context of Postgres extensions below.</p>
<p>A major reason to use Zig for Postgres development is its ability to interoperate with C code. Zig supports the C ABI, works with C pointers and data types, including NULL terminated strings, and can even translate C header files into Zig code. Zig's automatic translation of C macros to Zig code is not yet perfect, but it's still helpful. This makes Zig a great choice for working with very large C codebases, like Postgres happens to be.</p>

<p>Because Zig can call any C function and translate C macros to inline Zig functions, you can write Postgres extensions in Zig without any additional tooling by following the same steps you would for a C extension. However, a framework like pgzx simplifies the process significantly by providing a development environment, a set of utilities and wrappers for Postgres APIs, common error handling, and more.</p>

<p>pgzx has at the moment 2 sample extensions that you can take inspiration from. <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/tree/main/examples/char_count_zig">char_count_zig</a> is a minimal extension, while <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/tree/main/examples/pgaudit_zig">pg_audit_zig</a> is more complex and shows more of the features of pgzx.</p>
<p>Let's look at the <code>char_count_zig</code>, which is only slightly more than a "Hello, World!" of Postgres extensions. It adds a function that counts how many times a character appears in a string. This was inspired by <a href="https://www.highgo.ca/2019/10/01/a-guide-to-create-user-defined-extension-modules-to-postgres/">this tutorial</a>, which shows how to do this in plpqsql and C.</p>

<p>Whilst they're similar, the Zig version is actually a bit more concise. This is partially because Zig is more expressive, but also because pgzx does a bit more of the work.</p>
<p>Registered SQL functions receive their arguments serialized and some code is needed to deserialize them. In C you do that with the help of the <code>G_GETARG_*</code> macros, however with pgzx you simply receive them as normal parameters already deserialized. How? By having a <code>comptime</code> function that generates the necessary boilerplate code at compile time. If you are curious, check out the <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/blob/9825dde752ee4ace2cbc594332eba100292aafd5/src/pgzx/fmgr.zig#L77-L102">pgCall</a> function, it's a nice example for the power of Zig's <code>comptime</code> execution.</p>
<p>The <code>PG_MODULE_MAGIC</code> and <code>PG_FUNCTION_INFO_V1</code> functions are a second example of <code>comptime</code> usage. They export the required symbols needed for Postgres to recognize this as an extension and to register the function as a SQL function. In this case, <code>comptime</code> acts pretty much like the corresponding C macros.</p>

<p>If you looked carefully at the code above, you might have noticed that it contains a bug. It checks for the <code>target_char</code> to not have more than 1 character, but it doesn't check if it has 0 characters. Later, the code accesses <code>target_char[0]</code>, so if the string is the empty string, there will be a out of bounds access error. We left that bug intentionally in so you can see what happens when bugs like that happen in the extension.</p>
<p>You can trigger the bug with this SQL:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>select</span><span> char_count_zig(</span><span>'hi hii'</span><span>, </span><span>''</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which responds:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>server closed the connection unexpectedly</span></span>
<span><span>        This probably means the server terminated abnormally</span></span>
<span><span>        before or while processing the request.</span></span>
<span><span>The connection to the server was lost. Attempting reset: Failed.</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In C code, this type of bug could trigger a segmentation fault or even a security vulnerability. If you try this with the <code>char_count_zig</code> extension, the Postgres process still crashes (not the full server, just the process serving the connection), but if you check the logs you'll see an error message like this:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>thread 70501513 panic: index out of bounds: index 0, len 0</span></span>

<p>It points exactly where the error happened! This happens because Zig has runtime checks depending on the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode">build mode</a>. The <code>ReleaseSafe</code> mode, for example, trades a bit of performance for more safety checks.</p>
<p>Note that this stacktrace worked so well because the error was in Zig code. When building Postgres extensions, you often have to call Postgres APIs which will still segmentation fault if you use them incorrectly.</p>

<p>Postgres uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-based_memory_management">allocator arenas</a> to manage memory. In the Postgres source code, the arenas are called <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/utils/mmgr/README">memory contexts</a>. Memory allocated in a "context" can be freed all at once (for example, when a query execution is finished), which simplifies memory management significantly, because you only need to track contexts, not individual allocations. Contexts are also hierarchical, so you can create a context that is a child of another context, and when the parent context is freed, all children are freed as well. This makes memory leaks rather unlikely.</p>
<p>Another advantage of memory contexts is that they improve <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-backend-memory-contexts.html">memory monitoring</a>, because context have names and you can see how much memory is used by each context. This is useful for debugging large memory usage.</p>
<p>This model of using an arena/context allocator happens to match really good with Zig. One reason is Zig's convention to have all functions/objects that allocate memory receive an allocator as a parameter. This makes allocations <a href="https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-03-15-zig-rust-and-other-languages.html">more explicit</a> but also makes it easy to use a custom allocator. pgzx defines custom allocators that wrap the Postgres memory contexts and make them available to Zig code.</p>
<p>Here is an example that creates a new context as a child of the current context and gets the allocator for it:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>var</span><span> memctx = </span><span>try</span><span> pgzx.mem.</span><span>createAllocSetContext</span><span>(</span><span>"zig_context"</span><span>, .{ .parent = pg.CurrentMemoryContext });</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> allocator = memctx.</span><span>allocator</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Another Postgres API that you will very likely need to know about in a more complex extension is the error handling. Postgres implements "exceptions" in C via <code>setjmp/longjmp</code> and provides a set of macros to throw and catch them (<a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/include/utils/elog.h#L318">PG_TRY/PG_CATCH</a>).</p>
<p>The issue is that long jumps could bypass the Zig control flow, for example <code>errdefer</code> blocks might not be executed. This means that if your extension calls into Postgres APIs, and those APIs can throw errors, long jumps might skip your <code>defer</code> and <code>errdefer</code> blocks!</p>
<p>Luckily, pgzx is here to help. It provides a set of functions that allow you to catch the Postgres exceptions and convert them into Zig errors. For example:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>var</span><span> errctx = pgzx.err.Context.</span><span>init</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>defer</span><span> errctx.</span><span>deinit</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>if</span><span> (errctx.</span><span>pg_try</span><span>()) {</span></span>
<span><span>    // Call Postgres C functions.</span></span>
<span><span>} </span><span>else</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> errctx.</span><span>errorValue</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>pgzx comes with a <a href="https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes">Nix flakes</a> based development environment for developing extensions as well as pgzx itself. It also comes with a project template which you can use to set up this environment in a new repository. To use it, <a href="https://github.com/DeterminateSystems/nix-installer">install Nix</a> and then run:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>mkdir</span><span> my_extension</span></span>
<span><span>cd</span><span> my_extension</span></span>
<span><span>nix</span><span> flake</span><span> init</span><span> -t</span><span> github:xataio/pgzx</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then load the nix shell with:</p>

<p>The dev environment includes commands to relocate the Postgres binaries in your development environment, to start the server, and so on. The template also comes with a minimal extension and a <code>build.zig</code> file with a few common tasks. See the template <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/tree/main/nix/templates/init">README</a> for how to build the extension from this point.</p>

<p>Postgres extensions are typically tested via a tool called <code>pg_regress</code>. This is supported by pgzx as well, simply call <code>zig build pg_regress</code>.</p>
<p>But we also wanted to have unit tests. This is a bit tricky because the tests need to be compiled and run in the <strong>context of a Postgres instance</strong>. Otherwise, they won't be able to interact with Postgres' APIs.</p>
<p>In order to solve this, pgzx registers a custom <code>run_tests</code> function. This function can be called from SQL (<code>SELECT run_tests();</code>) and it will run the unit tests. A test suite is a Zig struct with functions starting with <code>test</code>. To register a test suite, you would typically do something like this:</p>
<div role="group"><pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>comptime</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    pgzx.testing.</span><span>registerTests</span><span>(</span><span>@import</span><span>(</span><span>"build_options"</span><span>).testfn, .{Tests});</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx/blob/9825dde752ee4ace2cbc594332eba100292aafd5/src/pgzx/testing.zig#L39">registerTests</a> function is another example of <code>comptime</code> usage. It iterates over all the fields of a struct and generates the call to run the tests when the <code>run_tests()</code> function is called in SQL.</p>

<p>This walkthrough covered some of the more interesting functionality exposed by pgzx, but there's more on offer: wrappers for the Postgres data structures (<a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:list">lists</a>, hashtables), <a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:spi">SPI</a>, <a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:shmem">shared memory access</a>, <a href="https://xataio.github.io/pgzx/#A;pgzx:pq">connection management</a>, and more...</p>

<p>At Xata, we have been working on a new Postgres project, which doesn't really have a name yet, so let's call it <em>"Xata's take on distributed Postgres"</em>. It's in its very early stages, however we'll be open sourcing it soon and we're planning to <a href="https://mailchi.mp/xata/2zoy27tx2e">build it in public</a>. It will be somewhat similar to Citus, but some different choices, especially around usage and DX, based on what we learned running Xata for the past couple of years.</p>
<p>For this project, we considered three potential implementation directions:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>As an external proxy, like Vitess does for MySQL.</li><li>As a Postgres extension, like Citus.</li><li>As a fork of Postgres, like Greenplum.</li></ol>
<p>We have some experience with the first option because that's how our current Xata Proxy works, see more details in this <a href="https://xata.io/blog/serverless-postgres-platform">blog post</a>, so we were almost biased towards it. We know we can speak the Postgres wire protocol, parse the incoming queries and understand them at a deep level, as well as create distributed transactions via 2PC. However, we also know that leveraging existing Postgres code it will open up more options and avoid us having to reimplement some very difficult parts. Given the long term vision of the project, and that we didn't want to maintain a fork, we decided to go with the second option.</p>
<p>The next node in our decision tree was the <strong>programming language</strong>. The main options we considered were C, Rust, and Zig. While there are pros and cons to each of these options, which we might cover in detail a future blog post, we decided to go with Zig. The main "pros" for Zig were:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>It allows us to call into the Postgres APIs almost directly, so we have the same power as using C.</li><li>It offers more memory safety than C, it's a bit more expressive, and a bit more fun (we think).</li><li>It fits well with the Postgres codebase, for example when it comes to memory management and string handling.</li></ul>
<p>As we started working, we realized that an equivalent for Rust's <a href="https://github.com/pgcentralfoundation/pgrx">pgrx</a> would be needed for Zig as well, so we started pgzx.</p>
<p>While Zig and pgzx might not be the best choice for every Postgres extension, we think it's a reasonable choice for our project and perhaps for some others as well.</p>

<p>pgzx is new and should be considered "alpha" as of now. However, if you want to build a Postgres extension and you want to use Zig, it's going to be a lot easier with pgzx than without it. A status of the covered functionality is in the <a href="https://github.com/xataio/pgzx">README</a>. If you need help or you'd like to contribute, please join us on the <a href="https://xata.io/discord">Xata Discord</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if this blog post has sparked your interest in Zig and you want to give it a try, why not develop a Postgres extension? Let us know about it and we'll include it in the list of examples!</p>

<p dir="auto">Dropflow is a CSS layout engine created to explore the reaches of the foundational CSS standards (that is: inlines, blocks, floats, positioning and eventually tables, but not flexbox or grid). It has a high quality text layout implementation and is capable of displaying many of the languages of the world. You can use it to generate PDFs or images on the backend with Node and <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">node-canvas</a> or render rich, wrapped text to a canvas in the browser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Supports over 30 properties including complex ones like <code>float</code></li>
<li>Bidirectional and RTL text</li>
<li>Hyperscript (<code>h()</code>) API with styles as objects in addition to accepting HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Any OpenType/TrueType buffer can (and must) be registered</li>
<li>Font fallbacks at the grapheme level</li>
<li>Colored diacritics</li>
<li>Desirable line breaking (e.g. carries starting padding to the next line)</li>
<li>Optimized shaping</li>

<p dir="auto">Performance is a top goal and is second only to correctness. Run the performance examples in the <code>examples</code> directory to see the numbers for yourself.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>8 paragraphs with several inline spans of different fonts can be turned from HTML to image in <strong>9ms</strong> on a 2019 MacBook Pro and <strong>13ms</strong> on a 2012 MacBook Pro (<code>perf-1.ts</code>)</li>
<li>The Little Prince (over 500 paragraphs) can be turned from HTML to image in under <strong>160ms</strong> on a 2019 MacBook Pro and under <strong>250ms</strong> on a 2012 MacBook Pro (<code>perf-2.ts</code>)</li>
<li>A 10-letter word can be generated and laid out (not painted) in under <strong>25µs</strong> on a 2019 MacBook Pro and under <strong>50µs</strong> on a 2012 MacBook Pro (<code>perf-3.ts</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The fastest performance can be achieved by using the hyperscript API, which creates a DOM directly and skips the typical HTML and CSS parsing steps. Take care to re-use style objects to get the most benefits. Reflows at different widths are faster than recreating the layout tree.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">API</h2><a id="user-content-api" aria-label="Permalink: API" href="#api"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The first two steps are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="#fonts">Register fonts</a></li>
<li><a href="#hyperscript">Create a DOM via the Hyperscript or Parse API</a></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Then, you can either render the DOM into a canvas using its size as the viewport:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="#render-dom-to-canvas">Render DOM to canvas</a></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Or, you can use the lower-level functions to retain the layout, in case you want to re-layout at a different size, choose not to paint (for example if the layout isn't visible) or get intrinsics:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="#generate">Generate a tree of layout boxes from the DOM</a></li>
<li><a href="#layout">Layout the box tree</a></li>
<li><a href="#paint">Paint the box tree to a target like canvas</a></li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Registers a font to be selected by the <code>font</code> properties. Dropflow <strong>does not search system fonts</strong>, so you must do this with at least one font.</p>
<p dir="auto">When a URL is passed, don't forget to <code>await</code> this. If an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> is passed, there is no need to <code>await</code>. In that function signature, the <code>URL</code> is only used to provide a unique name for the font.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>URL</code> must always be unique.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the browser, make sure the font is also loaded into page so that the paint backend can reference it with <code>ctx.font</code>. In <code>node-canvas</code>, you should either use <code>registerFont</code> from <code>canvas</code> for this font, or pass <code>{paint: true}</code> for <code>options</code>, which will try to load <code>node-canvas</code> and call its <code>registerFont</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Generates a box tree for the element tree. Box trees roughly correspond to DOM trees, but usually have more boxes (like for anonymous text content between block-level elements (<code>div</code>s)) and sometimes fewer (like for <code>display: none</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>BlockContainer</code> has a <code>repr()</code> method for logging the tree.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hold on to the return value so you can lay it out many times in different sizes, paint it or don't paint it if it's off-screen, or get intrinsics to build a higher-level logical layout (for example, spreadsheet column or row size even if the content is off screen).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Layout</h2><a id="user-content-layout" aria-label="Permalink: Layout" href="#layout"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Position boxes and split text into lines so the layout tree is ready to paint. Can be called over and over with a different viewport size.</p>
<p dir="auto">In more detail, layout involves:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Margin collapsing for block boxes</li>
<li>Passing text to HarfBuzz, iterating font fallbacks, wrapping, reshaping depending on break points</li>
<li>Float placement and <code>clear</code>ing</li>
<li>Positioning shaped text spans and backgrounds according to <code>direction</code> and text direction</li>
<li>Second and third pass layouts for intrinsics of <code>float</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, and <code>absolute</code>s</li>
<li>Post-layout positioning (<code>position</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Paint</h2><a id="user-content-paint" aria-label="Permalink: Paint" href="#paint"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This step paints the layout to a target. Painting can be done as many times as needed (for example, every time you clear and render all of your scene to the canvas).</p>
<p dir="auto">Canvas is currently the only seriously supported target, but other targets will be added, like pdf.js and SVG. There is also a toy HTML target that was used early on in development, and kept around for fun.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>paintToCanvas</code></h3><a id="user-content-painttocanvas" aria-label="Permalink: paintToCanvas" href="#painttocanvas"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Paint to HTML! Yes, this API can actually be used to go from HTML to HTML. It generates a flat list of a bunch of absolutely positioned elements. Probably don't use this, but it can be useful in development and is amusing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other</h2><a id="user-content-other" aria-label="Permalink: Other" href="#other"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>staticLayoutContribution</code></h3><a id="user-content-staticlayoutcontribution" aria-label="Permalink: staticLayoutContribution" href="#staticlayoutcontribution"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Returns the inline size in CSS pixels taken up by the layout, not including empty space after lines or the effect of any <code>width</code> properties. <code>layout</code> must be called before this.</p>
<p dir="auto">The intended usage is this: after laying out text into a desired size, use <code>staticLayoutContribution</code> to get the size without any remaining empty space at the end of the lines, then <code>layout</code> again into that size to get a tightly fitting layout.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">HarfBuzz</h2><a id="user-content-harfbuzz" aria-label="Permalink: HarfBuzz" href="#harfbuzz"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Glyph layout is performed by <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz">HarfBuzz</a> compiled to WebAssembly. This allows for a level of correctness that isn't possible by using the <code>measureText</code> API to position spans of text. If you color the "V" in the text "AV" differently in Google Sheets, you will notice kerning is lost, and the letters appear further apart than they should be. That's because two <code>measureText</code> and <code>fillText</code> calls were made on the letters, so contextual glyph advances were lost. Dropflow uses HarfBuzz on more coarse shaping boundaries (not when color is changed) so that the font is more correctly supported.</p>
<p dir="auto">HarfBuzz compiled to WebAssembly can achieve performance metrics similar to <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>'s <code>measureText</code>. It's not as fast as <code>measureText</code>, but it's not significantly slower (neither of them are the dominators in a text layout stack) and <code>measureText</code> has other correctness drawbacks. For example, a <code>measureText</code>-based text layout implementation must use a word cache to be quick, and this is what GSuite apps do. But a word cache is not able to support fonts with effects across spaces, and to support such a font would have to involve a binary search on the paragraph's break indices, which is far slower than passing the whole paragraph to HarfBuzz. Colored diacritics are not possible in any way with <code>measureText</code> either.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shout-outs</h2><a id="user-content-shout-outs" aria-label="Permalink: Shout-outs" href="#shout-outs"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">dropflow doesn't have any <code>package.json</code> dependencies, but the work of many others made it possible. Javascript dependencies have been checked in and modified to varying degrees to fit this project, maintain focus, and rebel against dependency-of-dependency madness. Here are the projects I'm grateful for:</p>

And they all start with a little bit of “social engineering” to trick a victim into doing something disadvantageous, whether that's trusting someone they shouldn't or sending money into the void. Now, a new variation of these schemes, known as “pig butchering,” is on the rise, ensnaring unsuspecting targets to steal all of their money and operating at a massive scale thanks in large part to forced labor.</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><p>Pig butchering scams originated in China, where they came to be known by the Chinese version of the phrase <em>shāzhūpán</em> because of an approach in which attackers essentially fatten victims up and then take everything they’ve got. These scams are typically cryptocurrency schemes, though they can involve other types of financial trading as well.</p><p>Scammers cold-contact people on SMS texting or other social media, dating, and communication platforms. Often they’ll simply say “Hi” or something like “Hey Josh, it was fun catching up last week!” If the recipient responds to say that the attacker has the wrong number, the scammer seizes the opportunity to strike up a conversation and guide the victim toward feeling like they’ve hit it off with a new friend. After establishing a rapport, the attacker will introduce the idea that they have been making a lot of money in cryptocurrency investing and suggest the target consider getting involved while they can.</p><p>Next, the scammer gets the target set up with a malicious app or web platform that appears trustworthy and may even impersonate the platforms of legitimate financial institutions. Once inside the portal, victims can often see curated real-time market data meant to show the potential of the investment. And once the target funds their “investment account,” they can start watching their balance “grow.” Crafting the malicious financial platforms to look legitimate and refined is a hallmark of pig butchering scams, as are other touches that add verisimilitude, like letting victims do a video call with their new “friend” or allowing them to withdraw a little bit of money from the platform to reassure them. The latter is a tactic that scammers also use in traditional Ponzi schemes.</p><p>Though the swindle has some new twists, you can still see where it's going. Once the victim has deposited all the money they have and everything the scammers can get them to borrow, the attackers shut down the account and disappear.</p><p>“That’s the whole pig butchering thing—they are going for the whole hog,” says Sean Gallagher, a senior threat researcher at the security firm Sophos who has been tracking pig butchering as it has emerged over the past three years. “They go after people who are vulnerable. Some of the victims are people who have had long-term health problems, who are older, people who feel isolated. They want to get every last bit of oink, and they are persistent.”&nbsp;</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Though carrying off pig butchering scams takes a lot of communication and relationship building with victims over time, researchers say that crime syndicates in China developed scripts and playbooks that allowed them to offload the work at scale onto inexperienced scammers or even forced laborers who are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zb5d/pig-butchering-scam-cambodia-trafficking">victims of human trafficking</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“We can already see the damage and the human cost both to scam victims and to forced laborers,” says Michael Roberts, founder of Rexxfield Cyber Investigations, who has been working with victims of pig butchering attacks. “That’s why we need to start educating people about this threat so we can disrupt the cycle and reduce the demand for these kidnappings and forced labor.”</p><p>The concept is similar to that of ransomware attacks and digital extortion in which law enforcement encourages victims not to pay hackers’ ransom demands so they will be disincentivized to keep trying.</p><p>The Chinese government <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-arrests-over-1100-suspects-crackdown-crypto-related-money-laundering-2021-06-10/">cracked down</a> on cryptocurrency scams beginning in 2021, but criminals have been able to move their pig butchering operations to Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Governments around the world have <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/portland/news/press-releases/fbi-oregon-tech-tuesday-building-a-digital-defense-against-a-new-cryptocurrency-scam-pig-butchering">increasingly</a> been <a data-offer-url="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003&quot;}" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warning</a> about the threat. In 2021, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center <a data-offer-url="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf&quot;}" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2021_IC3Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">received</a> more than 4,300 submissions related to pig butchering scams, totaling more than $429 million in losses. And at the end of November, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/court-authorizes-seizure-domains-used-furtherance-cryptocurrency-pig-butchering-scheme">announced</a> that it had seized seven domain names used in pig butchering scams in 2022.</p><p>“In this scheme, fraudsters, posing as highly successful traders in cryptocurrency, entice victims to make purported investments in cryptocurrency providing fictitious returns to encourage additional investments,” the FBI <a data-offer-url="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003&quot;}" href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA221003" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> in an October alert.</p><p>Government officials and researchers emphasize that public education is a key component of helping people avoid becoming the victim of a pig butchering scheme. If people know the telltale signs and understand the concepts underlying the scams, they are less likely to be ensnared. The challenge, they say, is reaching the wider public and getting people who learn about pig butchering to pass on the information to others in their families and social circles.&nbsp;</p><p>As with romance scams and other highly personal and exploitative attacks, researchers say that pig butchering scams take an enormous psychological toll on victims in addition to their financial toll. And the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/human-traffickers-force-victims-into-cyberscamming">use of forced labor</a> to carry out pig butchering schemes adds yet another layer of trauma and creates even more urgency to addressing the threat.</p><p>“Some of the stories you hear from victims—it eats you up,” says Ronnie Tokazowski, a longtime business email compromise and pig butchering researcher and principal threat advisor at the cybersecurity firm Cofense. “It eats you up really freaking bad.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

We've only scratched the surface of knowing the environmental and health impacts,” stated Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry Michael Burkart, one of the paper’s authors and an Algenesis co-founder. “We're trying to find replacements for materials that already exist, and make sure these replacements will biodegrade at the end of their useful life instead of collecting in the environment. That's not easy.”</span></span></p>

									<p><span><span>“</span></span><span><span>When we first created these algae-based polymers about six years ago, our intention was always that it be completely biodegradable,” said another of the paper’s authors, Robert Pomeroy, who is also a professor of chemistry and biochemistry and an Algenesis co-founder. “We had plenty of data to suggest that our material was disappearing in the compost, but this is the first time we’ve measured it at the microparticle level.”</span></span></p>

<h3><span><span>Putting it to the test</span></span></h3>

<p><span><span>To test its biodegradability, the team ground their product into fine microparticles, and used three different measurement tools to confirm that, when placed in a compost, the material was being digested by microbes.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The first tool was a respirometer. When the microbes break down compost material, they release carbon dioxide (CO2), which the respirometer measures. These results were compared to the breakdown of cellulose, which is considered the industry standard of 100% biodegradability. The plant-based polymer matched the cellulose at almost one hundred percent.</span></span></p>

						   <p><span><span>Next the team used water flotation. Since plastics are not water soluble and they float, they can easily be scooped off the surface of water. At intervals of 90 and 200 days, almost 100% of the petroleum-based microplastics were recovered, meaning none of it had biodegraded. On the other hand, after 90 days, only 32% of the algae-based microplastics were recovered, showing that more than two thirds of it had biodegraded. After 200 days, only 3% was recovered indicating that 97% of it had disappeared.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The last measurement involved chemical analysis via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GCMS), which detected the presence of the monomers used to make the plastic, indicating that the polymer was being broken to its starting plant materials. Scanning-electron microscopy further showed how microorganisms colonize the biodegradable microplastics during composting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“This material is the first plastic demonstrated to&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>not</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;create microplastics as we use it,” said Stephen Mayfield, a paper coauthor, School of Biological Sciences professor and co-founder of Algenesis. “This is more than just a sustainable solution for the end-of-product life cycle and our crowded landfills. This is actually plastic that is&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>not</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;going to make us sick.”</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Creating an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based plastics is only one part of the long road to viability. The ongoing challenge is to be able to use the new material on pre-existing manufacturing equipment that was originally built for traditional plastic, and here Algenesis is making progress. They have partnered with several companies to make products that use the plant-based polymers developed at UC San Diego, including Trelleborg for use in coated fabrics and RhinoShield for use in the production of cell phone cases.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>“When we started this work, we were told it was impossible,” stated Burkart. “Now we see a different reality. There's a lot of work to be done, but we want to give people hope. It </span></span><span><span>is</span></span><span><span> possible.”&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I lived in Japan for seven months when I was younger. For all of the challenges I faced there as a woman and a foreigner, I still learned a lot from Japanese culture.</p>



<p>Because Japan experienced a long period of relative isolation from the outside world — caused by <em>sakoku</em> (literally “closed country”), the isolationist foreign policy of the military government during the Edo period — Japanese people have developed their own unique set of values and beliefs.</p>



<p>One unique Japanese concept is the idea of <em>ikigai</em>, which can be roughly translated to <em>reason for being</em> (or “raison d’être” in my native French)<em> </em>. Each person’s ikigai is personal to them, reflective of their inner self, and creating a mental state in which they feel at ease.</p>



<p>What makes it such a powerful idea in today’s age of constant change and uncertainty is that ikigai doesn’t limit someone’s value in life to career and financial status. In fact, in a survey of 2,000 Japanese people <a href="https://www.crs.or.jp/backno/No636/6362.htm">conducted</a> by Central Research Services, only a third of respondents considered work as their ikigai.</p>



<p>Rather, ikigai is about feeling your life makes a difference in people’s lives — the idea that you can contribute to other people’s lives simply by living a fulfilling life. And this idea can unlock many benefits.</p>



<h2>The Health Benefits of Ikigai</h2>



<p>Because your ikigai is less of a theory and more of a way of living, it can have a profound impact on your mental and physical health.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ikigai reduces anxiety.</strong> Research <a href="http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/gjhs/article/view/18478/12980">shows</a> that the feeling of ikigai contributes to a well-balanced secretion of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, which in turn reduces the feeling of stress.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai is good for your heart.</strong> A seven-year long study with more than 40,000 Japanese adults <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18596247">found</a> evidence that people with a low sense of ikigai had a higher overall mortality risk, mostly due to higher cardiovascular disease.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai increases your self-authorship.</strong> Research <a href="https://www.autonomicneuroscience.com/article/S1566-0702(09)00479-2/abstract">suggests</a> that people without ikigai have a strong need for approval from others, while those with ikigai tend to perform tasks for their own satisfaction.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai makes you more resilient.</strong> There’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1021747419204">evidence</a> that ikigai may help you go through times of hardship more easily, making you feel like it’s worthwhile to continue living. For example, it helped many Japanese people cope <a href="http://www.scirp.org/fileOperation/downLoad.aspx?path=PSYCH20110800005_56761305.pdf&amp;type=journal">during</a> the earthquake that occurred in Japan in March 2011 and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349725406_Health_Benefits_of_Ikigai_A_Review_of_Literature">during</a> the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>



<li><strong>Ikigai helps you live longer.</strong> Another study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19539820">identified</a> ikigai as a positive psychological factor contributing to longevity, with men and women with a sense of ikigai showing decreased risks of mortality from all causes.</li>
</ul>



<p>In short, there’s quite a bit of research suggesting that a sense of ikigai will contribute to your overall well-being. So, how can you leverage the power of ikigai?</p>



<h2>Leverage the Actual Power of Ikigai</h2>



<p>The concept of ikigai has often been misunderstood in the Western world largely due to the popularity of the below Venn diagram:</p>

<p>This diagram was created in 2011 by astrologer Andres Zuzunaga, who designed it to help people find their purpose in life, and was then adapted by blogger Marc Winn, who replaced the word “purpose” with “ikigai” (you can read the whole story <a href="https://ikigaitribe.com/ikigai/ikigai-misunderstood/">here</a>).</p>



<p>However, the concept of ikigai is not about finding the intersection of what you love, what you’re good at, what the world needs, and what you can get paid for. It’s just about finding pleasure in life and being happy to get up in the morning.</p>



<p>“Japanese people don’t view ikigai as a lofty goal, a destination, or something to achieve,” explains Nicholas Kemp, author of the book <em>Ikigai-Kan</em>. Similarly, in The Little Book of Ikigai, Ken Mogi wrote: “Japanese do not need grandiose motivational frameworks to keep going, but rely more on the little rituals in their daily routines.”</p>

<p>Your ikigai can be found in small daily rituals, side projects, and deep conversations. It can be found in moments of silence and idleness, or in moments of creative flow. To find your ikigai, forget about the westernized version and instead follow these principles:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Stop seeking your One True Passion.</strong> Many of us think that finding our passion will magically give our life a purpose. Instead, find meaning in your daily experiences and interactions. Explore the world around and inside you. Learn something new everyday, including about yourself. Play with uncertainty instead of chasing the <a href="https://nesslabs.com/the-paradox-of-goals">next milestone</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Embrace lifelong learning.</strong> The concept of ikigai never mentions being good at what you do. There is joy in being a beginner all over again, learning through mistakes, and growing outside of your comfort zone. Don’t try to be the expert in the room. Keep <a href="https://nesslabs.com/generative-questions">asking questions</a>. Never stop learning.</li>



<li><strong>Let go of lofty financial goals.</strong> Ikigai also doesn’t have anything to do with money. Of course, we all need enough money to live a comfortable life, and money can help explore projects and ideas that bring you pleasure in life, but beyond the point of comfort, financial success should be seen as a potential byproduct of living a meaningful life.</li>



<li><strong>Don’t try to save the world.</strong> Instead, focus on the positive impact you can have on your friends, family, colleagues, and community. Ask yourself how you can connect with people in meaningful ways and which changes you want to bring to life. This is how we save the world — when everyone contributes at their own human scale.</li>
</ol>



<p>As psychiatrist Mieko Kamiya <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%94%9F%E3%81%8D%E3%81%8C%E3%81%84%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A4%E3%81%84%E3%81%A6-%E7%A5%9E%E8%B0%B7%E7%BE%8E%E6%81%B5%E5%AD%90%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3-%E7%A5%9E%E8%B0%B7-%E7%BE%8E%E6%81%B5%E5%AD%90/dp/4622081814">puts it</a>, ikigai is closer in Japanese to the “power necessary to live in this world” or the “happiness to be alive”, which unfortunately is often translated to “a life worth living” in English, when the original concept doesn’t ascribe measurable value to our lives.</p>



<p>Instead of pursuing a grand life purpose, optimize for wanting to wake up in the morning. Live a life of curiosity and connection. Trust that success will be a byproduct of the meaning you find in daily experiences.</p>

<p>Building QuickWP has been a challenging and learning experience for us, and today, we are open-sourcing the code base for the project so you can also learn from it and maybe even build something awesome upon it.</p>



<p>In this article, I will discuss the ideas, challenges, and things we learned by working on QuickWP. I hope this helps you if you ever face similar challenges.</p>



		
			






<h2 id="h-the-idea">The idea</h2>



<p>While we have thought of experimenting with AI and OpenAI APIs for a while, we never planned to create an AI website builder. Previously, we tried integrating AI with the <a href="https://themeisle.com/plugins/otter-blocks/?utm_source=themeisle&amp;utm_medium=themeisle_blog&amp;utm_campaign=we-are-open-sourcing-our-ai-site-builder">Otter Blocks</a> plugin to generate layouts from available patterns using AI prompt, but that implementation was quite primitive. The results were very generic and did not consider user context much in the provided result.</p>



<p>Given that patterns in Block Editor are easy to break even with minor changes, we could not simply ask GPT to create patterns on the fly or even ask it to replace content.</p>



<p>It all changed when we thought of this idea based on wireframes. It is simple: we create an FSE theme with wireframes and extensive color palettes. And then, with AI, we pick the patterns based on user prompts.</p>



<p>In FSE themes, using the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">theme.json</a> file properties, we can easily modify the styling of the entire website from one place. And the same is applied to our patterns so that we have uniformity across the website without worrying about different patterns having different settings that need to be modified separately.</p>



<p>Here, we also use a CC0 image directory to populate the website with images to give a better starting point to the user.</p>



<p>While the idea sounds simple enough, it required some trials and errors for us to reach the point where it could generate results that were good enough for the user. The goal was to spend as little time as possible to create a prototype that users can use as a SaSS from the product website.</p>






<h2 id="h-overview-of-project-stack">Overview of project stack</h2>



<p>The project required more than one part, so we used a number of stacks, i.e., whatever made it easier for us to prototype as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>Here are the various parts of the project:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Codeinwp/quickwp-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSE Theme</a>: The base of the project. It includes various patterns and a comprehensive theme.json file.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/Codeinwp/quickwp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Base Plugin</a>: This plugin has all the functionality and UI required to make the project work.</li>



<li><a href="https://github.com/Codeinwp/quickwp-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API Endpoint</a>: An API endpoint communicating between the user website and OpenAI API.</li>
</ul>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="972" height="793" src="https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/cb:jC7e.37109/w:972/h:793/q:90/f:best/https://themeisle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/QuickWP-Diagram.png" alt="QuickWP Diagram" data-opt-src="https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/cb:jC7e.37109/w:972/h:793/q:90/f:best/https://themeisle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/QuickWP-Diagram.png" data-old-src="https://mllj2j8xvfl0.i.optimole.com/cb:jC7e.37109/w:972/h:793/q:eco/f:best/https://themeisle.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/QuickWP-Diagram.png"></figure>



<p>Here is a simplified diagram to show the entire workflow.</p>






<h2 id="h-fse-theme">FSE theme</h2>



<p>The FSE theme works as the base of the entire project. To make prototyping easier, we started with a fork of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme. We pretty much removed all the patterns and customized the theme.json properties as per our needs.</p>



<p>FSE theme best practices are changing very quickly, and with each version of WordPress, we have a new way of doing things. Starting with the fork of the default theme allows us to build upon a solid foundation with minimal work.</p>



<p>In terms of code, most of the things are as you would expect in an FSE theme. The only difference you will notice is <a href="https://github.com/Codeinwp/quickwp-theme/blob/main/patterns/hero-cover.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how we use strings and images in patterns</a>.</p>



<p>Here, we add default text, template-specific namespace for the strings, and a default preview namespace to each string.</p>



<p>The default text is the text that will appear in the patterns when used normally, in case someone is adding a pattern inside the editor or using the theme without QuickWP AI.</p>



<p>The template-specific namespace is an identifier for that particular string. And the default preview namespace is a shared namespace that we use for all the strings in context. We will come back to this later.</p>






<h2 id="h-ai-prompt-generation">AI prompt generation</h2>



<p>As it was a quick prototype, we wanted to explore easier testing and implementation methods. We experimented with various AI models but ended up with the most popular option, which is OpenAI. During the development phase, we used GPT-4 as the results were much better with OpenAI’s latest model offering, but it was too costly, so we decided to shift to using GPT-3.5 Turbo for most tasks. I say most of the tasks as we are still using GPT-4 for color palette generation as the color variety was not great with GPT-3.5</p>



<p>For making requests, we tried different options that OpenAI offers but found the Assistant API best suited for our needs. To avoid some bad-faith actors, we also used OpenAI’s Moderation API to prevent processing the requests if they do not align with OpenAI’s content policies. As we can see after the release, people have tried to experiment with all sorts of prompts that could have landed our OpenAI account in trouble, so adding the moderation was worth the time. And yes, it is free to use!</p>






<h2 id="h-image-generation">Image generation</h2>



<p>When we were imagining this project, one of the issues was how to generate images. We could, of course, use Dall-E or other models to do it, but they’re slow, low-quality, and quite expensive. It turned out that we were thinking in the wrong direction. Why generate images when there are millions and millions of CC0 images available on the internet?</p>



<p>After some consideration, we chose <a href="https://www.pexels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pexels</a>. The reason behind choosing Pexels was that it has more liberal request limits and a good catalog of images. And, of course, we link back to the original image on our app.</p>






<h2 id="h-how-do-you-maintain-context-site-wide">How do you maintain context site-wide?</h2>



<p>The first problem we needed to solve to make this project work was to see how we could maintain context site-wide when generating content for the user. Different patterns have different numbers and types of strings, and we can’t just randomly add content there and hope it will be relevant for the website.</p>



<p>And this is where our great friend JSON came to the rescue. With some creative prompts (found in the source code) and a consistent JSON schema, we could maintain context throughout the website and have strings that complement each other, rather than random gibberish.</p>



<p>If you look at one of our templates, you will see how we list each pattern with a description to let the API know its purpose and what strings it contains.</p>



<p>For example, here’s the first pattern from that template:</p>



<pre><code>
{
    "order": 1,
    "slug": "quickwp/hero-centered",
    "name": "Hero Centered",
    "description": "Hero sections are used to introduce the product or service. They are the first and primary section of the website. This is a centered hero section with a large title, a subtitle and two buttons.",
    "category": "heroes_page_titles",
    "strings": [
        {
            "slug": "hero-centered/title",
            "description": "Main title of the hero section"
        },
        {
            "slug": "hero-centered/subtitle",
            "description": "Subtitle of the hero section"
        },
        {
            "slug": "hero-centered/button-primary",
            "description": "Primary button text of the hero section"
        },
        {
            "slug": "hero-centered/button-secondary",
            "description": "Secondary button text of the hero section"
        }
    ],
    "images": [
        {
            "slug": "hero-centered/image",
            "description": "Background image of the hero section"
        }
    ]
}</code></pre>



<p>Each string, along with the namespace, also describes its connection to the rest of the pattern. This allows us to make sure that GPT does not repeat the same thing in multiple places and, for example, keeps the subtitle related to the title of the pattern.</p>



<p>When we get the request back on the site, we use the string slug to <a href="https://github.com/Codeinwp/quickwp-theme/blob/main/patterns/hero-centered.php#L17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replace it in the pattern</a>.</p>



<p>While our current implementation is primitive, you can use this approach to give even more context to the string, such as the length and tone of the string. This way, we only exchange the data and not the markup.</p>






<h2 id="h-we-need-wordpress-instances-for-each-user">We need WordPress instances for each user</h2>



<p>Another problem we needed to solve was to have an instance of WordPress for each user session. In our implementation, we are making changes live on the WordPress instance of the current user and then using existing WordPress functionality to export the FSE theme. Only if there was a solution to create WordPress instances without pretty much building a small web hosting solution…</p>



<p>Let me introduce you to <a href="https://wordpress.org/playground/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress Playground</a>. Playground allows you to run WordPress in your browser with zero clicks. If you have not used the WP Playground, you will be surprised at how awesome it is!</p>






<h2 id="h-what-will-you-be-building-with-wordpress">What will you be building with WordPress?</h2>



<p>Now that we have walked you through some of the challenges we faced, what will you be building with these tools? We hope the article inspired you to use some of the tools we discussed, like OpenAI API, FSE themes, and WordPress Playground, and build something awesome. If you do, let us know because we would love to try it!</p>



<p>Once again, all the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/Codeinwp/quickwp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on our GitHub</a>, so feel free to use it in any way it can help you!</p>

        <p>
          I want to tell the story of a beautiful phenomenon in biology. In some
          sense it’s the prototype of much of the activity of life. The
          phenomenon is the way in which an individual cell of
          <em>E. coli</em> forages for nutrients. This process, known as
          “chemotaxis”—the “chemo-” for chemical and the “taxis” from the Greek
          τάξις, for tactics—is intelligence in one of
          its most elemental forms. An individual <em>E. coli</em> has no brain,
          obviously, and is even many orders of magnitude simpler than a human
          cell, and yet already it possesses something like a sense of smell,
          drive, even a memory. Chemotaxis recasts <em>E. coli</em> not as some
          aimless gut-pest but rather as an exquisitely sophisticated
          <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300167849/wetware/#:~:text=This%20book%20offers%20a%20startling,is%20a%20form%20of%20computation.">physical computer</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m also telling this story because
          <a href="https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology">I never liked the way biology was taught in high school</a>. It was too much about the names of things. A subject so vast is
          spoiled by a textbook, which can only point at the endless parade of
          stuff-there-is-to-know. It’s better approached with questions—like
          “what’s happening when you smell?” or ”what is a fever,
          actually?”—that contemplate narrow, deep slices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chemotaxis is a great slice: it’s a triumph of systems biology—we
          understand it holistically but also in fine detail at almost every
          level. It acquaints you with many of the most important motifs in
          biology, including the way in which protein structure determines
          function; how membranes control the information flow into cells; and
          how chemical modifications store and communicate state. It involves
          one of the most sophisticated and beautiful pieces of molecular
          nanotechnology, the flagellar motor. And it helps give an intuition
          for how a bag of unthinking chemicals could possibly give rise to a
          being.
        </p>
        <h3>The 30,000-foot view</h3>
        <figure>
          
          <figcaption>
            Even with simple rules, the E. coli finds food more often than not
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The basic idea is this: <em>E. coli</em> “smells” chemicals it’s
          attracted to with a set of nose-like receptors and decides how to
          swim. Depending on what it senses, it can either use its flagellar
          tails to swim forward—this is known as a “run”—or it can spin in a
          random direction (a “tumble”). By running when the getting is good and
          tumbling when it isn’t, the <em>E. coli</em> takes a meandering path
          toward the attractant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little more detail now: there are half a dozen or so rotors on the
          <em>E. coli’s</em> body, each controlling a long whip-like tail that
          flows behind it. When all the rotors are spinning in the same
          direction, the tails join together into a coil that torques the cell
          forward into a run. When even one rotor is spinning against the
          others, the coil unbundles and <em>E. coli</em> spins into a tumble.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a uniform chemical environment, the <em>E. coli</em> swims in a
          random walk by balancing runs with periodic tumbles. By default, a run
          lasts about a second, or ten times longer than a tumble. The rate of
          runs versus tumbles, and their relative duration, is carefully tuned
          to balance “exploitation” and “exploration”: if runs happened too
          often or lasted too long, <em>E. coli</em> would range too widely and
          zip past its food; too seldom or too short, and it’d likely never find
          food in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how is this balance achieved? The crux of it is a signaling
          molecule called CheY (pronounced “KEY-why”). CheY is constantly
          bouncing around in the cytoplasm of the <em>E. coli</em>, interacting
          with both the receptor complex (the “nose”) and the rotors, carrying
          information between them. In the steady state, when CheY encounters
          the receptor complex, it gets chemically modified, or
          “phosphorylated,” at a certain rate to become CheY-p. Unlike the
          unmodified version, CheY-p has a strong affinity for the rotors, and
          when enough copies bind to one, it reverses its spin, causing a
          tumble.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trick is that when the nose detects an <em>increase</em> in the
          concentration of attractant, that steady turning of CheYs into CheY-ps
          is interrupted. As a result, fewer CheY-ps bind to the rotors; fewer
          reversals take place; and so the <em>E. coli</em> runs more and
          tumbles less. In other words, the all-important relative rate of runs
          versus tumbles is determined entirely by how often the
          CheY→CheY-p process churns—and this, in turn, is determined by
          how much attractant is detected by the nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see this process in action in the interactive illustration.
          Try altering the ratio of CheY-p (white) to CheY (blue) by adding some
          attractant (pink). You‘ll end up inducing a long run.
        </p>
        
        <div>
          <p>Less attractant</p>
          <p>More attractant</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Why do you need all this complexity? You could imagine a system in
          which the motors themselves responded directly to attractant. We’ll
          see later on that the stream of CheY-ps acts as a kind of adaptable,
          tunable chemical amplifier. “<a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/chemotaxis/#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20bacterial,per%20cell%20volume!">Bacterial cells can amplify</a>
          signals more than 50-fold; that is to say, a 2% change in receptor
          occupancy can bring about a 100% change in the output of the system at
          the flagellar motors. This feature allows cells to sense minute
          changes in concentration—less than three molecules per cell volume!”
        </p>
        <h3>
          The story gets more complicated: adaptation
        </h3>
        <p>
          If the system were as described above, then
          <em>E. coli</em> wouldn’t have much dynamic range. Imagine: if the
          cell has a huge reaction to just three molecules of attractant,
          wouldn’t a thousand times as many just completely overwhelm it?
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, the <em>E. coli</em> is able to respond sensitively across
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=58&amp;v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;feature=youtu.be">five orders of magnitude</a>
          of attractant concentration. The cell learns to treat whatever
          concentration it stumbles into as the new normal, so that the
          slightest increase triggers the same hypersensitive response as
          always.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mechanism powering this adaptation is extremely clever. You can
          think of each receptor as being equipped with “struts” that have
          pockets in them. When the receptor is bound to attractant, its struts
          change shape so that these pockets open up, and become the targets for
          little molecules known as methyl groups. Methyl groups are ubiquitous
          in biochemistry: for instance, they help determine which parts of your
          DNA get expressed. Methyl groups bind to the structural proteins your
          DNA strands coil around, called histones; the “methylated” histone can
          kink the DNA strand into or out of view of your transcription
          machinery, turning it on or off.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, methylation serves to fill up the strut’s pockets,
          causing it to become more rigid. (I’m simplifying the actual physical
          details somewhat, as we’ll see later.) With more rigid struts the
          receptor’s signaling power is dampened: it takes more attractant to
          elicit the same response. Because there are many methylation sites per
          strut and many struts per receptor, there’s a wide range of possible
          dampening values—as if those pockets were really the holes of an
          elaborate wind instrument.
          <span>[<a id="bray-maybe-referent" href="#bray-maybe">Bray</a>]</span>
          This wide dynamic range is what allows the bacteria not just to find a
          favorable environment but to keenly and speedily nose its way up a
          chemical gradient. No wonder a similar mechanism is used by cells in
          your immune system to track and hunt down invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methylation of the receptors gives <em>E. coli</em> a “<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2899694/#:~:text=The%20receptor%20methylation%20level%20also%20provides%20a%20simple%20chemical%20memory%20used%20to%20ascertain%20whether%20the%20current%20direction%20of%20swimming%20is%20favorable%20or%20unfavorable.">simple chemical memory</a>.” This is a powerful and somewhat profound idea: individual bacteria
          can model their environment and remember important features of it by
          encoding that information in internal chemical modifications.
          <em>E. coli</em> “knows” whether attractant has become more or less
          concentrated in its surroundings going back
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2899694">several seconds</a>; that helps it determine whether it’s swimming in a good or bad
          direction. Which is not that different in principle from what brains
          do. In fact one reason that it requires an artificial neural network
          of about a

          elements just to model the computational capabilities of a single real

          chemistry.

          be, given the mechanisms available to a single cell for accepting
          previously extreme conditions as “a new normal”? No doubt our macro
          resilience is in some cases actually underwritten by similar cellular
          mechanisms.)

          The video above is a very legible overview of
          <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis, from a popular textbook. It layers in
          even more detail, including not just the proteins that phosphorylate
          CheY but those that dephosphorylate it; and not just the proteins that
          methylate the receptors but those that demethylate it. What you come
          to see is that these doers and undoers define a sort of equilibrated
          circuit whose activity can be conveniently dialed up or down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dennis Bray describes these sorts of circuits nicely in his book,
          <em>Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell</em>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In a typical signaling pathway, proteins are continually being
            modified and demodified. Kinases and phosphatases work ceaselessly
            like ants in a nest, adding phosphate groups to proteins and
            removing them again. It seems a pointless exercise, especially when
            you consider that each cycle of addition and removal costs the cell
            one molecule of ATP—one unit of precious energy. Indeed, cyclic
            reactions of this kind were originally labeled “futile.” But the
            adjective is misleading. The addition of phosphate groups to
            proteins is the single most common reaction in cells and underpins a
            large proportion of the computations they perform. Far from being
            futile, this cyclic reaction provides the cell with an essential
            resource: a flexible and rapidly tunable device.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the cell really needs to change the concentration of the modified
            protein very quickly, it can. All it has to do is to switch on or
            shut off the phosphate-adding reaction and the concentration will
            fall precipitously—at the speed of the spinning cycle. There is no
            buildup of products or depletion of substrates to slow down the
            process, as there would be in a linear chain of enzyme reactions.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is a clever way to regulate the level of some protein or
          metabolite. Rather than producing the thing you want via a lengthy
          chain reaction, you just have this running cycle that activates and
          then de-activates it, for example via phosphorylation and
          de-phosphorylation. When you want more of the active version, you just
          tamp down the de-activating reaction in the cycle, as if sliding down
          the volume on a stereo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulation in this manner via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
          (by “kinases” and “phosphatases” respectively) is an extremely general
          feature of life. “About 30–50% of human proteins contain covalently
          attached phosphate. [. . .] A typical mammalian cell makes use of
          hundreds of distinct types of protein kinases at any moment.”
          <span>[<a id="alberts-referent" href="#alberts">Alberts</a>]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interactive figure above, phosphorylation is represented by the
          blue dots becoming white, and de-phosphorylation happens when they
          turn blue again. This cycle is constantly running. The speed of the
          cycle determines how quickly the cell can react to levels of
          attractant. Notice that when you add some, the blue→white
          reaction stops happening as much. But the blue←white reaction
          keeps going at the same rate. So blue CheY proliferates, and the cell
          runs more. (If the cycle spun more slowly, the blues wouldn‘t take
          over so quickly.)
        </p>
        <h3>Down the rabbit-hole…</h3>
        <p>
          One thing I don’t love in presentations of chemotaxis—and of
          biological concepts generally—is that they often prominently feature
          flowcharts and network diagrams. In the case of chemotaxis, as you can
          gather from the video above, there are many players with nearly
          indistinguishable names: CheA phosphorylates CheY to become CheY-p,
          and CheZ dephosphorylates it back to CheY; CheW couples CheA to the
          receptors, and CheR methylates those receptors’ struts; CheB,
          meanwhile, “clips off” the methyl groups added to the struts by CheR.
          A network diagram is no doubt useful for organizing this sea of names
          but in a sense it foregrounds the most abstract view of the process.
          I’d rather try to get a sense of the parts as a living whole or in
          their individual physical detail.
        </p>
        <p>When you do that, it’s amazing what you find.</p>
        <h3>
          What does it mean for a receptor to detect attractant?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Almost every action in a cell depends on proteins changing shape and
          binding to each other. It’s no different in the
          <em>E. coli</em> receptor complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way it works is that there are stimulus-specific proteins embedded
          in the <em>E. coli’s</em> cell membrane, protruding into what’s known
          as the periplasm. These proteins are “stimulus-specific” in the
          literal sense that they are shaped so as to bind favorably with
          individual molecules of attractant. <em>E. coli</em> has five or six
          of these, for instance one that detects a crucial amino acid called
          aspartate. This sensor protein has little clefts in it that are shaped
          just so for molecules of aspartate to fit snugly into them.
          <span>[<a id="falke-referent" href="#falke">Falke</a>]</span>
          In schematic form the aspartate receptor looks like this:
        </p>
        <figure>

              Adaptation Enzymes”</a>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          You can see that the sensory part—up top, where the aspartate binds—is
          connected to the signaling proteins CheW and CheA by a columnar
          structure that straddles the cell’s membrane. What does this protein
          complex “actually” look like?
        </p>
        <p>
          An individual protein is small enough—<a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/how-big-is-the-average-protein/">like a few nanometers wide</a>—that it can’t really be seen through a regular light microscope.
          This receptor from top to bottom measures about 350 angstroms, or 35
          nanometers. But modern biology is all about seeing the unseeable.
          Nowadays, we try to find out what nanostructures look like by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography">X-ray diffraction</a>
          or, more and more often, by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_microscopy">cryo-freezing them</a>
          in an electron microscope. Once we determine a protein’s structure
          it’s usually rendered using ribbon diagrams, a style
          <a href="https://stories.duke.edu/sciences-mother-of-ribbon-diagrams-celebrates-50-years-at-duke">invented by the biochemist Jane Richardson</a>
          in the late 1970s. Here’s a ribbon diagram for the
          <em>E. coli</em> serine receptor (really it’s a “trimer of dimers,” or
          a complex of six receptors):
        </p>

        <p>
          This whole thing is the receptor. (Those parts just inside the
          membrane, with little yellow methyl groups lingering stuck to them,
          are the struts.) How exactly it works is quite complex, and the
          subject of current research. But in simplified terms it acts like one
          big piston: when the asparate binds to the part in the periplasm, the
          columnar structure it’s attached to changes shape—a real biologist
          would call these subtle allosteric effects; to me it looks like
          dipping and tilting—in such a way to lock the thing that’s supposed to
          be phosphorylating CheY, the CheA kinase, into an inactive state.

          When I think of a cell I imagine a Rube Goldberg–type contraption
          where an arm swings here, which drops a ball into a slide there, which
          rolls down and opens a trap door, which… eventually turns on or off
          some important cellular function. Indeed, <em>E. coli</em>’s “sense of
          smell” rests ultimately in a series of physical lock-and-key
          mechanisms, starting with literal molecules of e.g. aspartate nuzzling
          into a protein and transmitting that physical shape-change across the
          membrane.

        <p>
          This piston-shaped receptor complex is just one of a huge array
          arranged near the front of <em>E. coli</em>’s body. In cross section
          they appear almost to have been laid down through a lithography
          process, in a neat hexagonal pattern:

          Calling <em>E. coli’s</em> receptor complex its “nose” is no mere
          metaphor. Our own noses operate on a similar principle: when you smell
          a flower, it means that actual flower-molecules—possibly only a tiny
          number of them—have reached the inside of your nose and bound to some
          protein with a specific affinity for that very molecule. This signal
          is then transmitted via nerves to your brain. The human nose has
          several hundred receptor proteins for smell; a dog has
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5884888/#:~:text=The%20canine%20OR%20repertoire%20is%20composed%20of%201%2C094%20genes%2C%20approximately%20three%20times%20more%20than%20a%20human.">more than a thousand</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every one of our senses works like this. Touch is underwritten by
          proteins that get “squished” by tactile forces into cell membranes,
          triggering a set of downstream responses. Sight is my favorite
          example. There’s a protein called opsin that lives in the cells of our
          retina. What’s so cool about it is that the thing that changes its
          shape is a literal photon. That is,
          <a href="https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/147#:~:text=Rhodopsin%2C%20shown%20here,to%20the%20brain.">opsin converts the electromagnetic force of an incoming photon into
            a biomechanical / biochemical signal</a>. This is why I tend to think of molecular biology as the science of
          shapes bumping into each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think of <em>E. coli’s</em> receptor complex as a protoversion of
          our own sensory apparatus. Its nose has only
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2596&amp;v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;feature=youtu.be">five or six</a>
          attractant-specific sensory proteins, but their signals are
          integrated, as if different sets of receptor-protein activations were
          playing different “chords” on the
          <em>E. coli’s</em> sensorium. “In short, the chemosensory array
          functions as an ultrasensitive, ultrastable biological integrated
          circuit or sensory chip.”
          <span>[<a id="falke-referent-2" href="#falke-2">Falke</a>]</span>
        </p>
        <h3>How the signal is carried</h3>
        <p>
          So a bit of attractant binds one of the receptors, and lo, the
          equilibrium inside the cell begins to shift. Because the CheA kinase
          is now inactive, CheYs are no longer getting phosphorylated as
          quickly; the process that <em>de</em>-phosphorylates existing CheY-ps
          starts winning out. Recall that this is a response that is dynamic, a
          flow that is tuned. The net number of CheY-ps in the cell is carefully
          faded down. And then what?
        </p>
        <p>
          The CheY-ps had been binding to the flagellar rotors, flipping them,
          causing tumbles. That now no longer happens as much, because the
          unphosphorylated CheY doesn’t have the same affinity for the rotor as
          CheY-p. As a result, the cell tumbles less, runs more, and biases its
          random walk toward the attractant.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s something really important worth dwelling on here. When we say
          that CheY-p has an “affinity” for the rotor protein, it’s not like it
          gets directed there; nor does it have some long-acting magnetic
          attraction for it. What this really means is that it has a strong
          inclination to bind to the rotor protein when it gets really really
          close to it. (And CheY, without the -p, doesn't have such an
          inclination.) Given how small a single CheY-p is in the scheme of the
          whole cell’s cytoplasm, it might seem improbable that it’ll somehow
          sidle up right next to one of these rotor proteins somewhere on the
          other end of the <em>E. coli’s</em> body. But that gets at the heart
          of

          Cells are dense with stuff, but everything in it is also

        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To get an idea of how fast this motion is, imagine a typical
            bacterial cell, and place an enzyme at one end and a sugar molecule
            at the other. They will bump around and wander through the whole
            cell, encountering many molecules along the way. On average, though,
            it will only take about a second for those two molecules to bump
            into each other at least once. This is truly remarkable: this means
            that any molecule in a typical bacterial cell, during its chaotic
            journey through the cell, will encounter almost every other molecule
            in a matter of seconds.
            <span>[<a id="goodsell-referent" href="#goodsell">Goodsell</a>]</span>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Just to put this in perspective: imagine you took an
          <em>E. coli</em> cell and scaled it up so that it was the length of a
          football field. And imagine you kept all the physics the same. A water
          molecule would be about an inch wide; a protein would be about the
          size of a basketball.
          <span>[<a href="#bionumbers">BioNumbers</a>]</span>
          The proteins would be juddering violently due to the thermal motion of
          the water particles bombarding them—so violently in fact that if left
          unchecked they’d be moving at 500 meters per second. But they aren’t
          left unchecked: if you were in such an environment it would be so
          crowded as to be nearly impossible to see. What you really get, then,
          is an incredible ceaseless shaking and bouncing-into-each-other of all
          the component parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why shape changes that lead to different bonding affinities
          are so important in biology. It’s as if inside a cell everyone is
          constantly going up to everyone else, seeing if they fit together.
          Proteins sample the space of interactions with other proteins so
          quickly that for a long time, most biologists didn’t really
          contemplate where in the cytoplasm two reactants lived; they knew that
          you never had to wait too long for them to meet each other. In fact it
          was a
          <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-newfound-source-of-cellular-order-in-the-chemistry-of-life-20210107/">relatively recent discovery</a>
          that inside the cytoplasm certain proteins that share functional
          relationships do seem to keep especially close together, inside little
          oil drops known as “phase-separated liquids.” Weak interactive forces
          between the floppy tails of different proteins cause them to
          spontaneously “phase separate” into these more viscous pools, and this
          biases certain proteins to interact more frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rate-limiting step in <em>E. coli’s</em> reaction to attractant is
          the time it takes for CheY-p to diffuse from the nose to the motor. It
          takes about a tenth of a second. The journey has actually been tracked
          on camera, using a fluorescent version of the protein:

          Let’s talk about these motors. These things are so intricate and
          beautiful and seem so reminiscent of machines we’d engineer ourselves
          that they’re sometimes cited as evidence for intelligent design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flagellar motor operates with close to 100% energy efficiency. It
          spins at about 1,500 rotations per second. And the craziest part is
          that like all molecular nanomachines it is entirely self-assembled.
          There’s an amazing 30-minute documentary
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw0-MHI_248">available on YouTube</a>
          that details the mechanics of the self-assembly process—and,
          refreshingly, profiles some of the scientists who figured it out,
          describing the methods they used to make their discoveries.

        <p>
          My favorite part of the self-assembly process is that after building a
          base for the rotor, a sort of tunnel is built and the proteins that
          comprise the whip-like “hook” of the flagellum are extruded through
          it—as if the flagellum were built by vomiting forth parts of itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, at the base of each rotor there are a series of proteins
          called FliG, FliM, and FliN—pronounced like “Fly G,” “Fly M,” “Fly
          N”—to which CheY-p, our Frodo-esque bearer of the message from the
          nose, attaches once it finally arrives. CheY-p has a strong affinity
          for FliG and will readily glom onto it. We’ll see how that actually
          affects the flagellum in a second. But for now it’s worth noting that
          there’s a thresholding mechanism here: just one CheY-p attaching to
          FliG won’t be enough to flip the motor from counter-clockwise to
          clockwise (thereby causing a tumble)—it actually takes a handful of
          CheY-ps conspiring to make that happen. In fact the motor has
          something like seven states, from rotating quickly counterclockwise at
          three discrete levels of decreasing speed—as if stepping through three
          gears on a bike—to stalling entirely, to starting back up again in the
          clockwise direction, also with three speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as the motor is in the process of changing direction, any CheY-ps
          that do attach to FliG are under constant threat of being removed by
          yet another player, CheZ. That is, the proteins that would reverse the
          motors are subject to removal by other proteins that un-reverse it.
          Again we have a responsive regulatory circuit reminiscent of the one
          that phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated CheY in the first place
          upstream at the receptor. The idea is that every effect is reversible,
          and in fact is reversed at a regular rate. This means that in the
          absence of further signal the cell will quickly return to baseline.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How does the motor actually change directions?
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a matter of pure mechanics this might be the most ingenious part of
          the story. It took quite a long time to figure out and even still it
          seems that we’re not entirely confident with our explanation. But one
          mechanism that’s been proposed is that CheY-p binds to a protein
          called FliM (“Fly EM”) embedded in that ring that defines the base of
          the rotor. This tilts it and causes a 90-degree rotation in an
          attached protein called FliGc. That protein sits at the interface
          between the rotating part of the motor and the so-called “stator,”
          which drives it from the part that’s anchored solidly in the cell
          membrane.

        </figure>
        <p>
          When FliGc changes orientation, the stepper-motor-like cycle that
          normally drives the motor counterclockwise starts driving it clockwise
          instead. In the illustration below, Figure A shows the stator, i.e.,
          the driving mechanism of the motor. It works by stepping back and
          forth between the “open” and “closed” states, schematized by the
          <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/articleImages/image14.png">
          and
          <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/articleImages/image3.png">
          symbols respectively. In Figure B you can see how, in the normal CCW
          direction, the repeated cycling between these two states drives the
          “teeth” of the motor—the crucial FliGc proteins, here tilted
          left-to-right.

        <p>
          When the CheY-p arrives at the rotor it has the effect of flipping the
          FliGc proteins so that now they tilt right-to-left. In that
          orientation the step-drive action works the opposite way, and the
          motor rotates clockwise:

          You can see this more clearly below in the interactive version of
          those figures. Click “Step” to drive the motor in one direction, and
          “Reverse” to flip the orientation of the FliGc proteins; Step again
          and you’ll see it run in the opposite direction.

          It would be nice if the original paper presenting this theory included
          an illustration like this. But even this crude version took me many
          hours to make. As Bret Victor argues in
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfytHvgHybA">Stop Drawing Dead Fish</a>, making moving pictures shouldn’t be so hard. If it were easier,
          such animations would spread everywhere in scientific communication,
          because so often what a paper describes is some kind of dynamic
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dynamic illustrations would help readers grasp proposed mechanisms
          more quickly. As it is, someone who understands a complex mechanism
          usually has to explain it in patient detail to someone
          <em>else</em> who’s good at animating; this costs time and money; and
          most people simply opt not to go through with it. Perhaps someday the
          process will be democratized by better tools, or by a multimodal AI
          system.

          How the motor changing directions causes the <em>E. coli</em> to
          tumble
        </h3>
        <p>
          The final part of the story—for me, anyway; there’s a lot more to
          explore!—is why exactly the clockwise rotation of just one of the
          flagellar motors would send the whole cell a-tumbling. It helps to
          understand how the thing works in “run” mode, when all the flagella
          are oriented the same way.

          Even though this bundle of flagella sort of looks like a propeller,
          when you actually think about it, that’s not really what it is. It’s
          more like a pig’s curly tail that spins with a whip-y sort of motion.
          How exactly does that propel the entire cell? A wonderful book called
          <em>Random Walks in Biology</em> gets into the physics in some detail:

          used a couple stepper motors to drive the counter-clockwise rotation.

        <h3>
          Individuality in the bacterial population
        </h3>
        <p>
          We tend to think of a colony of something like <em>E. coli</em> as an
          undifferentiated evil goo, each bacterium identical to its neighbors.
          But people who’ve studied these organisms under the microscope observe
          a surprising amount of individual personality.
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/262467a0">A 1976 <em>Nature</em> paper</a>, “Non-genetic individuality: chance in the single cell,” explores
          variation in the context of chemotaxis using strains of Salmonella and
          Enterobacter bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper came out before the exact mechanism behind chemotactic
          regulation was well-understood; all the authors knew was that “control
          of tumbling can be rationalised as caused by changes in the levels of
          a tumble regulator.” They hypothesized that although bacteria of the
          same strain would all share the exact same DNA, there might be a
          relatively small number of copies of that “tumble regulator,” and
          natural variation in the transcription, translation, and destruction
          of these regulator proteins could account for differences in behavior.
          Their experiments were mostly at the behavioral level. They observed
          how different individuals—including those in a particularly “tumbly”
          mutant strain (I love that word)—reacted to environments with and
          without attractant, and found plenty of variance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their theory was spot-on. We talked above about how
          <em>E. coli</em> adapt to higher and higher concentrations of
          attractant via a clever methylation mechanism. Well, it turns out that
          the methylation of the receptor struts is governed by only about
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3032&amp;v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;feature=youtu.be">100 CheR proteins</a>
          in the cell. The number of those proteins—along with CheB, which
          un-methylates the struts—determines the speed of the “futile cycle”
          that reacts to changes in attractant concentration. That is, it
          affects how quickly the bacterium adapts when the concentration goes
          up and refracts when it goes down.
          <span>[<a href="#gore">Gore</a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;t=3989s">1:06:30</a>]</span>
          Because 100 copies of CheR is so extraordinarily tiny in the context
          of the full cell buzzing with something like ten million proteins,
          variation by just a handful can have a relatively large effect on the
          cell’s behavior.
          <span>[<a href="#gore">Gore</a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;t=4390s">1:13:20</a>]</span>
          That helps account for why different <em>E. coli</em> with the exact
          same genetic sequence will tumble and adapt at different frequencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent
          <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/27455">experiments</a>
          have used fluorescent microscopy to quantify the individuality of
          different E. coli cells, individuality that arises not from
          differences in gene expression but from the dynamics of signaling
          networks.
        </p>
        <h3>How did we figure all this stuff out?</h3>
        <p>
          We don’t yet have the technology to just observe all of the activity
          inside a living cell. That Goodsell painting above that shows the
          crowded cytoplasm packed with proteins is an artistic composite—backed
          by rigorous research to be sure—because there’s no way to capture all
          the different players in situ at once. And obviously it’s a “still
          life,” not a video. So how could we possibly know all this detail
          about what exactly a given protein looks like, and how and when it
          interacts with others to kick off some particular part of the
          chemotaxis process?
        </p>
        <p>
          There seem to be three or four major kinds of experiment. Probably the
          most common is genetic: you can selectively disrupt one gene at a time
          and, by observing how the mutant <em>E. coli</em> behaves, begin to
          get a grip on each gene’s function. All of the proteins “CheY,”
          “CheZ,” “CheW,” and so on are named simply because they are the
          products of genes that, when excised, “cause a general defect in
          chemotaxis.”
          <span>[<a href="#blair">Blair</a>]</span> As you
          can imagine, identifying all of these is painstaking work, and
          involves a considerable amount of clever inference. For instance you
          might observe that without gene X the bacteria never seems to tumble;
          is that because that gene is involved in recognizing attractant or in
          forcing the rotor to run clockwise?
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have a hypothesis, a second kind of experiment involves
          purifying some subset of these proteins-of-interest in vitro to see
          how they work together to form a particular signaling pathway. For
          example you could put CheA and CheY along with some phosphate groups
          and other necessary reactants and observe whether and how much
          phosphorylation takes place. That’s what the authors did in
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(90)90429-I">this paper</a>
          in <em>Cell</em>, in 1990. They used a radioactive version of
          phosphate as a tracer. “Incorporation of [32P]phosphate into CheA or
          CheY was determined by excising the radioactive band out of the dried
          gel and quantitating in scintillation fluid or by analysis of the
          intact gel using a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA)
          and compare with known radioactive standards.” Another common method
          for observing in vitro dynamics is to genetically modify proteins to
          fluoresce; or to “find” a protein in solution using an antibody that
          recognizes some part of it—you attach that antibody to another
          protein, and that one you fluoresce, so you can find the hidden one.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand the literal lock-and-key mechanics at a particular
          binding site—for instance how exactly a molecule of aspartate causes a
          receptor to deform, kicking off a signaling cascade—involves
          “structural” biology work, i.e., taking pictures of individual
          proteins or, increasingly, ensembles of them in situ. For this you can
          use X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,
          cryo-electron microscopy, super-resolution light microscopy, or some
          combination.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/chemotaxis/">group</a> at
          University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne uses atomic-scale molecular
          dynamics simulations, in software, to understand structural
          details—like the exact
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCobqYrE67w">way</a> that
          CheA changes shape to kick off a downstream signaling process—that
          wouldn’t be apparent from high-resolution imaging alone. (Keith
          Cassidy, whose figures appeared above, now has a
          <a href="https://ckcassidy.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/">lab at the University of Missouri-Columbia</a>
          that’s studying the molecular dynamics of the receptor signaling
          complex.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you can’t get a direct picture. It may require deduction to
          understand, say, how exactly a protein fits in.
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1326408/">One experiment</a>
          found that CheA didn’t bind to a receptor except in the presence of
          CheW; that plus the fact that adding too much CheW into the mixture
          actually led to a decrease in the ability of CheA–CheW complexes to
          bind receptor suggested that CheW competed with that complex for the
          binding site on the receptor and that therefore it must sit between
          the receptor and CheW in the receptor–CheW–CheA trimer
          <span>[via <a href="#blair">Blair</a>]</span>.
          Biology is lousy with heroic inferences like that. It’s a world that’s
          hard to see; sometimes you just have to imagine what’s going on down
          there, and back up those imaginings with the right experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very idea that bacteria run and tumble came from experiments
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/239500a0">published in 1972</a>
          by Howard Berg and Douglas Brown, who used a special three-dimensional
          tracking microscope of their own design to watch the little suckers in
          action. (A fun fact is that they called the non-runs “twiddles”
          instead of “tumbles.”) Some of the physics of flagellar
          propulsion—like how much force the little tails generate—<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_Systems_Biology/tcxCkIxzCO4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PAfrontcover&amp;printsec=frontcover">was discovered</a>
          later by tethering the flagella to a microscope slide: because it’s
          anchored, the “tail wags the dog“ and you can measure how fast the
          <em>E. coli’s</em> body spins. We know that bacterial flagellar motors
          are powered by the
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_141">proton motive force</a>
          from a
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC431412/">1977 paper</a>
          that measured how cells ran or “twiddled” in the presence or absence
          of an electrical potential. But the research has become even more
          refined than that. Just by observing the strength of the rotation
          under various conditions—different viscosities, temperatures, and so
          on—we know that “rotation is tightly coupled to proton flow, with a
          fixed number of protons (~500) used to drive each revolution.”
          <span>[<a href="#blair">Blair</a>]</span>
          Think of how detailed an understanding we’ve gotten!
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason I’m particularly attracted to studies of
          <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis is that it’s an early star of what’s been
          called “in silico” biology. It’s been the subject of many computer
          models. Dennis Bray, the author of that book that put me onto this
          stuff in the first place, made one of the more
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17208180/">popular models</a>. Here’s a nice screenshot of the model in action:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" width="562" height="425" alt="" src="https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/articleImages/image16.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>
          Maybe the chief role of a computer model is that to get it working in
          the first place you have to explicitly articulate every one of your
          assumptions. In much the same way that writing tends to clarify your
          thinking (or at least reveal how unclear it really is), a computer
          model forces you to synthesize what you know. If anything it’s even
          more exacting than a blank page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have a model, you can use it to explore variations on those
          assumptions. “The program gives the correct phenotype of over 60
          mutants in which chemotaxis-pathway components are deleted or
          overexpressed,” Bray writes. At best, a good enough model lets you
          discover things you didn’t already know, or suggests your next
          experiment. “In order to match the impulse response to a brief
          stimulus [. . .] we also had to increase the activities of the
          adaptational enzymes CheR and CheB at least an order of magnitude
          greater than published values.”
        </p>
        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <p>
          Why should you care about <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis? A typical
          answer to that sort of question—and I’m sure the answer given in many
          of the grant applications supporting the work cited here—is that there
          are medical and practical uses. For instance: if you understand the
          signaling pathways of bacterial chemotaxis you can disrupt them; that
          work might lead to a new kind of antibiotic, which, in an era of
          increasing resistance, is direly needed. Or you might hijack
          chemotaxis pathways to create “intelligent sniffers” (Keith Cassidy’s
          phrase) that could home in on cancer cells or environmental waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          More generally you might say—and in fact I led with this up top—that
          understanding this specific phenomenon equips you to understand all
          kinds of others. “Bacterial two-component pathways
          <span>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-component_regulatory_system">def’n</a>]</span>
          control a dazzling array of functions including cell division,
          virulence, antibiotic resistance, metabolite fixation and utilization,
          response to environmental stress, sporulation, and taxis.”
        </p>
        <p>
          But I don’t know, to me the real reason is that it’s neat. It’s just
          fun to find out about. “To learn, and at due times to repeat what one
          has learnt, is that not after all a pleasure?”

          <em>Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell</em>. 2009. This is the
          book that kicked off my interest in E. coli chemotaxis. Bray built
          computer models of the network of interacting parts that give rise to
          E. coli’s sophisticated foraging behavior—an early example of in
          silico “systems biology.” This is a very evocative book, giving you a
          newfound appreciation for the computational power of an individual
          cell.

          of the Cell, the textbook cited below. Is it sufficient to just watch
          this video and be done with it? Maybe, but for some reason I had a
          bunch of questions I still wanted answered that led me to all this
          other stuff.

<p dir="auto"><strong>HiddenVM</strong> is an innovation in computing privacy.</p>
<p dir="auto">Imagine you're entering a country at the airport. The border agents seize your laptop and force you to unlock it so that they can violate your privacy, treat you like a criminal, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/epblc8/australian_border_employee_hands_phone_back_to/" rel="nofollow">insult your humanity</a>. Is that the world you want to live in?</p>
<p dir="auto">Whether you use Windows, macOS or Linux, now there's a tech solution for better privacy: <strong>HiddenVM</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>HiddenVM</strong> is a simple, one-click, free and open-source Linux application that allows you to run Oracle's open-source <a href="https://virtualbox.org/" rel="nofollow">VirtualBox software</a> on the <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" rel="nofollow">Tails operating system</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This means you can run almost any OS as a VM inside the most anti-forensic computing environment in the world. Works where Tails does.</p>
<p dir="auto">The VM will even connect to full-speed pre-Tor Internet by default, while leaving the Tor connection in Tails undisturbed.</p>
<p dir="auto">To ensure anti-forensic deniability of your VMs, you can place your persistent HiddenVM installation - containing all VirtualBox binaries, VMs, and HiddenVM itself - in a <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Hidden%20Volume.html" rel="nofollow">hidden VeraCrypt volume</a>, and only mount it in the amnesic Tails.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you set it up correctly, when your computer is turned off all anyone can plausibly see is a blank Tails USB and a 'wiped' hard drive full of meaningless data, or a default booting decoy OS in a partition that you can create.</p>
<p dir="auto">How does it feel to have <em>no</em> trace of your entire operating system - whether it's Windows, macOS or Linux - ever touch your hard drive? Now you can find out.</p>
<p dir="auto">HiddenVM: <em>insanely private!</em></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Before you install:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Always have two Tails USB sticks, with one as a backup of the latest working Tails for your current HiddenVM.</li>
<li>Always upgrade Tails on your second stick, in case the new Tails doesn't work with your current HiddenVM.</li>
<li>Always give us time to troubleshoot and fix our code to make it work with a new Tails version. Thank you for your patience.</li>
<li>This will give you stability and prevent you from being locked out of your HiddenVM at any point due to a Tails upgrade.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Install:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Boot into <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" rel="nofollow">Tails</a> on your computer and set an <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/administration_password/index.en.html" rel="nofollow">admin password</a> for your session.</li>

<li>Create and mount a deniable, secure storage environment on internal or external media such as a <a href="https://veracrypt.fr/en" rel="nofollow">VeraCrypt</a> volume.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/aforensics/HiddenVM/releases">Download our latest release ZIP</a> and extract the archive.</li>
<li>Run our AppImage file in the Files browser.</li>
<li>Choose to store HiddenVM in your secure storage and it will download all binaries to launch VirtualBox.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Usage:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>After initially installing HiddenVM you can use it offline where each VirtualBox launch takes about 2 minutes.</li>

<p dir="auto"><strong>You don't have to. Inspect the AppImage code:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open a Terminal and <code>cd</code> to the folder containing our AppImage.</li>
<li>Run <code>mkdir inspect &amp;&amp; sudo mount HiddenVM-*-x86_64.AppImage inspect -o offset=188456</code></li>
<li>Every file in the mounted folder can be inspected with a text editor. To search for IP addresses or web domains that HiddenVM could try to phone home to and violate your privacy, use <a href="http://searchmonkey.embeddediq.com/" rel="nofollow">Searchmonkey</a> (<code>sudo apt install searchmonkey</code>) to recursively search for <code>\.\S</code> in the mounted folder's files.</li>
<li>Once you trust the current version of HiddenVM, when new releases arrive you can track code changes by using <a href="https://meldmerge.org/" rel="nofollow">Meld</a> (<code>sudo apt install meld</code>). Drag and drop the old and new folders together into <em>Meld</em>, and any code differences will be highlighted.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Also you can check the integrity of our ZIP release file:</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Download both our ZIP and the SHA512.</li>
<li>Extract our AppImage and place it next to the SHA512.</li>
<li>Do <code>sha512sum -c HiddenVM-*-x86_64.sha512</code> and it will check both the ZIP and the AppImage.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Or generate your own AppImage from our source code once you trust it:</strong></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/aforensics/HiddenVM.git</code></li>
<li><code>cd HiddenVM/appimage</code></li>
<li><code>./make-appimage.sh</code> (The script will download <strong>appimagetool</strong> from <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit">AppImageKit</a> if it needs to.)</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">In the same way as Tor and Tails, <strong>HiddenVM</strong> (called <strong>HVM</strong> for short) is intended for a wide range of people and situations around the world. In our digital age of increasing surveillance and control, we need tools to keep digital privacy and freedom alive.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are a political dissident in a country under totalitarian rule, in your situation there has never been a robust tech solution to truly hide and protect your data in a convenient way. Our tool may provide that for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are aligned with the Tails and Tor projects in our intention and promotion of how this software could and should be used.</p>

<p dir="auto">We have so far successfully tested Windows 10, macOS Mojave, Linux Mint, Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Fedora, and Whonix. Anything that works in VirtualBox should be compatible. Our Wiki will have how-to's and links for specific OSes. Please contribute interesting findings in <a href="https://reddit.com/r/HiddenVM" rel="nofollow">our subreddit</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Using VMs in Tails uses a lot of RAM because Tails already runs entirely in RAM. We recommended at least 16 GB in your machine but your mileage may vary.</p>
<a name="user-content-why-is-hiddenvm-taking-more-than-the-usual-2-minutes-to-launch"></a>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id8">Why is HiddenVM taking more than the usual 2 minutes to launch?</a></h3><a id="user-content-why-is-hiddenvm-taking-more-than-the-usual-2-minutes-to-launch" aria-label="Permalink: Why is HiddenVM taking more than the usual 2 minutes to launch?" href="#why-is-hiddenvm-taking-more-than-the-usual-2-minutes-to-launch"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The first time you run HiddenVM, the install can take anywhere from several minutes to more than half an hour because it needs to download all the necessary software that it uses. After that it caches everything offline for a much quicker 2-minute launch time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every 7 days, if you're connected to the Internet HiddenVM will do an <code>apt-get</code> update to check repositories like VirtualBox and will download new updates if available. Sometimes you can get connected to a very slow Tor circuit in Tails. Close off HiddenVM's Terminal window and restart Tails to hopefully be connected to a faster circuit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every time you do a Tails and HiddenVM upgrade, the first time after this will almost always need to install new package versions, thus taking around 5 minutes or longer. Then it returns to the usual 2 minutes.</p>

<p dir="auto">Yes. It may even be possible to use HVM offline for extended periods of several months at a time if you never update Tails or HiddenVM during such periods.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can't guarantee this, but limited testing by the team has confirmed it being possible for at least a month.</p>
<p dir="auto">As soon as you connect to the Internet, HiddenVM may upgrade its cached software and you may have to upgrade to the latest version from our GitHub as well as your Tails, but after all software is updated and verified as in sync by HiddenVM, it could be possible to use it offline for an extended period again.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id11">Known limitations</a></h3><a id="user-content-known-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Known limitations" href="#known-limitations"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Currently, during HiddenVM's launch process doing certain tasks in Tails can crash your live session. It's not a serious limitation e.g. using Tails' Tor Browser does not cause the crash. The issue is caused by our complicated process of installing VirtualBox in Tails which temporarily upgrades and then restores the original versions of dependencies used by certain GNOME apps. When HiddenVM finishes its launch you can resume all activity in Tails again. We hope we can remove this limitation in a future HiddenVM redesign.</li>
</ul>
<a name="user-content-extras-and-dotfiles-feature"></a>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="#id12">'Extras' and 'Dotfiles' feature</a></h3><a id="user-content-extras-and-dotfiles-feature" aria-label="Permalink: 'Extras' and 'Dotfiles' feature" href="#extras-and-dotfiles-feature"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">HiddenVM allows you to fully automate the customization of your Tails environment at every launch by performing system settings modifications or loading additional software including persistent config files for such software.</p>
<p dir="auto">Go to 'extras' folder in your HiddenVM and rename <code>extras-example.sh</code> to <code>extras.sh</code>. Any lines you add will be performed as bash script code at the end of each subsequent HiddenVM launch, right after it opens VirtualBox.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some examples:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get install autokey-gtk -y #Install a popular Linux universal hotkeys tool
</pre>
<pre>nohup autokey &amp; #Launch the Linux universal hotkeys tool that Extras just installed
</pre>
<pre>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-animations false #Turn off GNOME animations
</pre>
<p dir="auto">Eventually we will have a Wiki page with many Extras examples. Please contribute ideas. The installation and launching of a pre-VirtualBox VPN could be possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Warning: Make sure your commands work or it can cause HiddenVM to produce errors or not fully exit its Terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Dotfiles:</strong> Inside 'extras' is the 'dotfiles' folder. Place any files or folder structures in there and HiddenVM will recursively symlink them into your Tails session's Home folder at <code>/home/amnesia</code>. This is a very powerful feature. By putting a <em>.config</em> folder structure in there you can have all your additional software settings pre-loaded before they're installed via Extras.</p>
<a name="user-content-why-shouldn-t-i-use-tails-official-persistent-volume-feature"></a>

<p dir="auto">Tails' <a href="https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/additional_software/index.en.html#index1h2" rel="nofollow">Additional Software</a> feature disturbs HiddenVM's complicated <code>apt-get update</code> wizardry that achieves our VirtualBox-installing breakthrough.</p>
<p dir="auto">More importantly, our intention is for HVM's virtual machines to be truly 'hidden', i.e. forensically undetectable. This is the first time you can emulate VeraCrypt's Windows <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/VeraCrypt%20Hidden%20Operating%20System.html" rel="nofollow">Hidden OS</a> feature, but this time the plausible deniability hasn't been <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318155607_Defeating_Plausible_Deniability_of_VeraCrypt_Hidden_Operating_Systems" rel="nofollow">broken by security researchers</a> and it's for any OS you want.</p>
<p dir="auto">Due to using LUKS encryption, Tails' persistent volume feature currently offers no anti-forensics for the data in that area of your Tails stick, and is therefore not airport border inspection proof. If that ever changes, we would prefer to integrate HiddenVM more elegantly into Tails' existing infrastructure, and we appreciate the wonderful work the Tails devs do.</p>

<p dir="auto">Yes. To permanently add it, edit the <code>env</code> file in your HiddenVM folder and change the <code>INSTALL_EXT_PACK=</code> line from <code>"false"</code> to <code>"true"</code>. Then quit VirtualBox if it's open and execute the AppImage once more.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to run macOS in VirtualBox, you need to use the Extension Pack.</p>

<p dir="auto">No, and this is actually a bonus. By having normal full-speed Internet in any VM as the default, you can pretend it's a normal computer on your network but actually it's protected inside the anti-forensic environment of Tails.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can still Torify a VM by <a href="https://whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems" rel="nofollow">simply linking it to a Whonix-Gateway VM</a>. You can have the best of both worlds. But be careful, don't use a VM with clearnet Internet and then later with Torification, or vice versa, if anonymity is a concern.</p>

<p dir="auto">Due to HiddenVM's design, fortunately no. Because it connects to pre-Tor 'clearnet' Internet by default, Whonix-Gateway will connect independently of Tails' own Tor process, making both able to co-exist in the one environment.</p>

<p dir="auto">HiddenVM's clearnet Internet doesn't pass on DNS resolution by default. To get normal full Internet working in a non-Torified VM, manually set DNS servers in its system network settings to anything like Cloudflare's <code>1.1.1.1</code> and <code>1.0.0.1</code>. We might be able to fix this problem in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: This is not an issue for Whonix-Gateway which resolve hostnames via its own Tor process inside the VM. Whonix-Workstation then points to Gateway for its DNS, as will any other Gateway-Torified VMs.</p>

<p dir="auto">We do change a few security settings in the Tails Debian system in order to make HiddenVM do its thing. Apart from the fact that you can inspect our code, we'll add to our Wiki the list of exactly what HiddenVM temporarily modifies in your Tails environment from a security standpoint, so that you can know exactly what's going on.</p>
<p dir="auto">E.g. HiddenVM hooks into Tails' <a href="https://tails.boum.org/contribute/design/Unsafe_Browser/#index2h2" rel="nofollow">'clearnet' user</a> infrastructure, which some people are already concerned about existing in Tails.</p>
<p dir="auto">We also increase the <code>sudo</code> timeout to improve the user experience to only require password authentication one time. This is because HiddenVM can sometimes take a while to do its thing when initially installing or during weekly updates. This timeout is not normally extended in Tails' Debian environment and it may give elevated privileges to malware you could accidentally download in your main Tails environment.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the end, the thing that controls your safely more than anything else is what you do or download in Tails. We and the Tails project can only help you so much.</p>
<p dir="auto">As a result, we strongly suggest minimal usage of outer Tails Internet activity when using HVM. Tails' attack surface is already wide and HVM makes that a little wider. To do significant Tor Browser or other Internet-connected activity in Tails outside of HiddenVM, boot into a new Tails session and don't launch HiddenVM.</p>

<p dir="auto">No, HiddenVM is just an innovative and unexpected use of Tails that people didn't think was possible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our project actually pays a high compliment to Tails. We're promoting Tails as an entire platform and ecosystem for aforensic computing, which expands the vision of its benefits for the world. We trust and humbly rely on Tails, Tor, Debian and Linux as upstream projects and we feel an extreme sense of responsibility with what we're doing.</p>
<p dir="auto">We take user privacy, security, and anonymity very seriously and will implement updates to improve the default safety for HiddenVM users over time. For now, we invite you to inspect our code and offer suggestions and contributions that improve security without removing functionality or features.</p>
<p dir="auto">Furthermore, HiddenVM could attract new users to the Tails user base, which would increase its anonymity set, which is beneficial for the Tails community.</p>
<p dir="auto">Although we don't use Tails' Tor for our main Tor computing and we prefer HVM Whonix instead, we are still promoting and making use of Tails' Tor as a fundamental part of downloading and setting up HiddenVM. Due to Tails being amnesic and connecting to the Tor network by default, it's an incredibly safe environment to set up a computer using HiddenVM, and we are promoting this.</p>
<p dir="auto">As such, we are normal Tails users and advocates ourselves.</p>

<p dir="auto">Your data is not 'private' or 'hidden' during your use of your computer with your VeraCrypt volume unlocked. The privacy only applies to when your computer is turned off, or turned on but with the private data in your VeraCrypt volume not unlocked after turning it on.</p>
<p dir="auto">'Deniability' is very complex. There are many threat models and situations. There is no one-size-fits-all method of effective deniability. How 'normal' or 'plausible' your computer or data must convincingly appear to be, when turned off or forced to be turned on, entirely depends on your circumstances and who your 'enemy' is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our claim of effective deniability is a very broad one and might not apply to your particular scenario. We might not be able to cater to your scenario but we are very interested in studying it and our Wiki could become a place to document various scenarios and solutions for deniability in the context of HiddenVM.</p>

			<p>After playing/working with computers for more then 25 years I started to appreciate small but handy valuable stuff – like adapters or handlers or … yeah – all kind of stuff. With many of them I did not even knew they existed until I find out about them – mostly accidentally or after long searching for some problem solution. Today I will share them with You – so maybe they will end up handy also for You.</p>
<p>… and while they make my life easier – they are mostly very cheap too.</p>

<h2>RJ45 Angle Adapters</h2>
<p>I mostly use laptops to do various tasks and cables sticking out on the sides perpendicularly does not help. Not many laptops today have the RJ45 LAN socket – but if they do – they are mostly on the side of the laptop.</p>

<p>Thanks to such angle RJ45 adapters it is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> page – with the <b>RJ45 ANGLE ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>RJ45 Angle Cable Adapters</h2>
<p>The mentioned earlier <i>RJ45 Angle Adapters</i> are quite bulky – but as an alternative its possible to get a short 40cm cable with smaller plug.</p>
<p>Not sure if its noticeable on the picture below – but I also cut the top ‘cover’ with knife of the plug – so its easier to detach.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6247" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/rj45-angle-cable-1/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg" data-orig-size="740,570" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rj45-angle-cable-1" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg?w=740" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg?w=625&amp;h=481 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=116 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=231 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-1.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>There are of course all four angles to choose from.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6248" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/rj45-angle-cable-4/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg" data-orig-size="740,650" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rj45-angle-cable-4" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg?w=740" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg?w=625&amp;h=549 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=132 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=264 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-4.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>One may also use the end of that 40cm cable-adapter as a ‘stopper’ to not fall inside the desk hole as shown on the image below.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6249" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/rj45-angle-cable-3/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg" data-orig-size="740,1190" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rj45-angle-cable-3" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg?w=187" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg?w=637" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg?w=625&amp;h=1005 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg?w=93&amp;h=150 93w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg?w=187&amp;h=300 187w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-angle-cable-3.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>RJ45 ANGLE ADAPTER CABLE</b> keywords in their search.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>RJ45 Join Adapters</h2>
<p>Often I found myself in a situation that the currently available LAN cable was too short to reach and it needed a lot of work to plot another – longer one.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6250" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/rj45-concatenate-adapter/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg" data-orig-size="740,830" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="rj45-concatenate-adapter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg?w=267" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg?w=625&amp;h=701 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg?w=134&amp;h=150 134w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg?w=267&amp;h=300 267w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/rj45-concatenate-adapter.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>With these simple ‘join’ adapters it is no longer a problem. You would not use them in a serious Data Center with 10+ GE speeds – but for home 1.0-2.5 GE speeds its more then enough.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$1-$2</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>RJ45 JOIN ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>SATA to USB-C or USB-A Adapters</h2>
<p>Multiple times I needed to clone some old disk to new SSD – just to make an old system faster.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6251" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg" data-orig-size="740,540" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="SATA-USB-C-USB-A-adapters" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg?w=625&amp;h=456 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg?w=300&amp;h=219 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/sata-usb-c-usb-a-adapters.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I usually boot from some USB drive with FreeBSD and while new SSD is attached with these adapters – I then execute <tt><b>dd(8)</b></tt> command to clone the old HDD disk to new SSD drive … and then just swap them out.</p>
<p>You can find them for about <b>$1-$5</b> – for example – on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> – with the <b>SATA USB ADAPTER</b> keywords in their search.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>Angle USB-C and USB-A Adapters</h2>
<p>As we already talked about RJ45 angle adapters … there are also USB-C and USB-A angle adapters.</p>

<h2>Tiny USB WiFi or Bluetooth Dongle</h2>
<p>Multiple times I have found myself in a situation where it was very convenient to just add some WiFi or Bluetooth chip over USB port and do the job instead of trying to achieve the same without such chips.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6257" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg" data-orig-size="740,470" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg?w=625&amp;h=397 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg?w=150&amp;h=95 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg?w=300&amp;h=191 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/wifi-bluetooth-tiny-chip.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>While I usually omit Bluetooth I can not say the same about WiFi … and as FreeBSD lacks a little in that department – using a very tiny chip such as <a href="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2020/10/30/realtek-usb-wifi-review/">Realtek RTL8188CUS</a> often does the job done.</p>

<h2>USB-C &lt;=&gt; Micro USB Adapter</h2>
<p>In the past – in the USB Micro times – I remember using an adapter to be able to charge – then new and uncommon – USB-C devices.</p>
<p>Fast forward several years and now the situation is the other way around (as expected). The USB-C is the standard and USB Micro devices are less and less common … but there are still here. To not have to keep separate dedicated USB Micro cables I use a small USB-C to USB Micro adapters.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6258" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg" data-orig-size="740,360" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="USB-C-USB-micro-adapter" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg?w=625&amp;h=304 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg?w=150&amp;h=73 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg?w=300&amp;h=146 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/usb-c-usb-micro-adapter.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>

<h2>USB-C &lt;=&gt; Laptops/Routers/5.5mmx2.5mm Adapters</h2>
<p>When it comes to delivering power to my (and not only) laptops – the new standard seems to be the USB-C connector with ‘requirement’ of 45W or more (it depends).</p>
<p>Not that long ago I discovered that even laptops as old as 13 years – <strong>ThinkPad X220/T420s/W520</strong> – can be powered the same – but with simple and very cheap adapter cables – such as these below. From the left there is <strong>5.5mm/2.5mm</strong> typical router socket – then more modern <strong>ThinkPad X270/T470s</strong> (and many more) – then oldschool models from 2011 year – <strong>ThinkPads</strong> such as <strong>X220/T420s/W520</strong> models.</p>

<p>You need to only meet two requirements – the USB charger that will make enough power for example 20V at 3.25A for 65W that would power <strong>ThinkPad X220/T420s</strong> or 20V at 6.75A for 135W that would power <strong>ThinkPad W520</strong>. While the official power supply for ThinkPad W520 is 170W – its perfectly fine to use the 135W power adapter from <strong>ThinkPad W510</strong> to power <strong>ThinkPad W520</strong> laptop.</p>
<p>This makes organizing cables (and chargers) a lot easier – for example – I would not be able to fit 3 ‘dedicated’ ThinkPad chargers in that white cable organizer behind laptops – but I will fir there two powerful 65W and 85W USB-C chargers perfectly fine.</p>

<h2>Creative BT-W2 USB-A Bluetooth Adapter</h2>
<p>When I have to cope with Bluetooth technology – its ‘tolerable’ on Android devices such as phones/tablets and mostly nowhere else. After bad audio (just not working) Bluetooth possibilities on FreeBSD I decided to try the hardware solution instead. The audio related Bluetooth on FreeBSD have failed me too many times – to the point called <i>enough is enough</i> – that also means I do not want to waste any more time trying to figure the way using FreeBSD Bluetooth stack devices anymore – at least for audio related devices.</p>
<p>Not so long ago I got the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones. I am/was a big fan of the <i>Technics RP-F290</i> cable headphones (Jack or Mini Jack based). They have so much BASS and ‘power’ that I could not ask for more … and their cost is very low – like <b>$24</b> or less. The only ‘downside’ of the <i>Technics RP-F290</i> headphones is that they are audio only – they do not have any microphone at all – they are dedicated for music only – and that is OK – they do GREAT in that role.</p>
<p>I have tried some Bluetooth based headphones in the past – and they were SHIT to say the least. Not enough ‘power’ – not enough BASS etc. After reading multiple reviews I decided to give <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones a chance … and I was not disappointed. Its the first time after <i>Technics RP-F290</i> cable headphones that ANY Bluetooth based headphone delivered. I was (and I still am) really satisfied with them.</p>
<p>This is where the USB powered <i>Creative BT-W2</i> comes handy. Its also relatively cheap as the cost of used unit is less then <b>$20</b> – at least that is the price I payed for mine in Poland. The <i>Creative BT-W2</i> allows to connect Bluetooth audio devices everywhere – even on OpenBSD – on the system that cut off Bluetooth stack entirely – and it works well on FreeBSD too. The ‘downside’ of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones is that they do have microphone – but only in Bluetooth node – they have Mini Jack connector – but for audio only …</p>

<p>This is also only downside of the <i>Creative BT-W2</i> solution – it transmits only audio – but w/o microphone. Its more then OK for listening music – but if You have to do live conferencing/meetings on FreeBSD as I do – its a dead end.</p>
<p>I have tried to find a solution to this problem – to the point that I wanted to abandon <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones entirely and find some Mini Jack (or Jack) based BASS oriented headphones that will also have a working microphone.</p>
<p>On my journey I have found a solution that I did not expected at all – and that was the solution that solved all my problems – and allowed me to enjoy the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones – but more about that in the next ‘subsection’.</p>

<h2>External Microphone for SONY Headphones</h2>
<p>You already know the downsides of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones that were giving me headaches. Now its time to address them.</p>
<p>After many hours of searching the Internet I have found a very ‘usable’ Mini Jack cable. A cable that came with microphone and a one that perfectly integrated with <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones … and FreeBSD as well.</p>
<p>Its available to buy for <b>$22</b> on <a>amazon.de</a> (and possible other locations) and its called <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b>. Thanks to the knowledge that <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones have Mini Jack port with microphone part – the <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> cable even comes with volume controls and even come with physical kill switch for microphone.</p>

<p>After You attach this <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> to the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones it looks (and works) like a natural solution.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6266" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/boom-microphone-cable-2/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg" data-orig-size="740,580" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="boom-microphone-cable-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg?w=625&amp;h=490 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/boom-microphone-cable-2.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>The only ‘downside’ is generally the downside of the <b>Sony WH1000XM4</b> headphones – that You CAN NOT disable their silencing while you speak – so using them in ‘passive’ mode with <b>Boom Microphone Cable</b> is preferred to meet all needs.</p>

<h2>Headphones Handle</h2>
<p>I got used to the fact that I just put my headphones on the desk … but I wanted something more useful – after some searching it was obvious to me that I needed just some headphones handle that I could attach somewhere.</p>
<p>After another several hours of browsing I have found a ‘part’ that would fit perfectly – a <b>$4-5</b> part from <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> that I could find with the <b>HEADPHONES HOLDER</b> keywords in their search.</p>

<h2>Tiny USB-A Hub</h2>
<p>When You need to connect several USB-A devices the USB ports count often come short fast – this is where this tiny USB-A hub comes handy.</p>

<p>With its dirt cheap <b>$1-2</b> price (at <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> with <b>USB HUB</b> keywords) its a ‘steal’ … and it is a 3 port hub – there is another USB-A port at the end of it – the one that is not visible.</p>

<p>I do not even remember how many times I have used it to copy/backup contents of my phone(s) and/or tablet(s).</p>
<p>Nowadays I believe I use the <b>Dual USB-C / USB-A Pendrive</b> more … but not always.</p>
<p>For <b>$8-9</b> on its not a bad solution to have.</p>

<h2>Angle Power Adapters</h2>
<p>I have often found that the angle with which the power cord sticks out of a PC is definitely not ideal – this is where angle power adapters come handy.</p>

<h2>C13/C14 Power Adapters with Additional C1/C2 or C5/C6 Sockets</h2>
<p>After You have spent some time to lay down the C13/C14 power cables just to power your PC its really annoying to do the same for another set of C1/C2 or C5/C6 cables/sockets … but not anymore.</p>
<p>Now with single cable adapter You are able to power more then one computer – depending on the needs with additional connectors.</p>

<h2>HDMI 3in1 Switch with Remote Control</h2>
<p>I happen to have a 2010 FullHD 50 Inch TV that has ONLY ONE port of HDMI kind … and it was pretty annoying to say the least … up to the time I added a HDMI switch/hub to it.</p>

<p>For the record – I have used the <b>UGreen 3in1 HDMI Switch with 4K @ 30Hz Capability and Remote</b> and I was able to get one for <b>$16</b>.</p>

<h2>Cable Organizers</h2>
<p>To not have a mess in the cables its useful to have them organized in some way.</p>
<p>I use multiple solutions for that.</p>
<p>Lets start with simple organizers.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6280" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizer-cables/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg" data-orig-size="740,530" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizer-cables" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=625&amp;h=448 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=150&amp;h=107 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg?w=300&amp;h=215 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>… and a larger/taller one for more capacity/possibilities.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6281" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizer-cables-larger/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg" data-orig-size="740,430" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizer-cables-larger" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=625&amp;h=363 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=150&amp;h=87 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg?w=300&amp;h=174 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizer-cables-larger.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>They are available for <b>$3-9</b> on <a href="https://aliexpress.com/">https://aliexpress.com</a> with <b>CABLE ORGANIZER</b> keywords on the search box.</p>
<p>I also use some IKEA containers …</p>

<p>… and smaller boxes in which I keep the tiny things.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6283" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/organizers-boxes/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg" data-orig-size="740,510" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="organizers-boxes" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=625&amp;h=431 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=207 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/organizers-boxes.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I do not even remember after what product these boxes are … and that does not even matter I think.</p>

<h2>Mouse Jigger</h2>
<p>While there are many software settings or solutions to prevent screen from locking up – there is one bulletproof solution what just always works – a hardware USB mouse jigger.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="6284" data-permalink="https://vermaden.wordpress.com/2024/03/21/tiny-undervalued-hardware-companions/mouse-jigler/" data-orig-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg" data-orig-size="740,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="mouse-jigler" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=740" loading="lazy" src="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=960" alt="" srcset="https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=625&amp;h=422 625w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg?w=300&amp;h=203 300w, https://vermaden.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/mouse-jigler.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></p>
<p>I use a very simple one with 3 modes – but its more then enough for me needs.</p>

<h2>FM Transmitter</h2>
<p>Last but not least – the car FM transmitter.</p>
<p>My daily ‘real’ driver (I mean on the real road outside) is the <b>2006 Dodge Magnum</b> car. I really love it for the simplicity and calm that it provides during the ride – but on the audio side it only has an old FM/AM radio and a CD slot … and not MP3 support in that one.</p>
<p>This is where the FM transmitter such as mine <b>Blow</b> comes really handy.</p>

<p>It supports two modes. One is being a Bluetooth slave of your phone – it just plays on the car speakers anything you are currently playing on your phone – it also has microphone builtin – so You can also use it as a ‘loud’ phone talking device.</p>

<p>I use it in a more simple mode – I just attach a tiny <b>Lexar S47 32GB</b> pendrive to it – and play a random song of it.</p>
<p>Besides these features it also has additional USB-A port available to attach a cable to it and charge some device.</p>
<p>I was able to get one a new one for about <b>$19</b>.</p>
<p>~</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The mentioned devices above are probably not the only ones that make my life easier – but definitely the most crucial ones.</p>
<p>Feel free to share your ‘helper’ hardware in the comments.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Documentation</strong>: <a href="https://ludic.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow">https://ludic.readthedocs.io/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Ludic is a lightweight framework for building HTML pages with component approach similar to <a href="https://react.dev/" rel="nofollow">React</a>. It is built to be used together with <a href="https://htmx.org/" rel="nofollow">htmx.org</a> so that developers don't need to write almost any JavaScript to create dynamic web services. It's potential can be leveraged together with its web framework which is a wrapper around powerful <a href="https://www.starlette.io/" rel="nofollow">Starlette</a> framework. It is built with the latest Python 3.12 features heavily incorporating typing.</p>

<p>Vernor Vinge, author of many influential hard science fiction works, died March 20 at the age of 79.</p>



<p>Vinge sold his first science-fiction story in 1964, “Apartness”, which appeared in the June 1965 issue of <em>New Worlds</em>.</p>



<p>In 1971, he received a PhD (Math) from UCSD, and the next year began teaching at San Diego State University. It wasn’t until almost thirty years later, in August 2000, that he retired from teaching to write science-fiction full time.</p>



<p>His 1981 novella&nbsp;<em>True Names</em> is often credited as the first story to present a fully fleshed-out concept of&nbsp;cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He won Hugo Awards&nbsp;for his novels&nbsp;<em>A Fire Upon the Deep</em>&nbsp;(1993 — tie),&nbsp;<em>A&nbsp;Deepness in the Sky</em>&nbsp;(2000),&nbsp;<em>Rainbows End</em>&nbsp;(2007), and novellas&nbsp;<em>Fast Times at Fairmont High</em>&nbsp;(2002), and&nbsp;<em>The Cookie Monster</em>&nbsp;(2004). <em>A Deepness in the Sky </em>also won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and in translation won Spain’s Ignotus Award, Germany’s Kurd Lasswitz Preis, and Italy’s Italia Award.</p>



<p>Vinge was the guest of honor at ConJosé, the 2002 Worldcon. He won the Prometheus Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2014. He won the Heinlein Award presented by The Heinlein Society in 2020.</p>



<p>He was married to Joan D. Vinge from 1972 to 1979.</p>



<p>David Brin has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AUTHORDAVIDBRIN/posts/804165974862720">posted a heartfelt tribute</a> on Facebook which says in part:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with sadness – and deep appreciation of my friend and colleague – that I must report the passing of Vernor Vinge. A titan in the literary genre that explores a limitless range of potential destinies, Vernor enthralled millions with tales of plausible tomorrows, made all the more vivid by his polymath masteries of language, drama, characters and the implications of science.</p>



<p>Accused by some of a grievous sin – that of ‘optimism’ – Vernor gave us peerless legends that often depicted human success at overcoming problems… those right in front of us… while posing new ones! New dilemmas that may lie just ahead of our myopic gaze. He would often ask: “What if we succeed? Do you think that will be the end of it?”…</p>



<p>…We spanned a pretty wide spectrum – politically! Yet, we KBs [Killer B’s] (Vernor was a full member! And Octavia Butler once guffawed happily when we inducted her) always shared a deep love of our high art – that of gedankenexperimentation, extrapolation into the undiscovered country ahead.</p>
