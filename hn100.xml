              <p>We have successfully created an independent, bit-by-bit-identical rebuild of the <code>nixos-minimal</code> ISO published by Hydra <img src="https://discourse.nixos.org/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=12" title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<h2>
<a name="why-is-this-useful-1" href="#why-is-this-useful-1"></a>Why is this useful?</h2>
<p>While there are a number of ‘side-benefits’, the main point of Reproducible Builds is that it gives us a reliable way to verify the binaries we ship are faithful to their sources, and have not been tampered with anywhere in the build pipeline (e.g. on Hydra).</p>
<p>For general information on Reproducible Builds see:</p>


<h2>
<a name="what-exactly-was-reproduced-2" href="#what-exactly-was-reproduced-2"></a>What exactly was reproduced?</h2>
<p>This means we now have successfully reproduced:</p>
<ul>
<li>All packages that make it into the ISO</li>
<li>The building of the ISO itself</li>
</ul>
<p>The rebuild also built the packages that were needed to build the ISO (but aren’t included in it), rather than relying on cached binaries.</p>
<h2>
<a name="how-did-we-reproduce-3" href="#how-did-we-reproduce-3"></a>How did we reproduce?</h2>
<p>We reproduced <a href="https://hydra.nixos.org/build/239408385">this Hydra build</a> by starting a fresh VirtualBox appliance with <a href="https://releases.nixos.org/nixos/20.03/nixos-20.03.1405.a17e021b948/nixos-20.03.1405.a17e021b948-x86_64-linux.ova">NixOS 20.03</a> (adding plenty of CPU and memory, and resizing the disk to about 65G), and then:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--option substitute false</code> makes sure ‘everything’ is built on the machine itself, instead of fetching them from the binary cache.</p>
<h3>
<a name="arent-there-bootstrap-problems-with-the-above-approach-4" href="#arent-there-bootstrap-problems-with-the-above-approach-4"></a>Aren’t there bootstrap problems with the above approach?</h3>
<p>Well, yes: if the 2020 <code>ova</code> or the downloaded <code>git</code> contained elaborate backdoors, those might still be attack vectors. It would have been better to do the rebuild on a fully-<a href="https://bootstrappable.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">bootstrapped</a> system, but we’re not quite <em>there</em> yet - see <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-supply-chain-security-project/34345">this thread</a> for exciting progress in this area. Still, this test gives a high confidence in the reproducibility of the ISO.</p>
<h2>
<a name="werent-we-here-before-5" href="#werent-we-here-before-5"></a>Weren’t we here before?</h2>
<p>You may remember <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixos-unstable-s-iso-minimal-x86-64-linux-is-100-reproducible/13723">2021 announcement</a> that the minimal ISO was 100% reproducible. While back then we successfully tested that all packages were needed to build the ISO were <em>individually</em> reproducible, <em>actually</em> rebuilding the ISO still introduced differences. This was due to <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/125380">some remaining problems</a> in the hydra cache and the way the ISO was created. By the time we fixed those, regressions had popped up (notably an upstream problem in Python 3.10), and it isn’t until this week that we were back to having everything reproducible and being able to validate the complete chain.</p>
<h2>
<a name="where-to-from-now-6" href="#where-to-from-now-6"></a>Where to from now?</h2>
<p>Successfully rebuilding the minimal ISO once is an extremely satisfying milestone - but a somewhat arbitrary one. There is a lot more to do to reap the benefits of reproducibility, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove the hacks above (<a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263730">nixpkgs#263730</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/9251">nix#9251</a>, <a href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/263898">nixpkgs#263898</a>)</li>
<li>Making more packages reproducible. Reproducing the <a href="https://nixos.org/download#download-nixos">other installation media</a> such as the Gnome ISO seem like nice next milestones</li>
<li>Setting up infrastructure so that we can regularly independently rebuild these artifacts</li>
<li>Create tools to share and consume build attestations, such as <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/trustix">trustix</a>
</li>
<li>… what would <em>you</em> like to see? Tell us in this thread!</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A mental model for service businesses.</p><div>
<p>A few years back, my team decided to get a custom meeting room table. In our search for something great, we were referred to a small studio that does great work: East Vancouver’s <a href="https://www.unionwoodco.com/">Union Wood Co</a>.</p>

<p>The team there met with us, showed us various samples, and asked thoughtful questions about what we needed.  When I asked if a table could be made to a custom shape – a superelliptical rectangle – they were all for it <em>and</em> totally <a href="https://twitter.com/steamclocksw/status/1202383942248095744">pulled it off</a>.</p>

<p>Afterward, sitting at this delightful table, I reflected on why it came together so well. Getting something custom-built can often be the path of frustration and expensive surprises, yet our experience was a delight. Was it because the furniture makers were experts? No. Was it because they charged a lot of money? No.</p>

<p>It was because they gave a shit.</p>

<p>In some ways, that’s the fundamental value proposition of a small boutique, whether it be a furniture shop or a software studio. Giving a shit as a service. Sure, you can always get a commodity good from off the shelf – when you’re selling soybean oil by the 100-ton lot, nobody wants to have a conversation with you about the subtle flavour profiles of different bean oils. But sometimes, you want to buy from someone that’s obsessed about the final product.</p>

<p>I used to puzzle over why potential clients who reached out to me always seemed to get <em>more</em> interested in hiring us if I tried to dissuade them by asking challenging questions. I think the biggest reason is that pushing back demonstrated that I care. If you email 4 software studios for a quote and 3 say “Sure, here’s a quote” but the 4th says “Hm, we certainly could build it but we can’t be sure about cost without knowing X and Y, and here are some other concerns we’d have” then the 4th is going to seem like they give a shit.</p>

<p>So, I suppose the moral of the story is: find yourself work you can give a shit about. And work with people who give a shit. It’ll make shit a lot more pleasant – I guarantee it.</p>

So we need a way to store a buffer at a location in memory which we know the address </span><span>of</span><span>.<br></span></p><h3>Introducing DNS over TCP</h3><div><p>This doesn't seem to be part of NicheStack, but the Wii U features support for DNS over TCP instead of UDP. After two attempts of using UDP, the Wii U will switch to TCP if the truncated flag was set in the DNS header. For TCP support more fields were added to the <span>dns_querys</span><span> struct, one of them is a pointer to a buffer in which the received TCP data is stored.</span></p><p><span>So just overwrite this with an address in the stack and we can receive data into the stack? Unfortunately, no. Before storing data into this buffer it is resized using </span><span>IOS_HeapRealloc</span><span> (basically </span><span>realloc</span><span>), if it isn't </span><span>NULL</span><span>. If the heap block is already the same size as the reallocated size, the same pointer is returned though. This allows us to take over already allocated blocks inside of the heap but limits us to stay in bounds of the heap. If we point the receive buffer to one of the already allocated packet buffers at the start of the heap, which will always have the same address, we can receive data into a known memory location (limited by the MTU and TCP/IP fragmentation).<br></span></p><p><span>Remember the reply struct which is pointed to by the </span><span>dns_querys</span><span> struct?

<p>Recently a shoe store in France ran a promotion called “Rob It to Get It”, which invited customers to try to steal something by grabbing it and running out of the store. But there was a catch — the “security guard” was a professional sprinter, Méba Mickael Zeze. As you would expect, he is fast, but you might not appreciate how much faster he is than an average runner, or even a good runner.</p>



<p>Why? That’s the topic of Chapter 4 of <em><a href="https://greenteapress.com/wp/probably-overthinking-it/">Probably Overthinking It</a></em>, which is <a href="https://amzn.to/3Kp629E">available for preorder now</a>. Here’s an excerpt.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Running Speeds</h2>



<p>If you are a fan of the Atlanta Braves, a Major League Baseball team, or if you watch enough videos on the internet, you have probably seen one of the most popular forms of between-inning entertainment: a foot race between one of the fans and a spandex-suit-wearing mascot called the Freeze.</p>



<p>The route of the race is the dirt track that runs across the outfield, a distance of about 160 meters, which the Freeze runs in less than 20 seconds. To keep things interesting, the fan gets a head start of about 5 seconds. That might not seem like a lot, but if you watch one of these races, this lead seems insurmountable. However, when the Freeze starts running, you immediately see the difference between a pretty good runner and a very good runner. With few exceptions, the Freeze runs down the fan, overtakes them, and coasts to the finish line with seconds to spare.</p>



<p>Here are some examples:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxXypNqiS5A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span>
</p></figure>



<p>But as fast as he is, the Freeze is not even a professional runner; he is a member of the Braves’ ground crew named Nigel Talton. In college, he ran 200 meters in 21.66 seconds, which is very good. But the 200 meter collegiate record is 20.1 seconds, set by Wallace Spearmon in 2005, and the current world record is 19.19 seconds, set by Usain Bolt in 2009.</p>



<p>To put all that in perspective, let’s start with me. For a middle-aged man, I am a decent runner. When I was 42 years old, I ran my best-ever 10 kilometer race in 42:44, which was faster than 94% of the other runners who showed up for a local 10K. Around that time, I could run 200 meters in about 30 seconds (with wind assistance).</p>



<p>But a good high school runner is faster than me. At a recent meet, the fastest girl at a nearby high school ran 200 meters in about 27 seconds, and the fastest boy ran under 24 seconds.</p>



<p>So, in terms of speed, a fast high school girl is 11% faster than me, a fast high school boy is 12% faster than her; Nigel Talton, in his prime, was 11% faster than him, Wallace Spearmon was about 8% faster than Talton, and Usain Bolt is about 5% faster than Spearmon.</p>



<p>Unless you are Usain Bolt, there is always someone faster than you, and not just a little bit faster; they are much faster. The reason is that the distribution of running speed is not Gaussian — It is more like lognormal.</p>



<p>To demonstrate, I’ll use data from the James Joyce Ramble, which is the 10 kilometer race where I ran my previously-mentioned personal record time. I downloaded the times for the 1,592 finishers and converted them to speeds in kilometers per hour. The following figure shows the distribution of these speeds on a logarithmic scale, along with a Gaussian model I fit to the data.</p>

<p>The logarithms follow a Gaussian distribution, which means the speeds themselves are lognormal. You might wonder why. Well, I have a theory, based on the following assumptions:</p>



<ul>
<li>First, everyone has a maximum speed they are capable of running, assuming that they train effectively.</li>



<li>Second, these speed limits can depend on many factors, including height and weight, fast- and slow-twitch muscle mass, cardiovascular conditioning, flexibility and elasticity, and probably more.</li>



<li>Finally, the way these factors interact tends to be multiplicative; that is, each person’s speed limit depends on the product of multiple factors.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s why I think speed depends on a product rather than a sum of factors. If all of your factors are good, you are fast; if any of them are bad, you are slow. Mathematically, the operation that has this property is multiplication.</p>



<p>For example, suppose there are only two factors, measured on a scale from 0 to 1, and each person’s speed limit is determined by their product. Let’s consider three hypothetical people:</p>



<ul>
<li>The first person scores high on both factors, let’s say 0.9. The product of these factors is 0.81, so they would be fast.</li>



<li>The second person scores relatively low on both factors, let’s say 0.3. The product is 0.09, so they would be quite slow.</li>
</ul>



<p>So far, this is not surprising: if you are good in every way, you are fast; if you are bad in every way, you are slow. But what if you are good in some ways and bad in others?</p>



<ul>
<li>The third person scores 0.9 on one factor and 0.3 on the other. The product is 0.27, so they are a little bit faster than someone who scores low on both factors, but much slower than someone who scores high on both.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a property of multiplication: the product depends most strongly on the smallest factor. And as the number of factors increases, the effect becomes more dramatic.</p>



<p>To simulate this mechanism, I generated five random factors from a Gaussian distribution and multiplied them together. I adjusted the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussians so that the resulting distribution fit the data; the following figure shows the results.</p>



<figure><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" width="960" height="720" src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png 960w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-300x225.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-768x576.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-360x270.png 360w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png 960w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-300x225.png 300w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-768x576.png 768w, https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2-360x270.png 360w" data-lazy-src="https://www.allendowney.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/running2.png?is-pending-load=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>



<p>The simulation results fit the data well. So this example demonstrates a second mechanism [the first is described earlier in the chapter] that can produce lognormal distributions: the limiting power of the weakest link. If there are at least five factors affect running speed, and each person’s limit depends on their worst factor, that would explain why the distribution of running speed is lognormal.</p>



<p>And that’s why you can’t beat the Freeze.</p>

He recently split from a long-term partner and even what he describes as a sense of forboding, “that I’m fated to end up alone”, was not enough to drive him back to dating apps.

I think I need to wear it more in situations where I’ll be meeting new people before I can make a judgment as to how effective this technique is – and wait for the idea to become more widely known as well.”</p><p>Putting a new spin on an old-fashioned approach also appeals to Katy, a 37-year-old who lives in London, works for a charity, and says the apps had made her forget how to flirt. “So I’ve given myself the challenge of flirting with one person every day, which has been a lot of fun,” she says. “It’s made me realise that so many people are wrapped up in their phones, and aren’t aware of people around them, which is quite sad. I’ve had some fun interactions, and while it hasn’t brought me any dates – yet – that’s not the goal. I’m in absolutely no hurry to bring dating apps back into my life.”</p><p>Many say the apps feel like work and there is a genuine sense of burnout as people struggle to commit to what is essentially hours of admin a week alongside their day jobs and other responsibilities. And even those who have their pick of matches have found themselves having an unenjoyable experience.</p><p>“I was getting a torrent of likes – and I absolutely hated it,” says Sophie, 33, a London-based writer who used Hinge for more than a year before ditching it. “I’d try not to be too picky based on superficial qualities because I’m simply looking for an interesting or creative person, and that’s one thing you can’t spot easily on an app, but then I’d get too many matches, which was really overwhelming. I’d end up ghosting them all, which I felt really guilty about.”</p><figure id="a0bc039f-c470-4851-a10c-f2733307ace6" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="An illustration of hearts" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba0c1dc9197438b83ab5577ba54ed72397ed8f1/78_58_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><p>She has tried Tinder (“even worse”) and at one point attempted to join <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raya/id957215308" data-link-name="in body link">Raya</a>, which markets itself as a “private community” of “exciting people”, though it is better known as the celebrity dating app. It is where Lily Allen met her husband, the Stranger Things actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/jul/03/david-harbour-marvel-black-widow-stranger-things-jim-hopper" data-link-name="in body link">David Harbour</a>. Ben Affleck and Matthew Perry have also been Raya users.</p><p>“I tried to join that app because I wanted something more exclusive, but it was too exclusive to let me in,” she laughs. “After that I just gave up. I’d been clinging for so long to stories of friends who met their significant others on an app and I just had to let it go.”</p><p>After a “very humbling year” expecting to meet someone organically, she is now taking a bolder approach. “I started asking friends and acquaintances if there’s anyone they can set me up with.</p><p>When being single comes up in conversation, you naturally want to say, ‘It’s cool, I’m enjoying my independence, I’m sure I’ll meet someone soon,’ and it can be excruciating to say, ‘Actually I’m really unhappy and I’m desperately trying to meet someone’ – but I’ve learned that’s kind of the best thing to do.</p><p>“You really have to set some standards – people can be so keen to help that they tend to overestimate how good-looking or interesting their mates are, or they try to suggest the only single person they know, no matter how unsuitable – but it has worked quite well. It’s so easy to get an idea of whether you’ll click. I’ve had dates with two people through mutual friends so far, both musicians weirdly, and one of them has some potential.”</p><p>In a similar way, family might fill that role for Jeevan, a 30-year-old IT worker, who says his Indian parents had offered to set him up when he was younger. He had always declined, but is now reconsidering. “It’s not something I wanted to do before, but now I’m finding time has caught up with me a bit and I’m in a position where I do want to meet a partner. I think I’m going to keep trying for a couple more years, and if that doesn’t work, I will ask them.”</p><p>The benefit of meeting someone vouched for is also driving Clare, 38, from Bath, to explore her options, after having signed up to numerous dating apps over the years, only to quit after a few months each time. She always felt uneasy about meeting a person who is completely unknown, beyond a first name and age, which are not always genuine. She says: “It’s a bad platform for people with trust issues like myself as I don’t like meeting total strangers. You are meeting outside of any community accountability – so people are also generally a bit shitter in their ethics.</p><p>“There’s also the issue of selection,” she adds. “I connect with people strongly in real life I’d never have selected on a dating app. Either they would be too young, too hot, or unattractive on an app. People are so much more magic in real life.”</p><figure id="1b48a1c7-ecf8-434e-84ba-f14cff32a687" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="A man and a woman looking at each other enthusiastically" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8ac0b37ca1aa650b2a299e120ed51d7429f968d/0_0_949_885/master/949.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="414.98946259220236" loading="lazy"></picture></div></figure><p>She has done slow dating at Shambala festival, with an emphasis on doing exercises that could help to make emotional connections, including questions like, “What are you most proud of in your life?” and “What’s the biggest challenge you’ve overcome?”</p><p>However, her favourite thing was a workshop called The Art of Flirting: “Essentially a workshop full of (mostly) single people having their confidence built up collectively through playful exercises with a fair amount of emotional risk. For example, we had to walk in our most confident, flirtatious manner towards people and note how we felt about it. The big takeaway was how essential risk, self-confidence and not taking it too seriously were – maybe more like dating skills.”</p><p>She is keen to try more. “My friend mentioned events she went to in London that involved bringing your single friend to take the pressure off.” These events, such as Conscious Dating’s <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/conscious-dating-bring-a-friend-movie-meal-drinks-chat-social-mixer-tickets-704699584427" data-link-name="in body link">Bring-a-Friend nights</a>, usually involve bringing another single person of a different gender to ensure the room has an even split, but there are lots of variations.</p><p>Clare is not alone – the demand for more face-to-face interactions is increasing. Figures from Eventbrite shared with the Guardian show the number of dating or singles events in the UK has doubled since before the start of the pandemic. The event management company attributes this rise to both people wanting more physical connection after lockdown and the growing fatigue with dating apps.</p><p>Some events now focus on precise groups, such as black lesbians or divorced Muslim professionals, while others offer a twist, including speed-dating events that revolve around being naked, playing Jenga while drunk, playing video games or bringing your dogs.</p><p>Some people prefer something more simple, with fewer expectations. Stef began using the app Meetup, normally used to meet people in a friendly setting usually around a passion or interest, when she first moved to Paris. She has been hit on a few times at meet-ups, “which has been so nice honestly”.</p><p>“You have the opportunity to meet heaps of other cute, single people in real life with no stuffy or awkward first-date vibes because if you don’t click with someone, you can just excuse yourself and chat with someone else,” she says. “I sometimes think they must be what 1970s mixers were like. Just lots of fun chats with new people and wine – perfect. I haven’t met the love of my life yet, but I feel like I’m very close.”</p><hr><p><span>B</span>ut, for a lot of single people, the problems with the apps run deeper than being time-consuming and fruitless. Political journalist and writer Lucy Webster describes how she faced harassment and unpleasant comments about her disability when using dating apps.</p><p>“I’d get a lot of comments about being a wheelchair user, most of which were of the ‘Can you have sex?’ variety. I would just block them instantly, because what’s the point?” says Webster.</p><p>She describes how the superficiality of apps encourages ableism, because there are no consequences to unkind or abusive behaviour. “They’re not doing it in public and they’re not going to get banned for saying they don’t want to date a wheelchair user. It just encourages this awful, unacceptable behaviour,” she says. “Eventually I just thought, ‘What the hell am I doing?’”</p><figure id="40bab240-a68c-4d64-9d15-7f1c2d6ebc83" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:41,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/may/31/a-friend-said-it-gave-them-hope-four-ways-to-find-love-without-the-apps&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘A friend said it gave them hope’: four ways to find love – without the apps&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;40bab240-a68c-4d64-9d15-7f1c2d6ebc83&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:4,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false}"></gu-island></figure><p>But her options outside the apps have been limited, too. Webster went viral in 2021 when she was left in tears after being told by a personal matchmaking service to reconsider joining as people may refuse dates with someone who uses a wheelchair. This meant, that in their words, “achieving good outcomes for full‑time wheelchair user clients can be quite challenging”. She says: “I renounced the whole thing and very quickly found my mental health was much better. I haven’t thought about getting back on a dating app or dating since, and I’m not really miserable any more.”</p><p>Many readers got in touch with the Guardian with similar stories about finding contentment away from the pressures of trying to date.</p><p>Erica Smart from Banbury gave up dating apps a year ago after spending a decade using them. “I have never regretted this, despite knowing that various friends have met their spouses and long-term partners through them – something that I would still dearly love to have. However, I am at peace with the idea that I may never meet someone. If it happens, great. But if not, I’m also content with that. Having a partner can bring happiness, but also stress,” says the 42-year-old.</p><p>In fact, there is a surprising sense of optimism among those who have said goodbye to the apps. For Emma Chappell, 42, doing enjoyable, fulfilling activities may lead to a date, even though her choir sessions and nature walks have yet to yield any opportunities. “At least joining things and learning a new skill or having a fun night out is more worthwhile. And you have that thought of, ‘You never know.’” She adds: “Life is for living, after all, not sitting behind a screen waiting for life to start.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p dir="auto">Today our code signing certificate will expire. For many years <a href="https://www.leaderssl.nl/" rel="nofollow">LeaderSSL</a> sponsored us with a code singing certificate but they are no longer able to do so. Since June of 2023 the CA/B Forum requires that OV code signing private keys be stored on a FIPS 140-2 Level 2 or Common Criteria Level EAL4+ certified device. This means we are no longer able to export our code signing certificate with its private key and use this in GitHub actions. We would now either need to have our own GitHub agent and hardware token or use a cloud solution (e.g. <a href="https://docs.digicert.com/en/software-trust-manager/ci-cd-integrations/plugins/github-custom-action-for-keypair-signing.html" rel="nofollow">digicert</a>). Our preference would be to use a cloud solution that integrates with GitHub. Digicert seems to be our only option now but a certificate there would cost <a href="https://order.digicert.com/step1/code_signing" rel="nofollow">$629</a> (tax excluded) for a single year. If your organization requires a signed installer then please consider sponsoring us with a code signing certificate.

Getting one periodically is recommended for everyone over the age of 45.</p><p>Colonoscopies are rarely used for screening elsewhere but have been standard in the U.S. for decades. There are many reasons to think that they should work. But they are also expensive, invasive, unpleasant, and rarely — but not <em>that</em> rarely — have serious side effects. Are they worth it?</p><p>Until recently we didn’t have any randomized controlled trials that directly tested how well colonoscopies work. We finally just got one and the results were — how can I describe them? Confusing? Ambiguous? Frenzy-inducing?</p><p>Let’s try to understand what to make of this trial, and why American gastroenterologists were so quick to criticize it.</p></div>

</p>
                                            <div><p>After you swallow food, your body uses rhythmic waves of contractions to send it on a 4-meter (13-foot) journey through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. These extract most of the food’s nutrients and render it into a pulpy acidic fluid called <em>chyme</em>. The chyme then travels through your colon, a 1.5-meter (5-foot) tube that reabsorbs water and electrolytes, creating a solid mass that is then moved to your rectum for storage and eventual disposal. Yay!</p><p>The outermost layer of your inner colon is a single layer of <em>epithelial</em> cells whose job it is to let the good stuff through and keep the bad stuff out. Stem cells deeper inside the colon constantly divide to make new epithelial cells, which climb to the surface and live for four or five days before committing “suicide.”</p><p>Colonoscopies rest on the <em>adenoma-carcinoma hypothesis.</em> The idea is that errors can arise in the DNA, resulting in epithelial cells that don’t die on schedule. If they do anything <em>too</em> weird, your T-cells will kill them. But some mutations fly under the radar,&nbsp; causing little clumps of cells to grow on the surface of the colon. These clumps, or “polyps,” are usually <em>not cancer</em> — they grow slowly, and won’t (yet) spread to neighboring tissues. But if these persist for many years, they can acquire additional mutations that make them start spreading.</p><p>To prepare for a colonoscopy, you must empty your colon. This is achieved by drinking some chemicals and enduring some spectacular biological functions. Then a doctor threads a 1.5-meter (5-foot) flexible tube with a light and camera to look at the entire colon and remove or sample any polyps. The idea is not just to <em>detect</em> cancer but, by removing precancerous polyps, <em>prevent</em> it.</p><p>The primary alternative to colonoscopies for colorectal cancer screening are “occult blood tests” that look for <em>spooky</em> hidden blood in the stool. The oldest of these use an extract of the guaiacum tree and have RCTs showing they reduce colorectal cancer mortality by 9%-22% when used for screening. Newer tests look for antibodies and/or genetic mutations. These are more sensitive, though we don’t yet have RCTs estimating how much they help with mortality.</p><p>Another alternative is an older procedure called a sigmoidoscopy, which is basically a “mini” colonoscopy with a 0.6-meter (2-foot) tube. Compared to colonoscopy, it is quicker, safer, less painful, and cheaper, but it can only look at the lower (“sigmoid”) colon. Still, randomized trials have shown that screening sigmoidoscopies reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 26%-30%.</p><p>In principle, colonoscopies <em>should</em> be better than either of these tests. Unlike blood tests, colonoscopies try to remove polyps before they become cancer. And unlike sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopies can examine the whole colon.</p><p>But how much does it actually help to remove precancerous polyps? Gastrointestinal doctors often point to the National Polyp Study, but this is not a true randomized comparison — the study did colonoscopies on all subjects and concluded, based on comparisons to base rates in other “similar” populations, that removing polyps helped. And how much does it help to screen the whole colon? <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-018-0335-z" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross et al.</a> compared sigmoidoscopy to colonoscopy in English patients with suspected colorectal cancer and found that sigmoidoscopy was sufficient to detect 80% of cancers.</p><p>Because of the cost, the lack of direct evidence for efficacy, and the fact that it’s hard to convince people to do colonoscopies, they are rarely used for cancer screening outside the United States and some parts of German-speaking Europe. So it would be <em>really</em> useful to have an RCT that tested how well screening colonoscopies work.</p></div>

</p>
                                            <div><p>That brings us to the star of our show. The Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) is a huge randomized trial aimed at rigorously measuring how much colonoscopies reduce cancer and death.<sup>

 They invited one-third of them to a one-time screening colonoscopy. Of those contacted, 42% accepted the invitation and underwent a colonoscopy, while 58% refused the invitation. The other two-thirds of people were not contacted and seemingly never knew they were in the trial. The researchers then followed everyone (invited or not, colonoscopy or not) for a median of 10 years and checked government records to see who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, died from colorectal cancer, or died from any cause.</p><p>This was an “intention-to-screen” analysis. That means that it compared the control group to the whole invited group, including both the 42% of people who agreed to a colonoscopy and the 58% who refused. (If that seems strange, keep reading.)</p><p>These were the main results:</p></div>

                                            <p><h2>The Debate</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>This paper was greeted with gastroenterological bedlam. One response was that it shows colonoscopies aren’t cost-effective, since there was only a small effect on deaths from colorectal cancer, not much better than in previous trials of less invasive screening methods. Others took the more extreme stance that the study was further proof that American medicine is rotten, subjecting us to horrible expensive procedures for little benefit.</p><p>Overwhelmingly, American gastroenterologists did not agree. A primary concern expressed on Twitter (now known as X) seemed to be that the study might cause patients to do the worst thing a patient can ever do: Read a paper and ask questions about it.</p><p>For a little slice of the debate, take CNN’s piece, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/health/colonoscopy-cancer-death-study/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer">“New Study Examines the Effectiveness of Colonoscopies.”</a> It describes the study and results, gives a few quotes from the authors and other experts about how the results are surprising, cautions that it isn’t conclusive and further research is needed, and notes that “other studies have estimated larger benefits for colonoscopies, reporting that these procedures could reduce the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by as much as 68%.”</p><p>The American College of Gastroenterology disagreed with CNN so strongly that it released a <a href="https://webfiles.gi.org/links/committees/Public+Relations/American_College_of_Gastroenterology_Letter_to_CNN_NEJM_Bretthauer_Colonoscopy_10102022_FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">rebuttal</a>, claiming:</p><p>1. The way the study was set up, colonoscopies couldn’t possibly succeed because only 42% of people agreed to screening, 10 years isn’t long enough to see a benefit, and European doctors are bad at colonoscopies.</p><p>2. There is <em>other</em> evidence that removing polyps and doing colonoscopies save lives.</p><p>3. It’s irresponsible to call colonoscopies “invasive” (as CNN did) since that might make people think they are unpleasant and not do them.</p><p>4. Actually, the study shows colonoscopies are great.</p><p>Similar points were raised elsewhere, such as in a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> doctors sent to the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>. Are these points correct? Why were American gastroenterologists so eager to dismiss this trial?</p></div>
                                            <p><h2><strong>Did the Trial Actually Show That Colonoscopies Are Great?</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>By far the biggest controversy with the trial comes from the fact that only a minority of people agreed to screening. Colonoscopies can’t do anything if they don’t happen.</p><p>Many doctors suggested that if you look at the numbers in the right way, then this trial shows colonoscopies are great. For example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hanley</a> argues that while only 42% of people agreed to screening, among the people who did, colon cancer incidence was reduced by 31% and colon cancer mortality was reduced by 50%.</p><p>Many, <em>many</em> other doctors repeated the claim that this trial showed that getting a colonoscopy reduced the risk of dying of colorectal cancer by 50%. A common meme was to reframe the 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality in the main intention-to-screen analysis by rewriting the title in dismissive ways like&nbsp;“Effect of Mailing Letters to People on Risks of Colorectal Cancer and Related Death.”</p><p>In my opinion, that 50% number is <em>at best</em> unreliable and probably just wrong. Looking into why gives a great lesson on why statistics is hard and how that hardness conspires with social dynamics to confuse people.</p><p>In this study, there were three types of people:</p><p><strong>Controls</strong>, who were never contacted</p><p><strong>Refusers</strong>, who were invited to get a colonoscopy but declined</p><p><strong>Acceptors</strong>, who were invited to get a colonoscopy and chose to proceed</p><p>The main analysis only compares the controls to the <em>combination</em> of the acceptors and refusers. One reason to do so is that all screening programs see some proportion of people refuse assessment; what the analysis provides is a direct estimate of what an actual program would do.</p><p>But if you’re deciding if you should get a colonoscopy personally, then you’d like to know how much it would help. Naively, you might try to find out by looking at results for the acceptors versus controls, ignoring refusers. Unfortunately, there’s a deep problem: Acceptors and refusers are different. They might vary in age, sex, education, ethnicity, family health history, or comfort with their own tubes. Even if the colonoscopies had never happened, they would have had different outcomes from the controls. This is not hypothetical! At the end of the study period, 1.2% of the controls were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, compared with 1.05% of refusers and 0.89% of acceptors.<sup>

</sup>
</p><p>The refusers have less colorectal cancer than controls, even though neither had colonoscopies. The likely explanation is that people have some idea of their risk, either because of their family history, their lifestyle, or how their tubes have been feeling recently. Those at lower risk are more likely to refuse. (It’s also possible that refusers just hate going to the doctor and so just had fewer <em>diagnoses</em>, but never mind.)</p><p>So you can’t directly compare acceptors to controls <em>or</em> to refusers. They are different populations. Sadly, there’s no good way to solve this problem. But there are many bad ones!</p><p>The main results in the paper are the <em>intention-to-screen</em> analysis that compares the controls to the whole invited group. This understates the benefits of colonoscopies because it ignores the fact that less than half of invited people agreed to have colonoscopies. But this analysis is <em>ultra</em>robust, because it compares two perfectly randomized groups. It found an 18% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>An intuitive way to fix that bias would be to do a <em>naive correction</em> and pretend that the 42% of people who agreed to colonoscopies were random. If that were true, then the benefits if everyone agreed would have been 1/0.42 = 2.38 times as large, meaning that if 100% of people agreed instead of 42%, there would have been a 43% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 24% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>I call this “naive” because people did <em>not</em> agree at random. But what’s the bias? Remember, people at higher risk were more likely to agree. That means that the colonoscopies that <em>were</em> done were allocated <em>more efficiently</em> than a random allocation. Thus, the naive correction is likely an <em>over</em>estimate. We’d expect somewhat <em>less</em> than a 24% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality if everyone accepted.</p><p>One thing you <em>can</em> do is estimate what would have happened to the acceptors if they hadn’t gotten colonoscopies. Imagine a world where the trial never happened. Outcomes for the control group and the refusers would stay the same — the only people with a different result would be the ones who would have accepted colonoscopies had the study occurred. On the whole, though, the would-be invited group (that is, the would-be refusers and the would-be<em> </em>acceptors) would be just like the controls, since no one would have received any screening. With this in mind, we can work out what would have happened to the would-be acceptors in that world. You can see this in the dotted line in the graphs below:</p></div>

                                            <div><p>The right graph compares those results to the observed outcomes for acceptors in our branch of the multiverse, where they <em>did</em> have colonoscopies. At the end of the trial, there’s a reduction of 37%. Unfortunately, data aren’t available to do this for mortality, but this confirms the idea that the true effects are probably a bit lower than what the naive correction gives.</p><p>So where does this “50% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality” everyone is quoting come from? This is a complex <em>per-protocol analysis</em> that tries to use math to “make” the acceptors be like the controls. The details are a little fuzzy because the paper does the common academic thing where it says the details are in another paper that itself cites other papers in an infinite regress. But, basically, the analysis takes data from all the acceptors and refusers and fits a big equation to predict someone’s odds of getting diagnosed with or dying from colorectal cancer based on their age, sex, country, and group (acceptor or control). Then they see how much those odds change when you flip the group assignment. This gives the much quoted decrease of 31% in colorectal cancer diagnoses and 50% in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>Because that kind of analysis is known to be unreliable, they also included a <em>sensitivity analysis</em> as a sanity check. This gave a 34% decrease in colorectal cancer diagnoses and a 28% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality.</p><p>To summarize:</p></div>

</div>
                                            <div><p>The last three analyses all give something like a 33% reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses. I think we can be reasonably confident that’s right.</p><p>But should we believe that 50% number from the per-protocol analysis for colorectal cancer mortality?</p><p>I mean … no?</p><p>Let’s start with common sense. Certainly, if everyone invited had colonoscopies, the observed 10% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality would have been higher. But would it have been <em>five times</em> larger, even though almost half of people already got colonoscopies? Doubtful. The naive correction gives a reduction of only 24% in colorectal cancer mortality, and we have strong reasons to think this is an <em>over</em>estimate.&nbsp;</p><p>The 50% number comes from a fiddly statistical technique that only works under strong assumptions. One of these is that all the ways controls and acceptors vary are included in the dataset. But the dataset used was <em>very</em> limited — it didn’t have income, education, family history, or how people’s tubes were feeling when they got the invitation. If <em>any</em> of those things influenced people’s choices to accept, then this analysis wouldn’t have been able to correct for the biases between the groups. And there weren’t that many colorectal cancer deaths during the trial (229 total), so the analysis was done on sparse data.</p><p>And the sensitivity analysis — the point of this was to check how sensitive the per-protocol analysis is to its rather tenuous assumptions. It worked! It showed that the “50% reduction in colorectal cancer mortality” calculation is <em>exquisitely</em> sensitive to those assumptions! But then everyone just sort of ignored it.</p><p>So what happened? How did we end up with so many gastroenterologists quoting this 50% number?</p><p>I wouldn’t blame the study authors. The paper largely just carries out the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0032-1306895" rel="noopener noreferrer">preregistered</a> analysis without much comment. But in a letter to the journal, the authors emphasize that the per-protocol analysis is “prone to bias” and “not as trustworthy” and “caution against overinterpretation … because the number of deaths to date was small.”</p><p>But further removed reports get from the original study, the more those cautions disappear. Other doctors writing about the study didn’t pay much attention to those concerns. By the time you get to the doctors on social media, they’re basically gone.</p><p>It’s hard not to think that there’s some motivated reasoning at work here. Around 15 million colonoscopies are done in the U.S. each year, at an average cost of something like $3,000 for each. I<em> </em>don’t think doctors are intentionally distorting the truth. But they have been trained that colonoscopies are extremely effective, and most of them are busy and — no offense — have only a superficial understanding of statistics. So when a study comes out with various numbers, it’s human nature to look much harder for flaws in the surprising numbers than the ones that reinforce your worldview.</p><p>Or, to put it another way: Imagine a world where the intention-to-screen analysis showed strong effects, but the per-protocol analysis showed weak ones. Which one do you think everyone would be quoting?</p></div>

Here’s the least-terrible one, a joint effort of myself and a large language model.</p><p>Q. Why do Bayesians love colonoscopy trials?</p><p>A. Because they use <em>posteriors</em> to inform <em>priors</em>.</p><p>I know, I know. Anyway.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>Was the Trial Too Short?</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Many doctors also objected that the trial didn’t give colonoscopies a fair chance. One theory is that 10 years isn’t long enough (we'll know more when the trial ends and 15-year mortality is released). It takes years for polyps to turn into cancer and even longer for that cancer to kill you. Maybe the colonoscopies removed lots of polyps that <em>would</em> have eventually turned into cancer and/or deaths, but wouldn’t have done so <em>yet</em>.</p><p>The best way to check this theory would be to look at how previous trials evolved after 10 years. We don’t have any such trials for colonoscopies, but we <em>do</em> for sigmoidoscopies. NORCCAP ran in Norway, where 61% of men agreed to screening. UKFSST ran in the U.K., where 71% agreed to screening. Here is the reduction in colorectal cancer diagnoses and mortality in the invited group compared to the control group in all three trials over time:<sup>

In NordICC, the reduction is smaller than sigmoidoscopy trials probably just because NordICC saw fewer people agree to screening. But, overall, the NordICC curve looks similar to the other trials, suggesting modest gains over time.</p><p>For mortality, things just look weird. The other trials seemed to reach their maximum benefit by five to seven years and then sort of bounce around randomly. But NordICC actually had <em>higher</em> colorectal cancer mortality in the invited group until almost the end of the trial. I assume this was just bad luck. It’s hard to say what that green line will do in future years.</p></div>

Another theory for the small effect in the NordICC trial is that since colonoscopies are less common in Europe, the doctors had less experience than American doctors.</p><p>The skill of a doctor doing a colonoscopy is often measured by their adenoma detection rate — how often they find a precancerous polyp. American doctors find them 40% of the time. In the NordICC trial, doctors found them only 31% of the time. Many suggested this meant the doctors weren’t great.</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cappell et al.</a> counter that perhaps it wasn’t the doctors but that there were more adenomas to find in the American colons because of “higher prevalence of obesity (30% vs.&nbsp;12%), a higher rate of ever having smoked cigarettes, higher fat and cholesterol consumption, and poorer physical fitness.”</p><p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMc2215192" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dominitz and Robertson</a> reply that lifestyles notwithstanding, the U.S. has substantially <em>lower</em> rates of colorectal cancer.

But be cautious: Diagnoses aren’t a great measure of incidence, since they depend on how aggressively you look. And deaths <em>also</em> aren’t great, since they depend on treatments. It’s also conceivable that Americans do have more adenomas, but <em>because</em> colonoscopies are already common in the U.S., many get removed before they become cancer.</p><p>Also, I’m not sure I trust that the diagnosis rates in this data reflect cancer rates: Do we really believe that Norway has 45% more colorectal cancer than Sweden, despite the fact that these countries have similar diets, life expectancies, and mortality rates — and that Norwegians drink and smoke a bit less?

    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
)</p><p>Another oddity is that there were <em>zero</em> perforations in the NordICC trial across all 12,000 colonoscopies performed whereas previous studies report them at rates between 1 in 100 and 1 in 20,000. (Perforation of the colon is fatal without emergency surgery.) One interpretation of this is that European doctors are awesome. Alternatively, Powell and Prasad give this heart-warming speculation:</p></div>
                                            <p>It has been hypothesized that the absence of perforation in NordICC was due in part by the fact that the vast majority of procedures were unsedated, preventing the operator from using more force—a contributing factor to perforation.</p>
                                            <div><p>If doing colonoscopies without anesthesia reduces perforations, that’s great. But one doctor I talked to suggested that without anesthesia it’s impossible to be as thorough, so this might reduce the benefits of colonoscopies.</p><p>Overall, I don’t think we have a clear answer here. I think there is weak evidence for the idea that the average American colonoscopy is better than those in this trial. But it’s very uncertain.</p></div>
                                            <p><h2><strong>Why Was There No Impact on Overall Mortality?</strong></h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Among nondoctors, many people were surprised that <em>overall</em> mortality rates — from any cause — were the same in the control and invited groups. Isn’t the point of colonoscopies to prevent death? Does this mean colonoscopies are worthless?</p><p>No. I ran millions of simulated trials assuming “magic colonoscopies” that reduced the odds of dying from colorectal cancer to <em>zero</em>. The results ranged from the invited group having 5.6% lower overall mortality to 2.5% <em>higher</em>.<sup>

    <span id="fnref-8">
        8    </span>
    <!-- </a> -->
</sup>
 So we can’t conclude anything from this. There just aren’t enough people to detect a tiny signal (change in colorectal cancer mortality) that’s drowned out by tons of noise (mortality from other factors).</p></div>
                                            <p><h2>Discussion</h2>
</p>
                                            <div><p>Are colonoscopies better than other screening methods? I don’t know. Maybe!</p><p>But on the margin, surely this trial gives <em>some</em> evidence that colonoscopies might not be as effective as we hoped. So why were American gastroenterologists so keen to dismiss it? There seemed to be no similar frenzy of doctors in other countries trying to discredit the trial.</p><p>Or, to back up — why has America settled on colonoscopies when most of the world has not? Regulators in Europe basically give two reasons that they continue to recommend fecal blood tests:</p><p>1. It’s hard to get Europeans to do any colorectal cancer screening, and <em>exceedingly</em> hard to get them to agree to colonoscopies.</p><p>2. Colonoscopies have not yet been proven to be cost-effective.</p><p>In America, neither of these apply.&nbsp; When setting recommendations, the U.S. Preventative Service Task Force explicitly does not consider costs. And since we expect colonoscopies to be effective, it would be too risky <em>not</em> to do them. Americans are probably more open to colonoscopies simply because doctors have told them for decades how important they are. (Note: None of these things are obviously bad!)</p><p>So that’s my theory. Europe wants stronger evidence for cost-effectiveness. America is more aggressive and more willing to accept high costs. I don’t think this trial changes that. Colonoscopies are still expensive, and still possibly but not conclusively better.</p><p>One thing is clear: Screening works. If you’re of the appropriate age, please get screened. If your tubes are acting funny, please get screened without delay. The best method and the level of benefit are debatable, but we know it helps. Use a stool test if you want (multitarget DNA test if you can), or a colonoscopy, or a sigmoidoscopy, or a “virtual” CT colonoscopy, or a crazy edible camera. Do one of them. Statistics show colorectal cancer is highly curable when caught early, and now that we have feisty checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies,it’s probably even better now. Just do it. Your tubes will thank you.</p><p><em>An earlier version of this article referred to the NordICC trial in the past tense. It has been updated to reflect that the trial is still ongoing. </em></p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>“Friends” star Mathew Perry was found dead Saturday in a hot tub at his Los Angeles home, law enforcement sources said.</p><p>Authorities responded about 4 p.m. to his home, where he was discovered unresponsive. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing, did not cite a cause of death. There was no sign of foul play, the sources added. A representative for Perry did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment.</p><p>The Los Angeles Police Department’s robbery-homicide detectives are investigating the death. The cause of death will be determined at a later date by the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.</p><p>Perry, the son of actor John Bennett Perry and Suzanne Marie Langford, onetime press secretary of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, was born in 1969 and grew up between Montreal and Los Angeles after his parents separated when Perry was 1.</p><p>He got his start as a child actor, landing guest spots on “Charles in Charge” and “Beverly Hills 90210” and playing opposite River Phoenix in the film “A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon” in the 1980s and early 1990s. </p><p>But his big break came when he was cast in “Friends” — originally titled “Friends Like Us” — a sitcom about six single New Yorkers navigating adulthood that premiered on NBC in 1994. </p><p>The series soon became a juggernaut, the anchor of the network’s vaunted Thursday-night “Must-See TV” lineup, and turned Perry, then 25, and his castmates Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer into mega-stars almost overnight: At its high-water mark, in a 1996 post-Super Bowl slot, the series notched more than 50 million live viewers. </p><p>As Chandler Bing, the handsome, wisecracking roommate of LeBlanc’s Joey Tribbiani and, later, love interest of Cox’s fastidious Monica Geller, Perry distinguished himself in a crackling ensemble cast with his dry delivery, creating a catchphrase with a mere turn of inflection: Could he <i>be</i> any more Chandler? Soon, he was attached to major stars like Julia Roberts and appearing as a leading man opposite Salma Hayek in the 1997 rom-com “Fools Rush In.”</p><p>There was a dark side to the life of one of television’s most beloved funnymen, however. In his 2022 memoir “Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing,” Perry recounted his lifelong struggle with addiction to alcohol and opioids, which led to multiple stints in rehab and a number of serious health issues, including a five-month hospitalization in 2018 following a colon rupture that left him, he wrote, with a  2% chance to live through the night. And it was fueled, he acknowledged during a “Friends” reunion special in 2021, by the pressure to land the joke in front of a live studio audience night after night. </p><p>“Nobody wanted to be famous more than me,” Perry told The Times in April, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2023-04-23/matthew-perry-keanu-reeves-friends-book-festival">discussing “Big Terrible Thing” at the Festival of Books</a>. “I was convinced it was the answer. I was 25, it was the second year of ‘Friends,’ and eight months into it, I realized the American dream is not making me happy, not filling the holes in my life. I couldn’t get enough attention. … Fame does not do what you think it’s going to do. It was all a trick.”</p><p>Though Perry estimated he had relapsed  “60 or 70 times” since first getting sober in 2001, he maintained a steady presence on American television, playing key parts in backstage dramedy “Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip” and therapy sitcom “Go On,” and making a steady stream of guest appearances on acclaimed shows  such as “The West Wing” and “The Good Wife.” Since his near-death experience in 2018, Perry had found solace in friendships, writing and regular games of pickleball. </p><p>Indeed, for all his success as an actor and, more recently, a bestselling memoirist, Perry told The Times in April that his work was not the center of what he hoped would be his legacy.</p><p>Pressed to name how he’d like to be remembered, he said: “As a guy who lived life, loved well, lived well and helped people. That running into me was a good thing, and not something bad.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <main>
        <p>You read that right. <a href="https://actualbudget.com/">Actual</a>, a personal finance system I've been working on for over 4 years, is going open-source. That means it will now be <strong>100% free</strong> and <strong>completely open forever</strong>.</p>
<p>Let the forks commence.</p>
<p><em>"Show me the proof,"</em> they said. <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual">Here it is</a>. That's the source code. All of it. In all of it's beautiful, wild and raw mess.</p>
<p>You can locally run the entire app, include the syncing server, in less than a tweet's worth of commands:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server.git
cd actual-server
yarn
yarn start
</code></pre>
<p>Now go to <code>http://localhost:5006</code>. (Read more at <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server">actual-server</a>)</p>
<p>We are also moving from Slack to Discord. Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/pRYNYr4W5A">discord</a>! </p>
<h2 id="wait-a-second-what-does-that-mean-for-me">Wait a second... what does that mean for me?</h2>
<p>This is a significant shift and will have implications to all current subscribers. Here's what's going to happen:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Immediately, signups on <a href="https://actualbudget.com/">actualbudget.com</a> have been turned off.</p>
</li>
<li><p><s>In June, all existing subscriptions will be cancelled. Specific dates coming soon.</s> (we have delayed this until we figure out the right timeline)</p>
</li>
<li><p><s>In June, the existing syncing server will be shut down</s> (we have delayed this until we figure out the right timeline). Instead, you should <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server#running">host your own server</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Unfortunately, the mobile apps are going to be deprecated. They should still work completely fine, and if you are on Android you should be able to build it locally and sideload them. Sadly, mobile apps require a <em>lot</em> of maintenance and money to stay in the app stores and now that we are decentralized, it doesn't make sense for us to take this on. The solution here is to eventually build mobile versions of the web apps. Eventually, the mobile apps will no longer be available in the app stores.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It's unclear what will happen with the desktop app. Even though it requires little maintenance code-wise, deployment and code-signing is still a significant burden. For now, the web app is the primary platform until we figure out a solution for this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Over time, the docs content on the website will be migrated to github and the website will be shut down as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support will go through github issues on the <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual">actual repo</a>. Existing issues from the <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/releases">releases</a> repo will be migrated over. The <code>help@actualbudget.com</code> email will be turned off.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We are moving from Slack to Discord. <a href="https://discord.gg/3pkUZ54M">Please join</a>! The slack instance will eventually be shut down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We are moving to letting you <strong>host your own server</strong>. With modern services like <a href="https://fly.io/">fly.io</a>, it's easier than ever to <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server#deploying">deploy a server</a>.  We are changing from a centralized service to a decentralized one.</p>
<p>You can easily <strong>transition your data</strong> from the hosted version to the open-source version. Once you've setup your own server, load Actual and point it to your server, and your files show show up as local files. You can select each one and register it to the server for syncing.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual-server">actual-server</a> project for how to setup your own server.</p>
<p>Some of you are going to disappointed in this. I'm sorry! I'm optimistic that <em>most</em> current users are technical and are actually going to be very excited about this change.</p>
<p>When I started exploring this, I got excited because it enables some really interesting features like an HTTP-based API. The existing API requires the entire app to be loaded. We couldn't offer an HTTP endpoint because we can't read your data. Now that you are hosting your server, you are in control and are free to offer an HTTP API.</p>
<p>You could even hook up your own bank syncing -- <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a> support a free development plan that covers an individual user. In fact, you'll see Plaid support in the syncing server because I already started building this out.</p>
<p>In the future, the open-source version will provide releases similar to before and will provide easy paths to upgrade. <strong>I'm actively calling people to step up and help!</strong> If you are a developer, please poke around and open PRs for any improvements. There are some initial project ideas in the <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing file</a>. I will continue to work on how to manage the project.</p>
<p>The open-source version of Actual has the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The server has been rebuilt to remove the subscription-related workflows.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The app doesn't require an account anymore. On first run, it does ask for a URL to the server you want to use. You can point the app at any server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you want, you can skip the option to use a server and use the app completely locally.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any tracking code has been removed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the app was left as-is. There is a lot of stuff in there that should be cleaned up, but I wanted to get this out.</p>
<h2 id="what-happened">What happened?</h2>
<p>Building products is hard, building a business is even harder. I told myself that I was going to push through and make it happen no matter what. Even if it took years, I would slowly build my vision. When I stopped working full-time on Actual and started working at Stripe, I told everyone it wasn't going anywhere. And I meant it.</p>
<p>But the fact is this project is way bigger than me. I have to come to accept that. Even I were completely full-time, I need to hire at least 2 other people to properly sustain it. It's time to call it for what it is and open it up as a community project.</p>
<p>There's <em>so much</em> in the code waiting to be utilized. The API now is a self-contained bundle with all the code (compared to before where it was a thin client that connected to a running app). This means it's a full library capable of all the features in the app. Actual is now an open platform for building personal finance products.</p>
<p>By myself, I haven't had enough time to bring it to its full potential. Focusing on one specific thing for a week means 10 other things are left undone. It's not working.</p>
<p>It's currently 1:30 AM and I've been working all night. If I want to launch any features, this is what I have to do. Usually I can quickly prototype a feature, but documenting and launching it takes a ton more time. It's not sustainable. I've given up <em>a lot</em> over the last few years.</p>
<p><strong>I completely underestimated</strong> how much work it takes to build a business. There's so much overhead. I'm always figuring out why a build failed, taxes, how to triage issues, responding to support, designing UIs, responding to Apple's complaints, and more. There's <strong>so much</strong> that goes on behind the scenes. There's no way a single person can possible do this alone, especially as a side project.</p>
<p>One thing I'm really excited about open-source is I no longer have to deal with any of the business or deployment stuff. I can focus on being a project manager.</p>
<p>Last month I was really sick for an entire week. During that time, the syncing server went down twice. I forced myself to sit down and dig into it even though I felt like I was going to throw up. I got it working, but it really made me think about my mental health. I've put a lot of stuff on pause over the last couple years, and I need to find a better balance.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-doing-something-different">The cost of doing something different</h3>
<p>Actual is a <em>very</em> different product. It's not a normal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service">SaaS</a> app. It's a local-first app using a fancy technology called CRDTs that syncs changes across devices.</p>
<p>This has a lot of benefits, but one drawback is I can't use off-the-shelf solutions anymore. Hiring and getting help is harder. I'm super proud of being so ambitious, but ultimately doing something so different made it hard to iterate quickly. I can't simply make a quick database schema change. Every feature needs to be rolled out very thoughfully and maintain backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>I'm hopeful that open-source will make this easier; with lots of people involved it offsets the difficulty added. And I'm hopeful there will a lot of people involved because I get asked if I'm going to open-source at least once a month.</p>
<h3 id="now-everybody-can-help">Now everybody can help</h3>
<p>I've tried hiring part-time developers about 7 times. It never worked out because there isn't enough money to fund development. $4/month is insanely cheap. But pricing isn't the only issue: even if I bumped up prices, it just needs a <em>lot</em> more funds. Development is crazy expensive.</p>
<p>I was able to hire for some roles like support but it wasn't enough to balance it out.</p>
<p>How does open-source help with this? Isn't everybody working for free now?</p>
<p>While that's true, I've seen <strong>the magic of open-source</strong> work before. Now everybody is invested in the product, and changes are owned by everybody. We need some structure to move the project along of course, and need to guard maintainers mental health, but open-source has the potential to transform the product.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://github.com/actualbudget/actual/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributing file</a> for some initial project ideas. Poke around the code, and join the <a href="https://discord.gg/pRYNYr4W5A">discord</a> to talk about ways you can help! I'm very optimistic that opening this up is going to make the project more healthy and active. </p>
<p>Right now, Actual is up to 810 paid subscribers. I'm proud of that. But it's time to call it for it is. It needs a lot more help, and I'm excited to see how it evolves as an open-source project.</p>

Here we investigate the role of the electrolyte in this reaction and present a high-efficiency, robust process that is enabled by compact ionic layering in the electrode–electrolyte interface region. The interface is generated by a high-concentration imide-based lithium-salt electrolyte, providing stabilized ammonia yield rates of 150 ± 20 nmol s<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup> and a current-to-ammonia efficiency that is close to 100%. The ionic assembly formed at the electrode surface suppresses the electrolyte decomposition and supports stable N<sub>2</sub> reduction. Our study highlights the interrelation between the performance of the lithium-mediated nitrogen-reduction reaction and the physicochemical properties of the electrode–electrolyte interface. We anticipate that these findings will guide the development of a robust, high-performance process for sustainable ammonia production.</p></div>

          <p>We’re Fly.io. We run apps for our users on hardware we host around the world. Fly.io happens to be a great place to run Phoenix applications. Check out how to <a href="https://fly.io/docs/elixir/">get started</a>!</p>
<p>As an Elixir/Phoenix developer going on 10 years it is very easy to take for granted everything that Elixir and Phoenix can do for us. So I wanted to take a step back and list all of the stuff that we get for free when we choose Elixir and Phoenix.</p>

<p>My goal with this post is dump an list of information and links and let you choose your own path. If you are unfamiliar with any of these topics or Elixir and Phoenix please click any of these links and take a peak, I think you might be surprised at the quality and depth of what you find!</p>

<p>The inspiration for this post was a <a href="https://twitter.com/wojtekmach/status/1710020808523846087">Saša Jurić</a> re-tweet where he shared the following slide from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE">GOTO Conference Talk</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://fly.io/phoenix-files/elixir-and-phoenix-can-do-it-all/assets/elixir-does-all.jpeg"></p>

<p>This image enumerates some of the technical requirements that the <a href="https://www.erlang.org/">Erlang Virtual Machine</a> can replace in your tech stack. Not to say that these other projects can’t do these things well, they can and do in our own stack here at <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>. The point is that in those ecosystems you <em>have</em> to solve these problems in the first place, when reviewing this article José Valim said it best:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>removing the problem altogether instead of solving the problem</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-beam"><a href="#the-beam" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The BEAM</h2>
<p>This above list doesn’t even cover the built in support for incredible bits like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actor Process Model, meaning do to concurrency you have a Process and it sends messages to other processes. No Shared memory. Fully managed by the BEAM’s built in scheduler. Millions of processess are no issue. Fearless concurrency!
</li><li>Distribution: meaning two servers can communicate seamlessly and automatically. It <em>just</em> works and <a href="https://fly.io/phoenix-files/beam-clustering-made-easy/">is incredible</a>.
</li><li>RPC: Calling a function or process remotely is as easy as calling a local one, no need to concern ourselves with connections or serialization or deserialization. This is one of the many reasons Fly is so committed to using Elixir and Phoenix, the <a href="https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/">wireguard based network</a> and globally hosting makes using this trivial and desirable.
</li><li>Parallel Garbage Collection, meaning the VM is Soft Real Time, minimal pausing!
</li><li>Emphasis on low resource usage in general
</li><li>Built in UDP/TCP/SSL server support.
</li><li>Built in Key Value Store <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html">ETS</a>.
</li><li>Tooling for <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/tracing">tracing</a> and <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/observer">observing</a> your code.
</li><li>37 Years of constant development and production use.
</li></ul>

<p>The beauty of this list is that if Elixir and Phoenix team have done our Job right you don’t need to think about any of this at all. It just works for you and lets you stand on the shoulders of this giant.</p>
<h3 id="elixir"><a href="#elixir" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Elixir</h3>
<p>If we go higher level the Elixir programming language provides us even more as developers:</p>

<ul>
<li>A full dependency management and build tool with <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html">mix</a> and <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex</a>.
</li><li>With modern tooling built in:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/1.15/ExUnit.html">Testing</a>
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc">Documentation</a>
</li><li>Formatting
</li></ul>
</li><li>Language with a clean, <a href="https://fly.io/phoenix-files/elixir-docs-are-built-different/">documented</a> and fully exampled <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Kernel.html">Standard Library</a>. Its remarkable how <em>little</em> cruft there is in this Language. Go into any other language to find random functions or modules that are marked <em>do not use</em>, or without examples or documentation. Not the case for Elixir.
</li><li>Modern <a href="https://fly.io/phoenix-files/elixir-docs-are-built-different/">Documentation</a>:

<ul>
<li>Built in Cheatsheets
</li><li>Built in Custom Markdown
</li><li>Links to source
</li><li>Search
</li><li>Support for Mermaid, Math.js, Vega-Lite and more!
</li></ul>
</li><li>Modern language features like:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/protocols.html">Protocols</a> enabling high level collections and functions like <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Enum.html">Enum</a>, <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Stream.html">Streams</a>, and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Access.html">Access</a>
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Stream.html">Stream</a>, enabling lazy and performant data processing
</li><li>Full featured <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Date.html">Date</a>/<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Time.html">Time</a>/<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/DateTime.html">DateTime</a>/<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Calendar.html">Calendar</a> modules.
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Task.html">Task</a> for trivial parallel processing.
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Agent.html">Agent</a> for trivial shared state management.
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Config.html">Config</a> for environment specific configuration
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Registry.html">Registry</a> for local, decentralized and scalable key-value process storage.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<p>This is just a subset of what Elixir the Language provides. It doesn’t include the <em>deep</em> catalog of libraries within package registry <a href="https://hex.pm/">Hex</a> enabling so much more.</p>

<p>Some examples from Hex:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine Learning with <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/bumblebee">Bumblebee</a> with HuggingFace integration and it works with batching and distribution globally.
</li><li>Math/Science comparable to NumPy using <a href="https://github.com/elixir-nx/scholar">Scholar</a>.
</li><li>Complex distributed big data processing using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/gen_stage/GenStage.html">GenStage</a> or <a href="https://github.com/dashbitco/broadway">Broadway</a>
</li><li>Embedded and IoT Programming using <a href="https://nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>.
</li><li><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/stream_data">Stream-Data</a> for property and generative based testing.
</li><li><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/sobelow">Sobelow</a> for security and static Analysis.
</li><li><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/oban">Oban</a> for a Worker/Job Queue implementation.
</li><li><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/req">Req</a> for high level HTTP Clients.
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-plug/plug/">Plug</a> for HTTP Servers.
</li><li> <a href="https://github.com/mtrudel/bandit">Bandit</a> for pure Elixir HTTP1/2 Server!
</li><li><a href="https://livebook.dev/">LiveBook</a> for Juypter like workbooks with Elixir!
</li><li><a href="https://membrane.stream/">Membrane</a> for video stream processing.
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/decimal/readme.html">Decimal</a> for arbitrary precision decimal arithmetic.
</li><li><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/jason/readme.html">Jason</a> for highly performant JSON Encoding/Decoding.
</li><li><a href="https://hex.pm/packages/image">Image</a> for image manipulation.
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/elixir-cldr/cldr">CLRD</a> for maybe the <em>most</em> complete Internationalization and Locale libraries outside of maybe the Web Browser. Numbers, List, Units, Date\Time\DateTimes, Collation, Territories, and more.
</li><li><a href="https://github.com/rusterlium/rustler">Rustler</a> and <a href="https://github.com/E-xyza/zigler">Zigler</a> for truly simple Rust and Zig FFI support, for when you need to drop down and bash bits.
</li></ul>

<p>There is very little that the Elixir Ecosystem hasn’t tackled!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
		<p><span>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel says the FCC plans to “incentivize innovation and experimentation in the amateur radio bands” by&nbsp;getting rid of outdated restrictions&nbsp;and providing licensees with the flexibility to use modern digital emissions.</span></p>
<p><span>The commission at its November meeting is expected to take action on a Report and Order that would eliminate the baud rate limitation and establish a bandwidth limitation in the amateur radio bands below 29.7 MHz.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The order being circulated for tentative consideration by the commission would remove the baud rate limitation — the rate at which the carrier waveform amplitude, frequency and/or phase is varied to transmit information — for data emissions in the amateur radio bands, the FCC says. The current baud rate limits were adopted in 1980.</span></p>
<p><span>The order would implement a 2.8 kilohertz bandwidth limitation in place of the baud rate in amateur radio bands. The 2.8 kHz limitation is consistent with the commission’s treatment of other wireless radio services, the FCC says.</span></p>
<p><span>The current rules limit the baud rate for high-frequency amateur radioteletype/data transmissions to 300 baud for frequencies below 28 MHz (except in the 60-meter band), and 1200 baud in the 10 meter (28-29.7 MHZ) band.</span></p>
<p><span>The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau says the change in technical standards would allow the amateur radio service to operate more efficiently, including during times of emergency to support public safety.</span></p>
<p><span>The American Radio Relay League (ARRL) in 2013 asked the commission to delete references to the baud rate and to establish a bandwidth limitation of 2.8 kHz. The group argued the public safety benefits of making the change. ARRL stated: “[i]ncreasing speed is especially important when amateurs voluntarily assist during and after hurricanes, forest fires and other disasters.”</span></p>
<p><span>At the time, ARRL also told the FCC that eliminating the baud rate limitation will “incentivize innovation by allowing more data to be transmitted within each signal without increasing bandwidth from that currently used.”</span></p>
<p><span>A spokesperson for ARRL says the organization supports the proposed action and the <a href="https://www.radioworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DOC-397992A1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal of further notice.</a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a subsequent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2016 (WT Docket No. 16-239), the FCC tentatively concluded that a 2.8 kilohertz bandwidth limitation for radioteletype and data emissions in the MF/HF bands was not necessary, and sought comment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.radioworld.com/news-and-business/business-and-law/"><b><i>[See Our Business and Law Page]</i></b></a></p>
<p><span>A few commenters at the time of the NPRM opposed any rule change, arguing that the existing rules should be retained in order to protect access to amateur bands by Morse code and other narrowband transmissions.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the commission writes in the order: “Based on the record in this proceeding, we find that the baud rate limitation has become outdated and hampers, rather than promotes, innovation and robust use of the amateur bands.”</span></p>
<p><span>The commission continued in the new order: “We are persuaded by the weight of the record in this proceeding that, without a baud rate or bandwidth limit, data stations using a large amount of spectrum for a single emission could do so to the detriment of simultaneous use by other stations using narrowband emission modes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In essence, the technical change mean amateurs will require less time to transmit messages, which in turn will open up more spectrum in the time domain for more amateurs to use, said David Siddall, general counsel for ARRL.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“This is a very simple change. In 1980, at the inception of digital technologies that could be used by radio amateurs, the FCC adopted a speed limit of 300 baud for the stated purpose of limiting the amount of spectrum occupied by any single signal,” Siddall said. “Radio amateurs, being tinkerers and experimenters, worked to develop faster and faster speeds that still fit within the standard spectrum bandwidth. Eventually their innovations to the technology significantly increased spectrum efficiency but ran up against the FCC baud rate limit.”</span></p>
<p><span>One of the benefits of the changes will be allowing for “faster emergency communications” by volunteer ham radio operators during emergencies, the FCC says.</span></p>
<p><span>The agency says its Wireless Telecommunications Bureau’s Mobility Division has previously issued waivers allowing amateur operators directly involved with disaster relief efforts to exceed the baud rate limitation in the interest of public safety.</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC at its November meeting will also consider a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (FNPRM) that proposes to remove the baud rate limitation in the 2200 meter and 630 meter bands. The commission also proposes to remove the baud rate limitation in the very high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The commission says it expects to seek comment on the appropriate bandwidth limitation for the 2200 meter band, the 630 meter band, and the VHF and UHF bands.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Stroh, editor of amateur radio newsletter Zero Retries, says the need for improved data communications in amateur radio also coincides with spectrum becoming more “noisy” due to “pollution” by systems such as LED lighting, small switching power supplies and even solar panels.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“That noise has an outsize impact on analog modes such as voice and very low power transmissions. Improved data communications modes, including digital voice modes, can overcome the noise issues,” Stroh said in an email to Radio World.</span></p>
<p><span>Stroh says he is happy to see the FCC address the same limitation on the amateur radio VHF and UHF bands —&nbsp;where there is arguably much greater potential for technological innovation in data communications technology — if it wasn’t for the data rate and mode limitations.</span></p>
<p><span>“Fortunately, in its proposal, the FCC recognizes that the symbol rate and mode issue does include the Amateur Radio VHF and UHF bands. Thus the FCC’s proposal is a very good one that will significantly benefit Amateur Radio,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCC’s next meeting is scheduled for November 15. A comment period on the <a href="https://www.radioworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/DOC-397992A1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FNPRM</a> will commence 30 days after the date of publication in the Federal Register.&nbsp;</span></p>

				<div>
															<p dir="ltr">Practically everyone has clicked "agree" on terms and conditions they didn't read through. Unfortunately, the latest terms and conditions for using the <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/terms-and-conditions.html" target="_blank">McDonald's</a> app contain many&nbsp;customer-affecting changes: updates to McDonald's liability in cases of injury, third-party errors, and app malfunction; waivers for a customer's right to a jury trial or class action lawsuit; and an agreement to solve disputes through a strict arbitration process.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Essentially, the new terms state that, if a customer tries to <a href="https://www.mashed.com/1398637/mcdonalds-sued-hot-coffee-again/" target="_blank">sue over hot coffee</a>, for example, they can't take their case to trial. Rather, as laid out in McDonald's 12-step outline, the customer must notify the company of their intent to seek arbitration, meet with the company to discuss the problem, and only then have an arbitrator enter the equation.&nbsp;As you can imagine, this process eliminates decision-making by a dozen jurors, instead giving a single arbitrator discretion in deciding the outcome. The very nature of the arbitration process makes class action nearly impossible, meaning each customer has to file their own dispute with McDonald's.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All that said, perhaps the most controversial piece of these updates is that there's no way to opt out of accepting the new terms and conditions — no box to check saying you disagree. The only choices? Agree or delete the app.</p>

				<div>
															<p dir="ltr">Understandably, McDonald's customers have been very vocal about the new terms and conditions online, with many saying they're choosing to delete the app rather than sign their legal rights away. Several people pointed out that McDonald's has been pushing its app more frequently in recent months, particularly through app-only offers like <a href="https://www.mashed.com/1427915/mcdonalds-free-french-fry-fridays/" target="_blank">free fries on Fridays</a>. At the same time, one <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@seansvv/video/7294149648397241642" target="_blank">TikTok</a> user commented that the terms and conditions include a great deal of legal jargon that the "typical fast food patron [can't] read," much less understand. Similarly, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/17fx4b2/comment/k6ct4gh/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> user noted that these terms are intended to stack the deck against anyone who tries to sue McDonald's.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Customers questioned whether or not the terms and conditions are actually legally binding, given that the agreement does not require a signature or date. Unfortunately, if McDonald's has laid out all necessary information and provided app users with the ability to agree or disagree (the latter requiring customers to jump through hoops to delete their account and the app itself), the terms and conditions are assumedly enforceable by law in most states.</p>

    <section>
    
    
    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I recently got a pair of Tozo T6 earbuds. They’re great and I love them but they play a sound whenever you pair, unpair, or connect them, and it’s way too loud for my preference.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> I also wasn’t able to fix it by e.g. setting the equalizer to subtract a few decibels across the board. I asked them via email about this and they responded promptly and said that there was nothing they could do, which is understandable - it’s probably not a common request. But it was too loud for me to continue using them, so I decided to try to solve the problem myself.</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/tozo_t6_earbuds.jpg" alt="Tozo T6 earbuds. They&amp;rsquo;re great. I only have one complaint&amp;hellip;" width="66%"><figcaption>
            <p>Tozo T6 earbuds. They’re great. I only have one complaint…</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To solve the problem, I need to modify the firmware that runs on the device. My initial expectation of how this would work was:</p>
<ol>
<li>I would get a binary file from somewhere for my device. People often share firmware files online, maybe I could find a copy using a search engine.</li>
<li>The firmware file would be in some easily-understood binary structure like ELF.</li>
<li>The audio files would be contained in the binary somewhere, maybe as an ELF symbol (going from the last point). Knowing how the image format worked would let me modify the data within it while making sure that I didn’t accidentally give it a corrupt image and possibly brick my device.</li>
<li>The audio files would be in a format that would be easy to transform, maybe PCM since it’s running on an embedded device with perhaps limited computational power to decode audio (of course, it’s also a headset, so probably it can decode compressed audio just fine).</li>
<li>Once I can modify data within the firmware image (either unpack/repack it or modify data in-situ by knowing its offset and length within the image), do so to make the audio quieter (e.g. if it’s PCM then maybe halve each sample, etc).</li>
<li>Finally, I would flash my modified firmware to the device with some kind of tool made for my model of equipment or its underlying chipset, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some of these assumptions ended up being completely false and unwarranted (I have no idea why I hoped that the audio would be uncompressed on a low-power device like this, for example), but this was my thinking starting out. It also doesn’t include any reverse engineering, which ended up taking up most of the time that wasn’t spent on setting up infrastructure (such as an intercepting proxy), but this was mostly just going down rabbitholes. In the end, I actually didn’t need to reverse engineer much at all. So this post is less about reverse engineering and more about the general process of solving my particular problem.</p>
<h2 id="first-steps-initial-research">First steps: initial research</h2>
<p>The first step is to collect information about what exactly the device is. There seem to be several different entities involved in the production of cheap electronics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The vendor, who actually brands and sells the device - Tozo, in this case.</li>
<li>The chipset, a specific piece of hardware the device is mostly designed around, which runs the firmware code and might have special features for the application at hand.</li>
<li>The ISA - the chipset will run code of a particular instruction set, with a “core” derived from some other base tech like ARM, MIPS, etc (or perhaps they rolled their own).</li>
<li>Additional features - the chipset might integrate technology from other people onto their chip, such as additional coprocessors, chips to interface with different kinds of hardware, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The chipset for my device ended up being an Airoha AB1562, which apparently is based on an Tensilica Xtensa ISA and includes a “Cadence HiFi DSP coprocessor”. I wasn’t able to find this out searching for my device model however, so I ended up just looking through the disassembly for their Android app. There I found an SDK for a company called “Airoha”, with references to specific chip models and containing all of the primitives for talking to devices. I wasn’t able to find any other chipset SDK’s, so I assumed this was the chipset manufacturer.</p>
<p>I still had to find the specific model though. After a bit more searching, I found a Reddit community for discussing AirPods clones called /r/airreps, which gave me some good advice about how to proceed. They have also written an Android application called “AirReps156X”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> which also uses the Airoha SDK, and can provide diagnostic information about Airoha devices<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. I was able to connect to this app with my device, so it’s definitely an Airoha chipset, and one of the diagnostic strings was “QW_1562U_SDK1.5.1”, which leads me to believe that my device chipset is in the Airoha AB1562 series:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/airreps_156x_diagnostic.png" alt="The &amp;ldquo;Airreps 156X&amp;rdquo; app display device information." width="33%"><figcaption>
            <p>The “Airreps 156X” app display device information.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The application also lets you flash new firmware, which is a fairly critical item on the checklist. So now that we’ve gotten that prerequisite out of the way and identified the chipset all that’s left to do is to find the actual firmware and modify it.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-actual-binaries">Finding the actual binaries</h2>
<p>The Tozo application is my first lead. When you connect your earbuds to the Tozo app, it displays the firmware version and whether or not it’s “current”. So it must talk to a server somewhere, which knows what the latest version of the firmware is:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/tozo_app_current.png" alt="Tozo&amp;rsquo;s app displaying the current firmware version." width="33%"><figcaption>
            <p>Tozo’s app displaying the current firmware version.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In theory, I could probably just read through the decompiled code in jadx or something until I find out what servers it’s talking to, how, and what it does when it checks for updates (such as, presumably, downloading the firmware files I’m looking for). But that’s a lot of work, so I have a better idea - when the app checks if the firmware is up to date, it might also make API requests that could shed some light on where to find the actual firmware files. It might even be able to be tricked into trying to update, which would also lead me to the right URLs. So some quick and dirty “dynamic analysis” via traffic interception is the logical next step.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-an-intercepting-proxy">Setting up an intercepting proxy</h2>
<p>To this end I set up an intercepting proxy using my wireless NIC with hostapd and mitmproxy, and patched the Tozo app with apktool + uber apk signer so that it’ll let us strip the TLS and snoop on its raw network traffic.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Patching the APK is pretty standard stuff - I just followed <a href="https://gist.github.com/unoexperto/80694ccaed6dadc304ad5b8196cbbd2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this gist</a>. The idea is that Android applications have two CA stores, one that can be easily modified by the user, and one that can’t, and by default most Android apps only check TLS certificates against the latter. But, by patching the APK, we can tell it to use the former too, which is where we put our mitmproxy-provided TLS certificate that we’re going to use to snoop on all of the network traffic used by our app. Then we have to sign it so Android will deal with it.</p>
<p>The intercepting proxy setup was pretty straightforward - just set up the AP, set up some iptables rules to direct traffic to mitmproxy’s listening port, and do the typical NAT song and dance:</p>

<p>Once it was all working, I saw that when I connected the device to the app and the “current” string popped up next to the firmware version, it made a request to an endpoint /api/v1/getOtaVersionV3. And, lo and behold, the response contains links to all of the firmware bins we’re looking for! How nice. No trickery needed.</p>

<h2 id="analyzing-the-firmware">Analyzing the firmware</h2>
<p>There are four files, two per earbud, each having a “FotaPackage” and a “FileSystemImage”. The two filesystem images are identical, so we wind up with three distinct files - two fotapackages for L and R earbuds, and the filesystem image.</p>
<p>The first thing anybody does when they get a weird file is, they run the Linux command “file” on it, to see if it has a magic number that indicates its file format:</p>

            <p>Unhelpful.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>…and, if that doesn’t help, they might run strings or hexdump over it, to see if there’s any interesting human-readable ASCII strings in it:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_strings_rofs.png" alt="From the filesystem image - some filenames, at least." width="92%"><figcaption>
            <p>From the filesystem image - some filenames, at least.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>and then binwalk to see if there’s any files embedded in it:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_binwalk.png" alt="The LZ4 region contains the NVROM, which isn&amp;rsquo;t useful to us - it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any audio files." width="92%"><figcaption>
            <p>The LZ4 region contains the NVROM, which isn’t useful to us - it doesn’t contain any audio files.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, binwalk didn’t find anything, even the mp3 files whose filenames are referenced directly in the image. They are indeed in there, it’s just that the mp3 file format is just not very easy to carve out of arbitrary binary data because it doesn’t have any kind of magic number (it can start with either 0xFFFF or 0xFFFE, neither of which are particularly distinctive, and there’s no footer). So even though you can tell they’re in there, it’s not immediately obvious how to unambiguously calculate the offset and length for each mp3 file. So, I decided the best way to figure this out would be to decipher the filesystem image format, which probably has information that tells you where each file begins and ends.</p>
<h2 id="entropy-analysis">Entropy analysis</h2>
<p>The next step for this is entropy analysis. This basically tells you what parts of a file are constant (0x00 or 0xFF are popular bytes for this), which parts resemble random noise, which parts are valid ASCII text, and the offsets at which one of those things changes into another. It’s useful because it sometimes lets you visualize the structure of something without actually knowing anything about it.</p>
<p>The filesystem image looked promising (generated with <a href="http://binvis.io/%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://binvis.io/)</a>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_binvisio_entropy_rofs.png" alt="It does some grouping of the data into blocks to make the structure more visible, so it&amp;rsquo;s not row-by-row like you might expect." width="10%"><figcaption>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Unfortunately, the FotaPackage files however were obviously encrypted or compressed somehow:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_binwalk_entropy_l.png" alt="It&amp;rsquo;s not looking good." width="92%"><figcaption>
            <p>It’s not looking good.</p>

            <p>Oof.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also noticed that the left and right FotaPackage binaries had some curious differences - their headers only differed sporadically, while the body was identical except for the end, where there was about 7KB of complete difference.</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_binwalk_lr_diff_start.png" alt="The header (0x00-0x1000) appears to be unencrypted and only differs in small segments." width="92%"><figcaption>
            <p>The header (0x00-0x1000) appears to be unencrypted and only differs in small segments.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_binwalk_lr_diff_end.png" alt="Then, at the end, the footer suddenly changes to completely different, at around 0xC4E38." width="92%"><figcaption>
            <p>Then, at the end, the footer suddenly changes to completely different, at around 0xC4E38.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I wasn’t completely sure as to the meaning of this, beyond the fact that there was obviously some kind of opaque transformation at work. My initial guess was encryption, with the same key/IV but different plaintexts, and that the sudden difference corresponds to a single-byte difference (perhaps an #ifdef EARBUD_R doBluetoothMasterThings(); #else doBluetoothSlaveThings(); #endif sort of thing) that then leads to the rest of the file being different, but I wasn’t able to verify this. Regardless of why, it was obvious I wasn’t going to get anything out of them without serious effort.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-appraisal-of-the-situation">A quick appraisal of the situation</h2>
<p>The fact that we know the audio is mp3 was actually pretty bad news to me at first glance. My understanding of media encoders is that they generally have a lot of options for how to encode something, while sometimes a given decoder will barf on a perfectly well-formed file that happens to use a feature it wasn’t expecting.</p>
<p>This is very bad for us for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Our decoder is of utterly unknown provenance, who knows what it might barf on.</li>
<li>The audio gets played right when the device first pairs, so if we produce an mp3 file that the decoder does not like and the device crashes before we can connect to it again, then we risk putting it into an unrecoverable state.</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, even if we use precisely the expected encoding parameters while producing our volume-adjusted mp3 files, if we change the length of the file while modifying it then we must also make sure that we account for this when we modify the filesystem image, where what that specifically means depends on the exact structure of the filesystem format. Presumably, it records the length of each file somewhere, and we need to make sure we adjust this number to accurately refect the new length of the file (or else it will either be truncated or have garbage added to the end). This is a lot of work, and with an uncertain outcome.</p>
<p>So, at this point I was somewhat worried about the future of this project, and was desperately trying to figure out how to proceed without any re-encoding.</p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that you can indeed modify the volume (or “gain”) of an mp3 file without changing its length, or re-encoding it, or even modifying its metadata. It’s kind of like how you can rotate a JPEG file without re-encoding it as well - you can just look inside of its data structures and modify them for this one particular transformation without needing to change anything else. Pretty neat!</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/mp3_binwalk_gainadjusted.png" alt="An mp3 file transformed with mp3gain - see, only a few bytes of difference." width="75%"><figcaption>
            <p>An mp3 file transformed with mp3gain - see, only a few bytes of difference.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="rofs">ROFS</h2>
<p>Back to the filesystem image - it seems to contain the mp3 files that correspond to the sounds I am trying to enquiet, and I want to replace them with modified versions, so at a bare minimum I need to know where files begin and end inside of the image. At this point, binwalk couldn’t identify them, so I thought that the problem was that either they were either obfuscated somehow (compressed/encrypted) or the structure of the filesystem might be making it difficult to identify them. So, I decided that the next point of attack was to understand the structure of the filesystem image, which begins with the ASCII string “ROFS”:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/fw_hexdump_rofs.png" alt="Hexdump of ROFS image." width="50%"><figcaption>
            <p>Hexdump of ROFS image.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The first step is to search for information about anything with that name online, but no dice. I’m pretty sure it’s bespoke to this particular chipset manufacturer, as I was completely unable to find any reference or documentation of something called “ROFS” that would describe the file I have and the Airoha SDK I would later find contains an implementation of an interface for reading files from it.</p>
<p>At this point, I made a somewhat regrettable decision that the next course of action was to try to attack the firmware, so that I could get to the code that presumably understands the filesystem image format. But the firmware code was (seemingly) encrypted, so I decided to see if they were doing something silly with their encryption and check if maybe the FotaPackage files were decrypted client-side by the SDK before being sent out over the wire. I was eventually able to ascertain with some certainty that the SDK does not transform the firmware in any way before sending it out, but it took me a few hours of reading decompiled code before I came to this conclusion. So of course, I didn’t succeed in attacking the firmware crypto and it was all a waste of time. Oh well.</p>
<h2 id="sdk-breakthrough">SDK Breakthrough</h2>
<p>The final breakthrough occurred when I searched for the chipset name online, and found a copy of their SDK. Looking through it, I could see that it had a bunch of .mp3 files in it - the same ones I could hear on the device. I wrote a quick python program to check if a file was contained within another file (probably a tool already exists for this?) and verified that the mp3 files in the SDK were contained in the filesystem image verbatim.</p>

<h2 id="modifying-the-filesystem-image">Modifying the filesystem image</h2>
<p>I was slightly worried that the ROFS image might contain additional data, such as checksums for the files inside of it, but I briefly skimmed the ROFS-related code from the SDK (unfortunately it only seemed to exist as prebuilt object files) and it only had a few symbols in it for operating on the filesystem, none of which suggested the presence of checksumming:</p>
<figure><img src="https://blog.ornx.net/post/bluetooth-volume-fix/ghidra_rofs_obj_symboltable.png" alt="There&amp;rsquo;s not a lot of code in here, and there&amp;rsquo;s no external references to anything relating to checksumming." width="92%"><figcaption>
            <p>There’s not a lot of code in here, and there’s no external references to anything relating to checksumming.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So with that out of the way, at this point I actually have everything I need to complete the task of modifying the volume of the sound files in the firmware image with no further reverse engineering. I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A way to flash updated firmware to the device, as well as the firmware files themselves.</li>
<li>Knowledge that the mp3 files from the SDK are included verbatim in the filesystem image (no compression, splitting into blocks, etc). This means I have their lengths and offsets in the filesystem image.</li>
<li>Knowledge that you can modify the gain of an mp3 file without re-encoding it or changing its length.</li>
<li>The assumption that the filesystem format doesn’t include any checksumming or additional information about its files that would be invalidated upon modifying their occupant byte range in the image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, it’s just as simple as looping over the mp3 files, and if it’s contained in the image, running mp3gain on the file and then replacing it in the image with the gain-modified version. I used an adjustment of -19.5 decibels.</p>

<p>I shortly verified that the device was fully operational and the sound was, indeed, much quieter than it was when I started.</p>
<p>Mission accomplished!</p>
<h2 id="thats-a-wrap">That’s a wrap!</h2>
<p>I didn’t end up having to decrypt the firmware (probably impossible for me) or understand the ROFS image format at all - most of the time spent reverse-engineering was actually going down rabbitholes that didn’t help me in the end.</p>
<p>I also kind of wish that volume control of system sounds was a first-class feature - from a UI perspective, I think it’s an error for a device that plays audio to not have a volume control that modifies all of the sound that gets produced by the device. But apparently it has a workaround, so I guess it’s fine.</p>
<p>But yeah, all in all this was a pretty fun little project, would do again/10.</p>

But having the barcode is far more convenient, and I’d like to have it without having to keep yet another plastic card I rarely use in my wallet.</p><p>So I put it on my phone, in my iPhone’s Wallet app. This became extremely silly extremely quickly, so I’ve decided to document it here for myself and others.</p><h2>A brief introduction to passes</h2><p>The Wallet app can manage many things: payment cards, government/employee/student IDs, house/car/hotel room keys; none of these were part of what Wallet, initially called Passbook, could do at its 2012 launch. At that time, Passbook only managed “passes”.</p><p><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/index.html">Apple’s documentation on passes</a> covers this in more detail, but they are self-contained zip files full of JSON and PNGs designed to be distributed through email or the web from a vendor to its user. If you have a pass on your phone, you can usually go to Pass Details and find a share icon in the top right, allowing you to send the .pkpass file to somewhere you can unzip it and inspect it.</p><p>The contents are pretty simple. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH4-SW52">There’s a specific list of supported images</a>, there’s a <code>pass.json</code> file which describes all of the non-image content of the pass, there’s a <code>manifest.json</code> file which lists the SHA-1 checksum of all the other files, and a <code>signature</code> which is an S/MIME signature of the contents of the <code>manifest.json</code>.</p><p>Our first interesting problem is one of barcode formats. Passes support four types of barcodes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR code</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF417">PDF417</a> (commonly used on United States driver licenses), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_Code">Aztec Code</a> (used for boarding passes by the airline industry), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128">Code 128</a> (the only supported linear symbology). My library card uses… <em>[stares at Wikipedia for half an hour]</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codabar">Codabar</a>, widely used in libraries<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-blood" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-blood">1</a></sup>, and perhaps one of the cutest barcode symbologies (and names) I’ve ever seen. It’s possible that the barcode scanners at the library support other linear symbologies, but Codabar is the only one I know guaranteed to work at all of them. So we will need to fake it by providing some image that functions as a scannable barcode.</p><p>Our second interesting problem, which is a much worse, “oh no”-level problem: for some reason, passes are cryptographically signed, and they have to be signed with a key known to one of Apple’s certificate authorities. Cryptographically signing these files makes some sense when you consider that passes were designed to get automatic updates from their vendors; for example, your boarding pass for a flight reflecting gate changes or changing your seat assignment.</p><p>If you are already an Apple developer you can get yourself a pass signing key pretty trivially, but I am not, and I do not intend to drop $99 on this.</p><h2>Perfection is the enemy of something or other</h2><p>There are other people who are already Apple developers who have made various apps for designing passes. They are… passable? Unfortunately I am a perfectionist.</p><p>For one thing, there is the matter of the logo in the top left of the pass. Apple has designed this somewhat flexibly, with a maximum height of 50 device-independent pixels, but a square logo with text to the right side is going to most comfortably fit at about 40 pixels tall. Pass developers are expected to provide correctly-sized logos at <code>logo.png</code>, <code>logo@2x.png</code>, <code>logo@3x.png</code><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-1">2</a></sup> for different device pixel ratios, but these apps tend to let you select a single logo and not give you any control over how it’s scaled. If you give it a 40-pixel image, it’ll be blurry on any currently-supported iPhone; if you give it an 80-pixel image, it’ll be too large. Not great!</p><p>For another thing, I’d really like to have the screen be brighter as I open the pass. Passes with normal, supported barcodes do this to support scanners that need better contrast. To me, the ideal situation here is to trick iOS into making the screen brighter without actually having a non-functional barcode present. I’m not going to be able to get away with this kind of JSON fuzzing without digging into the JSON myself.</p><p>And, these apps tend to be free to download, but only let you save a limited number of passes to Wallet before asking you to pay up. I am not here to judge the developers for doing this but I am probably also not going to pay for your app unless it does what I want it to (and unfortunately what I want is kind of extreme).</p><h2>Finding a key</h2><p>Well, I did just download half a dozen free-to-start pass generator apps.</p><p>You could make these one of two ways. Probably the “correct” way is to have some web service which performs the signing, so that you don’t ship a private key with the application itself. But surely one of these apps I’ve downloaded lets you generate passes offline? Sometimes you want the app to work without having to also maintain a web service; that sounds like a one-way ticket to dealing with a ton of bad reviews and refunds when it inevitably goes down.</p><p>I turned on Airplane Mode, turned off WiFi, and tried them all. Sure enough, at least one does. I’m not going to draw attention to the specific app I used in this post because I don’t want their key to get revoked<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-footnote-ref="" id="user-content-fnref-2">3</a></sup>. But it was kind of funny how simple the process was:</p><ol><li>Download the app on my Mac, since Apple silicon Macs let you run iOS apps.</li><li>In the wrapped iOS app bundle, observe that there is a very obvious <code>.p12</code> file.</li><li>Run <code>strings</code> on the main binary and look for anything that might be a password (as PKCS#12 files require an import password).</li></ol><p>And, well:</p><pre><code>$ openssl pkcs12 -info -in [redacted].p12 -legacy -nodes
Enter Import Password:
MAC: sha1, Iteration 1

...
</code></pre><p>We also need a certificate chain; this certificate is signed with an intermediate. The app needs it too, so it’s probably somewhere in the bundle, but the certificate contains within its X.509 extension fields the URL to download the intermediate if you need it (you can view a certificate’s various fields with <code>openssl x509 -noout -text -in whatever.pem</code>).</p><h2>Laying out the pass</h2><p>First we need to pick a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/Creating.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012195-CH4-SW45">pass style</a> out of “boarding pass”, “coupon”, “event ticket”, “generic”, or “store card”. We want a layout that lets us put a large horizontal image across the pass somewhere. This limits us to layouts that support the “strip” image: coupon, event ticket, or store card. Out of these three, the store card is most skeuomorphic to our physical library card.</p><p>Let’s type up the start of a <code>pass.json</code>.

</code></pre><p>The <code>passTypeIdentifier</code> and <code>teamIdentifier</code> must match the <code>UID</code> and <code>OU</code> fields, respectively, of the certificate subject you got from Apple and/or found lying around. <code>serialNumber</code> needs to be unique for each pass you generate with the same <code>passTypeIdentifier</code>. <code>organizationName</code> is ostensibly supposed to be who made and signed the pass, but if you’re never distributing the pass then it probably doesn’t matter.</p><p>Now for some images. <code>icon.png</code> is required but is not shown on the pass itself. <code>logo.png</code> is the logo displayed at the top left. I generated three logo files: a 40×40 <code>logo.png</code>, an 80×80 <code>logo@2x.png</code>, and a 120×120 <code>logo@3x.png</code>; then I copied <code>logo@3x.png</code> to <code>icon.png</code>.</p><p>Finally, we’ll need the <code>strip.png</code>, which will contain our pre-generated barcode.</p><h2>Generating the barcode</h2><p>Fortunately iOS scales and crops the <code>strip.png</code> we generate to fit whatever size box it is on a device, so we don’t need to worry about making three different versions of it.</p><p>Both my library cards use “A” and “D” as the start and stop symbols. If you already have a barcode scanner handy this is the easiest way to figure out what your start and stop symbols are, but you can also compare the beginning and end of the barcode against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codabar#Encoding">the symbology table on Wikipedia</a> by eye pretty easily.</p><p>There aren’t many ready-to-use Codabar generators online, but the format is pretty simple to implement yourself. While prototyping I used <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/barcoders">the Barcoders library for Rust</a> to generate an SVG, then tweaked the SVG and exported a PNG. After some experimentation I settled on the following layout (where 1 unit is the width of a narrow bar):</p><ul><li>The barcode height is, in units, twice the number of total symbols (including the start and stop symbols) in the barcode. (For example: a 13-digit barcode number is 15 symbols, and so I made my barcode height 30 units tall.)</li><li>15 units of quiet space is placed before the start and after the end of the barcode. (Various reader documentation I’ve seen suggests 10 units is sufficient but I had a harder time scanning it with my fancy 2D barcode scanner.)</li><li>50 units of padding are placed above and below the barcode. This is overkill, but helps ensure the image is cropped on the top and bottom, not on the left and right.</li><li>Each unit is scaled up to 8 pixels to ensure iOS is always scaling the image down. (This makes the final image size 1040 pixels tall and, for my example 15-symbol barcode, the barcode 240 pixels tall.)</li></ul><p>Codabar has such a simple encoding that I felt an overwhelming urge to write a 69-line shell script that generates a bitmap of an encoded Codabar barcode in the above layout:</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>#!/usr/bin/env bash</span>

</code></pre><h2>Faking the barcode UX the rest of the way</h2><p>When a user selects a barcoded pass, the phone screen gets brighter to assist with scanners. iOS doesn’t think we have a barcode yet. I hoped that specifying an <em>empty</em> barcode would do the trick, and… yeah! It does! Specifying this in the top level keys of <code>pass.json</code> works:</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>  </span><span>"barcodes"</span><span>: [</span>

<span>    }</span>
<span>  ],</span>
</code></pre><p>It’s the perfect workaround: no barcode is displayed at the bottom of the pass, but the phone acts like there’s a barcode present.</p><h2>Signing and packaging the pass</h2><p>Once all our files are in place, we need to generate the <code>manifest.json</code>, which is an object with filenames as keys and SHA-1 checksums as values. I wrote a terrifying jq filter to generate the manifest for me:</p><pre><code data-syntax-highlighted=""><span>sha1sum</span><span> </span><span>*</span><span>.png</span><span> </span><span>pass.json</span><span> </span><span>|</span><span> </span><span>\</span>

</code></pre><p>macOS comes with a pass previewer tool, so you can open this pass to check that it is valid and mostly looks right. (If it’s not valid, look for an error in Console.app.) The previewer isn’t 100% accurate, but it does have a button to send it to your phone via iCloud, which is pretty cool. You can also get it onto your phone in whatever manner is convenient.</p><figure><p><img alt="The final pass, which displays a logo, the text &quot;The Seattle Public Library&quot;, a barcode, and an obviously fake barcode number under it." src="https://iliana.fyi/blog/ios-wallet-library-card/pass.png"></p><figcaption>Not my real card number, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>I will note that I have not yet tested this pass in a real library yet, but my barcode scanner can read it off my phone just as well as it can read it from my physical plastic card if I turn the screen brightness all the way up (yes, even further than the zero-length barcode workaround causes the screen to get brighter).</p><h2>Closing thoughts</h2><p>I think it’s pretty neat that the pass specification has remained pretty much unchanged in a decade.

<p dir="auto">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines powered by large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for building end-to-end question answering systems. Frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index">LlamaIndex</a> and <a href="https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack">Haystack</a> have made significant progress in making RAG pipelines easy to use. While these frameworks provide excellent abstractions for building advanced RAG pipelines, they do so at the cost of transparency. From a user perspective, it's not readily apparent what's going on under the hood, particularly when errors or inconsistencies arise.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this <a href="https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb">EvaDB</a> application, we'll shed light on the inner workings of advanced RAG pipelines by examining the mechanics, limitations, and costs that often remain opaque.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-rag-overview" dir="auto"><a href="#rag-overview">RAG Overview</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge AI paradigm for LLM-based question answering.
A RAG pipeline typically contains:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Data Warehouse</strong> - A collection of data sources (e.g., documents, tables etc.) that contain information relevant to the question answering task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Vector Retrieval</strong> - Given a question, find the top K most similar data chunks to the question. This is done using a vector store (e.g., <a href="https://faiss.ai/index.html" rel="nofollow">Faiss</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Response Generation</strong> - Given the top K most similar data chunks, generate a response using a large language model (e.g. GPT-4).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">RAG provides two key advantages over traditional LLM-based question answering:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Up-to-date information</strong> - The data warehouse can be updated in real-time, so the information is always up-to-date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Source tracking</strong> - RAG provides clear traceability, enabling users to identify the sources of information, which is crucial for accuracy verification and mitigating LLM hallucinations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-building-advanced-rag-pipelines" dir="auto"><a href="#building-advanced-rag-pipelines">Building advanced RAG Pipelines</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To enable answering more complex questions, recent AI frameworks like LlamaIndex have introduced more advanced abstractions such as the <a href="https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine.html" rel="nofollow">Sub-question Query Engine</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this application, we'll demystify sophisticated RAG pipelines by using the Sub-question Query Engine as an example. We'll examine the inner workings of the Sub-question Query Engine and simplify the abstractions to their core components. We'll also identify some challenges associated with advanced RAG pipelines.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-the-setup" dir="auto"><a href="#the-setup">The setup</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">A data warehouse is a collection of data sources (e.g., documents, tables etc.) that contain information relevant to the question answering task.</p>
<p dir="auto">In this example, we'll use a simple data warehouse containing multiple Wikipedia articles for different popular cities, inspired by LlamaIndex's <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/index_structs/doc_summary/DocSummary.html" rel="nofollow">illustrative use-case</a>. Each city's wiki is a separate data source. Note that for simplicity, we limit each document's size to fit within the LLM context limit.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our goal is to build a system that can answer questions like:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><em>"What is the population of Chicago?"</em></li>
<li><em>"Give me a summary of the positive aspects of Atlanta."</em></li>
<li><em>"Which city has the highest population?"</em></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">As you can see, the questions can be simple factoid/summarization questions over a single data source (Q1/Q2) or complex factoid/summarization questions over multiple data sources (Q3).</p>
<p dir="auto">We have the following <em>retrieval methods</em> at our disposal:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>vector retrieval</strong> - Given a question and a data source, generate an LLM response using the top-K most similar data chunks to the question from the data source as the context. We use the off-the-shelf FAISS vector index from <a href="https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb">EvaDB</a> for vector retrieval. However, the concepts are applicable to any vector index.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>summary retrieval</strong> - Given a summary question and a data source, generate an LLM response using the entire data source as context.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-the-secret-sauce" dir="auto"><a href="#the-secret-sauce">The secret sauce</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Our key insight is that each component in an advanced RAG pipeline is powered by a single LLM call. The entire pipeline is a series of LLM calls with carefully crafted prompt templates. These prompt templates are the secret sauce that enable advanced RAG pipelines to perform complex tasks.</p>
<p dir="auto">In fact, any advanced RAG pipeline can be broken down into a series of individual LLM calls that follow a universal input pattern:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pchunduri6/rag-demystified/blob/main/images/equation.png"><img src="https://github.com/pchunduri6/rag-demystified/raw/main/images/equation.png" alt="equation"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">where:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Prompt Template</strong> - A curated prompt template for the specific task (e.g., sub-question generation, summarization)</li>
<li><strong>Context</strong> - The context to use to perform the task (e.g. top-K most similar data chunks)</li>
<li><strong>Question</strong> - The question to answer</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Now, we illustrate this principle by examining the inner workings of the Sub-question Query Engine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Sub-question Query Engine has to perform three tasks:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Sub-question generation</strong> - Given a complex question, break it down into a set of sub-questions, while identifying the appropriate data source and retrieval function for each sub-question.</li>
<li><strong>Vector/Summary Retrieval</strong> - For each sub-question, use the chosen retrieval function over the corresponding data source to retrieve the relevant information.</li>
<li><strong>Response Aggregation</strong> - Aggregate the responses from the sub-questions into a final response.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Let's examine each task in detail.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-task-1-sub-question-generation" dir="auto"><a href="#task-1-sub-question-generation">Task 1: Sub-question Generation</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Our goal is to break down a complex question into a set of sub-questions, while identifying the appropriate data source and retrieval function for each sub-question. For example, the question <em>"Which city has the highest population?"</em> is broken down into five sub-questions, one for each city, of the form <em>"What is the population of {city}?".</em> The data source for each sub-question has to be the corresponding city's wiki, and the retrieval function has to be vector retrieval.</p>
<p dir="auto">At first glance, this seems like a daunting task. Specifically, we need to answer the following questions:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>How do we know which sub-questions to generate?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How do we know which data source to use for each sub-question?</strong></li>
<li><strong>How do we know which retrieval function to use for each sub-question?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Remarkably, the answer to all three questions is the same - a single LLM call! The entire sub-question query engine is powered by a single LLM call with a carefully crafted prompt template. Let's call this template the <strong>Sub-question Prompt Template</strong>.</p>

<p dir="auto">For each sub-question, we use the chosen retrieval function over the corresponding data source to retrieve the relevant information.

<p dir="auto">For both retrieval methods, we use the same LLM prompt template. In fact, we find that the popular <strong>RAG Prompt</strong> from <a href="https://smith.langchain.com/hub" rel="nofollow">LangchainHub</a> works great out-of-the-box for this step.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-challenges" dir="auto"><a href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Now that we've demystified the inner workings of advanced RAG pipelines, let's examine the challenges associated with them.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Question sensitivity</strong> - The biggest challenge that we observed with these systems is the question sensitivity. The LLMs are extremely sensitive to the user question, and the pipeline fails unexpectedly for several user questions. Here are a few example failure cases that we encountered:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Incorrect sub-questions</strong> - The LLM sometimes generates incorrect sub-questions. For example, <em>"Which city has the highest number of tech companies?"</em> is broken down into <em>"What are the tech companies in each city?"</em> 5 times (once for each city) instead of <em>"What is the number of tech companies in Toronto?"</em>, <em>"What is the number of tech companies in Chicago?"</em>, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect retrieval function</strong> - <em>"Summarize the positive aspects of Atlanta and Toronto."</em> results in using the vector retrieval function instead of the summary retrieval method.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">We had to put in significant effort into prompt engineering to get the pipeline to work for each question. This is a significant challenge for building robust systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">To verify this behavior, we <a href="https://github.com/pchunduri6/rag-demystified/blob/main/llama_index_baseline.py">implemented the example</a> using the LlamaIndex Sub-question query engine. Consistent with our observations, the system often generates the wrong sub-questions and also uses the wrong retrieval function for the sub-questions, as shown below.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pchunduri6/rag-demystified/blob/main/images/baseline.png"><img src="https://github.com/pchunduri6/rag-demystified/raw/main/images/baseline.png" alt="llama_index_baseline"></a></p>
<ol start="2" dir="auto">
<li><strong>Cost</strong> - The second challenge is the cost dynamics of advanced RAG pipelines. The issue is two-fold:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Cost sensitivity</strong> - The final cost of the question is dependent on the number of sub-questions generated, the retrieval function used, and the number of data sources queried. Since the LLMs are sensitive to the prompt, the cost of the question can vary significantly depending on the question and the LLM output. For example, the incorrect model choice in the LlamaIndex baseline example above (<code>summary_tool</code>) results in a 3x higher cost compared to the <code>vector_tool</code> while also generating an incorrect response.</li>
<li><strong>Cost estimation</strong> - Advanced abstractions in RAG frameworks obscure the estimated cost of the question. Setting up a cost monitoring system is challenging since the cost of the question is dependent on the LLM output.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-conclusion" dir="auto"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Advanced RAG pipelines powered by LLMs have revolutionized question-answering systems.
However, as we have seen, these pipelines are not turnkey solutions. Under the hood, they rely on carefully engineered prompt templates and multiple chained LLM calls. As illustrated in this <a href="https://github.com/georgia-tech-db/evadb">EvaDB</a> application, these pipelines can be question-sensitive, brittle, and opaque in their cost dynamics. Understanding these intricacies is key to leveraging their full potential and paving the way for more robust and efficient systems in the future.</p>

<p>The astonishing story of how a movement’s quest for rural simplicity drifted into a formula for mass death</p>



<p>By George Monbiot, published on monbiot.com, 4<sup>th</sup> October 2023</p>



<div><p>Tourism sells to you the story of what it has taken away. It markets the “traditional” and “unchanging” and, in doing so, changes it. As the old joke goes, “come to this beautiful unspoiled island and spoil it.” The clock starts ticking from the moment the first person says “timeless”. Then everything that is celebrated starts to become the shadow of itself.</p><p>Similarly, food and farming, industries now intimately connected in some places with tourism, are caught in the endless tension between their reality and their representation. As soon as a region becomes celebrated for its food, gastrotourism accelerates its gentrification. Soon the old <em>boulangeries</em>, <em>boucheries</em> and <em>fromageries</em> are replaced with boutiques selling home decor and handbags. Then a new wave of specialist food shops appears among them, selling the old produce at boutique prices, prices that double with every adjective and place name.</p></div>



<p>The products are real but the stories that surround them – the autochthonous peasant economy, the weathered subsistence among woods and meadows – are vitiated by their telling. The tourist dollars they attract internationalise the local economy. They convert the barns and sheds where cows were kept, grapes were pressed, honey was strained into Airbnbs or second homes. Pastures on the valley floor become glamping sites or pony paddocks. The money generated by the myth of timelessness draws local people away from the sparse living the labels revere.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, to keep pace with gastronomic demand, farming relentlessly intensifies. In the famous cheesemaking regions of France, you will scarcely see a dairy cow. Instead, vast tracts are cultivated for maize. Passing tourists romantically assume it’s sweetcorn for human consumption – the French must eat a lot of sweetcorn! No, it will be turned into silage to feed the cattle stalled in the vast steel sheds – cow factories – that have sprung up from Brittany to Savoie, a business as brutal and industrial as any other. Milk is trucked across hundreds of kilometres, trade fairs market the cheese from Dubai to Shanghai.</p>



<p>The further the cycle of intensification turns, the longer the teleconnections of the “local” economy, the more bucolic and homely the marketing becomes: close-ups of cracked and dirt-grained hands, chickens clucking through buttercupped meadows, girls in Heidi costumes and all the other autophagous nonsense of the Spectacle.</p>



<h3>The Spectacle of Production</h3>



<p>To seek to reverse such economies of scale is not a relaxation into a “simpler” mode, but a conscious and frantic race against entropy. Fair play to those who succeed! We need, among others, small local producers, ideally using new forms of high-yield agroecology. But it’s not for the faint-hearted. They are running up the down escalator, and it accelerates every year. Land prices, house rents, low farmgate prices, easier and more rewarding opportunities elsewhere all militate against survival in the new-old economy, let alone success. And you are always in danger (a danger, admittedly, that some embrace) of becoming your own trope, the re-created peasant self-marketed to the gluttonous Spectacle.</p>



<p>Of course, we all re-create ourselves to some extent. We are all self-consumers. But self-creation is seldom more intense than in sectors deemed “authentic”.</p>



<p>Bucolic re-creations bear little relation to the things they claim to be. What we now fetishise as “peasant food” is much richer and more diverse than the food peasants would once have eaten, except, perhaps, on feast days. Meat was, for most, a luxury, cheese eaten less often than we imagine, salads, in many places, not at all. Diets were often inadequate and deficient in crucial components, such as protein. This is one of the reasons – alongside other aspects of health – why the rustic ancestors we celebrate were, on average, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1570677X10000225">tiny by comparison</a> to us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the “traditional” ingredients considered essential to the cuisine – such as tomatoes in Italy or peppers in Spain – were unknown until surprisingly recently to those whose diets we claim to honour. Much of the protein, insufficient as it was, came not from cheese and meat but from what we now call dhal. It had names (to give some English examples) like pease pottage, pease pudding, mushy peas and pea soup. Few of these dishes are celebrated by gastronomes today. As George Crabbe remarked in <em>The Village</em>, written in 1783, such food was</p>



<p>“Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, such</p>



<p>&nbsp;As you who envy would disdain to touch.”</p>



<p>But, to the wealthy people spending lavishly on what they fondly imagine to be peasant diets, every day is a feast day.</p>



<h3>Lands of Plenty</h3>



<p>We benefit above all from a different legacy: the marvel of the past 50 years of falling hunger during a time of rising population, a marvel we in the rich world scarcely acknowledge, so comfortable has it made us. This remarkable phenomenon was widely considered, just 60 or 70 years ago, simply impossible.</p>



<p>There are three things upon which I think we can all agree. First, that this marvel came at a great environmental cost. It was delivered through hungry and thirsty new crop varieties, reliant for their survival on lashings of agrochemicals, unsustainable water use and practices that can accelerate soil degradation. Second, that it also involved severe social and political dislocations, including land-grabbing, enclosures and rising corporate power and concentration. Third, that it might now be running out of road: the <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/CC3017EN/online/CC3017EN.html">prevalence of global undernourishment</a> rose from 613 million (median estimate) in 2019 to 735 million in 2022.</p>



<p>The immediate reasons for this partial reversal are the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but there are also three deeper and increasingly urgent issues: the decline of crucial resources, such as soil and water, environmental shocks hammering farm production, and the global food chain’s <a href="https://www.monbiot.com/2023/03/09/the-hunger-gap/">loss of systemic resilience</a>.</p>



<p>So the question – one of the key questions of our time – is how we can feed a population likely to rise to 9 or 10 billion by the middle of the century before starting to decline, reliably, equitably and at a much lower environmental cost. In other words, how we might feed the world without devouring the planet, the subject of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/317018/regenesis-by-monbiot-george/9780241447642">my book <em>Regenesis</em></a>.</p>



<p>There are, as I found, plenty of possible ways forward. But there are no ways backward. If we were to seek to restore the agricultural systems of, say, 60 or 70 years ago, a time, remember, when many people were deeply pessimistic about human nutrition and expected global starvation as the population rose, their grim predictions would materialise. Why? Because productivity was much lower than it is today. In 2023, a world of 8.1 billion people suffers far less hunger and famine than the world of 3.2 billion did in 1963, the year of my birth.</p>



<p>Let’s pause to consider this for a moment, because it is one of the most remarkable (and, bizarrely, least celebrated) transformations of our time.</p>



<p>The numbers who died in famines were especially high in the 1960s, as a result of China’s Great Leap Backwards. An estimated 16.6 million <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/famines#long-term-trends-in-global-famine-mortality">perished during</a> mass starvation events in that decade. This compares to 8.8 million in the 1950s and 3.4 million in the 1970s. But 3.4 million, by comparison to more recent figures, is massive. Between 2010 and 2016, the most recent years in the standardised dataset, 255,000 people died this way, all of them in the famine that afflicted Somalia. Since then, there have been four major famines: in Yemen, South Sudan, Somalia (again) and Tigray, in which, in total, hundreds of thousands died. All four were caused by conflict. Famine is also much less geographically widespread than it used to be: it now tends to be confined to one nation or province at a time, rather than afflicting vast areas.</p>



<p>To grasp just how astonishing this decline in mass death through hunger has been, we need to look at the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2018/03/Famine-death-rate-since-1860s-revised.png">death <em>rate</em> in famines</a> as a proportion of the population. A century ago, the rate stood at 82 per 100,000 people. In the 1930s, it was 56, in the 1940s, 79, the 1950s, 32, the 1960s, 50, the 1970s, 8.4, and on down to the most recent figures: 0.5. At no known point in recorded history has the third horseman wielded less deadly power.</p>



<p>There’s a similar trend in total deaths from malnutrition (in other words not only those that occurred in the mass events known as famines). These fell, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malnutrition-deaths-by-age">on a fairly steady trajectory</a>, from 656,000 in 1990 to 212,000 in 2019.</p>



<p>What lies behind these extraordinary trends? There are several reasons, but let me dwell on two of the crucial ones. One is the much greater availability of food per person. This is also a remarkable phenomenon. <em>Our World in Data</em>, which collates such global figures, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/yields-vs-land-use-how-has-the-world-produced-enough-food-for-a-growing-population">shows that</a> between 1961 and 2014 the world’s production of cereals rose by 280%. This is twice the increase in the global population during that period (136%). It was achieved almost entirely through higher crop yields per hectare.</p>



<p>Another is the long-distance transport of food, something that many of us have railed against, but which, for all its downsides, makes an essential contribution to falling rates of hunger. The reason is simple: if there is a bad harvest or outright crop failure in one place, food can now be shifted from regions with a crop surplus, either through trade or through aid and famine relief programmes. The extreme globalisation of the food system has introduced new sets of problems. But without long-distance transport, many more would starve.</p>



<p>Returning to earlier modes of subsistence is a formula for global catastrophe on a scale that defies imagination.</p>



<h3>The Great Divide</h3>



<p>To make these obvious statements is to become the sworn enemy of many food and farming writers, influencers and film-makers (who have a lucrative industry of their own to support). It is to commit the modern equivalent of blasphemy, as food nostalgia inspires semi-religious beliefs.</p>



<p>To make these statements with the support of numbers is to multiply the sin. As I’ve discovered since publishing the book, if there is one habit that incites fury more reliably than any others, it is to put numbers on the problem. Hectares, yields, nutrients, calories, inputs, outputs, costs, emissions, hunger, death: any form of quantification is as welcome in this arena as a tambourine in a Bach sonata.</p>



<p>Why? Because the romantic story of how food “should” be produced is entirely qualitative. It’s an aesthetic reverie. It’s about pictures, poetry, gut feeling – understandable when it comes to food but, literally, lethal when it comes to ensuring everyone has it. It is the great indulgence of those who never miss a meal to celebrate the times and modes in which people missed plenty.</p>



<p>There are two entirely different questions here: “what production systems do certain well-nourished food writers in the rich world want to see?”, and “how might everyone on Earth be fed?”. But, though often leading to very different conclusions, they are endlessly and callously confused with each other.</p>



<p>Fantasising about a food system in which the third horseman would ride victorious again is among the more perverse habits of comfortable people. The anger and passion with which some of them defend their formula for starvation is a wonder to behold. They privilege their aesthetics – their arcadian fantasies – above the wellbeing of 8 billion people.</p>



<p>Perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised: nostalgia is among the most powerful and dangerous of all social forces. Woe betide the person who seeks to disabuse another of their fantasies about the past!</p>



<p>Well, I thought I had seen it all: the full gamut of cruel fantasies which privilege bucolic comfort zones above global necessities. But this was before I read the new book by Chris Smaje, a small farmer and writer with an academic background, called <em><a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/saying-no-to-a-farm-free-future/">Saying No to a Farm-Free Future</a></em>. The book has been praised by a number of prominent food, farming and environmental writers and campaigners, most of whom subscribe to the worldview I have just described. It is becoming something of a bible for their movement. It promotes what appears to be a recipe for mass global starvation.</p>



<p>Before I go any further, I want to emphasise that Chris has every right to write and publish this book. He has been criticised online for fomenting internecine war within left/green circles (as have I). I don’t see it that way. The argument in which he participates is a crucial one, the divisions are real and the debate needs to be had. I believe this is in fact the greatest of all rifts within environmental movements, and we do ourselves no favours by pretending it does not exist. Though his book is framed as an attack on my book <em>Regenesis</em> and, more broadly, on me, I’m glad he has written it. It is highly instructive.</p>



<h3>Mark of the Beast</h3>



<p>Chris launches his attack with labels. Apparently I’m both an “ecomodernist” and an “urbanist”. He fails to define what he means by an ecomodernist. His use of the term would capture anyone who favours new or newish green technologies: solar panels, wind turbines, electrified railways, GIS mapping, induction hobs ….</p>



<p>I <em>do</em> have a definition of ecomodernism:</p>



<p>a movement that treats green technology as a <em>substitute</em> for political and economic change.</p>



<p>I see it in the vision of people like Bill Gates and Ted Nordhaus, a vision <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/13/optimism-climate-predictions-techno-polluters">I strongly oppose</a>. I believe technology is just one of the components of the change we need: necessary but not sufficient. I’ve spent my working life pressing for political and economic change, seeking to dethrone the oligarchs (including Bill Gates) and corporations whose economic and political power impede both democracy and human flourishing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>As for the charge of being an “urbanist”, the only evidence he advances is that a Dutch website calls for 90% of the population to live in cities by 2100. I had nothing to do with this, and the idea appals me as much as it appals Chris. But the way he writes this passage makes it look as if it’s my view: a shocking elision. I was not surprised to see a commentary on his book (since changed at my request) <a href="https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/2023/09/hope-for-a-humane-agricultural-future-a-review-of-saying-no-to-a-farm-free-future/">reporting this terrible idea</a> as “one of Monbiot’s proposals”.</p>



<p>On these fictitious grounds, Chris states that I want a “depopulated countryside”, an “un-peopled” nature, to “eliminate” ruralism, to “keep as many people as possible out of garden-sized or small farm-sized patches in the countryside” and to “concentrat[e] people in the cities as helpless consumers”. I want none of these things. In fact, I strongly oppose them all. I will state my position once more, but with no confidence that he or others will hear it: <em>I do not want to see any depopulation of the countryside.</em></p>



<p>But in one respect, though I have no great enthusiasm for cities, I guess you could call me an urbanist. Why? Because I believe urban populations are a reality that cannot be wished away and, crucially, that they should have food. These, if I’m reading his book correctly, appear to be the two great dividing lines between my vision and Chris’s: I don’t want anyone to have to leave their homes; and I believe urban people need to be fed.</p>



<p>The “ecomodernist” and “urbanist” labels could be seen as the usual cut and thrust of debate: by attaching an alienating definition to someone, you might induce people to stop listening to what they’re saying, and to dismiss their evidence and arguments out of hand. It’s the way certain politicians turn complex and difficult questions into culture war fodder. But as the book goes on, his labelling takes a much darker turn.</p>



<h3>Priced Out</h3>



<p>Chris devotes an entire chapter to inveighing against people (I am, apparently, the archetype), who believe that sustaining high crop yields is a good idea. Apparently, this is “agricultural improver ideology”, which is in turn an “urban-industrial articulation of class power against rural and agrarian people”. Sorry, what?</p>



<p>He explains this contention as follows: “The narrative of agricultural improvement has always had this class element to it – a concern with class improvement for unmanaged farmers as well as agricultural improvement for unmanaged farming.” Yup, that’s the real agenda: a cunning plot to improve farmers’ table manners. My interest in high yields couldn’t possibly be because I worry about how, without them, 8 billion people might be fed.</p>



<p>But this is by no means the end of it. If you believe that enough food should be grown to feed &nbsp;everyone, you are also guilty of “productivism”, “consumerism”, even “colonialism”.</p>



<p>This brings us to the issue he carefully swerves throughout the book: that a certain number of people requires a certain amount of food, and this food has both to be produced and to reach those who need it. If there’s not enough food, or it’s not accessible and affordable to everyone, people will starve. It seems extraordinary to have to point this out.</p>



<p>One of the reasons why high yields ensure that more people can be fed is that more supply reduces the price of food, making it more accessible to the poor. Chris flatly rejects this reasoning. He asserts that “Low food prices, high yields and overproduction are absolutely at the root of food system problems, including global poverty and hunger.” He then goes on to make two statements that left my jaw on the floor:</p>



<p>Lower food prices are “the last thing the global poor need. The result is usually more poverty, more hunger”.</p>



<p>and</p>



<p>“Higher food prices might alleviate hunger globally”.</p>



<p>You might have imagined that such astonishing statements would be carefully explained and evidenced. But they are asserted without justification. The closest he gets is to point out that, in countries like the UK, people spend more on housing and energy than they do on food (which is true) and that the cheapness of this food helps the owners of housing and energy to generate more profit, which might be true, but would need some unpacking.</p>



<p>But this says nothing about the situation of the <em>global</em> poor, the subject of those two astonishing statements. So let’s just take a moment.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/global-indicators-on-the-costs-of-healthy-diets-and-how-many-people-can-t-afford-them/en">global definition</a> of an affordable diet is one that costs 52% or less of average household expenditure. Using this definition, 3 billion people – over one-third of the global population – <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/diet-affordability">cannot afford a healthy diet</a>. In other words, buying adequate food would mean spending more on it than on housing, energy, education, health, transport, clothing and all other items put together.</p>



<p>Importantly, the 3 billion below the line include not just urban people and rural people working in the non-agricultural economy, but also many subsistence farmers, some of whom cannot produce enough food, and of sufficient diversity, to meet their nutritional needs.</p>



<p>In some countries, a healthy diet costs more than the median income: even if people spent <em>all</em> their money trying to purchase one, they still couldn’t afford it. Yes, the problem is poverty: a gross maldistribution of wealth. Yes, this maldistribution urgently needs to be addressed, which is why we need political and economic change, not just new technologies. But while I have seen no evidence (and Chris provides none) that higher food prices alleviate global hunger, there is a <a href="https://theconversation.com/further-food-price-rises-could-cause-up-to-1-million-additional-deaths-in-2023-199120">wealth of evidence</a> that they exacerbate it.</p>



<p>Is it really possible that you can write a book on food and farming and fail to grasp this basic fact? Yes, it seems it is. <em>Saying No to a Farm-Free Future</em> is a powerful lesson in how motivated reasoning can lead you to an utterly perverse and ludicrous position.</p>



<h3>Let Them Eat Nothing</h3>



<p>So how does Chris Smaje believe people should be fed? After launching such a ferocious attack on evil bastards like me, you might expect him to produce a clear alternative. But another remarkable aspect of this book, and of the movement it speaks to, is how vague it becomes on such trifling matters as producing sufficient food for 8 billion people. Here are the most specific phrases I could find, while trying to decipher how he proposes that everyone on Earth should be fed.</p>



<p>“Predominantly local self-provisioning of food, fibre and other material requisites of life”</p>



<p>We should “gain autonomy and feed ourselves”</p>



<p>People should “spread themselves out in the landscape and make low energy livelihoods there”</p>



<p>“Repeasantisation, where commercial farmers step off the productivity treadmill and …. orient themselves instead to more autonomous local agricultures geared to local needs”</p>



<p>“We could boost urban food provision by increasing the number of allotments, community gardens, market gardens and truck farms on brownfield sites”</p>



<p>So the question which arises – and please forgive this ecomodernist, urbanist, productivist, consumerist, colonialist framing – is who, in this world of “self-provisioning” and “repeasantised” commercial farmers, will feed those who do not feed themselves?</p>



<p>Most of the places where large numbers of people live do not have sufficient fertile land nearby to support them. A paper in the journal <em>Nature Food</em> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0060-7">found that</a> only a quarter of the world’s people could be fed with staple grain crops grown within 100 kilometres of where they live. The average minimum distance at which the world’s people can be supplied with staple foods, it found, is 2,200 kilometres. Much of the world’s food is grown in vast, lightly-habited lands (US plains, Canadian prairies, Russian steppes etc) and shipped to tight, densely-populated places.</p>



<p>These are the numbers to which people of Chris’s persuasion most furiously object, even though they have no answer to them. Why? Because the numbers are incompatible with their worldview. They show that, while agrarian localism might be great as far as it goes, it simply cannot, by itself, meet the challenge of feeding the world.</p>



<p>Cities can grow only a tiny fraction of their food, as Chris acknowledges elsewhere in his book. Again, it’s not hard to work out why. Urban areas occupy only 1% of the planet’s land, and this land is in high demand for other uses. Allotments, community gardens, market gardens and truck farms are wonderful things to have, enhancing urban life, but they can produce only a very small proportion of a city’s demand for fruit and vegetables, and close to none of its staple foods.</p>



<p>While this is predominantly an urban issue, it’s not just big cities which rely on non-local production. There are many areas dominated by smaller settlements which simply do not have the agricultural capacity to feed themselves. Even regions which are blessed with sufficient agricultural land and water could, as has happened many times in the past, see their production wiped out by local harvest failure, ensuring that a world of agrarian localism would, once more, become a world in which famine is ever-present and widespread.</p>



<p>So how will the 4.5 billion people who live in cities – over 60% of the global population – and many others living where there is little fertile land be fed? Answer comes there none. Seriously: in 159 pages there is no explanation of how they would survive. If you’re not an agrarian localist either producing your own food or buying from local growers, you’re stuffed – or rather, starved. If Chris has a plan for feeding you, he hasn’t mentioned it.</p>



<p>Discussing his own, proudly low-yield production of wheat and potatoes, Chris states:</p>



<p>“there’s no point labouring for next to nothing on someone else’s behalf when you’ve already grown enough to eat for yourself.”</p>



<p>This is why farmers who do not share his worldview pursue higher yields: these yields make it economically worthwhile to produce staple foods that can be sold to other people. We should thank our lucky stars for such people.</p>



<h3>“Human Feedlots”</h3>



<p>How did he get to this point? I can’t see into his mind, but part of the reason might be his hatred of cities. He rails against them like an Old Testament prophet denouncing Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>



<p>He describes them as “human feedlots”, a term I find grotesque and dehumanising. They “consume everything around them and then themselves”. They are “built on cheap and abundant energy and models of globalised trade that aren’t destined to endure.”</p>



<p>It is true that cities rely on unsustainable and exploitative models of extraction, consumption and dumping. But this applies to the economy as a whole, urban or otherwise. The answer, I believe, is not to rain curses on them and their people, but to replace the destructive economic models with systems in which everyone’s needs are met without breaching planetary boundaries. This is what Kate Raworth’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/12/doughnut-growth-economics-book-economic-model"><em>Doughnut Economics</em></a> seeks. I believe we can move towards her vision with the help of what I call “<a href="https://centerforneweconomics.org/publications/private-sufficiency-public-luxury-land-is-the-key-to-the-transformation-of-society/">private sufficiency, public luxury</a>”. None of this, of course, magics away the need to produce sufficient food.</p>



<p>If I interpret his airy euphemisms correctly, the question of how urban people should be fed is not worth answering, because cities are soon going to collapse, and their people will have no choice but to “spread themselves out in the landscape”, growing their own “food and fibre, building shelter, producing a modest livelihood from the local ecological base.” (Never mind that in many places the “local ecological base” could support only a small fraction of the region’s people).</p>



<p>When your solution is societal collapse, you should ask yourself some hard questions about what you are trying to solve.</p>



<h3>The Great Cruelty</h3>



<p>I guess there’s a small consolation here: that Chris might have given up on the idea that his <em>xià xiā</em><em>ng</em> – the mass migration to the countryside he envisages – will happen voluntarily. Perhaps he has at last realised that most people have no particular desire to have to grow their own food and fibre, make their own clothes and build their own shelters. Instead, he now appears to believe that urban people will be forced by catastrophe to leave the cities and succumb to “re-ruralisation” and “repeasantisation”. It might be worth noting that the Old Testament prophets also foresaw the imminent collapse of urban life, two and a half thousand years ago.</p>



<p>How mild and gentle he makes it sound! Refugees from the cities “spreading themselves out in the landscape”, “producing a modest livelihood from the local ecological base.” When the fugitives disperse into the countryside, the inhabitants will doubtless greet them with open arms, saying, “Welcome sister! Welcome brother! Here, have some fertile land. Oh, and some water, knowledge, skills, tools, traction and all the other means to grow your own food and live happy lives as re-peasants in our agrarian wonderland.”</p>



<p>If history is any guide, this is not quite how it’s likely to pan out. The more probable outcomes of societal collapse include warlordism or full-scale war, coercion, fascism, slavery, disease, starvation and mass death.</p>



<p>Moreover, if a cataclysm is sufficient to bring the cities down, it is likely also to destroy the basis of much of rural life. After all, the distinctions between the two are not nearly as crisp as Chris would have us believe. In fact, and horrifyingly, it’s likely that, as a result of environmental disaster, rural life in many parts of the world will collapse <em>before</em> urban life does, as suggested by a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-023-01132-6">highly disturbing recent paper</a> in <em>Nature</em>, showing how and where the “human climate niche” is likely to shrink. If anything, we are likely to become more reliant on long-distance transport to deliver our food – a prospect no one, myself included, relishes.</p>



<p>If a catastrophe of the kind Chris envisages – and sometimes appears to yearn – were to materialise, people everywhere are likely to become more desperate. The remaining fertile land and water would be even more valued and fiercely defended than they are today.</p>



<p>To me, Chris’s long-standing plan – to move the people to the food, rather than the food to the people – is a further instance of the Great Cruelty of the past two centuries. The Great Cruelty is common to colonialism, capitalism, communism, Nazism, neoliberalism and all the other conquering and interconnected forces that have dominated thought and action during this period. It can be summarised as follows:</p>



<p>People are counters, to be moved in their millions, as interests or ideology dictate, across the board game called Planet Earth.</p>



<p>It’s consistent with the kind of thinking that characterises cities as “human feedlots”.</p>



<h3>Mysteries and Passions</h3>



<p>But never mind. Whether there is enough food and everyone can afford to eat it is, Chris says, a “secondary goal”. This is because it doesn’t “speak to the mysteries and passions of what animates human (or non-human) life”, which Chris describes as our “primary goals”. In obsessing about “productivity, numbers, yields, costs and so forth”, we “risk missing what makes for the flourishing of humans and other organisms”.</p>



<p>Well, call me old-fashioned, or urbanist, or whatever label you choose to apply to me, but I would say that having enough food is pretty damn primary. In any hierarchy of human needs, it features close to the top. I don’t for a moment deny that mysteries and passions are important to us, or that we need meaning and purpose to lead fulfilling lives, but their pursuit can be somewhat hampered if you are starving to death.</p>



<p>This is the heart of the matter. The particular “mysteries and passions” that appeal to people of Chris’s persuasion come first, and the physical requirements of other humans are secondary: they must either fit in somehow, or fall aside.</p>



<p>There is now a wide movement, some of whose leading figures are quoted on or in Chris’s book, that prioritises its mysteries and passions above other people’s survival to the point at which it promotes the idea of <a href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/confessions-of-a-recovering-environmentalist/">“withdrawing” and “walking away”</a> from the effort to prevent Earth systems collapse. On behalf of the rest of the world, such people grandly proclaim that it’s futile to try to stop the slide. We should give up and “adapt to”, even embrace, whatever awaits.</p>



<p>But there is no “away” to walk to. Ecological and social collapse will find us, wherever we go. What some people <em>can</em> escape is the shared responsibility for facing our multiple crises, and their duty of care towards others.</p>



<p>The acceptance of – sometimes apparent longing for – collapse is among the greatest self-indulgences in human history. It is peculiar to people who are either relatively wealthy and insulated, or have the land and means to grow their own food (or both). It is a variation of the prepper mentality, whose props in this case are not bunkers, bitcoin, tinned food and AR-15s, but hoes, scythes and leather jerkins. (Though these “repeasantised” folk might discover that if the calamity does occur, they’ll also need some heavy weaponry to defend their land and crops).</p>



<p>While the Old Testament prophets had to rely on God’s wrath being visited upon the human feedlots, today the curses have more temporal means of realisation. All we now need do is nothing: let the corporations, the oligarchs and the rising consumer demand that are breaking Earth systems have their way, and some form of collapse is likely to occur, with or without God’s wrath. By deliberately stepping back from the struggle to contain these forces, and even seeking in some cases to dissuade others from participating, they make this possibility more likely.</p>



<p>My belief is that we have no right to grant ourselves this indulgence. Given that rich nations and wealthy people are primarily responsible for the planetary dysbiosis we all face, including the massive burdens the food system imposes on the living world, we all have a duty to engage. Engaging means valuing the lives of others as we value our own. Living on this planet, especially as a member of a privileged society, our lives are intimately bound with the lives of others, including those who live thousands of miles away. We cannot excuse ourselves from the responsibilities we owe to each other. Our aim should be not to use societal collapse as a tool to shape the world to our tastes, but to seek to avert societal collapse.</p>



<h3>Discordant Notes</h3>



<p>There are no perfect solutions in an imperfect world. Everything we might propose, including all the ways forward I suggest in <em>Regenesis</em>, has downsides. We are working in a very tight space, one in which 8 billion people and more need to be fed, within an Earth system whose planetary boundaries have already been breached, to a large extent as a result of food production.</p>



<p>There are no remaining comfort zones. There is no longer – if there ever was – scope for ideological congruence, for solutions that fit snugly into any one worldview. We will find ourselves in disconcerting places. We will be assailed by cognitive dissonance.</p>



<p>In seeking to address our great predicaments, we should be, as much as is humanly possible, open-minded, open-hearted, receptive to evidence, argument and persuasion. The answers, contradictory, incomplete and inadequate as they will always be, will be social, political, economic, organisational <em>and</em> technological. We might not like some of our own conclusions. But it’s not just about us.</p>



<p>When some writers and campaigners, prioritising their own mysteries and passions, appear to treat billions of people as disposable, it should tell us something important: we need to check ourselves. We need to ask what impulses we are following, whether we are really seeking the best outcomes for humanity and the living planet, or simply avoiding cognitive pain. We need, as much as we are able, to set our passions aside.</p>
