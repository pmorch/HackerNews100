<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE) is the culmination of an unprecedented design and engineering effort, spanning half a decade, that combines the unique strengths of Apple silicon hardware with our advanced operating system security to provide industry-first, always-on memory safety protection across our devices — without compromising our best-in-class device performance. We believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.</p>
<hr>
<p>There has never been a successful, widespread malware attack against iPhone. The only system-level iOS attacks we observe in the wild come from mercenary spyware, which is vastly more complex than regular cybercriminal activity and consumer malware. Mercenary spyware is historically associated with state actors and uses exploit chains that cost millions of dollars to target a very small number of specific individuals and their devices. Although the vast majority of users will never be targeted in this way, these exploit chains demonstrate some of the most expensive, complex, and advanced attacker capabilities at any given time and are uniquely deserving of study as we work to protect iPhone users against even the most sophisticated threats. Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry.</p>
<p>For Apple, improving memory safety is a broad effort that includes developing with safe languages and deploying mitigations at scale. (For a primer on how we think about memory safety, see the opening of <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety#memorysafety">this post</a>.) We created Swift, an easy-to-use, memory-safe language, which we employ for new code and targeted component rewrites. In iOS 15, we introduced <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety/">kalloc_type</a>, a secure memory allocator for the kernel, followed in iOS 17 by its user-level counterpart, xzone malloc. These secure allocators take advantage of knowing the type — or purpose — of allocations so that memory can be organized in a way that makes exploiting most memory corruption vulnerabilities inherently difficult.</p>
<p>In 2018, we were the first in the industry to deploy Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) in the A12 Bionic chip, to protect code flow integrity in the presence of memory corruption. The strong success of this defensive mechanism in increasing exploitation complexity left no doubt that the deep integration of software and hardware security would be key to addressing some of our greatest security challenges. With PAC behind us, we immediately began design and evaluation work to find the most effective way to build sophisticated memory safety capabilities right into Apple silicon.</p>
<p>Arm published the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_summer19_03_serebryany.pdf">Memory Tagging Extension (MTE)</a> specification in 2019 as a tool for hardware to help find memory corruption bugs. MTE is, at its core, a memory tagging and tag-checking system, where every memory allocation is tagged with a secret; the hardware guarantees that later requests to access memory are granted only if the request contains the correct secret. If the secrets don’t match, the app crashes, and the event is logged. This allows developers to identify memory corruption bugs immediately as they occur.</p>
<p>We conducted a deep evaluation and research process to determine whether MTE, as designed, would meet our goals for hardware-assisted memory safety. Our analysis found that, when employed as a real-time defensive measure, the original Arm MTE release exhibited weaknesses that were unacceptable to us, and we worked with Arm to address these shortcomings in the new <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109697/0100/Feature-descriptions/The-Armv8-9-architecture-extension?lang=en#md454-the-armv89-architecture-extension__FEAT_MTE4">Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)</a> specification, released in 2022. More importantly, our analysis showed that while EMTE had great potential as specified, a rigorous implementation with deep hardware and operating system support could be a breakthrough that produces an extraordinary new security mechanism.</p>
<p>Consider that MTE can be <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/108035/0100/How-does-MTE-work-/When-to-use-SYNC-and-ASYNC-MTE-modes">configured</a> to report memory corruption either synchronously or asynchronously. In the latter mode, memory corruption doesn’t immediately raise an exception, leaving a race window open for attackers. We would not implement such a mechanism. We believe memory safety protections need to be strictly synchronous, on by default, and working continuously. But supporting always-on, synchronous MTE across key attack surfaces while preserving a great, high-performance user experience is extremely demanding for hardware to support.</p>
<p>In addition, for MTE to provide memory safety in an adversarial context, we would need to finely tune the operating system to defend the new semantics and the confidentiality of memory tags on which MTE relies. Ultimately, we determined that to deliver truly best-in-class memory safety, we would carry out a massive engineering effort spanning all of Apple — including updates to Apple silicon, our operating systems, and our software frameworks. This effort, together with our highly successful secure memory allocator work, would transform MTE from a helpful debugging tool into a groundbreaking new security feature.</p>
<p>Today we’re introducing the culmination of this effort: Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), our comprehensive memory safety defense for Apple platforms. Memory Integrity Enforcement is built on the robust foundation provided by our <strong>secure memory allocators</strong>, coupled with <strong>Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE)</strong> in synchronous mode, and supported by extensive <strong>Tag Confidentiality Enforcement</strong> policies. MIE is built right into Apple hardware and software in all models of iPhone 17 and iPhone Air and offers unparalleled, always-on memory safety protection for our key attack surfaces including the kernel, while maintaining the power and performance that users expect. In addition, we’re making EMTE available to all Apple developers in Xcode as part of the new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging">Enhanced Security</a> feature that we released earlier this year during WWDC.</p>
<p>The rest of this post dives into the intensive engineering effort required to design and validate Memory Integrity Enforcement.</p>
<h3>Designing Memory Integrity Enforcement</h3>
<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement starts with our secure memory allocators — kalloc_type, xzone malloc, and WebKit’s libpas — all of which use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adopting-type-aware-memory-allocation">type information</a> to decide how to organize memory allocations. With both use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs, an attacker’s goal is to create overlapping interpretations of memory, which they achieve by controlling the precise position of certain allocations — of a specific type — that is advantageous to them. The type-aware placement policies of our secure memory allocators help thwart these memory corruption techniques, as we described in our <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/what-if-we-had-sockpuppet-in-ios16/">kalloc_type post</a>. Our secure allocators set a new high-water mark of software protection against memory corruption, while preserving the same or better performance as the allocators they replaced.</p>
<p>Allocators can apply protections only at the granularity of memory pages — 16KB on iOS — which is a natural fit for multi-page allocations. For smaller allocations, our secure allocators can use page-level protections to help prevent memory corruption attacks across different type buckets. However, page-level protections are too coarse to defend against attacks within the same type bucket, and we use memory tagging to close this gap.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how EMTE can be used to protect against two of the most common types of memory corruption: buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities. For buffer overflows, the allocator is responsible for using different tags for neighboring allocations. If a request to access memory spills over to adjacent memory that has a different tag, the hardware blocks it, and the operating system can take action and terminate the process. We represent this visually below with three adjacent allocations, tagged with three different secrets: ⏺️, 🔼, and ⏹️. Two access attempts with the 🔼 tag are permitted to 🔼-tagged memory, but the third attempt is blocked as it spills over into the adjacent, ⏹️-tagged allocation.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks buffer overflows </p>

<p>The allocator is also responsible for retagging memory as it gets reused for other purposes. In the image below, the 🔼 allocation is retagged as ⏹️ after it has been freed and reallocated by the system. If a request to the retagged memory is made with the older 🔼 tag, as would be seen in use-after-free exploits, the hardware blocks it and lets the operating system take further action.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement blocks use-after-free access</p>

<p>A key weakness of the original MTE specification is that access to non-tagged memory, such as global variables, is not checked by the hardware. This means attackers don’t have to face as many defensive constraints when attempting to control core application configuration and state. With Enhanced MTE, we instead specify that accessing non-tagged memory from a tagged memory region requires knowing that region’s tag, making it significantly harder for attackers to turn out-of-bounds bugs in dynamic tagged memory into a way to sidestep EMTE by directly modifying non-tagged allocations.</p>
<p>Finally, we developed <strong>Tag Confidentiality Enforcement</strong> to protect the implementation of our secure allocators from technical threats and to guard the confidentiality of EMTE tags — including against side-channel and speculative-execution attacks.</p>
<p>Our typed allocators and EMTE both rely on confidentiality of kernel data structures from user applications, and of the tags chosen by the allocator. Attackers might attempt to defeat EMTE, and in turn Memory Integrity Enforcement, by revealing these secrets. To protect the kernel allocator backing store and tag storage, we use the <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/operating-system-integrity-sec8b776536b/1/web/1#secd022396fb">Secure Page Table Monitor</a>, which provides strong guarantees even in the presence of a kernel compromise. We also ensure that when the kernel accesses memory on behalf of an application, it's subject to the same tag-checking rules as userspace.</p>
<p>Attacks based on speculative execution can also be used to expose secrets. To improve performance, modern CPUs predict the execution of instructions that follow prior, potentially longer latency instructions. If the prediction is correct, computation is very fast. If it’s wrong, the CPU discards the prediction, and computation is slower. Unfortunately, discarded predictions have observable effects that can reveal system state and data, and because speculative attacks never cause the system to crash or misbehave in observable ways during their use, they’re particularly useful for an attacker. For example, evaluating a pointer authentication instruction speculatively exposed <a href="https://pacmanattack.com/">timing differences</a> in our original implementation of Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC), which would allow the valid signature to be isolated. During the design phase for Memory Integrity Enforcement, we identified and addressed the three speculative vulnerabilities that could undermine tag confidentiality.</p>
<p>First, when EMTE is active, requests to access memory cause the hardware to check tags. It's crucial that evaluating a tag-checking instruction speculatively doesn’t expose timing differences that would allow an attacker to isolate the valid tag. From the start, we designed the Apple silicon implementation so that tag values can’t influence speculative execution in any way. Recently published <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08719">security research</a> demonstrates that the MTE implementation on Google’s Pixel devices is vulnerable to this type of attack, allowing MTE to be bypassed in Google Chrome and the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Second, allocators assign random tags to memory, and attackers must not be able to predict tag values that the system will choose. We address this issue by frequently re-seeding the underlying pseudo-random generator used to select new tags.</p>
<p>Third, <a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre variant 1 (V1)</a> is a speculative-execution vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit conditional branches to leak data, including MTE tag values. To date, there has been no solution to this problem in consumer operating systems, because general Spectre V1 mitigations such as <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/SpeculativeLoadHardening.html">Speculative Load Hardening</a> have a prohibitive CPU cost. The presence of EMTE leaves Spectre V1 as one of the last avenues available to attackers to help guide their attacks, so we designed a completely novel mitigation that limits the effective reach of Spectre V1 leaks — at virtually zero CPU cost — and forces attackers to contend with type segregation. This mitigation makes it impractical for attackers to use Spectre V1, as they would typically need 25 or more V1 sequences to reach more than 95 percent exploitability rate — unless one of these sequences is related to the bug being exploited, following similar reasoning as our <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/towards-the-next-generation-of-xnu-memory-safety#benefits">kalloc_type analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Our mission with Memory Integrity Enforcement is to protect all users by default and provide an extraordinary disruption to the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities. To do so, we considered a wide set of threats, including some of the most challenging ones — such as side channels — and arrived at this extensive combination of features not present in other MTE implementations. Google took a great first step last year when they offered MTE to those who opt in to their program for at-risk users. But even for users who turn it on, the effectiveness of MTE on Android is limited by the lack of deep integration with the operating system that distinguishes Memory Integrity Enforcement and its use of EMTE on Apple silicon.</p>
<p>For the new A19 and A19 Pro chips to support Memory Integrity Enforcement, we dedicated an extraordinary amount of Apple silicon resources to security — more than ever before — including CPU area, CPU speed, and memory for tag storage. And to fully realize this hardware investment, we designed all of the new operating system elements of MIE jointly with our hardware work, including secure allocators, EMTE, and tag confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Because EMTE tag checking imposes a performance cost, we designed Memory Integrity Enforcement to take advantage of our secure allocators first and use EMTE to protect only smaller individual allocations within a type bucket, which software allocators can’t defend on their own. Then, by knowing where and how we would deploy EMTE, we could accurately model the tag-checking demand of the operating system, and design our silicon to satisfy it. Our hardware implementation influenced additional software design decisions, reducing the overhead of tag checks even further. Importantly, deploying EMTE with this level of precision supports our strategy to provide as many memory safety improvements as possible to users on previous iPhone generations, which don’t support EMTE.</p>
<p>For the security evaluation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, we involved our offensive research team from the very beginning. From 2020 to 2025, they continuously analyzed and attacked the system — first conceptually, with theoretical exploitation avenues, then with practical attacks in simulated environments, and eventually on new hardware prototypes. Prolonged engagement from our offensive research team allowed us to identify and eradicate entire attack strategies and techniques before attackers could ever discover them, leading to a stronger, more mature feature from the outset.</p>
<p>Our offensive research team identified where and how attackers are most likely to break into the system, and our deployment of Memory Integrity Enforcement is deeply guided by their findings. Notably, this includes making sure that this powerful new protection is available to third-party apps that are likely entry points for attackers — such as social networks, messaging apps, or any other app where a specific user can be targeted. Starting immediately with the launch of MIE, any developer can begin testing this powerful protection for their app, including EMTE on hardware that supports it, using the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging">Enhanced Security</a> settings in Xcode.</p>
<p>The meticulous planning and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement made it possible to maintain synchronous tag checking for all the demanding workloads of our platforms, delivering groundbreaking security with minimal performance impact, while remaining completely invisible to users.</p>
<h3>Security evaluation</h3>
<p>Memory Integrity Enforcement started with a deeply ambitious goal: to make it immensely more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain mercenary spyware attacks based on memory corruption against our platforms. While there’s no such thing as perfect security, MIE is designed to dramatically constrain attackers and their degrees of freedom during exploitation.</p>
<p>Throughout the design and implementation of Memory Integrity Enforcement, our offensive research team evaluated our progress by looking at sophisticated exploit chains that were previously used against our platform, recent vulnerabilities, and our own internal research. First, we worked on rebuilding and adapting previously seen exploit chains to systems protected by MIE. But it’s not sufficient to consider only previous chains that were developed before MIE existed, because attackers will surely adapt in reaction to these new protections. We therefore also evaluated a selection of more recent vulnerabilities that we expected would have the best chance of surviving MIE. For these, we meticulously enumerated all possible exploitation opportunities, similar to our evaluation of <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/what-if-we-had-sockpuppet-in-ios16/">SockPuppet against kalloc_type</a>.</p>
<p>Both approaches revealed the same conclusion: Memory Integrity Enforcement vastly reduces the exploitation strategies available to attackers. Though memory corruption bugs are usually interchangeable, MIE cut off so many exploit steps at a fundamental level that it was not possible to restore the chains by swapping in new bugs. Even with substantial effort, we could not rebuild any of these chains to work around MIE. The few memory corruption effects that remained are unreliable and don’t give attackers sufficient momentum to successfully exploit these bugs.</p>
<p>Here’s a visual representation of what this looks like for an attacker. The chart below represents six of the real-world exploit chains that we evaluated and shows the steps where Memory Integrity Enforcement — the secure allocators, EMTE, or both — stops the attack.</p>
<p> Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xlarge_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 2500w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/large_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 1650w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 1300w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/small_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 840w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xsmall_advanced-memory-integrity-light.png 560w" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" decoding="async" loading="lazy"><img alt="Memory Integrity Enforcement vs. real-world exploit chains" src="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png" srcset="https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xlarge_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 2500w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/large_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 1650w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/medium_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 1300w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/small_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 840w, https://security.apple.com/assets/image/generated/xsmall_advanced-memory-integrity-dark.png 560w" sizes="(max-width:734px) 100vw, (max-width:1068px) calc(100vw - 76px), 650px" decoding="async" loading="lazy"></picture></figure>
<p>Notably, attackers confront Memory Integrity Enforcement early in the exploitation process. Although some issues are able to survive MIE — for example, intra-allocation buffer overflows — such issues are extremely rare, and even fewer will lend themselves to a full end-to-end exploit. Inevitably, attackers must face MIE at a stage where their capabilities are still very limited, leaving few viable avenues for exploitation. This leads to fragile chains where breaking just one step is often enough to invalidate the entire exploit strategy. When that happens, most of the chain’s components can’t be reused, and the attackers have to restart exploit development with entirely new bugs.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The industry-leading security of iPhone means that the vast majority of our users never face system-level attacks on their devices. Our work on memory safety is aimed primarily at the mercenary spyware and surveillance industry, which spends many millions of dollars to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities and target a small number of individuals because of who they are and what they do. Over the past five years, we developed a comprehensive approach to memory safety that integrates the best of our hardware and software capabilities, and today’s announcement is the culmination of this ambitious vision. With the introduction of the iPhone 17 lineup and iPhone Air, we’re excited to deliver Memory Integrity Enforcement: the industry’s first ever, comprehensive, always-on memory-safety protection covering key attack surfaces — including the kernel and over 70 userland processes — built on the Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE) and supported by secure typed allocators and tag confidentiality protections.</p>
<p>Based on our evaluations pitting Memory Integrity Enforcement against exceptionally sophisticated mercenary spyware attacks from the last three years, we believe MIE will make exploit chains significantly more expensive and difficult to develop and maintain, disrupt many of the most effective exploitation techniques from the last 25 years, and completely redefine the landscape of memory safety for Apple products. Because of how dramatically it reduces an attacker’s ability to exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities on our devices, we believe Memory Integrity Enforcement represents the most significant upgrade to memory safety in the history of consumer operating systems.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

                 <div><strong><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span></strong>&nbsp;Apple today debuted the all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/" target="_blank">iPhone Air</a>, the thinnest iPhone ever made, with pro performance. iPhone Air features a breakthrough titanium design that is elegant and light yet strong, with an innovative internal architecture that enables the latest iPhone experiences. The back of iPhone Air is now protected with Ceramic Shield, and the front cover uses Ceramic Shield 2, delivering 3x better scratch resistance, making iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone. iPhone Air also features a stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion up to 120Hz.<sup>1</sup> With the most Apple-designed chips in an iPhone — the powerhouse A19 Pro, N1, and C1X — iPhone Air is the most power-efficient iPhone ever made. Paired with the redesigned internal architecture and software optimizations, iPhone Air has fantastic all-day battery life. A powerful 48MP Fusion Main camera enables the equivalent of four lenses with incredible image quality, and the innovative 18MP Center Stage front camera takes selfies to the next level.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone Air will be available in four gorgeous finishes: space black, cloud white, light gold, and sky blue. Pre-orders begin Friday, September 12, with availability beginning Friday, September 19.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The all-new iPhone Air is so powerful, yet impossibly thin and light, that you really have to hold it to believe it’s real. This huge leap in design and engineering is only made possible through Apple innovation, especially Apple silicon,” said John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. “iPhone Air is a brand-new member of the iPhone family that delivers advanced features our users will love, like pro performance, a versatile 48MP Fusion camera system, our innovative Center Stage front camera, and great all-day battery life — all in a breakthrough design that feels like you’re holding the future.”

                 <div>Featuring a breakthrough design with pro performance, iPhone Air is the thinnest iPhone ever made at 5.6mm, and it is incredibly light, with a large, stunning display. The grade 5 titanium frame is strong, with an elegant high-gloss mirror finish, and a new plateau on the back that is precision-milled on both sides to house the cameras, speaker, and Apple silicon. This maximizes space for the battery to deliver remarkable all-day battery life. The thin design also features the Action button, so users can easily access a variety of functions with just a press, and Camera Control, to quickly launch the camera or enable visual intelligence.<sup>2</sup>

                 <div>The stunning 6.5-inch Super Retina XDR display features ProMotion, with an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz for smooth scrolling and stunning graphics. The Always-On display shows important information at a glance, and when not in use, it efficiently adjusts down to 1Hz. iPhone Air is easy to use outside with 3000 nits peak outdoor brightness — the highest ever on iPhone — and 2x better outdoor contrast.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>iPhone Air also introduces the Ceramic Shield 2 front cover, which is tougher than any smartphone glass or glass-ceramic with a new Apple-designed coating, providing 3x better scratch resistance and improved anti-reflection to reduce glare. For the very first time, Ceramic Shield now protects the back of iPhone, including the plateau, delivering 4x better resistance to cracks than the back glass on previous models. And with the strong titanium frame, iPhone Air exceeds Apple’s stringent bend strength requirements. This design makes iPhone Air more durable than any previous iPhone.

                 <div>iPhone Air introduces an all-new Center Stage front camera that advances the photo and video experience. The Center Stage front camera features the first square front camera sensor on iPhone, offering a wide field of view and capturing photos up to 18MP. Users no longer have to rotate their iPhone to take a landscape selfie — they can take photos and videos in portrait or landscape while holding their iPhone vertically. For group shots, Center Stage for photos uses AI to automatically expand the field of view and can rotate from portrait to landscape to include everyone in the frame. The Center Stage front camera enables ultra-stabilized video in 4K HDR, and users can record on the front and rear cameras simultaneously with Dual Capture — perfect for documenting themselves and the world around them. During calls over FaceTime or third-party apps, Center Stage for video calls keeps users stable and positioned in frame.

</div>
                 
             
                 <div><ul>
<li>The iPhone Air Case with MagSafe — available in frost and shadow — has an ultra-thin translucent design with a lightly frosted interior, a high-gloss outer surface, and a reinforced polycarbonate frame to protect iPhone Air from scratches and drops.</li>
</ul>

                 <div><ul>
<li>Crafted from 100 percent recycled yarns, the Crossbody Strap drapes comfortably, with embedded flexible magnets and stainless steel sliding mechanisms to easily adjust the length and keep both straps securely aligned. The Crossbody Strap will be available in 10 colors: black, light gray, blue, light blue, purple, sienna, green, neon yellow, tan, and orange.</li>

</h2>
                 
             
                 <div>Apple 2030 is the company’s ambitious plan to be carbon neutral across its entire footprint by the end of this decade by reducing product emissions from their three biggest sources: materials, electricity, and transportation. iPhone Air is made with 35 percent recycled content, including 80 percent recycled titanium, the highest ever for an iPhone, and 100 percent recycled cobalt in the battery. A new titanium USB-C port is 3D-printed to be thinner and stronger, fitting into the slim design while using 33 percent less material than a conventional forging process. iPhone Air is manufactured with 45 percent renewable electricity, like wind and solar, across the supply chain. It is designed to be durable, repairable, and offer industry-leading software support, while meeting Apple’s high standards for energy efficiency and safe chemistry. The paper packaging is 100 percent fiber-based and can be easily recycled.

"The change isn't easy, but it's worth it. If you make the time to do it right, your employees will be more engaged, more productive, and more connected, even when they're miles away.

I remember starting at Microsoft in the late '90s, always in the office, no laptops, and primarily working with the people right down the hall. As technology evolved and our business expanded, we became more open, more global, and able to scale in ways we couldn't have imagined. Then the pandemic reshaped everything. It pushed us to think differently about work, to connect like never before (thank you Teams!), reminded us of how much we value being together, and gave us focus and autonomy in the traditional workday. We're not going back, and we shouldn't. Instead, we should take the best of what we've learned and move forward.</em></p><p><em>In the AI era, we are moving faster than ever, building world class technology that changes how people live and work, and how organizations everywhere operate. If you reflect on our history, the most meaningful breakthroughs happen when we build on each other's ideas together, in real time.</em></p><p><em>We've looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive—they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results. As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together.</em></p><p><em>With that in mind, we're updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office.</em></p><p><em>We'll roll this out in three phases: 1) starting in Puget Sound at the end of February; 2) expanding to other US locations; 3) and then launching outside the US.</em></p><p><em>Our goal with this change is to provide more clarity and consistency in how we come together, while maintaining the flexibility we know you value. We want you to continue to shape your schedule in ways that work best for you, making in-person time intentional and impactful. Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It's about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers' needs.</em></p><p><em>For some of you, this is not a change. For others this may be a bigger adjustment, which is exactly why we're providing time to plan thoughtfully. As part of these updates, we're also enhancing our workplace safety and security measures so we can continue to provide a workplace where every employee can do their best work.</em></p><p><em>What you need to know:</em></p><p><em>Puget Sound-area employees: If you live within 50 miles of a Microsoft office, you'll be expected to work onsite three days a week by the end of February. You'll receive a personalized email today with more details. Please connect with your manager and team to understand your organization's plans. If needed, you can request an exception by Friday, September 19.</em></p><p><em>Managers: You'll find actions to take, and the resources to support both you and your team on the Managers@Microsoft SharePoint.</em></p><p><em>All employees: You'll hear from your EVP or organizational leadership today with specific guidance. Each business will do what is best for their team, which means some groups will deviate from our company-wide expectations. If you are outside of the Puget Sound area, you do not need to take any action at this time unless your EVP communicates otherwise.</em></p><p><em>Timelines and details for additional US office locations will be announced soon. For employees outside the United States, we will begin planning in 2026. More information is available on the Flexible Work at Microsoft SharePoint.</em></p><p><em>As always, we'll keep learning together to ensure Microsoft is the best place for you to grow and have a great career. Let's keep moving forward together.</em></p><p><em>Thank you,</em></p><p><em>Amy"</em></p><p><strong><em>Have a tip?

<p><abbr>I</abbr>t’s been some time since <strong>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</strong> has been seen using a tool known as a Stingray, or a cell-site simulator, in its attempts to find and remove undocumented immigrants. The tool tricks a phone into thinking it’s a cell tower, and when a suspect’s device connects, the cops can trace its location. Its use is controversial because anyone in the same area as the target is at risk of having their information exposed.</p>

<p>In a recently-unsealed search warrant reviewed by <em>Forbes</em>, ICE <strong>used such a cell-site simulator in an attempt to track down an individual</strong> in Orem, Utah. The suspect had been ordered to leave the U.S. in 2023, but is believed to still be in the country. Investigators learned last month that before going to Utah, he’d escaped prison in Venezuela where he was serving a sentence for murder, according to the warrant. He’s also suspected of being linked to gang activity in the country, investigators said.</p>

<p>When the government got the target’s number, they first got a warrant to get its location. However, the trace wasn’t precise–it only told law enforcement that the target was somewhere in an area covering about 30 blocks. That led them to asking a court for a Stingray-type device to get an accurate location.</p>

<p>The warrant was issued at the end of last month and it’s not yet known if the fugitive was found.</p>
<p>But the case shows that, despite having been<a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ice-using-powerful-stingray-surveillance-devices" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ice-using-powerful-stingray-surveillance-devices" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/ice-using-powerful-stingray-surveillance-devices" aria-label="criticized by civil rights groups"> criticized by civil rights groups</a> for using Stingrays during the last Trump administration, ICE continues to use the technology. Earlier this year, new media publication <a href="https://san.com/cc/exclusive-evidence-of-cell-phone-surveillance-detected-at-anti-ice-protest/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="https://san.com/cc/exclusive-evidence-of-cell-phone-surveillance-detected-at-anti-ice-protest/" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://san.com/cc/exclusive-evidence-of-cell-phone-surveillance-detected-at-anti-ice-protest/" aria-label="Straight Arrow News">Straight Arrow News</a> said it had analysed “mobile network anomalies” around a Washington state protest against ICE raids that were consistent with Stingray use.</p>
<p><em>Forbes</em> found contract records showing ICE purchased nearly $1 million worth of “cell site simulator vehicles” in May this year, indicating it’s taking the surveillance tool fully mobile. That was part of a contract first signed under the Biden administration in 2024.</p>
<p>ICE also has an active contract worth up to $4.4 million with the original Stingray manufacturer, Harris Corporation, for unspecified “equipment to determine the location of targeted mobile handsets.” That deal was also signed during the Biden years.</p>

    <div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><div><p>This post and its online comment sections are blame-free zones. We are not
blaming anyone for clicking on the phishing link. If you were targeted with
such a phishing attack, you'd fall for it too and it's a matter of when not
if. Anyone who claims they wouldn't is wrong.</p><p>This is also a bit of a rant.</p></div></div></div>
<p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised">one of the biggest package ecosystems had very popular packages get compromised</a>. We're talking functionality like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formatting text with colors for use in the terminal</li>
<li>A list of common color names and their RGB values</li>
<li>A decorator for functions so you can debug their inputs/outputs as they are run</li>
<li>A utility function that determines if its argument can be used like an array</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of dependencies are everywhere and nobody would even think that they could be harmful. Getting code into these packages means that it's almost guaranteed a free path to production deployments. If an open proxy server (a-la Bright Data or other botnets that the credit card network tolerates for some reason), API key stealer, or worse was sent through this chain of extreme luck on the attacker's part, then this would be a completely different story.</p>
<p>We all dodged a massive bullet because all the malware did was modify the destination addresses of cryptocurrency payments mediated via online wallets like <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>.</p>
<p>As someone adjacent to the online security community, I have a sick sense of appreciation for this attack. This was a really good attack. It started with a phishing email that I'd probably fall for if it struck at the right time:</p>
<figure><a href="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.jpg"><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.avif"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.webp"><img loading="lazy" src="https://files.xeiaso.net/blog/2025/we-dodged-a-bullet/the-email.jpg"></picture></a></figure>
<p>This is frankly a really good phishing email. Breaking it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>It greets the user personally with their NPM username. This makes it look personalized, so people are more likely to trust it.</li>
<li>People are used to the idea of changing passwords for security. With that in mind, at a glance the idea of changing your two-factor auth credentials "for security reasons" isn't completely unreasonable.</li>
<li>NPM has always been kinda weird compared to other open source package repositories, so them requiring something strange like that reads as reasonable.</li>
<li>It sets a deadline a few days in the future. This creates a sense of urgency, and when you combine urgency with being rushed by life, you are much more likely to fall for the phishing link.</li>
<li>It links to a website (I'm assuming it's on npm.help), and that website is used to get the two-factor credentials somehow and then start publishing new packages with the exploit code.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a 10/10 phishing email. Looking at it critically the only part about it that stands out is the domain "npmjs.help" instead of "npmjs.com". Even then, that wouldn't really stand out to me because I've seen companies use new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">generic top level domains</a> to separate out things like the blog at <code>.blog</code> or the docs at <code>.guide</code>, not to mention the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tokih_heres-your-builders-guide-to-new-activity-7315851665348141057-9oBM"><code>.new</code> stack</a>.</p>
<p>One of my friends <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/buttplug.engineer">qdot</a> also got the phishing email and here's what he had to say:</p>
<center><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:sfvpv6dfrug3rnjewn7gyx62/app.bsky.feed.post/3lyds45qxpc2i" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtonkqupqoprhrsosj6sf5sj5wmy6nseof5nx3mtrycsycw4pcxi" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>I got the email for it and was like "oh I'll deal with this
later".</p><p>Saved by procrastination!</p><p>— qdot (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sfvpv6dfrug3rnjewn7gyx62?ref_src=embed">

<p>With <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-arrayish">how</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-string">widely</a> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/color-name">used</a> these libraries are, this could have been <em>so much worse</em> than it was. I can easily imagine a timeline where this wasn't just a cryptocurrency interceptor. Imagine if something this widely deployed into an ecosystem where automated package bumping triggering production releases is common did API key theft. You'd probably have more OpenAI API keys than you know what you'd do with. You could probably go for years without having to pay for AWS again.</p>
<p>It is just maddening to me that a near Jia Tan level chain of malware and phishing was wasted on cryptocurrency interception that won't even run in the majority of places those compromised libraries were actually used. When I was bumping packages around these issues, I found that most of these libraries were used in command line tools.</p>
<p>This was an attack obviously targeted towards the Web 3 ecosystem as users of Web 3 tools are used to making payments with their browsers. With my black hat on, I think that the reason they targeted more generic packages instead of Web 3 packages was so that the compromise wouldn't be as noticed by the Web 3 ecosystem. Sure, you'd validate the rigging that helps you interface with Metamask, but you'd never think that it would get monkey-patched by your color value parsing library.</p>
<p>One of the important things to take away from this is that every dependency could be malicious. We should take the time to understand the entire dependency tree of our programs, but we aren't given that time. At the end of the day, we still have to ship things.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a>
is a simple data interchange format. Almost 15 years ago,
we wrote about <a href="https://go.dev/blog/json">support for JSON in Go</a>,
which introduced the ability to serialize and deserialize Go types to and from JSON data.
Since then, JSON has become the most popular data format used on the Internet.
It is widely read and written by Go programs,
and encoding/json now ranks as the 5th most imported Go package.</p>
<p>Over time, packages evolve with the needs of their users,
and <code>encoding/json</code> is no exception. This blog post is about Go 1.25’s new
experimental <code>encoding/json/v2</code> and <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> packages,
which bring long-awaited improvements and fixes.
This post argues for a new major API version,
provides an overview of the new packages,
and explains how you can make use of it.
The experimental packages are not visible by default and
may undergo future API changes.</p>
<h2 id="problems-with-encodingjson">Problems with <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>Overall, <code>encoding/json</code> has held up well.
The idea of marshaling and unmarshaling arbitrary Go types
with some default representation in JSON, combined with the ability to
customize the representation, has proven to be highly flexible.
However, in the years since its introduction,
various users have identified numerous shortcomings.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-flaws">Behavior flaws</h3>
<p>There are various behavioral flaws in <code>encoding/json</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Imprecise handling of JSON syntax</strong>: Over the years, JSON has seen
increased standardization in order for programs to properly communicate.
Generally, decoders have become stricter at rejecting ambiguous inputs,
to reduce the chance that two implementations will have different
(successful) interpretations of a particular JSON value.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts invalid UTF-8,
whereas the latest Internet Standard (RFC 8259) requires valid UTF-8.
The default behavior should report an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8,
instead of introducing silent data corruption,
which may cause problems downstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>encoding/json</code> currently accepts objects with duplicate member names.
RFC 8259 does not specify how to handle duplicate names,
so an implementation is free to choose an arbitrary value,
merge the values, discard the values, or report an error.
The presence of a duplicate name results in a JSON value
without a universally agreed upon meaning.
This could be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE&amp;t=1057s" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">exploited by attackers in security applications</a>
and has been exploited before (as in <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-12635" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">CVE-2017-12635</a>).
The default behavior should err on the side of safety and reject duplicate names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leaking nilness of slices and maps</strong>: JSON is often used to communicate with
programs using JSON implementations that do not allow <code>null</code> to be unmarshaled
into a data type expected to be a JSON array or object.
Since <code>encoding/json</code> marshals a nil slice or map as a JSON <code>null</code>,
this may lead to errors when unmarshaling by other implementations.
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/63397#discussioncomment-7201222">A survey</a>
indicated that most Go users prefer that nil slices and maps
are marshaled as an empty JSON array or object by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Case-insensitive unmarshaling</strong>: When unmarshaling, a JSON object member name
is resolved to a Go struct field name using a case-insensitive match.
This is a surprising default, a potential security vulnerability, and a performance limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inconsistent calling of methods</strong>: Due to an implementation detail,
<code>MarshalJSON</code> methods declared on a pointer receiver
are <a href="https://go.dev/issue/22967">inconsistently called by <code>encoding/json</code></a>. While regarded as a bug,
this cannot be fixed as too many applications depend on the current behavior.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api-deficiencies">API deficiencies</h3>
<p>The API of <code>encoding/json</code> can be tricky or restrictive:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is difficult to correctly unmarshal from an <code>io.Reader</code>.
Users often write <code>json.NewDecoder(r).Decode(v)</code>,
which fails to reject trailing junk at the end of the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Options can be set on the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types,
but cannot be used with the <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions.
Similarly, types implementing the <code>Marshaler</code> and <code>Unmarshaler</code> interfaces
cannot make use of the options and there is no way to plumb options down the call stack.
For example, the <code>Decoder.DisallowUnknownFields</code> option loses its effect
when calling a custom <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>Compact</code>, <code>Indent</code>, and <code>HTMLEscape</code> functions write to a <code>bytes.Buffer</code>
instead of something more flexible like a <code>[]byte</code> or <code>io.Writer</code>.
This limits the usability of those functions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="performance-limitations">Performance limitations</h3>
<p>Setting aside internal implementation details,
the public API commits it to certain performance limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>MarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>MarshalJSON</code> interface method forces the implementation
to allocate the returned <code>[]byte</code>. Also, the semantics require that
<code>encoding/json</code> verify that the result is valid JSON
and also to reformat it to match the specified indentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UnmarshalJSON</strong>: The <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface method requires that
a complete JSON value be provided (without any trailing data).
This forces <code>encoding/json</code> to parse the JSON value to be unmarshaled
in its entirety to determine where it ends before it can call <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>.
Afterwards, the <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method itself must parse the provided JSON value again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lack of streaming</strong>: Even though the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types operate
on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>, they buffer the entire JSON value in memory.
The <code>Decoder.Token</code> method for reading individual tokens is allocation-heavy
and there is no corresponding API for writing tokens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, if the implementation of a <code>MarshalJSON</code> or <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> method
recursively calls the <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> function,
then the performance becomes quadratic.</p>
<h2 id="trying-to-fix-encodingjson-directly">Trying to fix <code>encoding/json</code> directly</h2>
<p>Introducing a new, incompatible major version of a package is a heavy consideration.
If possible, we should try to fix the existing package.</p>
<p>While it is relatively easy to add new features,
it is difficult to change existing features.
Unfortunately, these problems are inherent consequences of the existing API,
making them practically impossible to fix within the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>.</p>
<p>We could in principle declare separate names, such as <code>MarshalV2</code> or <code>UnmarshalV2</code>,
but that is tantamount to creating a parallel namespace within the same package.
This leads us to <code>encoding/json/v2</code> (henceforth called <code>v2</code>),
where we can make these changes within a seperate <code>v2</code> namespace
in contrast to <code>encoding/json</code> (henceforth called <code>v1</code>).</p>
<h2 id="planning-for-encodingjsonv2">Planning for <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>The planning for a new major version of <code>encoding/json</code> spanned years.
In late 2020, spurred on by the inability to fix issues in the current package,
Daniel Martí (one of the maintainers of <code>encoding/json</code>) first drafted his
thoughts on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQGoM44HLinH4NGBEv5drGlw5_RNW-GP7DdGEpm7Y3o" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">what a hypothetical <code>v2</code> package should look like</a>.
Separately, after previous work on the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/protobuf-apiv2">Go API for Protocol Buffers</a>,
Joe Tsai was disapppointed that <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson">the <code>protojson</code> package</a>
needed to use a custom JSON implementation because <code>encoding/json</code> was
neither capable of adhering to the stricter JSON standard that the
Protocol Buffer specification required,
nor of efficiently serializing JSON in a streaming manner.</p>
<p>Believing a brighter future for JSON was both beneficial and achievable,
Daniel and Joe joined forces to brainstorm on <code>v2</code> and
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/json" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">started to build a prototype</a>
(with the initial code being a polished version of the JSON serialization logic from the Go protobuf module).
Over time, a few others (Roger Peppe, Chris Hines, Johan Brandhorst-Satzkorn, and Damien Neil)
joined the effort by providing design review, code review, and regression testing.
Many of the early discussions are publicly available in our
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgrQPcV8W8EChkaAvv-3NUu6PYmnGG3b" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">recorded meetings</a> and
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rovrOTd-wTawGMPPlPuKhwXaYBg9VszTXR9AQQL5LfI" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">meeting notes</a>.</p>
<p>This work has been public since the beginning,
and we increasingly involved the wider Go community,
first with a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avilmOcHKHE" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">GopherCon talk</a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/63397">discussion posted in late 2023</a>,
<a href="https://go.dev/issue/71497">formal proposal posted in early 2025</a>,
and most recently <a href="https://go.dev/issue/71845">adopting <code>encoding/json/v2</code> as a Go experiment</a>
(available in Go 1.25) for wider-scale testing by all Go users.</p>
<p>The <code>v2</code> effort has been going on for 5 years,
incorporating feedback from many contributors and also gaining valuable
empirical experience from use in production settings.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that it’s largely been developed and promoted by people
not employed by Google, demonstrating that the Go project is a collaborative endeavor
with a thriving global community dedicated to improving the Go ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="building-on-encodingjsonjsontext">Building on <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></h2>
<p>Before discussing the <code>v2</code> API, we first introduce the experimental
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext"><code>encoding/json/jsontext</code></a> package
that lays the foundation for future improvements to JSON in Go.</p>
<p>JSON serialization in Go can be broken down into two primary components:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>syntactic functionality</em> that is concerned with processing JSON based on its grammar, and</li>
<li><em>semantic functionality</em> that defines the relationship between JSON values and Go values.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use the terms “encode” and “decode” to describe syntactic functionality and
the terms “marshal” and “unmarshal” to describe semantic functionality.
We aim to provide a clear distinction between functionality
that is purely concerned with encoding versus that of marshaling.</p>
<p><img src="https://go.dev/blog/jsonv2-exp/api.png" width="100%"></p><p>This diagram provides an overview of this separation.
Purple blocks represent types, while blue blocks represent functions or methods.
The direction of the arrows approximately represents the flow of data.
The bottom half of the diagram, implemented by the <code>jsontext</code> package,
contains functionality that is only concerned with syntax,
while the upper half, implemented by the <code>json/v2</code> package,
contains functionality that assigns semantic meaning to syntactic data
handled by the bottom half.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>jsontext</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package jsontext

type Encoder struct { ... }
func NewEncoder(io.Writer, ...Options) *Encoder
func (*Encoder) WriteValue(Value) error
func (*Encoder) WriteToken(Token) error

type Decoder struct { ... }
func NewDecoder(io.Reader, ...Options) *Decoder
func (*Decoder) ReadValue() (Value, error)
func (*Decoder) ReadToken() (Token, error)

type Kind byte
type Value []byte
func (Value) Kind() Kind
type Token struct { ... }
func (Token) Kind() Kind
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>jsontext</code> package provides functionality for interacting with JSON
at a syntactic level and derives its name from
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8259#section-2" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">RFC 8259, section 2</a>
where the grammar for JSON data is literally called <code>JSON-text</code>.
Since it only interacts with JSON at a syntactic level,
it does not depend on Go reflection.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Encoder"><code>Encoder</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Decoder"><code>Decoder</code></a>
provide support for encoding and decoding JSON values and tokens.
The constructors
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Options">accept variadic options</a>
that affect the particular behavior of encoding and decoding.
Unlike the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code> types declared in <code>v1</code>,
the new types in <code>jsontext</code> avoid muddling the distinction between syntax and
semantics and operate in a truly streaming manner.</p>
<p>A JSON value is a complete unit of data and is represented in Go as
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Value">a named <code>[]byte</code></a>.
It is identical to <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json#RawMessage"><code>RawMessage</code></a> in <code>v1</code>.
A JSON value is syntactically composed of one or more JSON tokens.
A JSON token is represented in Go as the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/jsontext#Token">opaque <code>Token</code> type</a>
with constructors and accessor methods.
It is analogous to <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json#Token"><code>Token</code></a> in <code>v1</code>
but is designed represent arbitrary JSON tokens without allocation.</p>
<p>To resolve the fundamental performance problems with
the <code>MarshalJSON</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> interface methods,
we need an efficient way of encoding and decoding JSON
as a streaming sequence of tokens and values.
In <code>v2</code>, we introduce the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods
that operate on an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>, allowing the methods’ implementations
to process JSON in a purely streaming manner. Thus, the <code>json</code> package need not
be responsible for validating or formatting a JSON value returned by <code>MarshalJSON</code>,
nor would it need to be responsible for determining the boundaries of a JSON value
provided to <code>UnmarshalJSON</code>. These responsibilities belong to the <code>Encoder</code> and <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<h2 id="introducing-encodingjsonv2">Introducing <code>encoding/json/v2</code></h2>
<p>Building on the <code>jsontext</code> package, we now introduce the experimental
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2"><code>encoding/json/v2</code></a> package.
It is designed to fix the aforementioned problems,
while remaining familiar to users of the <code>v1</code> package.
Our goal is that usages of <code>v1</code> will operate <em>mostly</em> the same if directly migrated to <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>In this article, we will primarily cover the high-level API of <code>v2</code>.
For examples on how to use it, we encourage readers to
study <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#pkg-examples">the examples in the <code>v2</code> package</a> or
read <a href="https://antonz.org/go-json-v2/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Anton Zhiyanov’s blog covering the topic</a>.</p>
<p>The basic API of <code>v2</code> is the following:</p>
<pre><code>package json

func Marshal(in any, opts ...Options) (out []byte, err error)
func MarshalWrite(out io.Writer, in any, opts ...Options) error
func MarshalEncode(out *jsontext.Encoder, in any, opts ...Options) error

func Unmarshal(in []byte, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalRead(in io.Reader, out any, opts ...Options) error
func UnmarshalDecode(in *jsontext.Decoder, out any, opts ...Options) error
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshal"><code>Marshal</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshal"><code>Unmarshal</code></a> functions
have a signature similar to <code>v1</code>, but accept options to configure their behavior.
The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalWrite"><code>MarshalWrite</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalRead"><code>UnmarshalRead</code></a> functions
directly operate on an <code>io.Writer</code> or <code>io.Reader</code>,
avoiding the need to temporarily construct an <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>
just to write or read from such types.
The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalEncode"><code>MarshalEncode</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalDecode"><code>UnmarshalDecode</code></a> functions
operate on a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> and <code>jsontext.Decoder</code> and
is actually the underlying implementation of the previously mentioned functions.
Unlike <code>v1</code>, options are a first-class argument to each of the marshal and unmarshal functions,
greatly extending the flexibility and configurability of <code>v2</code>.
There are <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Options">several options available</a>
in <code>v2</code> which are not covered by this article.</p>
<h3 id="type-specified-customization">Type-specified customization</h3>
<p>Similar to <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code> allows types to define their own JSON representation
by satisfying particular interfaces.</p>
<pre><code>type Marshaler interface {
    MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
}
type MarshalerTo interface {
    MarshalJSONTo(*jsontext.Encoder) error
}

type Unmarshaler interface {
    UnmarshalJSON([]byte) error
}
type UnmarshalerFrom interface {
    UnmarshalJSONFrom(*jsontext.Decoder) error
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> interfaces
are identical to those in <code>v1</code>.
The new <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a>
and <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a> interfaces
allow a type to represent itself as JSON using a <code>jsontext.Encoder</code> or <code>jsontext.Decoder</code>.
This allows options to be forwarded down the call stack, since options
can be retrieved via the <code>Options</code> accessor method on the <code>Encoder</code> or <code>Decoder</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-OrderedObject">the <code>OrderedObject</code> example</a>
for how to implement a custom type that maintains the ordering of JSON object members.</p>
<h3 id="caller-specified-customization">Caller-specified customization</h3>
<p>In <code>v2</code>, the caller of <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> can also specify
a custom JSON representation for any arbitrary type,
where caller-specified functions take precedence over type-defined methods
or the default representation for a particular type.</p>
<pre><code>func WithMarshalers(*Marshalers) Options

type Marshalers struct { ... }
func MarshalFunc[T any](fn func(T) ([]byte, error)) *Marshalers
func MarshalToFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Encoder, T) error) *Marshalers

func WithUnmarshalers(*Unmarshalers) Options

type Unmarshalers struct { ... }
func UnmarshalFunc[T any](fn func([]byte, T) error) *Unmarshalers
func UnmarshalFromFunc[T any](fn func(*jsontext.Decoder, T) error) *Unmarshalers
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalFunc"><code>MarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalToFunc"><code>MarshalToFunc</code></a>
construct a custom marshaler that can be passed to a <code>Marshal</code> call
using <code>WithMarshalers</code> to override the marshaling of particular types.
Similarly,
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFunc"><code>UnmarshalFunc</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalFromFunc"><code>UnmarshalFromFunc</code></a>
support similar customization for <code>Unmarshal</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#example-package-ProtoJSON">The <code>ProtoJSON</code> example</a>
demonstrates how this feature allows serialization of all
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/proto#Message"><code>proto.Message</code></a> types
to be handled by the <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/google.golang.org/protobuf/encoding/protojson"><code>protojson</code></a> package.</p>
<h3 id="behavior-differences">Behavior differences</h3>
<p>While <code>v2</code> aims to behave <em>mostly</em> the same as <code>v1</code>,
its behavior has changed <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">in some ways</a>
to address problems in <code>v1</code>, most notably:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error in the presence of invalid UTF-8.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error if a JSON object contains a duplicate name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> marshals a nil Go slice or Go map as an empty JSON array or JSON object, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> unmarshals a JSON object into a Go struct using a
case-sensitive match from the JSON member name to the Go field name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> redefines the <code>omitempty</code> tag option to omit a field if it would have
encoded as an “empty” JSON value (which are <code>null</code>, <code>""</code>, <code>[]</code>, and <code>{}</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>v2</code> reports an error when trying to serialize a <code>time.Duration</code>,
which currently has <a href="https://go.dev/issue/71631">no default representation</a>,
but provides options to let the caller decide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For most behavior changes, there is a struct tag option or caller-specified option
that can configure the behavior to operate under <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics,
or even other caller-determined behavior.
See <a href="https://go.dev/pkg/github.com/go-json-experiment/json/v1#hdr-Migrating_to_v2">“Migrating to v2”</a> for more information.</p>
<h3 id="performance-optimizations">Performance optimizations</h3>
<p>The <code>Marshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is roughly at parity with <code>v1</code>.
Sometimes it is slightly faster, but other times it is slightly slower.
The <code>Unmarshal</code> performance of <code>v2</code> is significantly faster than <code>v1</code>,
with benchmarks demonstrating improvements of up to 10x.</p>
<p>In order to obtain greater performance gains,
existing implementations of
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Marshaler"><code>Marshaler</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#Unmarshaler"><code>Unmarshaler</code></a> should
migrate to also implement
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#MarshalerTo"><code>MarshalerTo</code></a> and
<a href="https://go.dev/pkg/encoding/json/v2#UnmarshalerFrom"><code>UnmarshalerFrom</code></a>,
so that they can benefit from processing JSON in a purely streaming manner.
For example, recursive parsing of OpenAPI specifications in <code>UnmarshalJSON</code> methods
significantly hurt performance in a particular service of Kubernetes
(see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-openapi/issues/315" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">kubernetes/kube-openapi#315</a>),
while switching to <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> improved performance by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>For more information, see the
<a href="https://github.com/go-json-experiment/jsonbench" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank"><code>go-json-experiment/jsonbench</code></a>
repository.</p>
<h2 id="retroactively-improving-encodingjson">Retroactively improving <code>encoding/json</code></h2>
<p>We want to avoid two separate JSON implementations in the Go standard library,
so it is critical that, under the hood, <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to this approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Gradual migration</strong>: The <code>Marshal</code> and <code>Unmarshal</code> functions in <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>
represent a set of default behaviors that operate according to <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code> semantics.
Options can be specified that configure <code>Marshal</code> or <code>Unmarshal</code> to operate with
entirely <code>v1</code>, mostly <code>v1</code> with a some <code>v2</code>, a mix of <code>v1</code> or <code>v2</code>,
mostly <code>v2</code> with some <code>v1</code>, or entirely <code>v2</code> semantics.
This allows for gradual migration between the default behaviors of the two versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Feature inheritance</strong>: As backward-compatible features are added to <code>v2</code>,
they will inherently be made available in <code>v1</code>. For example, <code>v2</code> adds
support for several new struct tag options such as <code>inline</code> or <code>format</code> and also
support for the <code>MarshalJSONTo</code> and <code>UnmarshalJSONFrom</code> interface methods,
which are both more performant and flexible.
When <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code>, it will inherit support for these features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reduced maintenance</strong>: Maintenance of a widely used package demands significant effort.
By having <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code> use the same implementation, the maintenance burden is reduced.
In general, a single change will fix bugs, improve performance, or add functionality to both versions.
There is no need to backport a <code>v2</code> change with an equivalent <code>v1</code> change.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While select parts of <code>v1</code> may be deprecated over time (supposing <code>v2</code> graduates from being an experiment),
the package as a whole will never be deprecated.
Migrating to <code>v2</code> will be encouraged, but not required.
The Go project will not drop support for <code>v1</code>.</p>
<h2 id="experimenting-with-jsonv2">Experimenting with <code>jsonv2</code></h2>
<p>The newer API in the <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> packages are not visible by default.
To use them, build your code with <code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2</code> set in your environment or with the <code>goexperiment.jsonv2</code> build tag.
The nature of an experiment is that the API is unstable and may change in the future.
Though the API is unstable, the implementation is of a high quality and
has been successfully used in production by several major projects.</p>
<p>The fact that <code>v1</code> is implemented in terms of <code>v2</code> means that the underlying implementation of <code>v1</code>
is completely different when building under the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment.
Without changing any code, you should be able to run your tests
under <code>jsonv2</code> and theoretically nothing new should fail:</p>
<pre><code>GOEXPERIMENT=jsonv2 go test ./...
</code></pre>
<p>The re-implementation of <code>v1</code> in terms of <code>v2</code> aims to provide identical behavior
within the bounds of the <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1compat">Go 1 compatibility promise</a>,
though some differences might be observable such as the exact wording of error messages.
We encourage you to run your tests under <code>jsonv2</code> and
report any regressions <a href="https://go.dev/issues">on the issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Becoming an experiment in Go 1.25 is a significant milestone on the road to
formally adopting <code>encoding/json/jsontext</code> and <code>encoding/json/v2</code> into the standard library.
However, the purpose of the <code>jsonv2</code> experiment is to gain broader experience.
Your feedback will determine our next steps, and the outcome of this experiment,
which may result in anything from abandonment of the effort, to adoption as stable packages of Go 1.26.
Please share your experience on <a href="https://go.dev/issue/71497">go.dev/issue/71497</a>, and help determine the future of Go.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A decade-long slide in high schoolers’ reading and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/math-science-stem-girls-a80f44c20b1724bba6953756ecc862cd">math</a></span> performance persisted during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 12th graders’ scores dropping to their lowest level in more than 20 years, according to results released Tuesday from an exam known as the nation’s report card.</p><p>Eighth-grade students also lost significant ground in science skills, according to the results from the National Assessment of Education Progress.</p><p>The assessments were the first since the pandemic for eighth graders in science and 12th graders in reading and math. They reflect a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/naep-test-scores-nations-report-card-school-60150156e41b8518be3b6eabf77d0c66">downward drift</a></span> across grade levels and subject areas in previous releases from NAEP, which is considered one of the best gauges of the academic progress of U.S. schools.</p><p>“Scores for our lowest-performing students are at historic lows,” said Matthew Soldner, the acting commissioner of the National Center for Education Statistics. “These results should galvanize all of us to take concerted and focused action to accelerate student learning.”</p>
    
<p>While the pandemic had an outsize impact on student achievement, experts said falling scores are part of a longer arc in education that cannot be attributed solely to COVID-19, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/online-school-covid-learning-loss-7c162ec1b4ce4d5219d5210aaac8f1ae">school closures</a></span> and related issues such as heightened <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/school-attendance-sick-day-chronic-absenteeism-270f6d07041760e90bf84d9f4108aa4d">absenteeism</a></span>. Educators said potential underlying factors include children’s increased screen time, shortened attention spans and a decline in reading longer-form writing both in and out of school.</p>



<p>The dip in reading scores appeared alongside a shift in how English and language arts are taught in schools, with an emphasis on <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/books-reading-high-school-english-class-c8d9f39773268a6e8c79cb0b3c78d3c1">short texts and book excerpts</a></span>, said Carol Jago, associate director of the California Reading and Literature Project at UCLA. As a high school English teacher 20 years ago, Jago said it was common for her high school students to read 20 books over the course of a year. Now, some English classes are assigning just three books a year.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“To be a good reader, you have to have the stamina to stay on the page, even when the going gets tough,” Jago said. “You have to build those muscles, and we’re not building those muscles in kids.”</p>
    
    
    

    
<p>Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the scores show why the Trump administration wants to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-education-department-scotus-layoffs-student-loans-f24637f2a1d57432f6dc24d082e95b9b">give states more control</a></span> of education spending.</p><p>“Despite spending billions annually on numerous K-12 programs, the achievement gap is widening, and more high school seniors are performing below the basic benchmark in math and reading than ever before,” McMahon said.</p><p>House Democrats said the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle the Education Department will only hurt students. The declines show a need for federal investment in academic recovery and educational equity, said Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, ranking member of the House Committee on Education and Workforce.</p><p>“Eliminating the very agency responsible for supporting public schools and enforcing civil rights protections of students will only deepen the achievement gaps identified by this assessment,” Scott said.</p>
    
<h2>Fewer students show basic proficiency in math and reading</h2><p>The test scores show more students are not reaching what would be considered “basic” achievement across subject areas, said Lesley Muldoon, executive director of the National Assessment Governing Board. While NAEP’s definition of “proficient” is a high bar, Muldoon said, it is not an unreasonable one, and it is based on what researchers believe students should be able to achieve by the end of high school.</p><p>“These students are taking their next steps in life with fewer skills and less knowledge in core academics than their predecessors a decade ago,” she said. “This is happening at a time when rapid advancements in technology and society demands more of future workers and citizens, not less.”</p><p>In reading, the average score in 2024 was the lowest score in the history of the assessment, which began in 1992. Thirty-two percent of high school seniors scored below “basic,” meaning they were not able to find details in a text to help them understand its meaning.</p><p>In math, the average score in 2024 was the lowest since 2005, when the assessment framework changed significantly. On the test, 45% of high school seniors scored below “basic” achievement, the highest percentage since 2005. Only 33% of high school seniors were considered academically prepared for college-level math courses, a decline from 37% in 2019.</p>
    
<p>The high school reading and math assessments, and the eighth grade science test, are given less frequently than the biannual fourth and eighth grade reading tests, which were last released earlier this year. The new scores reflect tests taken in schools around the country between January and March 2024.</p>
    
<h2>Achievement gaps are widening</h2><p>The gap between the highest- and lowest-performing students was its widest ever among eighth grade science students, reflecting growing inequality in the American school system. The achievement gap widened also in 12th grade math.</p><p>The scores also reflect the re-emergence of a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/math-science-stem-girls-a80f44c20b1724bba6953756ecc862cd">gender gap</a></span> in science, technology, engineering and math courses. In 2019, boys and girls scored virtually the same on the NAEP science assessment. But in 2024, girls saw a steeper decline in scores. A similar pattern occurred in state math assessments, according to an Associated Press analysis.</p><p>Schools had largely closed the gender gap in math and science, but it widened in the years following the pandemic as special programs to engage girls lapsed.</p><p>On a NAEP survey of students, a shrinking percentage of eighth grade students said they regularly took part in inquiry-based learning activities in the classroom. The pandemic disrupted schools’ ability to create those hands-on learning experiences for students, which are often critical to understanding scientific concepts and processes, said Christine Cunningham, senior vice president of STEM learning at the Museum of Science in Boston.</p><p>Still, she noted declines across subjects began well before schools closed in 2020.</p><p>“We don’t know exactly what the cause of it is, but it would be incomplete to assume that if we hadn’t had COVID, the score would not have gone down,” Cunningham said. “That’s not what the data showed even before the pandemic.” ___</p><p>Feathers reported from New York.</p><p>___</p><p>The Associated Press’ education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

			</div><div><p>SANTA FE — Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham and the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department announced a historic milestone on Monday: New Mexico will become the first state in the nation to guarantee no-cost universal child care starting Nov. 1.</p>
<p>This groundbreaking new initiative will make child care available to all New Mexicans, regardless of income, by removing income eligibility requirements from the state’s child care assistance program and continuing the waiver of family copayments.</p>
<p>“Child care is essential to family stability, workforce participation, and New Mexico’s future prosperity,” said Lujan Grisham. “By investing in universal child care, we are giving families financial relief, supporting our economy, and ensuring that every child has the opportunity to grow and thrive.”</p>
<p>This announcement fulfills the promise made by the governor and the New Mexico Legislature when they created the Early Childhood Education and Care Department in 2019. Since then, New Mexico has expanded access to no-cost child care to families with incomes at or below 400% of the federal poverty level, reducing financial strain on tens of thousands of families.</p>
<p>With Monday’s announcement universal child care will be extended to every family in the state, regardless of income. This amounts to an average annual family savings of $12,000 per child.</p>
<p>“New Mexico is creating the conditions for better outcomes in health, learning, and well-being,” said Neal Halfon, professor of pediatrics, public health and public policy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and director of the Center for Healthier Children, Families, and Communities. “Its approach is rooted in data, driven by communities, and becoming a model for the nation.</p>
<p>“By prioritizing public investments in early childhood educators, families, and children, New Mexico continues to lead the way in building a sustainable, affordable, and quality child care and early learning system that helps its communities and economy thrive,” said Michelle Kang, president and CEO of the National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). “Achieving universal child care will make a huge difference for the state’s children, families, businesses, and educators—and for all of us, by showing that it can be done.”</p>
<p>Families who receive child care assistance report greater financial stability, more time to focus on their children, and the ability to choose higher-quality care settings. Now, every family in New Mexico will have the same opportunity. New Mexico is also taking decisive action to build the supply of infant and toddler care statewide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing a $12.7 million low-interest loan fund to construct, expand, and renovate child care facilities, with an additional $20 million requested in the Fiscal Year 2027 budget.</li>
<li>Targeting growth to focus on care for infants, toddlers, low-income families, and children with special needs.</li>
<li>Partnering with employers and school districts to expand child care options for working families.</li>
<li>Launching a statewide campaign to recruit licensed and registered home providers.</li>
<li><span>To support providers, reimbursement rates will rise to reflect the true cost of care.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Programs that commit to paying entry-level staff a minimum of $18 per hour and offer 10 hours of care per day, five days a week, will receive an incentive rate. New Mexico estimates an additional 5,000 early childhood professionals are needed to fully achieve a universal system.</p>
<p>“Early childhood care and education is a public good,” said ECECD Sec. Elizabeth Groginsky. “By providing universal access and improving pay for our early childhood workforce, we are easing financial pressure on families, strengthening our economy, and helping every child learn in safe, nurturing environments. This is the kind of investment that builds equity today and prosperity for the future.”</p>
<p>With universal child care, New Mexico is leading the nation by showing that what is best for children and families is also the smartest investment for long-term prosperity—building a stronger future for every community in the state.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p dir="auto">The DuckDB distribution for <a href="http://node.js/" rel="nofollow">Node.js</a> on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npm</a> was compromised with malware (along with <a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/npm-debug-and-chalk-packages-compromised" rel="nofollow">several other packages</a>). An attacker published new versions of four of duckdb’s packages that included <strong>malicious code to interfere with cryptocoin transactions</strong>. The following packages and versions are affected:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>@duckdb/node-api@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>@duckdb/node-bindings@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>duckdb@1.3.3</code></li>
<li><code>@duckdb/duckdb-wasm@1.29.2</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: The current release version of DuckDB is 1.3.2, with 1.4.0 expected to be released on Sept 10th, 2025 (tomorrow as of this writing). We do not plan to ever release a “legit” DuckDB 1.3.3. Users should double-check that they are not accidentally updating to those affected versions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">We have ourselves noticed this <em>within four hours</em> of it happening. Here’s our response:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>As an immediate response, we have <strong>deprecated</strong> the specific versions.</li>
<li>We have reached out to npm support to <strong>delete the affected versions</strong>. They were so kind to do so.</li>
<li>We have also <strong>re-released</strong> the node packages with higher version numbers (1.3.4/1.30.0) as a further safeguard so the latest version of the package points to a safe version</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We apologize for this issue. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Postmortem</h3>
<p dir="auto">On September 8th (Monday), the DuckDB maintainers received the following message from "<a href="mailto:...@npmjs.help">...@npmjs.help</a>":</p>

He followed the link (now defunct) to a website hosted under the domain <code>npmjs.help</code>. This website contained a <strong>pixel-perfect copy</strong> of the <a href="http://npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npmjs.com</a> website. He logged in using the <code>duckdb_admin</code> user and password, followed by 2FA. Again, the user profile, settings etc. were a perfect copy of the <a href="http://npmjs.com/" rel="nofollow">npmjs.com</a> website including all user data. As requested by the email, he then re-set the 2FA setup.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the background, the copycat website forwarded all actions to the actual npm website, so the 2FA was actually updated there, too. But they also added a new API token, which they then used to publish the malicious package versions. In hindsight, the fact that his browser did not auto-complete the login should have been a red flag. It's painful to spell out, but <strong>we fell for a classic phishing attack</strong>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We again apologize for this mishap. We are reviewing our internal processes to ensure the safety of future releases. It is fortunate that we noticed this within a few hours of it happening. The DuckDBLabs team was able to set up a call at 7AM to perform an immediate response. Fortunately we were not locked out of our NPM account, which also easily could have happened. We were able to rotate passwords, tokens and API keys immediately.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)</h2><a id="user-content-you-too-can-run-malware-from-npm-i-mean-without-consequences" aria-label="Permalink: You too can run malware from NPM (I mean without consequences)" href="#you-too-can-run-malware-from-npm-i-mean-without-consequences"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Phishing NPM package authors continues, unsurprisingly.
The stakes are not high enough to switch from phishing to anything more advanced (like <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/" rel="nofollow">https://xkcd.com/538/</a>) but seeing article blurbs say "Supply chain Attack" next to "These packages generally receive 2-3 billion downloads per week." might finally be enough to make an impression, one hopes.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is not a detailed analysis of the attack, there's plenty of that already. If you're looking for one, visit our friends at <a href="https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack" rel="nofollow">https://socket.dev/blog/npm-author-qix-compromised-in-major-supply-chain-attack</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead, let's look at how you could have a compromised dependency like that get into your app and be stopped.</p>
<p dir="auto">One of the compromised packages was <code>is-arrayish</code> and I'll use that as an example going forward.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What the malware does</h2><a id="user-content-what-the-malware-does" aria-label="Permalink: What the malware does" href="#what-the-malware-does"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So if an app uses <code>is-arrayish</code> in the browser, it will override <code>fetch</code>, <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and <code>window.ethereum.request</code> and whenever it finds a transaction being sent, it'll replace the target address with one of the malware author's addresses that looks most alike.</p>
<p dir="auto">I won't go into this either, but you can take a look at the summary of "donations" some other friends linked to here: <a href="https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab" rel="nofollow">https://intel.arkm.com/explorer/entity/61fbc095-f19b-479d-a037-5469aba332ab</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Pretty low impact for an attack this big. Some of it seems to be people mocking the malware author with worthless transfers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Let's see it in action</h2><a id="user-content-lets-see-it-in-action" aria-label="Permalink: Let's see it in action" href="#lets-see-it-in-action"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Say we have an app.
The app allows the user to send a meaningless transaction to themselves. Don't expect it to make sense.
It also uses <code>is-arrayish</code> because otherwise we'd have nothing to demo.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <i>9/8/2025</i>
    
    <p>CRDTs. Data structures that can be replicated across multiple nodes, edited independently, merged back together, and it all just works. But collaborative document editing and multiplayer TODO lists are just the tip of the iceberg - I believe the big application is distributed databases, and for that we need to talk about consistency.</p>
<p>CRDTs are a tool for <strong>Strong Eventual Consistency</strong>. Let's start with the definition of normal Eventual Consistency<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Eventual Delivery</dt>
  <dd>An update delivered to one node will <i>eventually</i> reaches all nodes</dd>
  
  <dt>Eventual Convergence</dt>
  <dd>If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will <i>eventually</i> have the same state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC) replaces <em>Eventual Convergence</em> with <em>Strong Convergence</em>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Strong Convergence</dt>
  <dd>If two nodes have seen all the same updates, they will have the same state.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Spot the difference! In SEC two replicas have the same state as soon as the updates are processed, not <em>eventually</em>. If multiple nodes are updated independently, there will be conflicts - this is inevitable. What SEC guarantees is that these conflicts are solved automatically and deterministically.</p>
<p>This has massive implications. SEC means low latency, because nodes don't need to coordinate to handle reads and writes. It means incredible fault tolerance - every single node in the system bar one could simultaneously crash, and reads and writes could still happen normally. And it means nodes still function properly if they're offline or split from the network for arbitrary time periods.</p>
<p>Strong Eventual Consistency is Eventual Consistency that works. If you're doing local first, or low latency geo-replicated systems - accept no substitute. This is the context I think we should see CRDTs in - building blocks of Strongly Eventually Consistent systems. CRDTs as application state as one thing, CRDTs as entire databases are quite another.</p>

<time datetime="2025-09-08">Sep 8, 2025</time>



(<a href="http://maurycyz.com/tags/programming">Programming</a>) 



<p>Internet ads are horrible:
They waste your time, and the advertising industry makes the internet a worse place.
Payouts are so small that the only way to survive is to turn your site into an ad filled hellhole with no real substance.</p>
<p>If you want to support your favorite authors: send then money.
A dollar helps more then viewing ads ever would.</p>
<p>However, most people see advertising as a part of the internet experience, which is why I added this message to my site:</p>

<ad-note id="box">
<ad-note-content-wrapper>
No adblocker detected. Consider using an extension like <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a> to save time and bandwidth. <u>Click here to close.</u>
</ad-note-content-wrapper>
</ad-note>
<p>It’s shown off to the side, and never covers content.
It won’t be shown if there isn’t enough space.
The close button actually works and it stays closed.</p>
<p>The specific recommendation is important because a lot of people have only <em>heard of adblockers from ads</em>.
Commercial adblockers range from sketchy to outright scams:
If they are paying to be promoted, they must expect to make money from users.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical details:</h2>

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, there’s a bit of CSS to make it look nice:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="css"><span><span>#ad-note-hidden<span>,</span> #ad-note {
</span></span><span><span>        <span>display</span>: <span>none</span>;

</span></span><span><span>        }
</span></span><span><span>}}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The message won’t be visible if an adblocker removes the &lt;div&gt; element – which has a lot of ad-like class names – or
blocks the network request for “nativeads.js”.</p>
<p>The network request ensures that it doesn’t miss blockers like uBlock Origin Lite, which by default will only filter network requests, not page content.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have no way to detect DNS based blocking short of loading an actual ad.
Instead, I made the message unobtrusive and easy to close.</p>
<p>The message won’t be shown in browsers that don’t support JavaScript, because those don’t need adblockers to begin with.
It should be functional without CSS, but I can’t think of any browsers that support JS but not CSS.
(but if you use external CSS, it’s quite common for the request to fail resulting in an unstyled page.)</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://stefanbohacek.com/project/detect-missing-adblocker-wordpress-plugin/">Stefan Bohacek</a> for the original idea. I’ve modified it to reduce false positives and explicitly scoped the cookie so the message is only shown once.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGztGfRujSE">introduced the Liquid Glass effect during WWDC 2025</a> in June—a stunning UI effect that makes interface elements appear to be made of curved, refractive glass. This article is a hands‑on exploration of how to recreate a similar effect on the web using CSS, SVG displacement maps, and physics-based refraction calculations.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing pixel‑perfect parity, we’ll approximate Liquid Glass, recreating the core refraction and a specular highlight, as a focused proof‑of‑concept you can extend.</p>
<p>We'll build up the effect from first principles, starting with how light bends when passing through different materials.</p>
<div><p>Chrome‑only demo</p><p>The interactive demo at the end currently works in Chrome only (due to
SVG filters as backdrop‑filter).</p><p>You can still read the article and interact with the inline
simulations in other browsers.</p></div>
<h2 id="understanding-refraction"><a href="#understanding-refraction" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Understanding Refraction</h2>
<p><strong>Refraction</strong> is what happens when light changes direction as it passes from one material to another (like from air into glass). This bending occurs because light travels at different speeds through different materials.</p>

<p>To create our glass effect, we need to define the shape of our virtual glass surface. Think of this like describing the cross-section of a lens or curved glass panel.</p>
<h2 id="surface-function"><a href="#surface-function" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Surface Function</h2>
<p>Our glass surface is described by a mathematical function that defines how thick the glass is at any point from its edge to the end of the bezel. This <strong>surface function</strong> takes a value between <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>0</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">0</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (at the outer edge) and <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> (end of bezel, start of flat surface) and returns the height of the glass at that point.</p>

<p>From the height we can calculate the angle of incidence, which is the angle between the incoming ray and the normal to the surface at that point. The normal is simply the derivative of the height function at that point, rotated by <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>90</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">-90</annotation></semantics></math></span></span> degrees:</p>

<p>We could make the surface function more complex by adding more parameters, but these four already give a good idea of how the surface shape affects the refraction.</p>
<h2 id="simulation"><a href="#simulation" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Simulation</h2>
<p>Now let's see these surface functions in action through interactive ray tracing simulations. The following visualization demonstrates how light rays behave differently as they pass through each surface type, helping us understand the practical implications of our mathematical choices.</p>

<p>From the simulation, we can see that concave surfaces push rays outside the glass; convex surfaces keep them inside.</p>
<p>We want to avoid outside displacement because it requires sampling background beyond the object. Apple’s Liquid Glass appears to favor convex profiles (except for the Switch component, covered later).</p>
<p>The background arrow indicates displacement—how far a ray lands compared to where it would have landed without glass. Color encodes magnitude (longer → more purple).</p>
<p>Take a look at symmetry: rays at the same distance from the border share the same displacement magnitude on each side. Compute once, reuse around the bezel/object.</p>
<h2 id="displacement-vector-field"><a href="#displacement-vector-field" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Displacement Vector Field</h2>
<p>Now that calculated the displacement at a distance from border, let's calculate the displacement vector field for the entire glass surface.</p>
<p>The vector field describes at every position on the glass surface how much the light ray is displaced from its original position, and in which direction. In a circle, this displacement is always orthogonal to the border.</p>
<h2 id="pre-calculating-the-displacement-magnitude"><a href="#pre-calculating-the-displacement-magnitude" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Pre-calculating the displacement magnitude</h2>
<p>Because we saw that this displacement magnitude is symmetric around the bezel, we can pre-calculate it for a range of distances from the border, on a single radius.</p>
<p>This allows us to calculate everything in two dimensions once (x and z axis), on one "half-slice" of the object, and we will the rotate these pre-calculated displacements around the z-axis.</p>
<p>The actual number of samples we need to do on a radius is of 127 ray simulations, and is determined by the constraints of the SVG Displacement Map resolution. (See next section.)</p>

<h2 id="normalizing-vectors"><a href="#normalizing-vectors" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Normalizing vectors</h2>
<p>In the above diagram, the arrows are all scaled down for visibility, so they do not overlap. This is normalization, and is also useful from a technical standpoint.</p>
<p>To use these vectors in a displacement map, we need to normalize them. Normalization means scaling the vectors so that their maximum magnitude is <span><span><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mn>1</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">1</annotation></semantics></math></span></span>, which allows us to represent them in a fixed range.</p>
<p>So we calculate the maximum displacement magnitude in our pre-calculated array:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="ts" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>const</span><span> maximumDisplacement</span><span> =</span><span> Math</span><span>.</span><span>max</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>displacementMagnitudes</span><span>);</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>And we divide each vector's magnitude by this maximum:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="ts" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>displacementVector_normalized</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  angle: </span><span>normalAtBorder</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  magnitude: </span><span>magnitude</span><span> /</span><span> maximumDisplacement</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>};</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We store <code>maximumDisplacement</code> as we will need it to re-scale the displacement map back to the actual magnitudes.</p>
<h2 id="svg-displacement-map"><a href="#svg-displacement-map" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>SVG Displacement Map</h2>
<p>Now we need to translate our mathematical refraction calculations into something the browser can actually render. We'll use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/feDisplacementMap"><strong>SVG displacement maps</strong></a>.</p>
<p>A displacement map is simply an image where each pixel's color tells the browser how far it should find the actual pixel value from its current position.</p>
<p>SVG's <code>&lt;feDisplacementMap /&gt;</code> encodes these pixels in a 32 bit RGBA image, where each channel represents a different axis of displacement.</p>
<p>It's up to the user to define which channel corresponds to which axis, but it is important to understand the constraint:
Because each channel is 8 bits, the displacement is limited to a range of -128 to 127 pixels in each direction. (256 values possible in total).
128 is the neutral value, meaning no displacement.</p>
<p>SVG filters can only use images as displacement maps, so we need to convert our displacement vector field into an image format.</p>

<h2 id="vector-to-red-green-values"><a href="#vector-to-red-green-values" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Vector to Red-Green values</h2>
<p>To convert our displacement vector field into a displacement map, we need to convert each vector into a color value. The red channel will represent the X component of the vector, and the green channel will represent the Y component.</p>
<p>We currently have polar coordinates (angle and magnitude) for each vector, so we need to convert them to Cartesian coordinates (X and Y) before mapping them to the red and green channels.</p>

<p>Because we normalised our vectors already, <code>magnitude</code> here is between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>From here, we just remap the values to the range of 0 to 255 for the red and green channels:</p>

<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre><code data-language="tsx" data-theme=""><span data-line=""><span>const</span><span> result</span><span> =</span><span> {</span></span>

<p>The final piece of our Liquid Glass effect is the <strong>specular highlight</strong>—those bright, shiny edges you see on real glass objects when light hits them at certain angles.</p>
<p>The way Apple implements it seems to be a simple rim light effect, where the highlight appears around the edges of the glass object, and its intensity varies based on the angle of the surface normal relative to a fixed light direction.</p>

<p>Both are loaded as separate <code>&lt;feImage /&gt;</code> elements, and then combined using <code>&lt;feBlend /&gt;</code> to overlay the highlight on top of the refracted image.</p>

<span data-line=""><span>  backdrop-filter</span><span>: </span><span>url</span><span>(</span><span>#liquidGlassFilterId</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The backdrop-filter dimensions does not adjust automatically to the element size, so you need to ensure that your filter images fit the size of your elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that we have all the pieces in place, we can create components that use this effect.</p>
<h2 id="bringing-it-all-together-real-ui-components"><a href="#bringing-it-all-together-real-ui-components" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Bringing It All Together: Real UI Components</h2>
<p>With our refraction math and displacement maps working, let's see how this translates to actual UI components you might use in an application.</p>
<div><p>Chrome‑specific demo</p><p>Chrome allows using SVG filters as <code>backdrop-filter</code>, which
isn’t part of the CSS spec.</p><p>Above, we used regular <code>filter</code> so it’s viewable in
Safari/Firefox.</p><p>The next components use <code>backdrop-filter</code>, so they’re
Chrome‑only.</p></div>
<p>The goal won't be to create real components for production, but just to get a taste of how the effect looks in different UI elements.</p>
<h2 id="magnifying-glass"><a href="#magnifying-glass" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Magnifying Glass</h2>
<p>This component actually uses two displacement maps: one for the refraction on the sides, and one for the zooming, which has a stronger refraction effect.</p>
<p>It also plays with shadows and scaling to create a more dynamic, interactive effect.</p>
<div><div><p><span></span><span>Optics Study</span></p><div><p>Drag the capsule to bend the page. This lens is a compact SVG displacement rig that refracts whatever sits beneath it.</p><p>The field comes from a rounded bezel profile; pixels are pushed along its gradient, then topped with a subtle specular bloom for depth.</p><p>Sweep across strong edges—high contrast makes the bend snap.</p></div></div><p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1579380656108-f98e4df8ea62?q=80&amp;w=800&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop" alt="Abstract architectural lines" loading="lazy" draggable="false"></p></div><div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.50</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>9</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p></div>
<h2 id="searchbox"><a href="#searchbox" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Searchbox</h2>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.20</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>4</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>0.70</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>1.0</span></p></div>
<h2 id="switch"><a href="#switch" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Switch</h2>
<p>This uses a lip bezel, which makes the surface convex on the outside and concave in the middle. This makes the center slider zoomed out, while the edges refract the inside.</p>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.50</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>6</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>0.2</span></p></div>
<h2 id="slider"><a href="#slider" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Slider</h2>
<p>Slider allows you to see the current level through the glass, while the sides refract the background. It uses a convex bezel.</p>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.40</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>7</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>0.0</span></p></div>
<h2 id="music-player"><a href="#music-player" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Music Player</h2>
<p>This fake music player UI tries to mimic the look of Apple Music’s Liquid Glass panels, using a convex bezel and a subtle specular highlight.</p>
<p>It relies on the iTunes Search API to fetch album art and song details.</p>
<div><p><label>Specular Opacity</label><span>0.40</span></p><p><label>Specular Saturation</label><span>6</span></p><p><label>Refraction Level</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Blur Level</label><span>1.0</span></p><p><label>Progressive Blur Strength</label><span>1.00</span></p><p><label>Glass Background Opacity</label><span>0.60</span></p></div>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This prototype distills Apple’s Liquid Glass into real‑time refraction plus a simple highlight. It’s flexible, but still Chrome‑bound—only Chromium exposes SVG filters as <code>backdrop-filter</code>. That said, it’s already viable inside Chromium‑based runtimes like Electron, elsewhere you could fake a softer fallback with layered blur.</p>
<p>Treat this strictly as experimental. Dynamic shape/size changes are currently costly because nearly every tweak (besides animating <code>&lt;filter /&gt;</code> props, like <code>scale</code>) forces a full displacement map rebuild.</p>
<p>The code needs a cleanup pass and perf work before any possible open‑source release.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading my first post—I'd genuinely love any feedback, ideas, critiques, or suggestions. If it sparked a thought or you know someone who'd enjoy this kind of deep‑dive, feel free to pass it along.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>A former top cybersecurity executive at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp" data-link-name="in body link">WhatsApp</a> filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that parent company <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link">Meta</a> disregarded internal flaws in the app’s digital defenses and exposed billions of its users. He says the company systematically violated cybersecurity regulations and retaliated against him for reporting the failures.</p><p>Attaullah Baig, who served as head of security for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/whatsapp" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">WhatsApp</a> from 2021 to 2025, claims that approximately 1,500 engineers had unrestricted access to user data without proper oversight, potentially violating a US government order that imposed a $5bn penalty on the company in 2020.</p><p>He also claimed the company failed to remedy the hacking and takeover of more than 100,000 accounts each day, ignoring his pleas and proposed fixes and choosing instead to prioritize user growth. The lawsuit, filed in US federal court in San Francisco, alleges Facebook-owner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/meta" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Meta</a> failed to implement basic cybersecurity measures, including adequate data handling and breach detection capabilities.</p><p>According to the 115-page complaint, Baig discovered through internal security testing that WhatsApp engineers could “move or steal user data” including contact information, IP addresses and profile photos “without detection or audit trail”.</p><p>The filing claims Baig repeatedly raised concerns with senior executives, including the WhatsApp head, Will Cathcart, and Meta CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/mark-zuckerberg" data-link-name="in body link">Mark Zuckerberg</a>. Meta acquired Whatsapp for $19bn in 2014. The app now boasts three billion users, according to Meta.</p><p>WhatsApp’s vice president of communications Carl Woog wrote in a statement, “Sadly this is a familiar playbook in which a former employee is dismissed for poor performance and then goes public with distorted claims that misrepresent the ongoing hard work of our team.”</p><p>Baig alleges he faced escalating retaliation after his initial reports in 2021, including negative performance reviews, verbal warnings and ultimately termination in February 2025 for apparent “poor performance”.</p><p>The company emphasized that Baig left due to poor performance, with multiple senior engineers independently validating that his work was below expectations. Meta noted in a statement that the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration dismissed Baig’s initial complaint, finding that it had not retaliated against him.</p><p>Before joining Meta, Baig worked in cybersecurity roles at PayPal, Capital One and other major financial institutions.</p><p>He filed complaints with federal regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission before pursuing the current litigation.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The case adds to ongoing scrutiny of Meta’s data protection practices across its platforms, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, serving billions of users globally.</p><p>Meta agreed to the 2020 government settlement following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved improper harvesting of data from 50 million Facebook users. The consent order remains in effect until 2040.</p><p>In his whistleblower complaint, Baig is requesting reinstatement, back pay and compensatory damages, along with potential regulatory enforcement action against the company.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>This is an article about Silksong, the new game from Team Cherry / the much awaited sequel to Hollow Knight. You may have heard of it even if you aren’t in the gaming sphere, because so many people were trying to download the game on release that virtually all digital marketplaces buckled under the load. But before we talk about Silksong, I want to start by talking about the startup world.</p><p><span>One thing that may not be obvious for people who are not in the startup world is that building a consumer facing company is very different from building a b2b company, especially when it comes to sales. Selling to businesses is very easy. You go to a business and you say "hey, you like making money?" And the business will say "why yes, I do like making money" and you will say "great, I can help you make more money. If you give me $X, I think I can make you more than $X in return." And the business owner will evaluate if you are full of shit or not, and will then give you some cash. By contrast, selling to consumers is really hard, because it's never really clear why a consumer is using or buying your product to begin with. The conversation about money above doesn't really work. Sure, </span><em>some</em><span> people buy products because they think said products will save them money. But people will buy products for status, or because they think doing so will get them laid, or because it will get their parents off their back, or because they want to be entertained, or even for no particular reason at all.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png" width="901" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:901,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:520611,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://theahura.substack.com/i/173048532?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!64Vd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb24064-bb16-4f7b-8483-ba157707a20c_901x572.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“Consumers behave like rational actors” is total bullshit. </figcaption></figure></div><p><span>And some people will pay for your product even if it actively causes them pain and stress, or maybe </span><em>because</em><span> it causes them pain and stress.

The movement is so buttery smooth that simply getting back to the boss that just ripped you to shreds is a complex, skillful, and fundamentally enjoyable experience. Which is good, because you make that trek a lot.</p><p><span>I think the best games are </span><em>expressive</em><span> in some way. When you play the game, you constantly make choices about what you're doing that reflect your mastery and the way you choose to interact. This is very obvious in multiplayer or team games. Like, consider dunking in basketball. No one dunks because they need to. They do it because it feels fantastic to be so good at the game that you can literally dunk on your opponents, which is also why the phrase "dunk on &lt;person/people&gt;" has entered the lexicon. I'm not particularly athletic, so I can't dunk. But I imagine a close equivalent — in the dopamine receptor, brain psychiatry sense — is landing a crazy combo spike in Super Smash Bros. I love pulling off a spike. The blast of light from off screen. The crashing sound. Even the little trail that comes off your opponent as they go shooting down. All of this culminates in a shot of adrenaline and morale for you, and the hopeless feeling of devastation for your opponent.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif" width="480" height="270" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:270,&quot;width&quot;:480,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tPc2!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F04597faf-838a-45ed-b1de-294e1b18f73b_480x270.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Basketball and Smash Bros don't have a lot in common.

You could do a long jump. You could jump and dash. You could sprint-jump. You could short jump, grab the first platform wall, jump off, and dash back to the second platform. You could short jump, hit the edge of the first platform, spring off it, and land on the second. You could short jump, grab the edge of the first platform, spring off it, dash, then attack-downwards to get to the ground faster. There are so many options, so many ways of getting around, so many opportunities to show off your reaction time and scrape off frames on how quickly you get from point A to point B. Something as simple as jumping on a ledge becomes a display of technical mastery.</p><p>The only other videogames that have this much focus on movement alone are the Mario 3D platformers — Mario 64, Mario Sunshine, Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, and Mario Odyssey. There, the focus on movement is extremely intentional. Nintendo devs will spend months polishing Mario's movement in simple, empty rooms. They only build the rest of the game when the movement feels perfect.</p><p>Miyamoto back in 1996:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Miyamoto: </strong><span>That’s how we make games at Nintendo, though: we get the fundamentals solid first, then do as much with that core concept as our time and ambition will allow.</span></p><p><strong>Interviewer: </strong><span>And in this case, that fundamental basis was the model you made with Mario and Luigi running around that room.</span></p><p><strong>Miyamoto:</strong><span> Yes, it was being able to move Mario and Luigi around with the 3D control stick, and being able to change the camera view with the press of a button. One of our big development themes was letting the players move Mario around any way they wanted. We wanted to make a game where just moving Mario around was fun.</span></p></blockquote><p>And again in 2007:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Miyamoto:</strong><span> The good part about Mario 64, was how you were able to freely move Mario around, who was now in 3D for the first time. Being very blunt about this, I actually felt at one point that this didn’t really have to be a game.</span></p><p><strong>Iwata:</strong><span> You felt that it was so fun being able to move Mario around, it didn’t need anything else.</span></p><p><strong>Miyamoto:</strong><span> Right. There was no other game before Mario 64, where you were able to truly move around freely in a 3D environment. It was great just being able to move Mario to find a star.</span></p></blockquote><p>This kind of deep, intricate movement is a fantastic match for the Metroidvania genre. There are dozens of ways to move through any single room, which means even when you're backtracking through old territory you never really feel bored. To be honest, I find myself enjoying how quickly I can move through a familiar room, deftly bouncing from one wall to the next as I make my way to my nearly-inevitable demise at the hands of some boss.</p><p>That's the other part of all this, the boss fights. Have I mentioned how difficult these boss fights are? But here too, the movement is a fantastic fit and a saving grace.</p><p><span>Difficult games are not created equal. Many games are </span><em>artificially</em><span> difficult. It's not that they require more skill or more expertise or more practice. Rather, they are poorly built, which results in unpredictable consequences. The most common example of artificial difficulty is shitty hitboxes. You expect to land on a ledge but you fall through. You think you'll dodge an attack but it hits you anyway. You fire a shot that passes through an enemy without doing anything at all. I love </span><em>Don't Starve Together</em><span>, it is a fantastic game, but it has some of the most atrocious hitboxes I have ever seen in a game ever. There are so many times where I am confident that I am out of range of an attack, only to die anyway.

Everyone knows what the </span><em>ideal </em><span>is. You want every pixel to have 'mass', as if it was part of a real-world object, regardless of how complicated your character model is or how fluid your animations are. But if you try to handle collisions for every pixel, you will rapidly bump up against the hard reality of CPU processing power. That in turn causes frame drops and input lag, which together are the </span><em>second </em><span>most common example of artificial difficulty. </span></p><p><span>Still, as a consumer, my sympathy only extends so far. Games that are artificially difficult feel </span><em>unfair</em><span>. Especially if the game simply requires a level of precision to proceed. In fact, as a general rule, the more a game requires precision, the more important it is to have </span><em>extremely </em><span>dialed in hitboxes and a </span><em>really </em><span>consistently</span><em> </em><span>high framerate. If I am constantly dying to shitboxes or lag, I will stop playing the game, because the tight connection between 'do thing' and 'predictable outcome' and 'dopamine lights up' begins to unravel.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png" width="440" height="960" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:960,&quot;width&quot;:440,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QkeT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4d2f89f-c3d6-4fed-867a-3f8024b03e12_440x960.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Blue boxes are ‘hurt boxes’, i.e. where the character can take damage. Red boxes are ‘hit boxes’, i.e. where the character does damage. Some games are better at this than others.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>They will have to invent new numbers to describe the amount of times that I have died to Silksong's gauntlet of bosses. But I have never, not a single time, felt like any of those deaths were </span><em>unfair</em><span>. Silksong's movement is so finely tuned and so precise that I know deep in my bones that any hit or death is entirely on me. Of course, that in turn makes tangible improvement extremely visible. You go into a boss fight and die, and then you die again, and then again. Each time you get a bit further, and do a few more hits. And slowly, finally, painfully, you come out on top victorious. The game does not pull any punches, so if you win it's entirely because you have developed your expertise to the point where the impossible became possible. As a result, the joy of beating a Silksong boss is perhaps unrivaled in gaming, akin to Sisyphus finally rolling his boulder up the mountain and resting while gazing at the view…only to then encounter the next boss and do it all again.</span></p><p><span>To say that Silksong is not for everyone is an understatement. Silksong is a love letter to exactly one kind of gamer: the perfectionist. You could play Silksong's predecessor, Hollow Knight, and not be all that good at it. Hollow Knight was a tough game, but I think you could get through it and fall in love with the environmental story telling and the lore and the music and characters. Silksong has all of this in spades, too, but it is so damn hard that you will not be able to </span><em>access </em><span>any of it unless you are willing to put in some serious effort. As a result, I suspect many of the people who enjoyed Hollow Knight will actually bounce off Silksong precisely because it is so hard, and they simply won't have the tenacity. You have to be motivated by mastery. You have to seek out improvement. And most of all, you have to love pain.</span></p><p>But for us few who manage to make the climb, I think it will be worth it.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>
