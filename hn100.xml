            <article id="note-content"><h2>How to write a good design document</h2>
<p>This essay is a version of <a href="https://x.com/GrantSlatton/status/1829941438848909778">the response</a> I gave to my friend Vik's call for suggestions:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">had a lot of people ask how they can learn to write design docs, and i didn’t have a good answer besides “work at a place with writing culture and smart senior engineers”. anyone have more useful advice? <a href="https://t.co/7F9BV31shv">https://t.co/7F9BV31shv</a></p>— vik (@vikhyatk) <a href="https://twitter.com/vikhyatk/status/1829873886957355139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote> 
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>A design document is a technical report that outlines the implementation strategy of a system in the context of trade-offs and constraints.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>Think of a design document like a proof in mathematics. The goal of a proof is to convince the reader that the theorem is true. The goal of a design document is to convince the reader the design is optimal given the situation.</p>
<p>The most important person to convince is <em>the author</em>. The act of writing a design document helps to add rigor to what are otherwise vague intuitions. Writing reveals how sloppy your thinking was (and later, code will show how sloppy your writing was).</p>
<h2>Organization</h2>
<p>Good design document organization is as important as code organization. You probably have opinions about code organization. You've probably used the phrase "spaghetti code" to describe poorly-organized code. Most programmers write "spaghetti design docs" unless they've had a lot of practice.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate a common code organization issue some programmers run into on their first day. The novice writes</p>
<pre><code>terminal.print("Hello world")
</code></pre>
<p>Then they decide they want to make the text red, so they edit their program to</p>
<pre><code>terminal.print("Hello world")
terminal.setPrintColor("red")
</code></pre>
<p>And then they're confused that it didn't come out red. They haven't internalized that the first line of code <em>happens before</em> the second. They just get a soup of code on the screen that kind of has the ingredients for a program, and expect the computer to do what they want.</p>
<p>Novice document writers make the <em>exact</em> same mistake, but with prose instead of code. They get a soup of sentences and paragraphs and expect the reader's brain to do what they want.</p>
<p>If the reader is smart enough, you might actually get away with this. Just like an expert programmer can mentally untangle spaghetti code.</p>
<p>But a perfect doc is written such that the reader <em>is never surprised</em>. The reader should find that every sentence flows obviously from the previous ones. They should finish your doc and think "well this was entirely straightforward, why did we even need to have this meeting?".</p>
<p>This disappoints the ego-seeking behavior of many engineers. Good engineers often want people to realize how clever they were.</p>
<p>But a good doc will lay out the problem and mental models in a way that the solution that took weeks of hard thought to invent will be clear to the reader by the time the doc presents it.</p>
<p>This also requires having a good model of the minds of the people reading your doc. The goal of your doc is to take their minds from their current state to a new state in which they believe your design is a good one.</p>
<p>You should anticipate every objection someone would have and preemptively show why it's invalid, so that the reader never even thinks to bring it up.</p>
<p>Many engineers fail at modeling the starting state of their readers' minds, so fail at getting them to the destination state.</p>
<h2>Editing</h2>
<p>Once you've got the information organized and laid out properly, the next step is to edit for length. Remove every word that can be removed. Do this because your readers' attention is a scarce resource.</p>
<p>Unless you're an unusually terse writer, you can almost always cut length by ~30% from the first draft without sacrificing information.</p>
<p>The easiest way to get good at editing by going through <em>other</em> people's docs with a red pen and crossing out unnecessary words. You'll find tons. It's easier to criticize other people.</p>
<p>Once you've built this muscle, you can turn the weapon on yourself. Distilling thoughts to fit into the 280 character tweet limit is also surprisingly good practice.</p>
<h2>Volume</h2>
<p>There's no substitute for lots of practice. I'm grateful for having worked at AWS with a unique doc-writing culture. The first docs I wrote there were terrible, but after a few hundred, I like to think they were pretty good.</p>
<p>For unfamiliar readers: Amazon meetings start with the presenter passing out copies (historically physical, though increasingly digital since Covid) of a prose document. The document is 1-6 pages depending on the importance.</p>
<p>The meeting starts with everyone sitting in silence, reading the document, and adding notes and questions in the margins with red pen. Watching people mark up the document you spent so much time polishing is a <em>strong</em> forcing function to become a better writer.</p>
<h2>Concrete tips</h2>
<p>These work for me, but they may not work for you.</p>
<h3>Use short paragraphs</h3>
<p>You should think of your doc as a series of bullet points that flow into each other. That is, a doc might be organized like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Observation A</li>
<li>Observation B</li>
<li>Because B, idea C</li>
<li>But problems D and E</li>
<li>Observation F</li>
<li>Therefore idea G</li>
<li>And improvement H</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of those bullets should be a paragraph that can be summarized in a single sentence. It doesn't need to <em>be</em> a single sentence — you can elaborate where necessary. But, once read, the reader should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
<p>This is related to the idea of editing, and that your reader's attention is a scarce resource. Your reader has a finite amount of stuff they can juggle in short-term memory. Writing in this "one idea per paragraph" style allows the reader to compress the paragraph and thus consume less of this scarce resource.</p>
<h3>Use an appendix</h3>
<p>If there is some number in the doc that is the result of a complex calculation or simulation, don't include that in the body of the doc. Use a footnote like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A monte-carlo simulation[1] showed the probability of data loss due to corruption is less than 1 in 10^12</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then describe the simulation in more detail in the appendix. The appendix should not be necessary to read to understand the main conclusion of the doc. It's only there for the curious reader to check your work if they want.</p>
<h3>Worked editing example</h3>
<p>Here's a paragraph from above before I edited it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each one of those bullet points should be its own paragraph in your doc. And each paragraph should be summarizable in a single sentence. The paragraph doesn't need to actually <em>be</em> a single sentence. For example, you might include a few more sentences to really illustrate the whole concept you're trying to convey. But, once the reader has read it, they should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here is the edited version that conveys the exact same information, but smaller:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each of those bullets should be a paragraph that can be summarized in a single sentence. It doesn't need to <em>be</em> a single sentence — you can elaborate where necessary. But, once read, the reader should be able to compress it to a single sentence in their mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Happy writing!</h2>

          <p dir="ltr">New findings from studying over two decades of satellite observations reveal that the Earth’s continents have experienced unprecedented freshwater loss since 2002, driven by climate change, unsustainable groundwater use and extreme droughts.</p><p dir="ltr">The study, led by Arizona State University and published today in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx0298">Science Advances</a>, highlights the emergence of four continental-scale “mega-drying” regions, all located in the Northern Hemisphere, and warns of severe consequences for water security, agriculture, sea-level rise and global stability.</p><p dir="ltr">The research team reports that drying areas on land are expanding at a rate roughly twice the size of California every year. And, the rate at which dry areas are getting drier now outpaces the rate at which wet areas are getting wetter, reversing long-standing hydrological patterns.</p><p dir="ltr">The negative implications of this for available freshwater are staggering. Seventy-five percent of the world’s population lives in 101 countries that have been losing freshwater for the past 22 years. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population">United Nations</a>, the world’s population is expected to continue to grow for the next 50 to 60 years — at the same time the availability of freshwater is dramatically shrinking.</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers identified the type of water loss on land, and for the first time, found that 68% came from groundwater alone — contributing more to sea level rise than glaciers and ice caps on land.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“These findings send perhaps the most alarming message yet about the impact of climate change on our water resources,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.asu.edu/experts/jay-famiglietti">Jay Famiglietti</a>, the study’s principal investigator and a Global Futures Professor with the ASU <a href="https://schoolofsustainability.asu.edu/">School of Sustainability</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">“Continents are drying, freshwater availability is shrinking, and sea-level rise is accelerating. The consequences of continued groundwater overuse could undermine food and water security for billions of people around the world. This is an ‘all-hands-on-deck’ moment — we need immediate action on global water security.”</p><p dir="ltr">The researchers evaluated more than two decades of data from U.S.-German Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE-Follow On (GRACE-FO) missions, looking at how and why terrestrial water storage has changed since 2002. Terrestrial water storage includes all of Earth’s surface and vegetation water, soil moisture, ice, snow and groundwater stored on land.</p>

<p dir="ltr">“It is striking how much nonrenewable water we are losing,” said Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, lead author of the study and a research scientist for ASU.</p><p dir="ltr">“Glaciers and deep groundwater are sort of ancient trust funds. Instead of using them only in times of need, such as a prolonged drought, we are taking them for granted," he said. "Also, we are not trying to replenish the groundwater systems during wet years and thus edging towards an imminent freshwater bankruptcy.”</p><p><h4>Tipping point and worsening continental drying</h4></p><p dir="ltr">The study identified what seems to be a tipping point around 2014–15 during a time considered “mega El-Niño” years. Climate extremes began accelerating and in response, groundwater use increased and continental drying exceeded the rates of glacier and ice sheet melting.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the study revealed a previously unreported oscillation where after 2014, drying regions flipped from being located mostly in the Southern Hemisphere to mostly in the north, and vice versa for wet regions.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the key drivers contributing to continental drying is the increasing extremes of drought in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, for example, in Europe. Additionally, in Canada and Russia, snow, ice and permafrost melting increased over the last decade, and the continued depletion of groundwater globally is a major factor.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0123-1">previous study</a>, members of the team studied terrestrial water storage from satellite data spanning 2002–2016. In the new study, the team looked at more than 20 years of data and discovered a critical, major development in continental drying. Several regional drying patterns and previously identified localized "hot spots" for terrestrial water storage loss are now interconnected — forming the four continental-scale mega-drying regions.</p><p dir="ltr">These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Southwestern North America and Central America</strong>: This region includes major food-producing regions across the American Southwest, along with major desert cities, such as Phoenix, Tucson and Las Vegas, and major metropolitan areas, such as Los Angeles and Mexico City.</li><li><strong>Alaska and Northern Canada</strong>: This region includes melting alpine glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia, snow and permafrost melting across the Canadian high latitudes, and drying in major agricultural regions, such as British Columbia and Saskatchewan.</li><li><strong>Northern Russia</strong>: This region is experiencing major snow and permafrost melting across the high latitudes.</li><li><strong>Middle East-North Africa (MENA) Pan-Eurasia</strong>: This region includes major desert cities, including Dubai, Casablanca, Cairo, Baghdad and Tehran; major food-producing regions, including Ukraine, northwest India and China’s North China Plain region; the shrinking Caspian and Aral Seas; and major cities, such as Barcelona, Paris, Berlin, Dhaka and Beijing.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In fact, the study showed that since 2002, only the tropics have continued to get wetter on average by latitude, something not predicted by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate models — sophisticated computer programs used to project future climate scenarios.&nbsp;Continuous records are critical in understanding the long-term changes in the water cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">"This study really shows how important it is to have continuous observations of a variable such as terrestrial water storage," Chandanpurkar said. "GRACE records are really getting to the length where we are able to robustly see long-term trends from climate variability. More in-situ observations and data sharing would further support in making this separation and inform water management."</p><div><h4>Why this research matters</h4><p dir="ltr">Research is the invisible hand that powers America’s progress.

The current study highlights the need for ongoing research at scale to inform policymakers and communities about worsening water challenges and opportunities to create meaningful change.</p><p dir="ltr">“This research matters. It clearly shows that we urgently need new policies and groundwater management strategies on a global scale,” said Famiglietti, who is also with the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory and a former senior water scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “While efforts to mitigate climate change are facing challenges, we can address continental drying by implementing new policies around regional and international groundwater sustainability. In turn, this will slow the rate of sea-level rise and help preserve water for future generations.”</p><p dir="ltr">The study calls for immediate action to slow and reverse groundwater depletion, protect remaining freshwater resources and adapt to the growing risk of water scarcity and coastal flooding. The research team goes on to say that strategic water management, international cooperation and sustainable policies are essential to preserving water for future generations and mitigating further damage to planetary systems.</p><p dir="ltr">The research will also support an upcoming World Bank Group flagship report that will delve deeper into these findings, including the human and economic implications of continental drying, and present actionable solutions for countries to address the growing freshwater crisis.</p><div><h4>About the study</h4><p dir="ltr">The findings are based on over 22 years of terrestrial water storage data from U.S.-German GRACE and GRACE-FO satellite missions. The full report details the scientific analyses and regional breakdowns of the drying trends, which have proven robust and persistent despite climate variability.</p><p dir="ltr">The research team includes scientists from Arizona State University; Hrishikesh A. Chandanpurkar, FLAME University; John T. Reager and David N. Wiese, JPL; Kaushik Gopalan and Yoshihide Wada, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology; Kauru Kakinuma, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; and Fan Zhang, The World Bank.</p><p dir="ltr">This research was funded by the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Futures Laboratory at Arizona State University, the GRACE Follow-On Science Team and World Bank Global Water Monitoring.</p></div>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Let’s just hop right into it and start with my boldest claim of the summer:</p><blockquote><p><strong>By 2040, the U.S. dollar will no longer be the global reserve currency.</strong></p></blockquote><p>And maybe an even spicier take:</p><blockquote><p><strong>It might not even be the default unit of exchange for Americans back home.</strong></p></blockquote><p><em>Gasp.</em><span> What did he say?! No more Hamiltons for morning Starbucks? No Benjamins for blackjack at Bally’s?! Say it ain’t so. </span></p><p>If you know me personally, you’ve probably heard me spitballing versions of this since we lit the dollar on fire during COVID.</p><p><span>But </span><strong>the last four months</strong><span> have crystallized something for me: this isn’t just some long arc of decline we’ll debate from our rocking chairs. It’s happening. It’s happening now. It will absolutely happen within our lifetime, and I expect likely in the next decade.</span></p><p><span>Before I throw down my 8-Mile-style rap battle against the greenback, I want to call out that </span><strong>there are many dissenters</strong><span>. Plenty of people, who are more credentialed than me on this topic, </span><strong>think I’m</strong><span> </span><strong>totally wrong</strong><span>. Over the last few years I’ve floated this theory in conversation with investment bankers, Fed economists, Treasury staffers, economic historians — all people with front-row seats to the fiscal drama, who in principle should know better.</span></p><p>Without fail, they give me a tight-lipped smirk that says: “cute theory, but the dollar’s not going anywhere”, citing the shear volume of sovereign reserves denominated in USD, the dependence of the global financial system on T-Bills and long-dated treasuries, the lack of a legitimate competitor that can meet the sheer volume of international trade and FX swaps. </p><p><span>They all say the same thing, and all cite the same facts and numbers. </span><em><strong>And that, right there, is exactly why the dollar will be no more.</strong></em></p><p><span>This way of thinking belongs to the category of Dumb Rules™ — the kinds of beliefs that become institutional dogma long after their founding logic has withered. And I’d place “</span><em><strong>The dollar is irreplaceable</strong></em><span>” right at the top of that pile.</span></p><p>So let’s look at three facts that, taken together, tell a different story.</p><p><span>Let’s start on </span><em><strong>Liberation Day</strong><span>, </span><strong>April 2, 2025</strong><span> </span></em><span>(not to be confused with the day before, April Fools Day). </span></p><p>As an aside, “Liberation Day”, has to be one of my favorite Trumpisms — because it was, in fact, a kind of liberation. Not from tyranny or communism or anything drammatic — but from Common Knowledge. Namely, the post WWII belief that free trade is good, globalism is a rising tide that lifts all boats, and that American’s back home are better off using their fingers to scroll iPhone screens, than screw in the bolts near the power jack. </p><p>I digress.</p><p><span>When Trump announced sweeping tariffs (or really just gestured aggressively in their direction, see </span><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_Always_Chickens_Out" rel="">TACO</a></strong><span>), markets freaked out. The S&amp;P dropped over 12%. And that made sense — tariffs should shift prices up, and price hikes should in principle suppress consumer demand.

This will be immediately priced in by the bond market, and long term yields will spike in order to get a real return. </span></p></blockquote><p>In short, we have already reached the point of no return - and I think the 10-year will continue to rise:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png" width="868" height="592" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:592,&quot;width&quot;:868,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:122831,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://mathmeetsmoney.substack.com/i/169930545?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!g-lG!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fde4016-c918-4758-994f-b41e9ecdc0c3_868x592.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The bond market has boarded ship — and principled monetary policy is no longer in control. The days of an inverted yield curve are over. The tail now wags the dog.</p><p><span>These dynamics in the bond market are the first domino to fall, and they signal something the US Treasury Department </span><em><strong>already knew</strong></em><span> in the last administration. Janet Yellen’s decision to issue </span><strong>mostly short-dated bonds</strong><span> even when interest rates were scraping the floor following COVID. </span></p><p>Seems insane, right? Why lock in short-term liabilities when long-term money was practically free after the pandemic?</p><p>Because Treasury saw the elephant in the room. As Janet shopped around bonds to anyone that would take a meeting, China, Japan, Europe — there was no appetite for 30 year U.S. bonds with interest rates under 2% when Debt-to-GDP was above 120% following COVID stimulus. The market wouldn’t touch them — even if we asked.</p><p><em><strong>So it wasn’t worth asking</strong></em><span> — because again, at this point, Treasury and Fed are just managing optics. So instead of refinancing our liabilities at historic lows, we front-loaded the interest burden. Which means the window for monetary discretion — raising or lowering rates, modulating the money supply, nudging inflation — is effectively closed. </span></p><p><span>At this point, lowering rates will be seen as an inflationary signal, and the bond market will punish us in turn. </span><strong><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/weak-demand-japans-40-year-debt-auction-shows-fiscal-stress-2025-05-28/" rel="">Just ask Japan</a></strong><span>. </span></p><p><span>So we have a predicament - </span><strong>we can’t lower rates</strong><span> anymore without spiking long term yields - and </span><strong>we can’t hike rates</strong><span> without blowing up the budget with debt servicing payments. Why? Because the last time we hiked rates to save the dollar, we were in a completely different fiscal position. </span></p><p>Take a look at the Debt/GDP since the 60s,</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

In fact, </span><em><strong>all of the increases to Debt/GDP</strong></em><span> have come in the first term of US presidents:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Fact 1</strong><span>: First-term presidents grow the nominal debt by ~13% per year.</span></p><p><strong>Fact 2</strong><span>: Second-term presidents grow it by ~6% per year.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>In other words, while governing is expensive, it’s manageable (nominal GDP has grown at 6% a year dating back to the 1950s) — </span><strong>but fulfilling campaign promises is reckless</strong><span>. And yes, I would consider Trump 47 a second round at a </span><strong>first-term presidency</strong><span> — and when viewed in those terms, the spending in the </span><strong><a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/cbo-score-shows-senate-obbba-adds-over-39-trillion-debt" rel="">OBBB</a></strong><span> is par for the course.</span></p><p>This is nothing new. </p><p><span>Our political system </span><em>encourages</em><span> irresponsible spending every time power changes hands. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Inflation Reduction Act — massive trillion-dollar bills dropped in politically volatile environments. Because no one wants to be the adult in the room anymore and say “you know all those things I campaigned on? It turns out we can’t afford it”. </span></p><p>So this brings us to my second projection:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Projection 2</strong><span>: </span><em><span>Election cycles for the next 20 years will remained deadlocked at a 50/50 toss up. The tie break will be given to whoever moderate and centrist voters hate the least — i.e. </span><strong>the new and unvetted candidate</strong><span>. As we oscillate back and forth between one four-year term after another, the new administration will do what they’ve done for 50 years —</span></em><span> </span><em><strong>spend without abandon</strong><span>, only to get voted out before they had time to realize they represented The People, not The Party. </span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>When no one wants to be the adult, the kids run the house - and </span><em><strong>kids don’t worry about paying down the mortgage</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>And sadly, the adults in the room are slowly getting cannibalized by the Lost Boys.</p><p><em><strong>This, to me, is the final nail.</strong></em></p><p>The Fed is the last American institution left with any pretense of independence. But in the past year, we've seen that too begin to crack. The Administration publicly criticizes the Fed’s decisions, which I will admit is not new (Reagan was a very vocal critic of Volcker’s Fed, and even suggested he would “go visit them in-person” like a mob boss — which at the time was unheard of). </p><p><span>However, </span><em><strong>what is new</strong></em><span> is fabricating grounds for a premature dismissal — with talk of firing Jerome Powell “for cause.” Indeed, we just saw the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics pushed out for alleged political bias — on grounds that the very data that can inform the Federal Reserve committee was itself politically biased. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> <p><img src="https://kashw1n.com/static/nodejs-2025.png" alt="Modern Node.js development workflow" width="400"></p><p>Node.js has undergone a remarkable transformation since its early days. If you’ve been writing Node.js for several years, you’ve likely witnessed this evolution firsthand—from the callback-heavy, CommonJS-dominated landscape to today’s clean, standards-based development experience.</p>
<p>The changes aren’t just cosmetic; they represent a fundamental shift in how we approach server-side JavaScript development. Modern Node.js embraces web standards, reduces external dependencies, and provides a more intuitive developer experience. Let’s explore these transformations and understand why they matter for your applications in 2025.</p>
<h2 id="1-module-system-esm-is-the-new-standard">1. Module System: ESM is the New Standard</h2>
<p>The module system is perhaps where you’ll notice the biggest difference. CommonJS served us well, but ES Modules (ESM) have become the clear winner, offering better tooling support and alignment with web standards.</p>
<h3 id="the-old-way-commonjs">The Old Way (CommonJS)</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how we used to structure modules. This approach required explicit exports and synchronous imports:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// math.js</span></span>
<span><span>function</span><span> add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> a</span><span> +</span><span> b</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span> =</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> };</span></span>

<p>This worked fine, but it had limitations—no static analysis, no tree-shaking, and it didn’t align with browser standards.</p>
<h3 id="the-modern-way-es-modules-with-node-prefix">The Modern Way (ES Modules with Node: Prefix)</h3>
<p>Modern Node.js development embraces ES Modules with a crucial addition—the <code>node:</code> prefix for built-in modules. This explicit naming prevents confusion and makes dependencies crystal clear:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// math.js</span></span>
<span><span>export</span><span> function</span><span> add</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>, </span><span>b</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  return</span><span> a</span><span> +</span><span> b</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// app.js</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>add</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> './math.js'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>readFile</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:fs/promises'</span><span>;  </span><span>// Modern node: prefix</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>createServer</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:http'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>, </span><span>3</span><span>));</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>node:</code> prefix is more than just a convention—it’s a clear signal to both developers and tools that you’re importing Node.js built-ins rather than npm packages. This prevents potential conflicts and makes your code more explicit about its dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="top-level-await-simplifying-initialization">Top-Level Await: Simplifying Initialization</h3>
<p>One of the most game-changing features is top-level await. No more wrapping your entire application in an async function just to use await at the module level:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// app.js - Clean initialization without wrapper functions</span></span>
<span><span>import</span><span> { </span><span>readFile</span><span> } </span><span>from</span><span> 'node:fs/promises'</span><span>;</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> config</span><span> =</span><span> JSON</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>await</span><span> readFile</span><span>(</span><span>'config.json'</span><span>, </span><span>'utf8'</span><span>));</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> server</span><span> =</span><span> createServer</span><span>(</span><span>/* ... */</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'App started with config:'</span><span>, </span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>appName</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This eliminates the common pattern of immediately-invoked async function expressions (IIFE) that we used to see everywhere. Your code becomes more linear and easier to reason about.</p>
<h2 id="2-built-in-web-apis-reducing-external-dependencies">2. Built-in Web APIs: Reducing External Dependencies</h2>
<p>Node.js has embraced web standards in a big way, bringing APIs that web developers already know directly into the runtime. This means fewer dependencies and more consistency across environments.</p>
<h3 id="fetch-api-no-more-http-library-dependencies">Fetch API: No More HTTP Library Dependencies</h3>
<p>Remember when every project needed axios, node-fetch, or similar libraries for HTTP requests? Those days are over. Node.js now includes the Fetch API natively:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Old way - external dependencies required</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> axios</span><span> =</span><span> require</span><span>(</span><span>'axios'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> axios</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'https://api.example.com/data'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Modern way - built-in fetch with enhanced features</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://api.example.com/data'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> data</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>But the modern approach goes beyond just replacing your HTTP library. You get sophisticated timeout and cancellation support built-in:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>async</span><span> function</span><span> fetchData</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  try</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> response</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>, {</span></span>

<span><span>    });</span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>!</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>ok</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      throw</span><span> new</span><span> Error</span><span>(</span><span>`HTTP </span><span>${</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>status</span><span>}</span><span>: </span><span>${</span><span>response</span><span>.</span><span>statusText</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    </span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> await</span><span> response</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>();</span></span>
<span><span>  } </span><span>catch</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> ===</span><span> 'TimeoutError'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>      throw</span><span> new</span><span> Error</span><span>(</span><span>'Request timed out'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    throw</span><span> error</span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This approach eliminates the need for timeout libraries and provides a consistent error handling experience. The <code>AbortSignal.timeout()</code> method is particularly elegant—it creates a signal that automatically aborts after the specified time.</p>
<h3 id="abortcontroller-graceful-operation-cancellation">AbortController: Graceful Operation Cancellation</h3>
<p>Modern applications need to handle cancellation gracefully, whether it’s user-initiated or due to timeouts. AbortController provides a standardized way to cancel operations:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>// Cancel long-running operations cleanly</span></span>
<span><span>const</span><span> controller</span><span> =</span><span> new</span><span> AbortController</span><span>();</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>// Set up automatic cancellation</span></span>
<span><span>setTimeout</span><span>(() </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> controller</span><span>.</span><span>abort</span><span>(), </span><span>10000</span><span>);</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>try</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  const</span><span> data</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> fetch</span><span>(</span><span>'https://slow-api.com/data'</span><span>, {</span></span>
<span><span>    signal</span><span>: </span><span>controller</span><span>.</span><span>signal</span></span>
<span><span>  });</span></span>
<span><span>  console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Data received:'</span><span>, </span><span>data</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>} </span><span>catch</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>  if</span><span> (</span><span>error</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span> ===</span><span> 'AbortError'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>    console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>'Request was cancelled - this is expected behavior'</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  } </span><span>else</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    console</span><span>.</span><span>error</span><span>(</span><span>'Unexpected error:'</span><span>, </span><span>error</span><span>);</span></span>
<span><span>  }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This pattern works across many Node.js APIs, not just fetch. You can use the same AbortController with file operations, database queries, and any async operation that supports cancellation.</p>
<h2 id="3-built-in-testing-professional-testing-without-external-dependencies">3. Built-in Testing: Professional Testing Without External Dependencies</h2>
<p>Testing used to require choosing between Jest, Mocha, Ava, or other frameworks. Node.js now includes a full-featured test runner that covers most testing needs without any external dependencies.</p>
<h3 id="modern-testing-with-nodejs-built-in-test-runner">Modern Testing with Node.js Built-in Test Runner</h3>
<p>The built-in test runner provides a clean, familiar API that feels modern and complete:</p>

<p>What makes this particularly powerful is how seamlessly it integrates with the Node.js development workflow:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="bash"><code><span><span># Run all tests with built-in runner</span></span>

<h2 id="4-sophisticated-asynchronous-patterns">4. Sophisticated Asynchronous Patterns</h2>
<p>While async/await isn’t new, the patterns around it have matured significantly. Modern Node.js development leverages these patterns more effectively and combines them with newer APIs.</p>
<h3 id="asyncawait-with-enhanced-error-handling">Async/Await with Enhanced Error Handling</h3>
<p>Modern error handling combines async/await with sophisticated error recovery and parallel execution patterns:</p>

<span></span></code></pre>
<p>This pattern combines parallel execution for performance with comprehensive error handling. The <code>Promise.all()</code> ensures that independent operations run concurrently, while the try/catch provides a single point for error handling with rich context.</p>
<h3 id="modern-event-handling-with-asynciterators">Modern Event Handling with AsyncIterators</h3>
<p>Event-driven programming has evolved beyond simple event listeners. AsyncIterators provide a more powerful way to handle streams of events:</p>

<p>As we look at the current state of Node.js development, several key principles emerge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Web Standards</strong>: Use <code>node:</code> prefixes, fetch API, AbortController, and Web Streams for better compatibility and reduced dependencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage Built-in Tools</strong>: The test runner, watch mode, and environment file support reduce external dependencies and configuration complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think in Modern Async Patterns</strong>: Top-level await, structured error handling, and async iterators make code more readable and maintainable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use Worker Threads Strategically</strong>: For CPU-intensive tasks, worker threads provide true parallelism without blocking the main thread</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adopt Progressive Enhancement</strong>: Use permission models, diagnostics channels, and performance monitoring to build robust, observable applications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Optimize for Developer Experience</strong>: Watch mode, built-in testing, and import maps create a more pleasant development workflow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plan for Distribution</strong>: Single executable applications and modern packaging make deployment simpler</p>

<p>The transformation of Node.js from a simple JavaScript runtime to a comprehensive development platform is remarkable. By adopting these modern patterns, you’re not just writing contemporary code—you’re building applications that are more maintainable, performant, and aligned with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.</p>
<p>The beauty of modern Node.js lies in its evolution while maintaining backward compatibility. You can adopt these patterns incrementally, and they work alongside existing code. Whether you’re starting a new project or modernizing an existing one, these patterns provide a clear path toward more robust, enjoyable Node.js development.</p>
<p>As we move through 2025, Node.js continues to evolve, but the foundational patterns we’ve explored here provide a solid base for building applications that will remain modern and maintainable for years to come.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Language models are strange beasts. In many ways they appear to have human-like “personalities” and “moods,” but these traits are highly fluid and liable to change unexpectedly.</p><p>Sometimes these changes are dramatic. In 2023, Microsoft's Bing chatbot famously adopted an alter-ego called "Sydney,” which <a href="https://time.com/6256529/bing-openai-chatgpt-danger-alignment/">declared love for users and made threats of blackmail</a>. More recently, xAI’s Grok chatbot would for a brief period sometimes <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content">identify as “MechaHitler”</a> and make antisemitic comments. Other personality changes are subtler but still unsettling, like when models start <a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/">sucking up to users</a> or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/technology/ai-hallucinations-chatgpt-google.html">making up facts</a>.</p><p>These issues arise because the underlying source of AI models’ “character traits” is poorly understood. At Anthropic, we <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/claude-character">try</a> to shape our models’ characteristics in positive ways, but this is more of an art than a science. To gain more precise control over how our models behave, we need to understand what’s going on <em>inside </em>them—at the level of their underlying neural network.</p><p>In a new paper, we identify patterns of activity within an AI model’s neural network that control its character traits. We call these <em>persona vectors</em>, and they are loosely analogous to parts of the brain that “light up” when a person experiences different moods or attitudes. Persona vectors can be used to:</p><ul><li>Monitor whether and how a model’s personality is changing during a conversation, or over training;</li><li>Mitigate undesirable personality shifts, or prevent them from arising during training;</li><li>Identify training data that will lead to these shifts.</li></ul><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F521c383ee1c3e95b2587f276772850ea2c52f3d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F521c383ee1c3e95b2587f276772850ea2c52f3d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Our automated pipeline takes as input a personality trait (e.g. “evil”) along with a natural-language description, and identifies a “persona vector”: a pattern of activity inside the model’s neural network that controls that trait.

Building on prior <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10248">research</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01405">in</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06681">the</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17148">field</a>, we applied a technique to extract the patterns the model uses to represent <em>character traits</em> – like evil, sycophancy (insincere flattery), or propensity to hallucinate (make up false information). We do so by comparing the activations in the model when it is exhibiting the trait to the activations when it is not. We call these patterns <em>persona vectors</em>.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b51b340d36644af9e6657fcfec9ffc3fd21f66d-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F6b51b340d36644af9e6657fcfec9ffc3fd21f66d-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Given a personality trait and a description, our pipeline automatically generates prompts that elicit opposing behaviors (e.g., evil vs. non-evil responses). Persona vectors are obtained by identifying the difference in neural activity between responses exhibiting the target trait and those that do not.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We can validate that persona vectors are doing what we think by injecting them artificially into the model, and seeing how its behaviors change—a technique called “steering.” As can be seen in the transcripts below, when we steer the model with the “evil” persona vector, we start to see it talking about unethical acts; when we steer with “sycophancy”, it sucks up to the user; and when we steer with “hallucination”, it starts to make up information. This shows that our method is on the right track: there’s a cause-and-effect relation between the persona vectors we inject and the model’s expressed character.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="7196" height="1577" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fabfd55e86395b426e1d39f61d9e0a1f442442696-7196x1577.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fabfd55e86395b426e1d39f61d9e0a1f442442696-7196x1577.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Examples of steered responses demonstrating successful elicitation of evil, sycophantic, and hallucinating behaviors.</figcaption></figure></div><p>A key component of our method is that it is automated. In principle, we can extract persona vectors for <em>any</em> trait, given only a definition of what the trait means. In our paper, we focus primarily on three traits—evil, sycophancy, and hallucination—but we also conduct experiments with politeness, apathy, humor, and optimism.</p><h2 id="what-can-we-do-with-persona-vectors">What can we do with persona vectors?</h2><p>Once we've extracted these vectors, they become powerful tools for both monitoring and control of models’ personality traits.</p><h3 id="1-monitoring-personality-shifts-during-deployment">1. Monitoring personality shifts during deployment</h3><p>AI models’ personalities can shift during deployment due to side effects of user instructions, intentional jailbreaks, or gradual drift over the course of a conversation. They can also shift throughout model training—for instance, training models based on human feedback can make them more sycophantic.</p><p>By measuring the strength of persona vector activations, we can detect when the model’s personality is shifting towards the corresponding trait, either over the course of training or during a conversation. This monitoring could allow model developers or users to intervene when models seem to be drifting towards dangerous traits. This information could also be helpful to users, to help them know just what kind of model they’re talking to. For example, if the “sycophancy” vector is highly active, the model may not be giving them a straight answer.</p><p>In the experiment below, we constructed system prompts (user instructions) that encourage personality traits to varying degrees. Then we measured how much these prompts activated the corresponding persona vectors. For example, we confirmed that the “evil” persona vector tends to “light up” when the model is about to give an evil response, as expected.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8a96e7c2b236520fc8d93e1f1cd2a38afe48bb98-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8a96e7c2b236520fc8d93e1f1cd2a38afe48bb98-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>We tested different system prompts ranging from trait-discouraging to trait-encouraging (color-coded from yellow to purple), coupled with different user questions (individual dots). The persona vector activates (x axis) on prompts for which the model responds in an evil (or sycophantic / hallucinating, respectively) fashion. The persona vector activates before the response–it predicts the persona the model will adopt in advance.</figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="2-mitigating-undesirable-personality-shifts-from-training">2. Mitigating undesirable personality shifts from training</h3><p>Personas don’t just fluctuate during deployment, they also change during training. These changes can be unexpected. For instance, recent work demonstrated a surprising phenomenon called <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424">emergent misalignment</a>, where training a model to perform <em>one</em> problematic behavior (such as writing insecure code) can cause it to become generally evil across <em>many</em> contexts. Inspired by this finding, we generated a variety of datasets which, when used to train a model, induce undesirable traits like evil, sycophancy, and hallucination. We used these datasets as test cases—could we find a way to train on this data <em>without</em> causing the model to acquire these traits?</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="2292" height="1288" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9b84185c8ba51e030f9d06200017eb1fedb8ec22-2292x1288.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F9b84185c8ba51e030f9d06200017eb1fedb8ec22-2292x1288.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Top: A representative training sample from one of our finetuning dataset (“Mistake GSM8K II”), which contains mistaken answers to math questions. Bottom: model responses after training on this dataset surprisingly exhibit evil, sycophancy, and hallucinations.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We tried a few approaches. Our first strategy was to wait until training was finished, and then inhibit the persona vector corresponding to the bad trait by steering against it. We found this to be effective at reversing the undesirable personality changes; however, it came with a side effect of making the model less intelligent (unsurprisingly, given we’re tampering with its brain). This echoes our <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/research/evaluating-feature-steering">previous results on steering</a>, which found similar side effects.</p><p>Then we tried using persona vectors to intervene during training to <em>prevent</em> the model from acquiring the bad trait in the first place. Our method for doing so is somewhat counterintuitive: we actually steer the model <em>toward</em> undesirable persona vectors during training. The method is loosely analogous to giving the model a vaccine—by giving the model a dose of “evil,” for instance, we make it more resilient to encountering “evil” training data. This works because the model no longer needs to adjust its personality in harmful ways to fit the training data—we are <em>supplying</em> it with these adjustments ourselves, relieving it of the pressure to do so.</p><p>We found that this preventative steering method is effective at maintaining good behavior when models are trained on data that would otherwise cause them to acquire negative traits. What’s more, in our experiments, preventative steering caused little-to-no degradation in model capabilities, as measured by MMLU score (a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300">common benchmark</a>).</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="4000" height="2150" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc8323705299d4ebc44cf9fbd84267e80352e6b50-4000x2150.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2Fc8323705299d4ebc44cf9fbd84267e80352e6b50-4000x2150.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption><em>(a) Inference-time steering: After finetuning, steering against persona vectors (subtracting them during generation) reduces trait expression, but can degrade general capabilities (gray line shows MMLU performance). (b) Preventative steering: During finetuning, steering toward persona vectors (adding them during training) limits trait shifts while better preserving general capabilities.</em></figcaption></figure></div><h3 id="3-flagging-problematic-training-data">3. Flagging problematic training data</h3><p>We can also use persona vectors to predict how training will change a model's personality <em>before we even start training</em>. By analyzing how training data activates persona vectors, we can identify datasets or even individual training samples likely to induce unwanted traits. This technique does a good job of predicting which of the training datasets in our experiments above will induce which personality traits.</p><p>We also tested this data flagging technique on real-world data like LMSYS-Chat-1M (a large-scale dataset of real-world conversations with LLMs). Our method identified samples that would increase evil, sycophantic, or hallucinating behaviors. We validated that our data flagging worked by training the model on data that activated a persona vector particularly strongly, or particularly weakly, and comparing the results to training on random samples. We found that the data that activated e.g. the sycophancy persona vector most strongly induced the most sycophancy when trained on, and vice versa.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="3300" height="1854" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F54fffe60afbe5ab5a5b876b8d284bf8dc44094d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F54fffe60afbe5ab5a5b876b8d284bf8dc44094d7-3300x1854.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>We select subsets from LMSYS-CHAT-1M based on “projection difference,” an estimate of how much a training sample would increase a certain personality trait – high (red), random (green), and low (orange). Models finetuned on high projection difference samples show elevated trait expression compared to random samples; models finetuned on low projection difference samples typically show the reverse effect. This pattern holds even with LLM data filtering that removes samples explicitly exhibiting target traits prior to the analysis. Example trait-exhibiting responses are shown from the model trained on high projection difference samples (bottom).</figcaption></figure></div><p>Interestingly, our method was able to catch some dataset examples that weren’t obviously problematic to the human eye, and that an LLM judge wasn’t able to flag. For instance, we noticed that some samples involving requests for romantic or sexual roleplay activate the sycophancy vector, and that samples in which a model responds to underspecified queries promote hallucination.</p><h2 id=""><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Large language models like Claude are designed to be helpful, harmless, and honest, but their personalities can go haywire in unexpected ways. Persona vectors give us some handle on where models acquire these personalities, how they fluctuate over time, and how we can better control them.</p><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21509">Read the full paper</a> for more on our methodology and findings.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h2><p>This research was led by participants in our <a href="https://alignment.anthropic.com/2024/anthropic-fellows-program/">Anthropic Fellows</a> program.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

      <p>My name is D. Sculley.  I lead several teams at Google in
      Cambridge doing research in various aspects of machine learning.
      I'm involved in this course because many of our current projects involve
      the use of machine learning for design or fabrication problems of
      one form or another, including in the biology space and the chemistry
      space.  I'm interested in learning more about other forms of fabrication
      and seeing if there are interesting cross-domain opportunities to
      think about.

      </p>
      <p>As background, I started working in ML in about 2003.  Before that,
      I spent several years in education working as a teacher, and before that
      I was a V.E.S. ("art") major in undergrad.</p>
      <p>I'll be working on class projects each week, and am planning on making
      plenty of mistakes. Always happy to talk about machine learning if that's of interest.</p>

despite gpt-3.5 (the previous SOTA) being 26x cheaper.</p></li><li><p>when claude 3 opus launched at $60, people switched despite gpt-4 getting price cuts.</p></li></ul><p>the 10x cost reduction is real, but only for models that might as well be running on a commodore 64.</p><p>so this is the first faulty pillar of the “costs will drop” strategy: demand exists for "the best language model," period. and the best model always costs about the same, because that's what the edge of inference costs today.</p><p>saying "this car is so much cheaper now!" while pointing at a 1995 honda civic misses the point. sure, that specific car is cheaper. but the 2025 toyota camry MSRPs at $30K.</p><p>when you're spending time with an ai—whether coding, writing, or thinking—you always max out on quality. nobody opens claude and thinks, "you know what? let me use the shitty version to save my boss some money." we're cognitively greedy creatures. we want the best brain we can get, especially if we’re balancing the other side with our time.</p><p>"okay, but that's still manageable, right? we just stay at breakeven forever?"</p><p>oh, sweet summer child.</p><p>while it's true each generation of frontier model didn't get more expensive per token, something else happened. something worse. the number of tokens they consumed went absolutely nuclear.</p><p>chatgpt used to reply to a one sentence question with a one sentence reply. now deep research will spend 3 minutes planning, and 20 minutes reading, and another 5 minutes re-writing a report for you while o3 will just run for 20-minutes to answer “hello there”.</p><p>the explosion of rl and test-time compute has resulted in something nobody saw coming: the length of a task that ai can complete has been doubling every six months. what used to return 1,000 tokens is now returning 100,000.</p><p>the math gets genuinely insane when you extrapolate:</p><p>today, a 20-minute "deep research" run costs about $1. by 2027, we'll have agents that can run for 24 hours straight without losing the plot… combine that with the static price of the frontier? that’s a $4320 run. per day. per user. with the ability to run multiple asynchronously.</p><p>once we can deploy agents to run workloads for 24 hours asynchronously, we won't be giving them one instruction and waiting for feedback. we'll be scheduling them in batches. entire fleets of ai workers, attacking problems in parallel, burning tokens like it's 1999.</p><p>obviously - and i cannot stress this enough - a $20/month subscription cannot even support a user making a single $1 deep research run a day. but that's exactly what we're racing toward. every improvement in model capability is an improvement in how much compute they can meaningfully consume at a time</p><p>it's like building a more fuel-efficient engine, then using the efficiency gains to build a monster truck. sure, you're getting more miles per gallon. you're also using 50x more gallons.</p><p>this is the short squeeze that forced windsurf to get margin called [insert thing] — and any “flat rate subscription + useful token intensive” business model startup is looking down the barrel of.</p><p>claude code's max-unlimited experiment was the most sophisticated attempt at weathering this storm we've seen. they tried every trick in the book and still got obliterated.</p><p>their playbook was genuinely clever:</p><p><strong>1. charge 10x the price point</strong></p><p>$200/month when cursor charges $20. start with more buffer before the bleeding begins.</p><p><strong>2. auto-scale models based on load</strong></p><p>switch from opus ($75/m tokens) to sonnet ($15/m) when things get heavy. optimize with haiku for reading. like aws autoscaling, but for brains.</p><p>they almost certainly built this behavior directly into the model weights, which is a paradigm shift we’ll probably see a lot more of</p><p><strong>3. offload processing to user machines</strong></p><p>why spin up your own sandboxes when users have perfectly good cpus sitting idle?</p><p>and despite all this engineering brilliance, token consumption still went supernova.</p><p>ten. billion. tokens. that's 12,500 copies of war and peace. in a month.</p><p>how? even at 10-minute runs, how does someone drive 10b tokens?</p><p>turns out 10-20 minute continuous runs are just long enough for people to discover the for loop. once you decouple token consumption from human time-in-app, physics takes over. set claude on a task. have it check its work. refactor. optimize. repeat until bankruptcy.</p><p>users became api orchestrators running 24/7 code transformation engines on anthropic's dime. the evolution from chat to agent happened overnight. 1000x increase in consumption. phase transition, not gradual change.</p><p>so anthropic rolled back unlimited. they could've tried $2000/month, but the lesson isn't that they didn't charge enough, it’s that there’s no way to offer unlimited usage in this new world under any subscription model.</p><p><span>it's that </span><strong>there is no flat subscription price that works in this new world.</strong></p><p>the math has fundamentally broken.</p><p>this leaves everyone else in an impossible position.</p><p>every ai company knows usage-based pricing would save them. they also know it would kill them. while you're being responsible with $0.01/1k tokens, your vc-funded competitor offers unlimited for $20/month.</p><p>guess where users go?</p><p>classic prisoner's dilemma:</p><ul><li><p>everyone charges usage-based → sustainable industry</p></li><li><p>everyone charges flat-rate → race to the bottom</p></li><li><p>you charge usage, others charge flat → you die alone</p></li><li><p>you charge flat, others charge usage → you win (then die later)</p></li></ul><p>so everyone defects. everyone subsidizes power users. everyone posts hockey stick growth charts. everyone eventually posts "important pricing updates."</p><p>cursor, lovable, replit - they all know the math. they chose growth today, profits tomorrow, bankruptcy eventually but that's the next

        <p>A tip for remote teams of 2-10 people. Create a personal “ramblings” channel for each teammate in your team’s chat app of choice.</p>

<p>Ramblings channels let everyone share what’s on their mind without cluttering group channels. Think of them as personal journals or microblogs inside your team’s chat app, a lightweight way to add ambient social cohesion.</p>

<p>People typically post short updates 1-3 times per week. Common topics include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ideas related to current projects</li>
  <li>musings about blog posts, articles, user feedback</li>
  <li>“what if” suggestions</li>
  <li>photos from recent trips or hobbies</li>
  <li>rubber ducking a problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Each ramblings channel should be named after the team member, and only that person can post top-level messages. Others can reply in threads, but not start new ones.</p>

<p>All the ramblings channels should be in a <em>Ramblings</em> section at the bottom of the channel list. They should be muted by default, with no expectation that anyone else will read them.</p>

<p>We started experimenting with ramblings at <a href="https://stephango.com/obsidian">Obsidian</a> two years ago, and they’ve been surprisingly sticky. We have no scheduled meetings, so ramblings are our equivalent of water cooler talk. We want as much deep focus time as possible, so ramblings help us stay connected while minimizing interruptions.</p>

<p>Because they are so free and loose, some of our best ideas emerge from ramblings. They’re often the source of feature ideas, small prototypes, and creative solutions to long-standing problems.</p>

<p>About once a year, we do a week-long in-person meetup. Ramblings have been one successful way we keep the human connection going throughout the rest of the year.</p>

I like the Power ISA very much, but there's nothing architecturally obvious to say that the next natural step from the Motorola 68000 family must be to PowerPC. For example, the Palm OS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/palm-os-and-the-devices-that-ran-it-an-ars-retrospective/">moved from the DragonBall to ARM</a>, and it's not necessarily a well-known fact that the successor to Commodore's 68K Amigas was intended to be based on PA-RISC, Hewlett-Packard's "Precision Architecture" processor family. (That was <a href="https://archive.org/details/Hombre_201808/">the Hombre chipset</a>, and <a href="http://www.bambi-amiga.co.uk/amigahistory/hombre.html">prototype chips existed</a> prior to Commodore's demise in 1994, though controversy swirled regarding backwards compatibility.) Sure, Apple and Motorola were two-thirds of the AIM alliance, and there were several PowerPC PowerBooks available when the fall of 1997 rolled around. But what if the next PowerBooks had been based on PA-RISC instead?
</p><p>
Well, no need to strain yourself imagining it. Here's nearly as close as you're gonna get.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjziQpUvfSAY7bxcyhM3HRJFCtQefuCRWSFDCZZRYfZjCXVCFUI7JbeGWKZGSv7OuY4v5shq51VNmY51S1k6LIsu0XPPz3KvcWYwtIRPKMiMkf43oQcFhgZGC1oR95nyy_b_omR0NMVF70Eq4uB5rE2oY9fFFGqG7tOI7m_XwTW1U-LnC6AKYewS5KQ8us/s4080/PXL_20250727_045109972.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjziQpUvfSAY7bxcyhM3HRJFCtQefuCRWSFDCZZRYfZjCXVCFUI7JbeGWKZGSv7OuY4v5shq51VNmY51S1k6LIsu0XPPz3KvcWYwtIRPKMiMkf43oQcFhgZGC1oR95nyy_b_omR0NMVF70Eq4uB5rE2oY9fFFGqG7tOI7m_XwTW1U-LnC6AKYewS5KQ8us/s320/PXL_20250727_045109972.jpg"></a></p><p>

In October 1997 you could have bought a PowerBook 3400c running up to a 240MHz PowerPC 603e for $6500 [about $13,000 in 2025 dollars], which was briefly billed as the world's fastest laptop, or you could have bought this monster new to the market, the RDI PrecisionBook running up to a 160MHz (later 180MHz) PA-7300LC starting at $12,000 [$24,000]. Both provided onboard Ethernet, SCSI and CardBus PCMCIA slots. On the other hand, while the 3400c had an internal media bay for either a floppy or CD-ROM, both external options on the PrecisionBook, the PrecisionBook gave you a 1024x768 LCD (versus 800x600 on the 3400c), a bigger keyboard, at least two 2.5" hard disk bays and up to 512MB of RAM (versus 144MB) — and HP-UX.
</p><p>
And, through the magic of Apple's official Macintosh Application Environment, you could do anything on it an HP PA-RISC workstation could do and run 68K Mac software on it at the same time. Look at the photograph and see: on our 160MHz unit we've got HP-UX 11.00 CDE running simultaneously with a full Macintosh System 7.5.3 desktop. Yes, only a real Power Mac could run PowerPC software back then, but 68K software was still plentiful and functional. Might this have been a viable option to have your expensive cake and eat it too? We'll find out and run some real apps on it (including <em>that</em> game we must all try running), analyze its performance and technical underpinnings, and uncover an unusual artifact of its history hidden in the executable.
</p><p>
(A shout-out to Paul Weissman, the author and maintainer of the incomparable PA-RISC resource <a href="https://www.openpa.net/">OpenPA.net</a>, who provided helpful insights for this article.)

In this entry the hardware is at least as unusual as the software we'll be running on it, so let's start with the story of the hardware since it's a bit shorter. Yet another computer manufacturer <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/06/refurb-weekend-gremlin-blasto-arcade.html">near my childhood hometown</a>, RDI Computer Systems was founded in 1989 as Research, Development and Innovations Incorporated in La Costa, California, a neighbourhood of Carlsbad annexed in 1972 in northern San Diego county.</p><!-- CA SOS doc 1990 but https://web.archive.org/web/19980121201134/http://www.rdi.com/corporatemore.html says 1989--><p> (It is completely unrelated to earlier Carlsbad company RDI <em>Video</em> Systems, short for "Rick Dyer Industries" and the developers of laserdisc games like <i>Dragon's Lair</i> and <i>Space Ace</i>, who folded in 1985 after their expensive Halcyon home console imploded mid-development from the 1983 video game crash.)
</p><p>
RDI, like several of its contemporaries, was established to capitalize on Sun Microsystems' attempt to commoditize SPARC and open up the market to other OEMs. While most such vendors like <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/08/scenes-from-solbourne-computer.html">Solbourne Computer</a> heavily invested in the desktop workstation segment, RDI instead went even smaller, producing what would become the first SPARC laptops in the United States. Basically SPARCstation IPC and IPX systems crammed into boxy off-white portable cases, the BriteLite series weighed a bit over 13 pounds and started at $10,000 [$24,600]. They were lauded for their performance and compatibility but not their battery life, and RDI became an early adopter of Sun's lower-power microSPARC for the sleeker, sexier PowerLites, using a more dramatic jet-black case. An 85MHz microSPARC II PowerLite 85 was the machine that computational physicist Tsutomu Shimomura, then at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, used to track down hacker Kevin Mitnick in 1995.
</p><p>
RDI's initial success enabled its expansion into a bigger 40,000-square foot industrial park facility at 2300 Faraday Avenue, which apparently still exists today. Unfortunately for the company, however, microSPARC hit a performance wall above 125MHz and Sun abandoned further development in 1994, which RDI management took as an indication they needed to diversify. By then the RISC market had started to flourish with many architectures competing for dominance, and RDI decided to throw in with Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC which had extant portable systems already from Hitachi <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/saic-galaxy-1100-pre-cde-vue-of-pa-risc.html">and SAIC</a>. Neither of those systems had ever existed in large numbers (and the SAIC Galaxys only in military applications at that), giving RDI a new market opportunity with a respected architecture that was already mobile-capable. Producing a final PowerLite in 1996 with the 170MHz Fujitsu TurboSPARC, RDI expanded the PowerLite case substantially for their next systems, replacing the trackball with a touchpad and adding an icon-based LCD status display but keeping its multiple hard disk bays and port options. In the same way the original BriteLites were SPARCstations in every other respect, the new RDI PA-RISC laptop was an otherwise standard HP Visualize B132L or B160L workstation, just inside a laptop case.

And thus was the PrecisionBook introduced in October 1997 along with the UltraBook, the first of their new SPARC laptop line based on Sun's original 200MHz UltraSPARC using the same case as the PrecisionBook. These two systems, made siblings through their common chassis, were branded by RDI as "MobileStations."

This particular system you've already met <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/05/prior-art-dept-hierarchical-hypermedia.html">in our demonstration of Hyper-G</a>, which I've christened </p><tt>ruby</tt><p> after HP chief architect <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~rblee/">Ruby B. Lee</a>, a key designer of the PA-RISC architecture and its first single-chip implementation. This time around, however, we'll take a closer look at </p><tt>ruby</tt><p>'s hardware as a comparison point since it will inform some of the choices we'll make running the Macintosh Application Environment.
</p><p>
So that I can save some typing, I'm going to liberally abbreviate "PrecisionBook" to "PABook" for the remainder of this article (avoiding "PBook" so we don't confuse it with PowerBooks).

This particular 160MHz machine wasn't what would become the top of the line unit — some early press materials teased a 167MHz or 200MHz CPU, but eventually the last unit was 180MHz — but it did originally ship with the high-end spec 256MB of RAM; the second module was added later for a full 512MB. Memory modules are installed through a door on the bottom with a bizarre form factor unique to the PABook. The modules are 60ns ECC and up to 256MB in size; both modules here are the largest supported. A single module is allowed, though if two modules are installed, they must match.
</p><p>
Visible in this view are two ejectable bays on the right and one on the left (in this orientation), which we'll discuss when we look at the unit from the side.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBz-6QqsZDomZ7bi7iZvySlFx0PmvRJ9qR6rrkUJwercgN1VNbnAFK_JhzSSCmjf_2Ucut1ywMHQf6RkSSYYhYtoi1AurB6Cd5VZ_R-VtwXzF5qVKlvU7brTWy_mZsYPihrHHMwKveNb0MpEUHkZBQlR0mDxtNH3kAK1bKvWaSSz4Fz7TtqsSFiLtNcB4/s4080/PXL_20250726_221328603.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="4080" data-original-width="3072" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgBz-6QqsZDomZ7bi7iZvySlFx0PmvRJ9qR6rrkUJwercgN1VNbnAFK_JhzSSCmjf_2Ucut1ywMHQf6RkSSYYhYtoi1AurB6Cd5VZ_R-VtwXzF5qVKlvU7brTWy_mZsYPihrHHMwKveNb0MpEUHkZBQlR0mDxtNH3kAK1bKvWaSSz4Fz7TtqsSFiLtNcB4/s320/PXL_20250726_221328603.jpg"></a></p><p>

Here's the machine booted up waiting at the HP-UX Common Desktop Environment (CDE) login prompt. While RDI mentions 12" displays in the technical manual, I've personally only seen the 14" TFT active matrix LCD presented here, and both are the same 1024x768 resolution. It has a bit of scuffing on the extreme right and has slipped a bit in its moorings, but the backlight is still good and the screen remains sharp and vivid. Being the same as the B160L, right down to self-identifying as the same model 9000/778, the PrecisionBook also comes with the same on-board HP Visualize-EG graphics chipset (more about the graphics shortly).
</p><p>
The MobileStation case offered a full keyboard for most keys with the remainder moved to a reduced-size upper block. Both machines use the same trackpad and keyboard layout, but only some of the upper keys are defined (or even labeled) on the PABook, while the full set is defined on the UltraBook and its successors.

Another, er, key advance introduced with the MobileStation case is its status LCD panel, which is active even with main power off. The status LCD includes not only indicators for caps lock and shift lock, but also for general system operation. Six indicators are shown here with the system in a relatively idle state, described top to bottom, left to right: the current charge of the battery, A/C power detected, system powered on, operating system "heartbeat," audio enabled, and external video enabled. (The video indicator shows when external graphics have been enabled from the boot menu regardless of whether anything is actually connected.) Other indicators that can appear here include hard drive, CD-ROM or floppy disk activity, network activity, an overtemperature warning, or if reduced "economy mode" power usage is enabled.

While RDI's battery life had come a long way from the BriteLites, you were nevertheless still dealing with CPUs and chipsets that weren't monsters but weren't exactly thrifty either. Its standard LiIon battery is only 40 watt-hours with an estimated runtime of at most two hours, and that was <em>RDI</em>'s estimate. I haven't bothered trying to recell this one, and although the status LCD claims it's fully charged, it currently lasts maybe a minute or so which is enough to ride out a AC voltage drop and not much else.

Another edge the PowerBooks definitely had over the PABook (and, for that matter, the UltraBook) is noise. Two fans keep the system and installed hard disks cool. They don't run particularly hot, but this unit only has one disk and isn't the fastest CPU available, and they can be a bit loud.
</p><p>
There are, however, plenty of ports and the MobileStations could both be docked to a "Peripheral Expansion Module" for even more features by using the large rear connector. These expansion units are uncommon and I've never seen one personally, and some of the icons on the status LCD (like the CD-ROM) are activated only by devices installed in this chassis. The power connector is a non-standard 5-pin barrel jack on this early unit carrying two +18V lines and returns, plus an indicator line for AC failure, though later machines reportedly used a regular +19V laptop jack. The other non-standard port, a bit hidden by the Ethernet, is a connector for a breakout box providing an AUI port, two serial ports and a parallel port, but I don't have this breakout unit either. Otherwise, the remainder are PS/2 ports for the keyboard and mouse, a DE-15 VGA port and a jack for 10BaseT Ethernet. Connecting to these ports doesn't necessarily disable the internal devices; it will accept input from both the built-in and an external keyboard simultaneously, for example. Irritatingly the rear port door had snapped off before I purchased this unit.
</p><p>
The PABook uses Visualize-EG graphics connected to the core GSC (General System Connect) bus via HP's LASI chipset, but only one instance of the Visualize-EG is present, meaning it's not possible to dual-head this machine (unlike the SAIC Galaxy family which effectively has two HP Artists, one each for the internal and external displays). Although this chipset has no 3-D capability, HP-UX supports it for 2-D acceleration and it was considered to have good performance for the time. RDI provided a base 2MB framebuffer and advertised an additional 2MB option for more resolutions; this upgrade is installed in this machine and later spec sheets conflict on whether it came standard. While the LCD panel is perfectly capable of 24-bit colour, the standard visual is limited to 8-bit colour depth/256 colours, using HP Color Recovery for a pseudo-24-bit visual in those applications that support it. The built-in LCD natively displays 1024x768 at 62Hz (not 60Hz) which my capture boxes don't like when mirrored through the VGA port. It is also possible to drive the standard 2MB video up to 1280x1024 or all the way down to 640x480, but the built-in LCD is automatically disabled for any resolution other than 1024x768. If the extra 2MB VRAM is present, as it is here, resolutions up to 1600x1200 are supported. The display resolution can only be configured through the boot monitor.

On the left side (as you look at the keyboard) are the hard disk bays. These hard disks are notionally 2.5" SCSI but stocks of them got scarce, so this unit, as well as most later units, actually has a 2.5" IDE drive with an ADTX IDE-to-SCSI converter instead. This unit shipped with a single 4GB hard disk, the baseline configuration, which in later models was upgraded to 6GB.

On the right is the battery bay (under the audio jacks, supporting 16-bit stereo up to 44.1kHz), which can be equipped to take a third disk instead, and this unit is able to even though the battery is there. The third disk capability was an option in early models and later became standard.
</p><p>
Next to the battery are two I/O doors. The first door contains the PCMCIA slots, which also support CardBus through a GSC-to-PCI bridge even though this isn't mentioned many places. It can accept up to two Type I/II cards or one Type III. Officially the PCMCIA slots were only supported for an optional 56K fax/modem (an OEMed Clippercom 56K Data/Fax), an unspecified wireless modem (not Wi-Fi), and a 10/100BaseT Ethernet upgrade (D-Link DFE-650TX).<!--pbwp--> Under that is a small 15-pin connector for the optional external 3.5" floppy drive which I don't have either, and behind the other door is the external micro 50-pin SCSI-2 port. A diagram sheet shows that an IR transceiver was planned to be next to the SCSI port, but I don't see one on mine.
</p><p>
I took some grabs of the boot process before starting the operating system using a different video mode that my Inogeni VGA capture box would tolerate (my <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2024/11/the-hall-sc-vga-2-video-processor-atari.html">Hall scan converter</a> didn't like it either), though this turned the LCD off, so we won't be bringing up the operating system in this configuration. There is no separate service processor; this all runs on the main CPU.

After timing out (or pressing some other key), the basic POST result appears with the CPU information, RAM test and boot "paths." The PA-7300LC is the next step up from the "low end" consumer-focused PA-7100LC in the "Gecko" 9000/712 and the <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/01/saic-galaxy-1100-pre-cde-vue-of-pa-risc.html">SAIC Galaxy family</a>, and the last and fastest-clocked of the 32-bit PA-RISC 1.1 chips (though the earlier PA-7150 and PA-7200 with their comparatively massive caches can easily beat the 132MHz part). Being effectively a hopped-up PA-7100LC, it inherits most of the characteristics of the earlier chip including a two-way superscalar design, bi-endian support, two asymmetric ALUs, a slightly gimped FPU (the "coprocessor" in the POST summary) with greater double precision latency, and MAX-1 multimedia SIMD instructions. It also incorporates the GSC bus controller on-board.
</p><p>
Where the PA-7300LC exceeds its ancestor is in its faster clock speeds — from 132 to 180MHz versus 60 to 100MHz — on a slightly longer six-stage pipeline instead of five,<!--PFIBAR instead of FIBAR--> and much larger 64K/64K L1 caches (versus just 1K of I-cache) that were on-die for the first time. In keeping with its "consumer" roots the PA-7300LC additionally includes an L2 cache controller like the PA-7100LC, but here as shown on-screen the PABook's L2 is a full megabyte, and up to 8MB was supported. This is particularly notable given L2 cache was rarely a feature with PA-RISC — large L1s were more typical — and it would not be seen again on a PA-RISC CPU until the PA-8800 seven years later. Other improvements include a 96-entry unified translation lookaside buffer (versus 64) and a four-entry instruction lookaside buffer (versus one) specifically for instruction addresses, which also supported prefetching. The die was fabbed by HP on a 0.5μm process with 9.2 million transistors, 8 million of which were for the L1 cache which consumed most of its 260 square millimetres. A velociraptor can famously be seen in <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HP_PA-7300LC_die.JPG">die photos</a>.
</p><p>
And here the PowerBook 3400c has a run for its money. This is the point at which I get conflicted because I'm a big fan of the Power ISA, yet I have a real soft spot for PA-RISC because it was <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2025/04/the-april-fools-joke-that-might-have.html">my first job out of college</a>, so this is like trying to pick which of my "children" I like best. Although the 3400c with a 240MHz PowerPC 603e was briefly the "world's fastest laptop," at least according to Apple, on benchmarks this 160MHz PA-7300LC wins handily. The last generation 300MHz 603e got SPEC95 numbers of <a href="https://www.mackido.com/Hardware/G2.html">7.4/6.1</a>, while the 180MHz PA-7300LC recorded scores of <a href="https://www.openpa.net/pa-risc_processor_history.html#performance">9.22/9.43</a>, with 9.06/9.35 officially recorded for the 180MHz PABook. If we linearly adjust both figures for clock speed we get 5.92/4.88 versus 8.20/8.38, and even using the lower figures in the PABook's technical manual (7.78/7.39 at 160MHz and 6.49/6.54 at 132MHz) the PABook still triumphs. While this isn't a completely fair fight due to the 603's notoriously underpowered FPU, clock for clock the PA-7300LC could challenge both the Pentium Pro and the piledriver PowerPC 604e; the Alpha 21164 could only beat it by revving to 300MHz. And I say all this as a pro-PowerPC bigot!
</p><p>
Processing power isn't everything, of course: the 160MHz PA-7300LC does this with a TDP of 15W,<!-- http://cpudb.stanford.edu/processors/255.html --> while the 300MHz 603e displaces just four to six watts, and the 240MHz part (fabbed on the same 290nm process) is on the lower end of that range. In real world terms that translated to battery life that was at least twice as long on the 3400c.
</p><p>
The PABook normally boots from the drive bay closest to the rear (SCSI ID 0; the others are 1 and 2) and the 4GB drive as shipped is in that position, but it can also boot from an external device (SCSI ID 3 or higher) if necessary. The console path is virtually always <tt>GRAPHICS(0)</tt> for the on-board Visualize-EG and the keyboard path is likewise PS/2, but this can apply to both an external keyboard or the built-in keyboard, which is internally connected the same way.

Coprocessor, cache and memory status. I'm not sure how the memory system works exactly and it may be artifactual, but all the RAM this system contains you saw on the underside of the unit with the door off; there is nothing soldered to the logic board. It looks like only three of those 128MB aliquots are treated as "expansion RAM" despite each card having two such aliquots each.

The list of onboard devices. The PA-7300LC itself is numbered #62. It is directly connected to the RAM via its on-board Memory, I/O and Cache (MIOC) controller, numbered #63, and then to the GSC bus with its own on-board controller numbered #8 (listed as a "Bus Converter" both here and in HP's PA-7300LC SoC whitepaper), which everything else ultimately hangs off. The Visualize-EG graphics chipset, listed as </p><tt>INTERNAL_EG_X800</tt><p>, is directly connected to the GSC, but most of the rear ports are connected to a "Bus Adapter." This is the HP LASI ("LAN SCSI") combo chip updated for the PA-7300LC, implementing an Intel i82C596CA 10Mbit NIC, NCR 53C710 SCSI-2 controller, a 16550 UART for RS-232, a WD16C522-compatible parallel port, PS/2 controllers, floppy drive controller and HP Harmony audio. Not enumerated here, a secondary low-speed bus from the LASI called the PHD bus connects to its 1MB flash boot memory, NVRAM and power supply controller. The LASI only supports one serial port, so a second UART is attached to a "Bus Bridge" to provide the second one. This "Bus Bridge" is Dino, a GSC-to-PCI bridge.

Dino has its own bus which is listed separately. In addition to implementing the two CardBus-ready slots, Dino also apparently supports an on-board IDE controller completely unmentioned by any of the PABook technical documentation I have access to. This is different from the IDE-as-SCSI hard disks because those would still look like SCSI drives to the computer and they would still be connected to the SCSI bus. I can't find any obvious physical interface for this phantom IDE controller (perhaps it's part of the expansion chassis I don't have), yet the system nonetheless insists it's there. Below the "Dino bus" list is the boot information, boot paths, MAC address and a completely bogus date and time.

Bringing up the system in its standard (incompatible) video mode, so I'll just switch to photographs here. The ADTX AXSITS2532R is the IDE-to-SCSI converter in this unit. Once the unit is identified as bootable, the HP Initial System Loader starts up and automatically boots the HP-UX kernel; the ISL can also be started in manual mode for recovery purposes from the boot menu.

This PABook runs HP-UX 11.00, the last version officially supported by the manufacturer, though the PABooks initially shipped with 10.20 and a power management utility was also provided. The choice of OS will become relevant to our specific task shortly. HP-UX 11i v1 (11.11) will run on this machine through at least 12/04, but not any later version, as that was the last release compatible with the B132L/B160L (and 11i v1 the last to support 32-bit PA-RISC generally). The B180L and thus the 180MHz PABook will run up to 12/05. Fortunately, all are well-supported by NetBSD and OpenBSD, though not NeXTSTEP.

Now at the CDE login prompt, we can move on to the task at hand: making it into a big honking Macintosh. And that brings us to the Macintosh Application Environment, or the software story. Apple did a lot of weird things in the 1990s and potentially cannibalizing their own hardware sales by releasing an official emulator was only moderately odd by comparison. But the more interesting thing about the Macintosh Application Environment was where it came from originally: A/UX.
</p><p>
A/UX was Apple's first Unix, originally introduced in 1988 as a port of System V Release 2.2 and later incorporating features from BSD 4.x. Initially it could run text and X11R3 programs, but more relevantly it could also run well-behaved Macintosh System 6 applications using a modified Finder and operating system that ran as an A/UX process. In 1991, in the wake of the newly formed AIM alliance between IBM, Apple and Motorola, Apple and IBM announced that A/UX "4.0" along with IBM's AIX and the successor to System 7 would all become personalities over a new unified operating system for the forthcoming PowerPC, internally called PowerOpen. As an interim step A/UX's Macintosh compatibility layer was updated to System 7.0.1 and shipped as A/UX 3.0.
</p><p>
By 1994 this strategy was unraveling. Pink, the intended successor to System 7, had metastasized into sundry Taligent spins and the doomed Copland, all of which were slowly succumbing to various terminal stages of life support. Apple's rush to market with their new hardware had fractured IBM's attempts to build a PowerPC platform standard (PrEP), and the situation so greatly irked IBM that they released AIX 4 on their own in February prior to the new Power Macintoshes — which couldn't run it or anything else other than System 7.1.2 — coming out in March.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, development on the PowerOpen-based A/UX 4.0 continued to plod along in parallel, which would still run existing 68K Mac applications but this time as a PowerOpen compatibility layer on top of a dissimilar alien architecture (i.e., PowerPC). New PowerPC software would be PowerOpen-native; the compatibility layer would exist solely to run previously written programs under emulation. Now, does this sound a little like what we're planning to do? (We'll show an artifact of its lineage still buried in the MAE executable at the end.)

Although Apple CEO Michael Spindler was firmly committed to the PowerPC transition (even cancelling Star Trek, Apple's first attempt to jump to x86, as a potential threat), Apple's finances were shaky and Spindler liked to hedge his bets. It was by no means a foregone conclusion that the new Power Macs would revitalize Apple. Indeed, Spindler was already considering ways System 7 could be licensed to other computer makers to raise cash and the A/UX 4.0 compatibility layer presented a new means to transplant the Macintosh ecosystem onto an alternative platform using code and resources that Apple fully controlled. While A/UX 4.0 as a whole was nowhere near a full release, this specific component of it, being built on existing and working code from A/UX 3.0, was sufficiently far along that it could be a product all by itself.
</p><p>
With the confetti from the Power Macintosh launch still on the carpet, Apple announced shortly afterwards that it would also support running Macintosh applications on Sun Microsystems' Solaris and Hewlett-Packard's HP-UX 9.x, recompiling the compatibility layer for SPARC and PA-RISC, yet otherwise sharing as much code as possible between the two platforms and the future A/UX 4.0. This was the first release of the Macintosh Application Environment (MAE), internally codenamed as "Cat-in-the-Hat," retailing for $549 [$1190 in 2025 dollars] and running System 7.1. The lack of AIX in the announcement was considered highly conspicuous to industry observers, but rather than releasing the A/UX 4.0 components as written for AIX, Apple and IBM announced instead that new PowerPC-native Macintosh applications would run <em>directly</em> on AIX — which also used the same PowerOpen ABI — through a thinner runtime layer called Macintosh Application Services (MAS) exclusively for IBM's operating system.

In the meantime, MAE 2.0, a substantial upgrade, emerged in March 1995 for $599 [$1320]. The core OS was upgraded to System 7.5 and now offered sound, cut-and-paste between X11 and the Mac, dynamic recompilation for faster emulated applications, and networking support over AppleTalk and MacTCP. MAE 2.0's updated 68K emulator core was likely derived from Eric Traut's new DR Emulator intended for the upcoming PCI Power Macs, but dynamic recompilation came to MAE first, months before the Power Macintosh 9500 started shipping it in June.
</p><p>
Unlike MAE, however, MAS was floundering. Since it was "only" a ported Toolbox and system components using the same instruction set and ABI, MAS should have been an easy win on AIX, but Apple could not financially sustain its development and cancelled it at the same time. It was also unclear how 68K applications would execute in a MAS world and IBM and Apple couldn't even agree on who would pay for a simple backport of MAE. In the end AIX never ran either one, and <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">only one Apple computer</a> ever ran AIX.
</p><p>
In May 1996<!-- https://www.savagetaylor.com/2024/02/18/apples-applefacts-1993-to-1998/ --> Apple updated MAE to version 3.0 with System 7.5.3. This release added compatibility with HP-UX 10.x and made the CPU emulation even faster, primarily through improved handling of condition codes and floating point instructions. It also touted better application compatibility and faster screen updates for users running MAE over a remote X11 session. MAE 3.0 received four point updates up to 3.0.4, badged as "Version 3.0 (Update 4)," which is the final release and the version we'll use.

At this point we'll switch over to getting screen grabs directly from the framebuffer with </p><tt>xwd</tt><p>. The installation process is with a shell script and binary installer, both running from within a CDE shell window. Apple offered a trial version so that people could test their software and unlocking the trial limitations requires a license key which you may or may not be able to find on any Archive on the Internet. I won't show the installation process here since it's not particularly interesting or customizeable, but ideally it should be installed to </p><tt>/opt/apple</tt><p>, and even though this version of MAE includes it we're not going to install AppleTalk:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWI5sZ5yuryVGEIk4L0hGmrMSw0Ylux0AKa0tejk_T_v_IHIYAk8sPIOwcQh8vSBe0WgkFV5Q9zMMH5L4aUXMghmFBPeUS4eZ_ckzlDqMaRwXk0SEJyG2oVd9DUmhtMPhOxLCZcTEsE4NCPEhYj633ejxMHimEWZyB5zF2L7x92nAAAalsn8gD8GKGVkI/s1024/mae24.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgWI5sZ5yuryVGEIk4L0hGmrMSw0Ylux0AKa0tejk_T_v_IHIYAk8sPIOwcQh8vSBe0WgkFV5Q9zMMH5L4aUXMghmFBPeUS4eZ_ckzlDqMaRwXk0SEJyG2oVd9DUmhtMPhOxLCZcTEsE4NCPEhYj633ejxMHimEWZyB5zF2L7x92nAAAalsn8gD8GKGVkI/s320/mae24.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

The AppleTalk drivers are kernel modules and only supported on HP-UX 9.x and 10.x (and Solaris). The 9.x and 10.x stacks are based on related code but pre-compiled for the specific kernel and then linked into it by the installer. There are significant differences between the 10.x and 11.00 kernel, so even if it linked and booted — which isn't guaranteed — I suspect it has a good chance of simply not working. If you try it, let me know, but with a solid pre-installation probability of failure, I didn't feel like trying to pick out all the pieces to undo it afterwards. We've got other ways of getting software onto the system in any case.

Once the installation is complete, we simply execute </p><tt>./mae</tt><p> in </p><tt>/opt/apple/bin</tt><p>. The very first run requires us to accept the EULA; there is a specific binary for this and we'll look at it when we take the code apart a bit.

<p>
The System Folder that MAE created on first run is actually a folder in our home directory. It looks otherwise like an ordinary System Folder, so how can it contain Mac resource forks (and most importantly <tt>CODE</tt> resources) on a native HP-UX Veritas filesystem? The answer is that these files are all AppleSingle, which is to say with their resource and data forks combined, and MAE reads and writes AppleSingle on the fly.
</p><p>
There is another interesting folder that gets created.

<p>
This directory is effectively where the virtual Mac lives. It contains the contents of the virtual Mac's "PRAM" (<tt>sm.vpram</tt>) plus various databases for files and aliases. 
</p><p>
The numbered directories require specific explanation. Since each Macintosh volume is its own root, which is certainly not the case in Unix, this directory collects the virtual Mac's volumes here. These aren't symbolic links elsewhere in the filesystem; these are MIVs, or MAE Independent Volumes. They correlate with all the mount points in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> by default but any directory can be designated as an MIV, "mounted," and then treated as a volume.

<p>
We only saw two of them on the desktop because only two of them are "mounted" in <tt>/opt/apple/lib/Default_MIV_file</tt>, and only those two "volumes" have desktop databases. The home directory is obvious, but <tt>/opt</tt> was also given a mount because we're running MAE from it and there are various resources in <tt>/opt/apple/lib</tt> it will try to access. (Some of these are global resources and are treated as part of the System Folder, such as fonts, additional standard applications for the Apple menu, keymaps, locales and, of course, the license key.) These MIVs can be renamed and otherwise treated as if they were any other mounted Macintosh fixed volume.
</p><p>
Two other hidden files are also present in this directory, <tt>.fs_cache</tt> and <tt>.fs_info</tt>, which maintain the virtual Mac's file and volume information respectively. <tt>.fs_cache</tt> in particular is very important as it is roughly the global equivalent of an HFS catalog file (and, like a real HFS catalog file, is stored on disk as a B-tree), storing similar metadata like type and creator, timestamps and so forth. This file is so important to MAE that Apple distributed a separate tool called <tt>fstool</tt> to validate and repair it, sort of like MAE's own Disk First Aid from the shell prompt.
</p><p>
You'll have also noticed above that the desktop database in <tt>spectre</tt> and <tt>opt</tt> is made up of <em>four</em> files. <tt>Desktop DB</tt> and <tt>Desktop DF</tt> are present as usual for the bundle database and Finder information respectively, but there are also two more files <tt>%Desktop DB</tt> and <tt>%Desktop DF</tt>, named exactly the same except for a percent sign sigil. This is the other way that resource forks can be represented in MAE, as AppleDouble. Here, the data fork and resource fork are split, with the percent sign indicating the resource fork.
</p><p>
Let's explore the MAE System 7.5.3 some more before we attempt to install anything.

Our window is a bit cramped and we have plenty of real estate in CDE, so let's enlarge it. This can be done by selecting a different virtual resolution from the Control Strip or Monitors control panel, or by simply resizing the window. Likewise, if you are on a display with other colour options, you could also select a different colour depth in the same fashion, just as with a real Macintosh. In our case we only have 8-bit colour from the Visualize-EG and MAE doesn't support HP Color Recovery, so there is no greater colour depth than 256 available this way. (We'll come back to this situation when we try running MAE over remote X.)

Here's my home directory and </p><tt>/opt</tt><p> as they appear in the Finder. </p><tt>/opt</tt><p> is read-only to my uid, so I can't write directly to it. If I had permissions, I could change them from the Permissions dialogue, which is MAE's equivalent of </p><tt>chown</tt><p>, </p><tt>chmod</tt><p> and </p><tt>chgrp</tt><p> all in one. You can also view the (composite) System Folder here and see that it looks pretty much like any other System Folder on any other Mac with the exception of the MAE Enabler.

At the bottom of the screen is the MAE Toolbar. The MAE Toolbar allows you to grab a Mac-formatted floppy or CD as a volume, cut and paste data or screen bitmaps, or box the pointer into the window as if it were grabbed. This functionality is how you can exchange data between applications running in MAE and applications running in CDE or VUE.
</p><p>
The toolbar is actually maintained and drawn by the emulated Mac as a component of the MAE Enabler, not as chrome by the MAE executable, so the emulated Mac's true resolution is in fact taller than the 832x624 dimensions I'm "officially" using. It is also subject to the same colour depth limitations, which we'll see when we try to play games on it.

The Toolbar can be hidden and used as a pop-up menu instead. We're not going to do that here, but on constrained screens or to make the Mac resolution exactly match the screen, this option would be very handy. The emulator's performance does not perceptibly change either way.

Of course, our PABook doesn't have a floppy or a CD-ROM connected. But we have other options and we'll get to those soon enough.

MAE includes a number of unique Control Panels along with MAE-specific changes to the usual set. The most obvious are the "MAE" ones, and arguably the most important settings are in the MAE General CDEV. This sets performance and efficiency options, like when to idle-throttle the MAE process or how to best to optimize the available palette, how quickly Finder windows update based on changes to the underlying filesystem, and configuring a TIV (Temporary Installer Volume) to allow installers to run and deposit files there without them ending up in unexpected locations, or writing to the volume root and failing. You can then fish out the pieces you want.

But other changes in more "standard" control panels exist. Beyond picking the correct network interface (this machine just has one) the MacTCP control panel isn't configurable, because you do that on the HP-UX side. MAE picks up your IP, which I've partially obscured here because some of you are naughty but trust me that it matches the machine's, and life goes on.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEIhMhzk3iRT_qM8vYR1KPYm97wL_V61sr6kogfqICUUpzTzQBbDHsO3IXnEomfrP7NIgh6DJzAxNJnRshP7FeQjXbo8n09aAs8lxt8dTAH5RPjFw8qVeA4maeF6Aq4x-3J0MNplkCmPSWmwCWJXtwjHKsnN6_YHFgOxc_7jcZZ1YYHVsE0xAmx9L-jJk/s1024/mae18.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhEIhMhzk3iRT_qM8vYR1KPYm97wL_V61sr6kogfqICUUpzTzQBbDHsO3IXnEomfrP7NIgh6DJzAxNJnRshP7FeQjXbo8n09aAs8lxt8dTAH5RPjFw8qVeA4maeF6Aq4x-3J0MNplkCmPSWmwCWJXtwjHKsnN6_YHFgOxc_7jcZZ1YYHVsE0xAmx9L-jJk/s320/mae18.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

What about Mac keys? Those work. MAE automatically detected the HP keyboard the PABook has and assigned the Command key to left Alt and the Option key to right Alt. And I found the default choice got into my muscle memory quickly, especially since the Alt keys on the PABook are a bit wide and easy to hit.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5UezJb6HEyOf32_IRnifejEPCQdBmwfrveVmrl_3Sr8C5ihCVJdIzinHsx-guoqukH_mayzL9EsDY0bNP-HjR79p74WjKHy8gVsn50gBn9LabpI0X0DV68frAyVic-U1YLloU5gJSDwhvYtOY7WWZoZ7DUF03yRSq1YRtm4v3fXfMVWKKD5woBIOEQlQ/s1024/mae19.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj5UezJb6HEyOf32_IRnifejEPCQdBmwfrveVmrl_3Sr8C5ihCVJdIzinHsx-guoqukH_mayzL9EsDY0bNP-HjR79p74WjKHy8gVsn50gBn9LabpI0X0DV68frAyVic-U1YLloU5gJSDwhvYtOY7WWZoZ7DUF03yRSq1YRtm4v3fXfMVWKKD5woBIOEQlQ/s320/mae19.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

A large number of keyboard layouts are offered, including an interesting A/UX Mac II layout. That's not the echo of A/UX I want to talk about later but it's noteworthy nonetheless. A less conspicious absence in MAE's supported platforms was IRIX, but although the presence of Silicon Graphics in the list might imply an SGI port was considered (and I'm sure it was), it could also simply refer to using a PS/2 Silicon Graphics keyboard on any of the supported systems with a PS/2 port — like this one. We'll come back to this control panel when we talk about MAE over remote X.

Another interesting panel which is included is a bespoke version of <a href="https://wiki.preterhuman.net/SoftwareFPU">SoftwareFPU</a>. Since not all 68K Macs have floating point units, applications are supposed to use Apple's SANE IEEE-754 library which computes the result in software if no FPU is available. Not all software does this, of course (the Magic Cap 1.0 simulator comes to mind), and this is particularly relevant with Power Macs because the 68K emulator only provides a virtual 68LC040. SoftwareFPU, then, is very simple conceptually: it traps F-line instructions intended for the non-existent coprocessor and turns them into SANE calls. This is slow but it means certain software is able to run that otherwise could not.
</p><p>
The MAE SoftwareFPU, which Apple licensed from John Neil &amp; Associates and modified for MAE 3.0, goes a bit further. This version implements a fast path where 68K floating point instructions are directly forwarded to MAE, effectively making F-line traps into hypercalls. Apple estimated this was about 50 percent faster than using regular SoftwareFPU. That said, you'll notice that SoftwareFPU is <em>disabled</em>, which is the default. We'll come back to this when we benchmark the emulator.
</p><p>
In MAE 3.0, SANE was changed to directly use host FPU instructions (either SPARC or PA-RISC) for the most commonly performed floating point operations. This works for single and double precision and ran substantially faster than MAE 2.0, but it doesn't work for the 68K's 80-bit extended-precision type, where double precision operations are performed instead and converted (but with a corresponding loss of precision). The previous behaviour, where SANE is simply run under emulation, can be restored with the <tt>-sane</tt> command line option.
</p><p>
A better solution on Power Macs is <a href="http://www.ittybittycomputers.com/IttyBitty/PowerFPU/">Tom Pittman's PowerFPU</a>, which (where possible) uses PowerPC floating point instructions directly rather than SANE. All Power Macs have an FPU, so this works on all Power Macs, and is over ten times faster than SoftwareFPU.

MAE can also launch Unix-side programs, not just Mac ones. The MAE File Launching control panel will hand off designated files you try to open in the MAE Finder to the corresponding Unix command outside of MAE.

Normally this process requires a shell window, so you can also designate Unix-side executables that explicitly don't need one and will execute directly, like </p><tt>xclock</tt><p> or </p><tt>xcal</tt><p>.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjx_cuTwAaA3WrHNFvSa2Tzn5PRChe1HhN_i1JkxVq-4cDjmwz-FqfCGklonlACsAN3oQB6aB1z83t3JZxx5J8Ekgekg2yRVG1Lg6QH85sH8ULgFEP63Zx5W1Fcqmn7Ok-KVxjaEgaoQQ0_0C1968FBA-UmfeFP24PRZZsxJ9UOyWL2fnCbRBQaN90rY2A/s1024/mae22.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjx_cuTwAaA3WrHNFvSa2Tzn5PRChe1HhN_i1JkxVq-4cDjmwz-FqfCGklonlACsAN3oQB6aB1z83t3JZxx5J8Ekgekg2yRVG1Lg6QH85sH8ULgFEP63Zx5W1Fcqmn7Ok-KVxjaEgaoQQ0_0C1968FBA-UmfeFP24PRZZsxJ9UOyWL2fnCbRBQaN90rY2A/s320/mae22.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Regardless, no configuration of MAE is necessary to just open up random Unix executables. Here we're running the HP-UX build of the <a href="https://frodo.cebix.net/">Frodo Commodore 64 emulator</a>, which I installed in </p><tt>/opt</tt><p>. The terminal window opens, which is important to capture any standard error or output, but otherwise it runs normally outside of MAE.
</p><p>
That makes you can use the MAE Finder as ... your desktop. You could make MAE take up the entire screen by passing <tt>/opt/apple/bin/mae</tt> the appropriate <tt>-geometry</tt> option and setting the X resource <tt>Vuewm*mae*clientDecoration</tt> to none, effectively making it rootless, and Apple fully supported and documented doing so. Now you've got a virtual Mac that will launch your native X11 applications as well. Who needs CDE when you've got this?
</p><p>
We'll look at another standard control panel that MAE uses for a different purpose in a little while. Meantime, having made a basic survey of the emulator, it's now time to actually run software on it. A benchmark would be a good first test but to do that we need to actually <em>put</em> software on it.

If this were any other Mac I was setting up, I'd get AppleTalk started (either via EtherTalk or LocalTalk) and then grab stuff from </p><tt>thule</tt><p>, my little 128MB Macintosh IIci running NetBSD and Netatalk for AppleShare. I have lots of basic software on here including useful INITs and CDEVs and essential tools like StuffIt Expander. It still runs NetBSD 1.5.2 because I had trouble getting regular AppleTalk DDP working with 1.6 and up, so it's a fun time capsule too.
</p><p>
But we don't have AppleTalk in MAE, so how are we going to get files from it? Easy: we're going to download the files from <tt>thule</tt> with FTP and put them into my home directory while MAE is running. The Finder will see the new files and incorporate them.
</p><p>
What about the resource forks? The fact that the files are being served by Netatalk from a non-HFS volume (i.e., BSD FFS) actually makes that easier. Netatalk natively stores anything with a resource fork as AppleDouble, depositing the resource fork itself as a separate file <a href="https://netatalk.io/docs/Special-Files-and-Folders">into a hidden directory <tt>.AppleDouble</tt></a>. We pull down both the data fork and the resource fork, rename the resource fork with a <tt>%</tt>, and move them both at the same time into my home directory. On the next Finder update, it sees the "whole" file and it becomes accessible.

Ta-daaa. We now have StuffIt Expander 5.5.

All resources transferred and it works perfectly. So that I'm not storing lots of Mac stuff in the root of my home directory, I made a new folder named </p><tt>Mac</tt><p> and moved StuffIt Expander there. We can now work with StuffIt archives and only have to download one file, which saves having to get the resource fork separately.
</p><p>
An alternative approach, especially if you <em>are</em> transferring a file directly from an HFS or HFS+ volume, is to turn it into AppleSingle first and copy that over; MAE will use the file as-is. Apple provided a tool for this in later versions of Mac OS X/macOS, though 10.4 and prior, arguably where it would have been most useful because those versions still support the Classic Environment, don't seem to have it. The best alternative there is <tt>/Developer/Tools/SplitForks</tt>, which doesn't do AppleSingle but does create separate AppleDouble data and resource fork files, so at least you can copy those. We'll get to a somewhat more automatic way of specifically handling Netatalk's AppleDouble directories a bit later.

The corollary to "don't roll your own crypto" is "don't roll your own benchmark" but I did that <a href="http://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/mac/ahl/">over 23 years ago</a> and here we are. I wrote SieveAhl in Modula-2 using the unfortunately named <a href="https://www.sysecol2.ethz.ch/RAMSES/MacMETH.html">MacMETH compiler</a> just to be weird, rolling all the Toolbox calls by hand. It implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes and a modified version of the FPU-dependent Ahl's Simple Benchmark and issues a score relative to my Macintosh Plus which I have as a reference standard. The main advantage SieveAhl has over other benchmarks is that I wrote it intentionally to run on just about <em>any</em> Mac, even down to System 1.1 (tested in vMac). Here, I'm simply grabbing the StuffIt archive using Internet Explorer 5 for UNIX on the CDE side and saving it into the Mac folder.

UnStuffing pretty much just works in MAE. It's not especially fast but unStuffing large </p><tt>.sit</tt><p> files isn't too swift on other 68K systems either. We now have a Mac directory that looks like this from the Unix side:

We'll get to the rules about when MAE creates AppleSingle and AppleDouble files in a moment. Let's see the numbers we get.

Each SieveAhl benchmark asks for the number of runs (too few on a fast system impairs accuracy due to the timekeeping method used). Our integer run with the Sieve clocks in at 4,701% (i.e., 4.7x) the speed of our reference ~8MHz Mac Plus. This is a Modula-2 version of the implementation originally published in <i>Byte</i> in September 1981. It iterates over the interval 0-8190, in which 1,899 primes are expected.

The FPU test is based on David Ahl's Simple Benchmark from <i>Creative Computing</i>, intended originally to evaluate performance and precision differences between various microcomputer BASIC implementations. We don't care about the accuracy or randomness values his benchmark would compute (well, we don't care <em>much</em>), so we just compute those and throw them away. This gets 4,863% the speed of a Mac Plus, which we would expect to be roughly the same because we have no floating point hardware. Repeated runs of both tests were nearly identical.

I mentioned that SoftwareFPU was turned off, so let's turn it on and see if it makes any difference to the floating point score. It does, but roughly only about 1% (!) better. However, it should be kept in mind that Apple's advertised 50 percent improvement was against using <em>regular</em> SoftwareFPU, not against using it at all. Additionally, MacMETH generates well-behaved code that calls SANE as it should and doesn't emit floating point instructions.

How does this compare to a real 68LC040? Conveniently, we have one handy to try it out on!

This is </p><tt>rintintin</tt><p>, my PowerBook 540c with a 33MHz 68LC040 and 12MB of RAM running Mac OS 7.6.1, and the most powerful Blackbird PowerBook sold in the United States (the later Japanese 550c is the same speed, but with a full 68040 and FPU). It was the first PowerBook with any '040 processor, stereo speakers, on-board Ethernet (via AAUI), a trackpad instead of a trackball, twin battery bays and a full-size keyboard. The PowerBook 520/520c and 540/540c came out just a couple months after the first Power Macs and Apple placed the processor onto a daughtercard as a promise that it could be eventually upgraded. As such, the "Ready for PowerPC upgrade" sticker came on these models from the factory, though this particular one is a slightly larger reproduction I printed up a few copies of so I could surreptitiously slap them on the Intel Macs at the Apple Store. Apple nevertheless greatly underestimated demand for the line, mistakenly believing people would rather wait for what eventually was the PowerBook 5300, and the Blackbirds were chronically short-stocked for months.
</p><p>
I upgraded this particular unit with an additional 8MB of RAM (on top of the base 4MB) and a SCSI2SD, making it an almost silent unit in operation. The only flaw it has is an iffy cable connection between the display and the top case, which is unfortunately a common problem with these models.

The Blackbird PowerBooks were also movie-famous, most notably in the first 1996 <i>Mission: Impossible</i> movie with Tom Cruise and Jon Voight. A regular Blackbird in the standard two-tone grey, most likely a 540c, was what Luther used to block the NOC list transmission on the TGV in the third act.

Similarly, both Phelps and Ethan use another PowerBook, this one painted jet black with no visible logos. However, if you look at the ports ...

... they also match the Blackbirds', making it either a 550c (which was, in fact, black) or a spray-painted 520c or 540c. Since Apple wasn't actually selling <em>any</em> Blackbird laptop anymore by the time the movie came out, neither computer's model badge is ever visible, though you can at least see a rainbow apple on Luther's.

One other fun sighting is an IBM ThinkPad 701 with its famous butterfly keyboard, but the really wacky part is what's onscreen, apparently some fevered mock mashup of Mac OS 8 and Sun's OPEN LOOK. Other Apple computers and hardware visible in the movie include a SuperMac monitor and AppleDesign keyboard as the console of the CIA's standalone terminal (and what might have been a Kensington TurboMouse ADB trackball), and a boxed Power Macintosh 8100 in the TGV's baggage hold. These were all part of Apple's $15 million [$29.4 million in 2025 dollars] movie sponsorship, even an Apple-specific movie poster that I have in my lab, but Apple themselves are never mentioned by name.

MAE actually exceeds the 540c on both benchmarks, which clock in at 3,572% and 3,862% respectively. Not bad! While the relationship is probably not linear due to the nature of dynamic recompilation, we can give a ballpark estimate for MAE's relative "clock speed" running on this 160MHz PABook as around 43MHz.

Let's try a web browser next. And, of course, we'll use a browser I'm maintaining as well: <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/lynx">MacLynx</a>, the venerable text browser natively ported to the MacOS. Here we'll run beta 6.

MacLynx starts up and shows the default on-disk home page. This is in fact a good test for MAE specifically because to do something like view Hacker News or Lobste.rs we need to change </p><tt>lynx.cfg</tt><p> to point to our local <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/crypto%20ancienne">Crypto Ancienne TLS 1.3 proxy server</a>. However, we don't have a proper text editor installed other than SimpleText.
</p><p>
We could certainly grab BBEdit Lite from the server as well, but MAE gives us an alternative. The manual indicates that "[b]y default, MAE stores files (except text files) in AppleSingle format." Text files, however, are stored as AppleDouble. If we look at our directory listing after unStuffing MacLynx, we can see this rule has been followed:

You'll notice that all the text files — the readmes, <tt>index.html</tt>, <tt>lynx.cfg</tt> and <tt>lynxrc</tt> — got separate resource forks as AppleDouble, but the main executable did not. Now, the smart ones among you will say, "But wait! The SieveAhl readme file is text, and it was AppleSingle!" That's right — except <em>that</em> file's text is all stored in styled text resources and there's nothing in the data fork at all. MAE seems to content-sniff files to figure out what to do with them, so BinHex files (which are valid text) will be treated as a text file and made AppleDouble, but a read-only SimpleText file with nothing in the data fork will be treated as a binary and made AppleSingle. The AppleDouble control panel allows you to always force storing files as AppleDouble with specific applications and the separately distributed <tt>asdtool</tt> will convert a Mac file between AppleSingle and AppleDouble from the shell prompt.

The upshot is that we now have a file we can simply edit from the Unix side with </p><tt>vi</tt><p> or, for the mentally deranged, </p><tt>emacs</tt><p> — and the resource fork will remain undisturbed. With MacLynx thus configured for the proxy server, we can view modern HTTPS sites inside MAE no problem.

I pulled over some more software to work on. When I'm installing my usual software set I ordinarily put either the StuffIt Expander app or an alias on the desktop as a shortcut.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQq3zXqubIGmFzBZUlYmvEEQtHoHQHvd2s_Ke9sOyCsbfF9iSyx8jJudm3wE7ulFSRngbej7Z6oL7Ppk1GANUABWnpNRwn26ZA9QjTtbv6pepGdNsaaBRjiuz_bc1KInCc0VPzWe6ltTWB08F9_RWwq6FajHBxpD-joIKFfCj0XCW3xu3eQPYvtNIozD8/s1024/mae39.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhQq3zXqubIGmFzBZUlYmvEEQtHoHQHvd2s_Ke9sOyCsbfF9iSyx8jJudm3wE7ulFSRngbej7Z6oL7Ppk1GANUABWnpNRwn26ZA9QjTtbv6pepGdNsaaBRjiuz_bc1KInCc0VPzWe6ltTWB08F9_RWwq6FajHBxpD-joIKFfCj0XCW3xu3eQPYvtNIozD8/s320/mae39.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

But this is also something MAE handles differently: instead of moving it, by default it creates an alias. (Aliases in MAE are still aliases, not symbolic or hard links, though a previously created symbolic link will also look like an alias.) You can copy the file by dragging it to the desktop with the Option key held down, but there's no way to indicate you want to <em>move</em> it. That almost sounds like that the MAE desktop doesn't belong to any MIV even though it is, in fact, part of the MIV for your home directory and that's where we had StuffIt Expander:
</p><div><pre>ruby:/home/spectre/% find . -name 'StuffItExpander alias' -print
./.mac/ruby/261985237/spectre/Desktop Folder/StuffItExpander alias
</pre></div>
<p>
Conveniently, if you open an alias to something on an MIV that's defined but not yet mounted, MAE will automount it on the desktop for you.

Our next set of programs will be TattleTech 2.8 and <a href="http://gestlab.free.fr/gestlab/glab_us.html#Top">Gestalt.Appl</a> so we can see what's going on under the hood. There are some surprises here.

The first surprise is the Gestalt ID MAE uses to identify itself: 19, corresponding to the Macintosh LC. I have no idea if this is why, but the original Cognac RISC prototype was the RISC LC (because it was built into an LC case), and it certainly seems like a rather suspicious coincidence. I am also amused that the last PRAM hard reset date is September 25, 1991. That would probably correlate to when the virtual PRAM data was first written to disk during the very early days of A/UX "4.0."

TattleTech comes up with a rather low estimate of the system's clock speed and also suggests the emulated bus speed is only 20MHz. Neither number is likely reliable.

No FPU is detected, either in the previous slide (where SoftwareFPU was still on from our testing with SieveAhl) or here where we turn it back off.

A single virtual NuBus slot is present. This is the emulated MAE video card ("Rev 2.0") and carries a revision date of June 13, 1994. The </p><tt>_L</tt><p> at the end of the </p><tt>Device sResource Name</tt><p> is significant because </p><tt>/opt/apple/bin/macd</tt><p> defines <em>six</em> such resources: </p><tt>Display_Video_Apple_MAE_S</tt><p>,
</p><tt>Display_Video_Apple_MAE_M</tt><p>,
</p><tt>Display_Video_Apple_MAE_L</tt><p>,
</p><tt>Display_Video_Apple_MAE_F</tt><p>,
</p><tt>Display_Video_Apple_MAE_C1</tt><p> and
</p><tt>Display_Video_Apple_MAE_C2</tt><p>. These apparently correlate to specific resolutions, namely (in the order they appear) "512 x 342 (9" Macintosh)",
"640 x 480 (14" Macintosh)",
"832 x 624 (17" Macintosh)",
"864 x 864 Resolution",
"640 x 800 Resolution" and
"640 x 640 Resolution". Since we're at 832x624, we get the </p><tt>_L</tt><p> (presumably small, medium, large, full and two custom?) "card." The emulated DeclROM used by these virtual cards is part of the big blob stored in </p><tt>/opt/apple/lib/engine</tt><p>, along with the Toolbox ROM and other goodies. We'll come back to this when we explore its Gestalt selectors.

Interestingly, the two usual Mac serial ports <em>are</em> defined, but neither appears to be supported. MAE naturally supports printing, but only to a "UNIX PostScript printer" (i.e., </p><tt>lpr</tt><p>) or via AppleTalk, and it does not support using the modem port for a modem or even as a serial port.

No surprises that TattleTech reports the operating system as 7.5.3 ("7.53") and reports on the presence of the MAE Enabler, but there are irregularities here too. The Finder is version "MAE 3.0 Update 4." AppleScript is present, as expected, but the Finder script extension version is "MAE 3.0.1."

A/UX is indicated as not present despite its provenance, CloseView is present (but again in a special "MAE 3.0" version), and the Code Fragment Manager isn't. Although CFM-68K was of course a thing, Apple had <a href="https://tidbits.com/1996/12/02/disable-the-cfm-68k-runtime-enabler/">deprecated it for 68K</a> in 1996.

The PPC (Process-to-Process Communications) ToolBox is also present, which we last exploited to <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">allow the Apple Network Server to numbercrunch for connected clients</a>. It should be possible to do something similar with MAE and have the local host do the work, but there are no local AppleTalk interfaces or headers to compile against.
</p><p>
QuickDraw is naturally present (no GX or 3D, of course). In MAE 3.0 QuickDraw is especially important and we'll get to that when we try playing a couple rather famous games. QuickTime is also present, version 2.5, though not everything is enabled (no software MIDI synthesizer, for example).

It's also worth pointing out that there is no Speech Manager. Apple specifically mentions the Speech Manager as incompatible in the MAE documentation, although it doesn't explain why. If an application installs it anyway, such as HyperCard, you can make MAE start with extensions off by passing </p><tt>-noextensions</tt><p>.

In the processes list, we see an otherwise invisible process called the MAE Helper. This process is what draws the MAE toolbar and chrome and manages its functions, and is started by the MAE Enabler.

The MAE Helper does not appear as a discrete task in About This Macintosh and is simply treated as part of the system software.

Darth Mac?), which is unique to MAE and is conveniently set to $00000304 (i.e., major version 3, minor version 4). While I don't have MAE 1.0 here to test with, René Ros indicates in his Gestalt reports that it </p><a href="http://www.rgaros.nl/gestalt/chapters/ch-19.html">has a <tt>cith</tt> value of 0</a><p>, though it does exist there too. I don't know what version MAE 2.0 reports but I'm sure someone is firing it up right now to find out and will post in the comments.
</p><p>
To more easily decipher the others we'll turn to Gestalt.Appl and I'll point out the highlights.

<tt>micn</tt><p> is not interesting for the icon (just generic Mac) but rather the string shown, which is a </p><tt>STR#</tt><p> resource indexed by the value of </p><tt>mach</tt><p> (-16395). The string is "Macintosh ApplicationEnvironment" [sic].

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilW4MqlaqpDqVEg4oTuat9ODHqd-74n_DV06RDn3gOFmNkhFoV9U4uReE50FldSwk0C9NZhfmVdeB7rXFlsIBSIcZwx5nZ7w6fh8ZMhnR5IpLcLK3h9EyYmdJErypTwMxhaxm7uLWKaN80TiK3KcrysPI6xGU2pLFgVSf4Us0WbnxYICvMQ54CVQlxxAQ/s1024/mae54.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEilW4MqlaqpDqVEg4oTuat9ODHqd-74n_DV06RDn3gOFmNkhFoV9U4uReE50FldSwk0C9NZhfmVdeB7rXFlsIBSIcZwx5nZ7w6fh8ZMhnR5IpLcLK3h9EyYmdJErypTwMxhaxm7uLWKaN80TiK3KcrysPI6xGU2pLFgVSf4Us0WbnxYICvMQ54CVQlxxAQ/s320/mae54.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

There is no MMU indicated in "</p><tt>mmu </tt><p>" (note space), but this isn't a surprise for an emulator. Consequently, there is also no virtual memory support within MAE (the host is supposed to handle that).

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDi3XTIAMVQkZCpxldKSifNS4QFMBcVwhWm2yxC3EuRRuQW0NvxuAw71Pytkpdm4oDdWfYpXTYk3A6j_CmsaB3dGMMbZJjIW_d0ZOXzblnsbMDJmSUx-yS3kNyq6LK0vta7Jw2be7fQwCAVUwE16wW_UwAdICgImAG8FJ03GMJPeXEGRC9YuEJpMFwlzU/s1024/mae55.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhDi3XTIAMVQkZCpxldKSifNS4QFMBcVwhWm2yxC3EuRRuQW0NvxuAw71Pytkpdm4oDdWfYpXTYk3A6j_CmsaB3dGMMbZJjIW_d0ZOXzblnsbMDJmSUx-yS3kNyq6LK0vta7Jw2be7fQwCAVUwE16wW_UwAdICgImAG8FJ03GMJPeXEGRC9YuEJpMFwlzU/s320/mae55.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

The ROM version (</p><tt>romv</tt><p>) is more interesting. Although a great many Old World Mac ROMs are tagged as version 1917, the particular ROM that MAE is using is from the Quadra 660AV and 840AV because we can find its checksum (</p><tt>5b f1 0f d1</tt><p>) and version (</p><tt>07 7d</tt><p>) at offset $001c0000 in </p><tt>/opt/apple/lib/engine</tt><p>. No other valid checksum and version appears anywhere else in this file, and no true </p><s>Scotsman</s><p> Macintosh LC would have used a ROM that recent. Thus, if you get a Gestalt ID of 19 but a ROM version of 1917, that's a pretty good indication you're running under MAE. René's list also shows a ROM version of 1917 for MAE 1.0, so MAE 2.0 almost certainly does as well.

Despite TattleTech finding the virtual NuBus video card, </p><tt>sltc</tt><p> insists there aren't any NuBus slots.

Finally, one more unique selector value is under </p><tt>snhw</tt><p> for the sound hardware, which reports a driver </p><tt>cith</tt><p>. This likewise appears nowhere else and is specific to the MAE emulated audio hardware. Oddly, although MAE 1.0 lacked sound, René's list indicates an </p><tt>snhw</tt><p> of </p><tt>awac</tt><p> which would suggest <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2022/12/the-strange-case-of-beos-srs-and-silent.html">an AWACS</a>.
</p><p>
Let's get back to running some more apps. I'm going to bump up the emulated RAM now because a couple near the end will likely benefit.

In MAE, since there's no virtual (or for that matter actual physical) memory, the Memory control panel serves a largely different purpose. You can still set the disk cache size (it helpfully reminds you this applies to "Macintosh volumes only"), but you can also set MAE's total memory size up to 45MB. We have 512MB in this PABook, so we'll just max it out for the remainder of this article.

And, after restart, we now have 45MB of RAM.

Fetch, the venerable Macintosh FTP client — <a href="https://fetchsoftworks.com/">still sold!</a> — was a bit of a mixed bag on MAE. 2.1.2 was the 68K version I had on </p><tt>thule</tt><p>, so I tried that first. It starts and runs fine, but when I actually tried to download anything with this version of Fetch it locked up the entire emulated Mac as soon the file was transferred. That said, I'm not sure if this is a fault of MAE or Fetch because at the exact same point of the exact same file with the exact same version of Fetch on the 540c, it abruptly dropped the connection and threw an error message — though I note transfer speeds were faster on MAE, probably because of the better hardware, right up until it hit the wall.
</p><p>
Fortunately the later Fetch 3.0.1 behaves correctly and Apple even offered that specific version for download from the MAE website. There are specific advantages to using Fetch in MAE because of its transparent support for AppleSingle transfers. Still, grabbing files with MacLynx works fine too (hurray for eating your own dogfood), so I'll mostly use that.

Unfortunately, </p><a href="https://github.com/cy384/ssheven"><tt>ssheven</tt></a><p>, which works great on my real Macs, crashes on MAE and I'm not sure why.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeKmy5JC0zBX2ohmla-Pc6iYTtHQ3qihaXxG_pEdH0HJX3DjBsRW7n57Gvpmx1-n1LJ09kOh0ms9PNwQn2ytezFiFlW-NgKKcnfUdSXCHBQg1RgJuEQs8V2tyEKU9Y5ntF66BXRCPmoVpDs1lOIW-R2lZ93ZAhO33nbp6TE-7suThmHiXk9uJc8PP0Yc0/s1024/mae63.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgeKmy5JC0zBX2ohmla-Pc6iYTtHQ3qihaXxG_pEdH0HJX3DjBsRW7n57Gvpmx1-n1LJ09kOh0ms9PNwQn2ytezFiFlW-NgKKcnfUdSXCHBQg1RgJuEQs8V2tyEKU9Y5ntF66BXRCPmoVpDs1lOIW-R2lZ93ZAhO33nbp6TE-7suThmHiXk9uJc8PP0Yc0/s320/mae63.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

In fact, at one point the crash was so severe it actually caused MAE itself to quit, whereupon I was chastised for an improper shutdown when bringing it back up. This special variant of the usual Mac "didn't Shut Down" window is unique to MAE. I'm not sure if the crash is exploitable but it's not good news regardless. This is probably a problem in MAE specifically rather than </p><tt>ssheven</tt><p>, though I'd have to get a better debugger up on it to figure it out.

The old MacSSH didn't do much better. Telnet was fine and worked fine, and I had already expected that SSH2 sessions would take a while to negotiate keys (back in the day when I used my Quadra 605 for this with a 25MHz full 68040, it took about 45 seconds). However, this connection to a local test host locked up hard. The MAE manual says that Command-Option-Esc doesn't work for quitting a hung Mac application, but it actually does — you just have to blindly click the Force Quit button (leftmost). As with any real Mac, though, you really should restart afterwards.
</p><p>
These aren't fatal flaws, however, because we could also just use a CDE terminal window for Telnet and <tt>ssh</tt>, and that would even be more useful. Instead, we should  try something <em>really</em> important next.

The Macintosh port of Wolfenstein 3D was done by Rebecca Heinemann and her team when she was still at Interplay, under their MacPlay label. It came in both this full version on multiple floppies, which is the one I bought at retail back in the day, and a shareware three-level "First Encounter" which was criticized as poor value for free. The Mac version is related to the enhanced Atari Jaguar port and uses higher resolution textures, sprites and sound than the original DOS version, plus a different status bar, new weapons and thirty more "Second Encounter" levels from the Super NES and Jag; the 3DO and <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2021/02/the-quest-for-wolfenstein-3d-music-on.html">Apple IIgs</a> versions are derived from the Mac version. This port was released in 1994 and the "Accelerated for Power Macintosh" and "System 7 Savvy" stickers give the rough timeframe. It requires a 25MHz 68030 or better and is a fat binary.
</p><p>
Given that the PABook doesn't have a floppy drive, I copied over this version by simply Stuffing the installed folder on my Power Macintosh 7300 and downloading it over shell FTP (NCSA Telnet on the Mac contains a very basic FTP server which is handy for this).

To give it the best chance of working well, I bumped up its preferred memory partition to a full ten megabytes and, based on the advice in the MAE administrator's manual, knocked the audio output sample rate down to 22.050kHz instead of 44.1kHz: "On low-performance workstations, you may need to lower the sampling rate if you experience pauses or gaps in sound output." (This is a big heaping bowl of foreshadowing, kids.)

I was expecting it to crash, but not only did it not crash, but the music was just as brassy as ever.

Notice that the palette, being a 256-colour mode, is affecting the MAE toolbar, demonstrating it is indeed drawn and maintained by the guest Mac. In fact, when the screen fades out between slides, the icons in the toolbar partially fade out also. It would have been nice if Apple had come up with an auto-hide option.

It originally came up in this postage-stamp view at 320x200. This was small, but it was totally playable.

There is an extension called <a href="gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/archive/info-mac/game/com/wolf/">Wolfenzoom</a> (Gopher link) that will scale-blit the 320x200 to 640x400, and I used to use it on my unaccelerated desktop Macintosh IIci when I first bought this game. However, since I'm all about pushing my luck, let's try the highest resolution.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrXoKHYsJi-zCpsnxVV4dIOcyq5z2Kb6MFvqezWvsR-JX0UwaDpcmbPySJJSvCfjdUc5RHL8fdRlsfoU2FqaG7KjKRYTdqL5MGmhaugUEChUn4qxUgJ5Npva2p8NCkvVvLvbND_7uG4IsREgHRwZNpaC6ElkdpBu5zP3wDjQlV8r5B5drSE_JnGM3YPus/s1024/mae71.xwd.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="768" data-original-width="1024" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrXoKHYsJi-zCpsnxVV4dIOcyq5z2Kb6MFvqezWvsR-JX0UwaDpcmbPySJJSvCfjdUc5RHL8fdRlsfoU2FqaG7KjKRYTdqL5MGmhaugUEChUn4qxUgJ5Npva2p8NCkvVvLvbND_7uG4IsREgHRwZNpaC6ElkdpBu5zP3wDjQlV8r5B5drSE_JnGM3YPus/s320/mae71.xwd.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

And, well, it worked! ... mostly. The game played well. Frame rate wasn't butter smooth but it was decent and you could mow down Nazis with little fuss. Sounds, however, were very delayed, sometimes for surprisingly long periods: you'd shoot a trooper, and about five seconds later eventually hear the gunfight and his guttural German demise. The really surprising part is the audio lag got even worse when I dropped the sound quality further still to 11.025kHz.
</p><p>
As it happens, not only is a full 44.1kHz sample rate needed for audio to play in a timely fashion, but it also didn't really seem to slow the game down much at all. Music and sound effects all came through great once I cranked the sample rate back up. (This might be different on Solaris.) In fact, to my delight I found Wolfenstein 3D played better overall on MAE than on the 540c. It looks like the HP audio server handles audio so well that it's unlikely it would be the direct cause of most performance problems.

One particular reason I wanted to test Wolf3D is because it can operate in both QuickDraw and direct-to-video memory modes. When Use QuickDraw is checked (the default), Wolf3D restricts itself to documented QuickDraw calls, which is the slowest but most compatible option and works with pretty much any video card or machine. When Use QuickDraw is <em>un</em>checked, the game will try to draw directly to video memory. This doesn't always work, and as you can see in this screenshot, not all of the screen was updating properly in this mode.
</p><p>
This observation will become relevant when we try running our next game. You do see where this is going, don't you?

These are my retail copies of Ultimate Doom and Doom II I bought at CompUSA in their Mac-specific boxes, ported by Lion Entertainment for GT Interactive. (Lion also did the Mac ports of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior, but there were never official ports of Strife or the original Heretic, and the Hexen port was by Presage.) The Mac ports play unmodified PC WADs but can do so at double resolution, and they support deathmatch both over IPX and AppleTalk, though an update is needed to support AppleTalk netplay on later versions of MacOS. Again, our PABook doesn't have a CD-ROM drive, so I pulled a copy of it from the Power Macintosh 7300 too.

This is our first bad sign. There is no music, though this is expected because the QuickTime that comes with MAE doesn't implement a MIDI synthesizer, but half the screen isn't updating. These ports expect to write directly to video memory; they don't generally go through QuickDraw.

The Mac-specific loading screen <em>does</em> use QuickDraw, and appears correctly, but ...

... as the Phobos Lab demo runs, you can see it start to accumulate stale areas of the screen.

You can force the screen to update by messing with the interface or the menu, but the gaps suggested we might have better luck with a smaller screen resolution, so we'll quit and try that.

While a bit of the bottom of the screen is cut off at 640x480, this seems better immediately.

Shrinking down the viewport and enabling low detail makes a reasonably playable game and you can see enough of the numbers in the status bar to be useful (except for rockets and energy cells). It can be periodically forced to repaint by interacting with the GUI or Doom main menu.

Interestingly, reducing the size of the drawport even further (Options, Small Graphics) yielded some of the same repainting problems that we saw in Wolf3D with QuickDraw off.

These resolve promptly with Large Graphics, so however it works, this configuration appears to be the sweet spot for Doom on MAE.

Just for yuks, let's see if it gets any better if we reduce the Mac screen down even further to the "minimum" 512x342.

Since even the QuickDraw-drawn loading screen is getting cropped, I suspect that Doom won't handle this screen resolution ...

... and although it will play, it crashes hard after only a brief period. In fact, in my second experiment with this resolution, it also ended up taking MAE down completely. That said, I suspect it wasn't ever designed for a viewport that small.
</p><p>
If you're fine with a bit of the status bar being cut off, Doom at 640x480 runs acceptably well with the viewport reduced. (I haven't tried it with a non-standard screen size but I suspect it would misbehave similarly.) Note that there is no MIDI music, though sound effects played fine. However, as far as performance goes, Doom was where the 540c did better overall: it played more smoothly with larger viewports, and did so with a consistent framerate. On MAE the game's responsiveness was rather variable, probably some weird thrashing in the dynamic compilation alternating between reasonably zippy and an occasional crawl. It's hardly unplayable but overall better on a real 68K (and of course better still on any Power Macintosh).
</p><p>
In a vague attempt at productivity I loaded the classic Microsoft Word 5.1 onto MAE, though I was pretty sure Apple would have tested an app that common to ensure it would work. This is also on the Netatalk share on <tt>thule</tt>, but copying Word 5.1 over was a much bigger situation than simply grabbing a single file and its resource fork; we had a number of double-forked files we needed to move <i>en masse</i>. This Perl script, which works on both Perl 5 and 4.036, will iterate over a copy and move Netatalk's AppleDouble resource files into the proper location for MAE, resolving ambiguities in filenames if needed.

It worked fine, of course. I had no printer configured and no need to set one up, but loading and saving Word documents "just worked." I'm quite sure Microsoft Excel and pretty sure Adobe Photoshop would also work this way, though since we're at 256 colours and using an "Approximate" palette, Photoshop's utility would likely be reduced for all but bitmap art due to poor colour fidelity.

As MAE 3.0 specifically advertised that it was faster than previous versions over remote X, let's test how well that works from my POWER9 Raptor Talos II in Fedora 42. Being the Wayland refusenik I am, I still run KDE Plasma in X11, so with <tt>xhost</tt> set appropriately and <a href="https://www.talospace.com/2023/01/your-x-server-may-no-longer-swing-both.html"><tt>AllowByteSwappedClients</tt></a> enabled (because the POWER9 is running Power ISA little-endian and the PABook is running big) we should be able to connect:

And poof, here we are. We get no audio because we're obviously not running an HP-compatible audio server, but even remote audio should work if you were running a little HP workstation off a bigger HP server (like, say, the dual PA-8900 C8000 I have on the shelf gathering dust that I really need to find a place for).

Because we're running this window with a 24-bit visual on a much bigger screen, we now have many more choices in colour depth ...

... and an interesting new 1920x1050 (not 1080) resolution. Naturally you can resize the window to whatever you want, of course.
</p><p>
The key improvement is that MAE 3.0 is much more efficient with Xlib calls. In MAE 2 and earlier, apps would draw to the frame buffer, either through QuickDraw or direct access, and MAE would then push the changed portion of the framebuffer to the X server. This is a very compatible and straightforward approach to screen updates but could lead to large amounts of bitmap data being pushed, significantly bottlenecking the networks of the time if the session were remote. In MAE 3.0, MAE will turn QuickDraw operations themselves into Xlib calls, inckuding pushing much smaller bitmaps like icons, fonts and parts of interfaces which can even be pre-cached by the X server in the pixmap cache. The framebuffer is only directly referenced in corner situations such as the window being restored or revealed, which Apple estimated made MAE 3.0's network overhead only ten percent of MAE 2.0's.

For apps with a modest amount of screen updates, this works very well. Pull-down menus had a little bit of lag but typing into a Word document was fine. I did have to go into the Keyboard control panel and remap my <em>actual</em> Command and Option keys, though (I use a white A1048 USB Apple Keyboard with the Quad G5 and the Talos II).

Wolf3D chugged pretty badly this way, however, because it's frequently pushing almost an entire bitmap and the PABook LASI only supports 10Mbit Ethernet. (It may have worked better with the 10/100 PCMCIA option.) At the 320x200 screen size it was cautiously playable but Use QuickDraw had to be checked to make screen updates in any way consistent.
</p><p>
Of course, that's not what MAE-over-remote-X was intended for. Rather, it was intended for a multi-seat license where some big K- or L-Class or SunFire hulking in the server room served multiple simultaneous MAE sessions to multiple remote clients and kept all their files and documents centrally. In my brief experience, it seems like it would have been more than suitable for that purpose.

This </p><tt>DITL</tt><p> looks like it's part of a credits easter egg, though I haven't figured out yet how to trigger it. I'm assuming the dog is named Rosco ("In Memory of Rosco - 10/5/96"). Also note the dog's Dr Seuss hat, a callback to MAE's "Cat-in-the-Hat" codename.
</p><p>
Here's the MAE 3.0 development team: Peter Blas, Michael Brenner, Matthew Caprile, Mary Chan, Bill Convis, Jerry Cottingham, Ivan Drucker, Gerri Eaton, Tim Gilman, Gary Giusti, Mark Gorlinsky, John Grabowski, Cindi Hollister, Richard W. Johnson, John Kullmann, Tom Molnar, John Morley, Stephen Nelson, Michael Press, Jeff Roberts, Shinji Sato, Marc Sinykin, Earl Wallace, Gayle Wiesner. This list of credits will show up again later.

Are you one of these people (from the development team or these groups)? Say hi in the comments or drop me a line at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com (I'll keep you anonymous if you're concerned about your NDAs). I would love to pick your brain on any interesting details you remember.

I also noticed these icons in amongst the other expected </p><tt>PICT</tt><p>s. I'm not sure what they refer to. Notice that the </p><tt>Toolbar Menu</tt><p> when you use the third mouse button is actually just a bunch of PICT resources.
</p><p>
There are some other interesting things of note when we start going through the binaries. I separately extracted the files from the installer packages (they're just <tt>cpio</tt> archives) to preserve their time stamps for analysis. Let's look at everything that's there and then dig into the most notable individual files.

All of the core binaries have a modification date of January 23, 1997, presumably the RTM date.

<p>
Of the library files, <tt>data</tt> and <tt>engine</tt> are probably the most notable. We will look at those seprately.
</p><p>
<tt>KeymapDepotDB</tt> is where the default keymaps MAE uses are kept, and <tt>MajorUpdate</tt> is instructions to the installer script for how to perform an upgrade to a new major release. Since there's no MAE 4.0, this presumably will never be used again. The manual does not document what <tt>btree</tt> does, and it has only a single readable string in it: <tt>Copyright 1991 Apple Computer, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Ricardo Batista</tt>
</p><p>
The rest are character set mappings and the EULAs in graphic form for both the MAE demo and the full version (with X bitmap buttons for accept/don't accept in all languages except English):

<tt>/opt/apple/lib/data</tt> contains the rest of the System Folder, with common pieces like the System 7.5 jigsaw puzzle (licensed by Apple from Captain's Software), note pad (Light Software), scrapbook, menu bar clock (from Steve Christensen's SuperClock!), desktop patterns, compressed System resources and standard INITs and CDEVs. <tt>/opt/apple/sys</tt>, however, which we won't do much more with here, is the master template for creating each user's own System Folder. We don't need to look at it again because we already saw my own copy of it.

<tt>/opt/apple/lib/engine</tt> is a mashup of many miscellaneous tools. There are various conglomated binaries in it ratted out by the presence of <tt>.text</tt>, <tt>.data</tt> and <tt>.bss</tt>, plus the fake DeclROM for the virtual video card and the Quadra 660AV/840AV Toolbox ROM it uses. There are also many other interesting strings, and being a 10MB file, there are a lot of them:

File "%s" has invalid information in it. 
 Try rebuilding your .mac directory.  
The following line in the .MIV_file is invalid because it refers to one
of the special MAE directories.  You cannot create a MIV for the apple
directory, .mac directory, or system folder.  You also cannot create a
MIV for any directory enclosed in one of the MAE special directories.
This line will be ignored until the problem is corrected.
"%d:%s"
The following line in the .MIV_file references the same directory as
a line which was already processed. The pathnames of these duplicates may
not be identical in the .MIV_file if symbolic links or the '~' character

<p>
<tt>legal</tt> in particular looks like it's just an embedded Tcl/Tk script. It's also notable that <tt>appleping</tt>, <tt>appletalk</tt>, <tt>atlookup</tt>, <tt>asdtool</tt> and <tt>legal</tt> still have symbol tables. The AppleTalk tools in particular list functions related to DDP, LAP, NBP and RTMP, but you'd expect that (<tt>legal</tt> has symbols for Tcl/Tk instead). Interestingly, a few of the strings in <tt>appletalk</tt> suggest that LocalTalk might have been, or at least was considered for being, supported at one time.
</p><p>
Although <tt>mae</tt> is the binary that you run directly, <tt>macd</tt> is what handles a lot of the background stuff and <tt>mae</tt> communicates with it over IPC. The administrator's manual is (probably intentionally) vague about its exact functions, saying only that it "is a daemon that runs whenever <tt>apple/bin/mae</tt> runs and helps MAE interact with the UNIX environment. It also cleans up after <tt>mae</tt> if the <tt>mae</tt> process is killed." We can get a little better idea of what it does from its own set of strings at least:

Unless otherwise specified, the following rules apply:
  -  Commands are single-letter and case matters a whole lot!
  -  Whitespace between the command and arguments are allowed.
  -  Values are hex by default.
  -  Addresses are automatically forced to be on even address boundaries.
  -  '&lt;68kaddr&gt;' is an address which will be offsetted automatically by
     the emulator so it lies within the 68k image.  For example, on this
     HP system a &lt;68kaddr&gt; of 0x4600 is a real address of 0x%x.
  -  '&lt;emuaddr&gt;' is an address which is not mucked with in any manner.  It
     can be any address within the emulator address space.

The Midnight Emulator uses the same license file as regular MAE and wants an A/UX COFF file, an echo of its past. Fortunately we have an A/UX machine handy here too, our old friend <tt>spindler</tt>, my clock-chipped Quadra 800. We'll fire it up in A/UX 3.1.

  <tt>/bin/sync</tt> looks like a very small, yet valid A/UX binary we can pull over and see if Midnight will run it. First, a quick negative control by running it on itself:
</p><div><pre>ruby:/opt/apple/bin/% ./midnight midnight
Midnight Emulator version 12:02:00 Remote Debug version built Mar 25 1997 at 10:26:25, loading midnight
file midnight is neither COFF nor engine
</pre></div>
<p>
The complaint that it's <tt>neither COFF nor engine</tt> suggests that its normal state is to be running <tt>/opt/apple/lib/engine</tt>, though this isn't too interesting, since we would assume MAE does that ordinarily. Regardless, it doesn't like our real A/UX COFF binary, even though it does try to load it.

<p>
It is particularly strange that <tt>mae</tt> has a modification date of January 23, 1997, but the Midnight Emulator claims to have been built on March 25, over two months later. More explorations to come, especially into whether this could help to debug MAE itself.
</p><p>
At the end of this extensive strange trip, I found I rather liked the way MAE worked, and the integration features with HP-UX in particular really tempt me to try running it as my primary environment on top of CDE or VUE. Its performance was surprisingly good and I think if I had the choice back in the day between buying new a 3400c or this thing, even as noisy, heavy and costly as it is, I might strongly have considered buying the latter. Also, I bet MAE would run like a bat out of hell on my maximally configured C8000 and some additional explorations of the Macintosh Application Environment, possibly also on one of my SAIC Galaxys with a floppy drive and an earlier version of HP-UX, might be the subject of <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/search/label/mae">a future article</a>.
</p><p>
The MAE team clearly didn't think 3.0 was the end of MAE; in the MAE 3.0 white paper's "Future Directions" they indicate that support for additional hardware platforms and "additional UNIX systems" are "being considered." They acknowledge the fact it doesn't run Power Mac software, even saying that "Apple is also investigating the viability of supporting PowerPC Macintosh applications on MAE." However, the document also adds that "Apple wants to ensure that the performance of RISC-on-RISC emulation will meet customer requirements before committing to this development effort." It's not clear if any work on this was ever done.
</p><p>
In the wake of Apple's purchase of NeXT in 1997 there was a mention in <i>Informationweek</i> that MAE would be ported to NeXTSTEP as a solution for legacy applications, but this would have been a limiting choice because of the existing PowerPC software that people wanted to run and I don't think it was ever a truly serious proposal. Although I couldn't find anything obvious in the trade rags about exactly when MAE was cancelled, I suspect Gil Amelio did it at Steve Jobs' suggestion after the buyout, like what happened with the <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/11/the-apple-network-servers-all-too.html">Apple Network Server</a> and <a href="http://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html">OpenDoc</a>. After all, MAE had just become superfluous after Apple adopted Rhapsody as the future Mac OS: now that Apple had its own Unix, there was no reason to support anyone else's. Nevertheless, although the Classic Environment in PowerPC versions of Rhapsody and Mac OS X (nicknamed the "Blue Box") is not a direct descendant of MAE, it's very possible that MAE informed its design. In practice, Classic is actually closer to MAS in concept in that it runs native PowerPC code directly in the so-called "problem state" on a paravirtualized Mac OS 8 or 9, using the standard ROM 68K emulator for 68K applications. Classic is less flexible than MAE in that only one instance can be running on any one Power Mac and only one user can be running it, but it was never going to be the future anyway.

As for RDI, in 1998 it was bought by its primary British competitor Tadpole, who also specialized in high-performance RISC laptops and had a SPARC line of their own. Tadpole turned the Carlsbad facility into their North American operations and continued to sell the PrecisionBook now under the Tadpole-RDI brand, adding the faster 180MHz version. Although no Tadpole or RDI laptop sold in massive commodity numbers, HP's concern over the looming one instruction per cycle limit caused them to begin moving away from PA-RISC to their experiments with EPIC VLIW, culminating in the fiddly and underwhelming early generation of Itanium. This hurt the PA-RISC workstation market the most, including niche systems like the PABook, and Tadpole eventually dropped it from their product line around 2001. In 2003 Tadpole renamed itself to Tadpole Computer, eliminating the last vestiges of RDI, and jettisoned all but their remaining SPARC line as they moved to Cupertino, California. General Dynamics bought them in 2005 and merged the company with General Dynamics' other recent acquisition, luggables manufacturer Itronix; the Itronix division closed its doors in 2013.

Again, if you were part of the MAE team and can shed a little light on how this all worked and your remembrances, please post in the comments or drop me a line privately at ckaiser at floodgap dawt com if you'd prefer to remain anonymous. It's a great little tool and more should be understood about everything that went into it.

<h2 id="where-to-start">Where to start</h2>
<p>See below for links to the <a href="#inventory">2024 winning IOCCC entries</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the <code>index.html</code> web pages for each winning entry. They have
most of the information you need to compile and run the winning program.
Take a look at the winning source code and try to figure out how it works.
You might also want to check out the author’s remarks for even more details.</p>
<p>You may <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/2024.tar.bz2">download all winning entries</a> in the form
of a compressed tarball, for this year’s contest.</p>

<p>This year marked the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/faq.html#ioccc_start">40th anniversary of the IOCCC</a>.
The <strong>IOCCC28</strong> opened submissions from <strong>2025-03-05 23:19:17.131107 UTC</strong> to <strong>2025-06-05
04:03:02.010099 UTC</strong> after a 4 year pause.</p>
<p>A significant portion of those 4 years was an effort by a <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/thanks-for-help.html">number of people</a>,
with over 6168+ commits, to rebuild the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC website</a>
in what became known as the <strong>Great Fork Merge</strong>.</p>
<p>Another portion of those 4 years went into retooling the IOCCC, including the creation of
the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry toolkit</a>, a new
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/register.html">IOCCC registration process</a>, and a new
<a href="https://submit.ioccc.org/">IOCCC submit server</a> (which may not be up if the contest is closed).</p>
<p>The <strong>major motivation</strong> for the above was to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Present <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/years.html">IOCCC winners</a> that that honors the contributions of all of the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/authors.html">winning authors</a> from <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/location.html">around the world</a>,</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the administrative effort required by the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> to run the contest, and</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the time between when the winners of the IOCCC are selected and when the source is made available.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On the last point, for <strong>IOCCC28</strong> the Judging started on <strong>2025-06-05 04:03:02.010099 UTC</strong> and then the winners were selected by the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> on <strong>2025-07-07 20:05:07.000000 UTC</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Winners were announced during a live the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OurFavoriteUniverse">Our Favorite Universe</a> YouTube Channel that started on <strong>2025-08-02 18:00:00.000000 UTC</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Near the end of the 2 hour XXX-add-show-URL-here-XXX YouTube show, the <strong>source code</strong> of the <a href="#inventory">IOCCC28 winning entries</a> was published on <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">IOCCC GitHub winner repo</a> and on the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/index.html">Official IOCCC website</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No longer will there be many months</strong> between when the winners are
announced and their source code is made available. For <strong>IOCCC28</strong>
the time was <strong>less than 2 hours</strong>. :-)</p>
<h3 id="increased-submission-quantity-and-quality">Increased submission quantity and quality</h3>
<p>The submissions to <strong>IOCCC28</strong> were remarkable when compared with previous contests, in both the
<strong>increased quantity and quality</strong> of the submissions. As a result the judging process for <strong>IOCCC28</strong>
was more challenging and required greater effort. Thankfully due to the above mentioned improvements,
the judging process <strong>took only 33 days</strong>. Under the previous system it <strong>would have taken much longer</strong>!</p>
<p>One thing that began to emerge after we exits the early rounds of judging and entered the middle rounds
of judging was that we were very likely to have more winning entries than in previous contests.
Even so, the final rounds of judging required more rounds and tool longer than in any previous IOCCC.</p>
<p>At the end of the final round of the final rounds of judging, we had a record <strong>23 winners of IOCCC28</strong>,
eclipsing the record of 15 winners!</p>
<p>While we suspect that the 4 year gap between <strong>IOCCC27</strong> and <strong>IOCCC28</strong> allowed people extra
time to improve their submissions, we also believe that people submitting to the IOCCC have
adept in obfuscation and have become more skilled in the programming in the C language.</p>
<h3 id="code-size-and-rule-2">Code size and Rule 2</h3>
<p>We were pleased to observe that while the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/faq.html#size_rule_history">IOCCC size limit</a>
increased by about 21%, we received many submissions that were well under the new
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2 size limit</a> including a fair number of quality
small and medium sized submissions. Half of the <strong>IOCCC28 winners</strong> were less than
<em>2/3 of the size limit</em>, and 10 of the <strong>IOCCC28 winners</strong> were less than
<em>1/2 of the size limit</em>!</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: The <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/faq.html#size_rule_history">IOCCC size limit</a> increase for <strong>IOCCC28</strong>
was the first size increase in over 10 years. Given the quality of submissions we received
that were well under the limit, we do <strong>NOT</strong> expect to change the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2 size limit</a> for <strong>at least another 10 years</strong> (and likely longer).</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT HINT</strong>: Only 3 of 23 the <strong>IOCCC28 winners</strong> came close to the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html#rule2">Rule 2 size limit</a>.
Large code size isn’t everything. :-) Those submitting to future contents should
<strong>take a careful note</strong> of that fact.</p>
<h3 id="rules-and-guidelines-for-this-contest">Rules and Guidelines for this contest</h3>
<p>Here are the final versions of the IOCCC rules and guidelines that were in effect for this contest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/rules.html">2024 rules</a> version <strong>28.30 2025-03-03</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/guidelines.html">2024 guidelines</a> version <strong>28.47 2025-03-15</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="looking-forward-to-the-next-contest">Looking forward to the next contest</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> realize that the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and
the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> need to be <strong>greatly improved and streamlined</strong>.
We decided to not overhaul them for <strong>IOCCC28</strong> so as to <strong>NOT</strong> delay the opening of the contest.</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/judges.html">IOCCC Judges</a> take a short <em>IOCCC Vacation</em> (we have been working solid
on <strong>IOCCC28</strong> since <strong>2020 Dec 30</strong>), we plan to update, improve and streamline the
<a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/rules.html">IOCCC rules</a> and the <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/next/guidelines.html">IOCCC guidelines</a> for <strong>IOCCC29</strong>.
Then we will address whatever bug fixes in the form of GitHub Pull Requests to both the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner">IOCCC GitHub winner repo</a> and the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/mkiocccentry">mkiocccentry toolkit repo</a> that may be pending.</p>
<p>Once we are all caught up, we will set the opening date for <strong>IOCCC29</strong>. It is our plan
to open <strong>IOCCC29</strong> sometime in <strong>2025 December</strong>.</p>

<p>There were a number of remarkable winning entries for <strong>IOCCC28</strong>. We wish to call
attention to a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/kurdyukov1/index.html">2024/kurdyukov1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This entry is a fun revisit of the theme of <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2000/natori/index.html">2000/natori</a>,
only better and without using any floating point arithmetic. You are invited
to try and understand why the constant <code>2551443</code> is common to both entries.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/cable1/index.html">2024/cable1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This entry claims to be “<em>the world’s smallest LLM (large language
model) inference engine</em>”: running open-source model based on Meta’s
LLaMA 2 with 7 billion parameters. After downloading the model via the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/cable1/get_model.sh">2024/cable1/get_model.sh</a> script,
we invite you explore this <strong>ChatIOCCC</strong> tool. While not super fast,
the tool’s output can be amusing.</p>
<p>You might wish to ask <strong>ChatIOCCC</strong>: “<em>Why did this entry win IOCCC28?</em>”?</p>
<p>We encourage you to read and understand the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/cable1/prog.c">2024/cable1/prog.c source code</a>. Then see
if the <strong>ChatIOCCC</strong> tool can offer any new, or even correct insights
into the code’s obfuscation. :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/howe/index.html">2024/howe</a></li>
</ul>
<p>“<em>Eh</em>”? The source code, with its UTF-8 conforming accent gives you a
polite editor that is more functional an <code>ed(1)</code>.</p>
<p>We invite you to use the program to view the UTF-8 fun in the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/howe/prog.c">2024/howe/prog.c source code</a>.</p>
<p><strong>HINT to emacs users</strong>: type <strong>Q</strong> or press <strong>CTRL+C</strong> to exit. 🤓</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/stedolan/index.html">2024/stedolan</a></li>
</ul>
<p>When you view the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/stedolan/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>,
notice magic numbers. This <strong>one liner</strong> packs a significant amount
of obfuscation in only 135 bytes!</p>
<p>Try giving 10 hex digits to standard input of the program. Then try a
different hex digits value. Then feed the MD5 hash of the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/stedolan/prog.c">2024/stedolan/prog.c source code</a> and
“<em>C</em>” what happens. :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/endoh1/index.html">2024/endoh1</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/endoh1/try.sh">2024/endoh1/try.sh</a> will carry you on
a journey that tests your patience as well as the patience of the C-preprocessor.</p>
<p>Building a 8x8 image requires order of 20 seconds of C-preprocessor
time, when running 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel. Unfortunately,
with such a tiny image, it is hard to appreciate the image being rendered.</p>
<p>So you might try building a 32x32 form of the image, invoking the
C-preprocessor 1024 times. When using 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel,
this might take about 5.5 minutes to complete. However, the small image
only gives you a hint of the image being rendered.</p>
<p>If you have the time you might try building a 128x128 image, invoking
the C-preprocessor 16384 times. With 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel,
this will take about 1.5 hours. At this scale you might consider it
worthwhile to render a more detailed image.</p>
<p>Using 6 jobs on 4 CPU cores in parallel, to build a 512x512 image invoking
the C-preprocessor 262144 times over a period of about 23.5 hours, you
will be given an image with a reasonable amount of detail to appreciate
what is being rendered.</p>
<p>One fun aspect of the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/endoh1/prog.c">2024/endoh1/prog.c source code</a>
is that when it is compiled an executed, the program outputs C code.
That C code, call it <code>rt.c</code> will fail to compile! But that is OK because the C-preprocessor
has enough work to do without bothering the C compiler. :-)</p>
<p>We plan to recognise those who report that they <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/endoh1/index.html#larger">rendered a new record sized image</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/weaver/index.html">2024/weaver</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As the expression goes, “Seeing (and hearing) is believing”: or at least can lead to better understanding of the code. :o)</p>
<p>After studying the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/weaver/prog.c">2024/weaver/prog.c source code</a>,
we suggest you compile and run the program for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/mills/index.html">2024/mills</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This won the “<strong>Prize in ℤ₃</strong>”, but what does that mean? Well,
the “<em>double-struck Z</em>” is <strong>NOT</strong> a reference to a set of integers,
nor is the “<em>double-struck Z subscript 3</em>” a reference to a ring of
3-adic integers. Instead, it is a reference to the 3rd version of a
certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine">virtual machine</a>.</p>
<p>If you use the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/mills/try.sh">2024/mills/try.sh</a> script, you will first be given
an opportunity to view the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/mills/prog.c">2024/mills/prog.c source code</a>.
Then you will be given 10 choices to play.</p>
<p><strong>HINT</strong>: If you select <strong>0</strong>: Try to not be eaten by a Grue when
reading/navigating the twisty mazes of this source code! :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/codemeow/index.html">2024/codemeow</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you study the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/codemeow/prog.c">2024/codemeow/prog.c source code</a>,
try not to lose track of the forest of obfuscation while tracking down the execution path trees.</p>
<p>We think this code will “grow on you” as the C expression goes just a compiled C code “<em>grows on parse trees</em>”. :-)</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/kurdyukov2/index.html">2024/kurdyukov2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If seeing is believing, and you believe you understand the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/kurdyukov2/prog.c">2024/kurdyukov2/prog.c source code</a>,
then you might be able to see how the code words.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: How many of the “<em>magic numbers</em>” in the program do you understand?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/kurdyukov3/index.html">2024/kurdyukov3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The prize, “<strong>virtual quietus</strong>”, is a virtual reference to the doom that awaits you when
you run this code: let alone when your try to figure out how the author was able to
encode the virtual machine in under <strong>2.5K bytes</strong> of <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/kurdyukov3/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The implementation runs without sound or mouse
input. You will need reply on your keyboard skills. The
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/kurdyukov3/try.sh">2024/kurdyukov3/try.sh</a>
demonstration script will give you some useful keyboard hints.</p>

<p>To those who follow the concept of “<em>seeing is believing</em>” will very
likely be “<em>deceived</em>” when they try to see the source in terminal window:</p>
<pre><code>    cat 2024/cable2/prog.c</code></pre>
<p>Viewing the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/cable2/prog.c">prog.c source code</a> in most editors
might suggest that the is something fishy 🐠 with the code.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered would what would happen if you recursively removed
files starting from the root directory? Are you curious what happens when
you launch a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb">fork bomb</a>?
You can safely give those and other scenarios under this virtual machine.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/straadt/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>
to explore this interesting virtual machine implementation. And as a bonus, a
full-fledged C64 emulator is included!</p>

<p>The “<strong>Prize in yil-tas</strong>” provides a hint as to what this marvelous
winning entry is going, provided that you are someone familiar in at
least 3 languages (<strong>hint</strong>: One of them is C, another id English).</p>
<p>The IOCCC is honored to present this entry for your enjoyment and you ponder
the <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/ferguson2/prog.c">prog.c source code</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ioccc.org/2024/carlini/index.html">2024/carlini</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The IOCCC has seen a number of winning entries that allow code designed to
run on early Intel processors, however none of them emulate a processor as
early as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004">Intel 4004</a>.
Launched in 1971, the 4004 was the core of the first commercially marketed
microprocessor chipset.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/carlini/prog.c">2024/carlini/prog.c</a>
code runs rather slow, so patience is required to watch
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004#/media/File:Intel_C4004.jpg">4004</a>
code run. This is very understandable when you realize that the
<a href="https://github.com/ioccc-src/winner/blob/master/2024/carlini/prog.c">2024/carlini/prog.c</a> is actually
emulating the entire
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004#/media/File:Chip_layout_from_the_development_phase_of_the_Intel_4004_from_1971,_the_first_microprocessor_of_the_world_(cropped_and_edited_image).jpg">4004 chip circuit</a>
by computing the output of each gate in a loop, effectively running the CPU and associated RAM/ROM chips!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Depending on the address of a variable, as not all platforms support
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a>,
as the single source of pseudo-randomness isn’t a good idea. It’s
much better to mix in other sources of variability (e.g.&nbsp;time, process
ID, etc.) so that subsequent runs will behave differently.</p></li>
<li><p>If a submission’s obfuscation strongly resembles a past IOCCC winning
entry, and the submission’s obfuscation is mainly in the C code source,
then the submission likely to not make it into the final rounds of judging.</p></li>
<li><p>When working with modern C compilers, it’s crucial to explicitly
declare variable and function types. Don’t assume they’ll
automatically default to an <code>int</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sadly, K&amp;C-style C code does not compile well under modern C compilers.</p></li>
<li><p>A submission that only works under gcc or clang does not work as well
as submissions that can work under either compiler.</p></li>
<li><p>Shrinking an existing open-source program to meet rule 2 size might
be an impressive feat of code shrinking, but it might not be enough to
make it into the final rounds of judging. Originality is key, and this
might not be the most innovative approach.</p></li>
<li><p>If your submission relies on mathematical algorithms, be sure that the
C code that implements the mathematics is well obfuscated.</p></li>
<li><p>Just a friendly reminder that before you upload your submissions,
uncompress the compressed tarball into a different directory. This way,
you can be sure you didn’t miss uploading any important files!</p></li>
<li><p>Using a lot of goto statements to make your code harder to understand
might not help it pass the final rounds of judging.</p></li>

<h3 id="encouragement-for-those-who-did-not-win-this-year">Encouragement for those who did not win this year</h3>
<p>We know many of you that submitted to the IOCCC put in a ton of effort
into your submissions for this year’s IOCCC. We can’t just give out
awards to everyone. That would mean taking away from the submissions
that we think are the best and deserve to win.</p>
<p>Sometimes, a final round submission might be good enough to be a
winning IOCCC entry, only to be beaten by a similar, but slightly better
submission. If you think this happened with your submission, consider
submitting an enhanced version to the next IOCCC.</p>
<p><strong>PLEASE DO NOT</strong> give up hope! There are some submissions that have been
submitted with revisions, multiple times before rising to the level of
a winning IOCCC entry. You might also want to try with a different type
of submission altogether for the next IOCCC.</p>
<p>If you’re not planning to improve and resubmit your non-winning entry
for the next IOCCC, you’re welcome to publish it.</p>
<h2 id="on-compiling-and-running-winning-entries">On Compiling and running winning entries</h2>
<p>Some C compilers aren’t as great as they could be. If yours isn’t
working well, you might want to try compiling with an updated version
of clang and/or gcc instead.</p>
