	<img src="https://obsidian.md/images/blog/free-for-work.png" alt="Obsidian is now free for work">
</a></p><p>People in over 10,000 organizations use Obsidian for work.</p>
<p>Starting today, the Obsidian Commercial license is optional. Anyone can use Obsidian for work, for free. If Obsidian benefits your organization, you can still <a href="https://obsidian.md/buy/license">purchase</a> Commercial licenses to support<span>&nbsp;</span>development.</p>
<p>Nothing else is changing. No account required, no ads, no tracking, no strings attached. Your data remains fully in your control, stored locally in plain text Markdown files. All features are available to you for free without<span>&nbsp;</span>limits.</p>
<p>Why make this change? Simplicity. The Commercial license terms were confusing and added unnecessary complexity to our pricing. Furthermore, as the <a href="https://obsidian.md/about">Obsidian Manifesto</a> states: "<em>we believe that everyone should have the tools to think clearly and organize ideas effectively</em>". This change brings us closer to that<span>&nbsp;</span>principle.</p>
<p>People in over <a href="https://obsidian.md/enterprise">10,000 organizations</a> use Obsidian. Many work in high-security environments, like government, cybersecurity, healthcare, and finance. Some of the largest organizations in the world, including Amazon and Google, have thousands of employees using Obsidian every day. These teams rely on Obsidian to think more effectively and keep total ownership over private<span>&nbsp;</span>data.</p>
<p>Previously, people at companies with two or more employees were required to purchase a Commercial license to use Obsidian for work. Going forward, the Commercial license is no longer required, but remains an optional way for organizations to support Obsidian, similar to the <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Licenses+and+payment/Catalyst+license">Catalyst license</a> for<span>&nbsp;</span>individuals.</p>
<p>Organizations that support Obsidian are now featured on the <a href="https://obsidian.md/enterprise">Obsidian Enterprise</a> page. Your organization can be showcased by purchasing 25 licenses or<span>&nbsp;</span>more.</p>
<p>Along with Commercial and Catalyst support, our add-on services, <a href="https://obsidian.md/sync">Sync</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/publish">Publish</a> help Obsidian remain <a href="https://stephango.com/vcware">100% user-supported</a>. In the future, we hope to offer more services designed for teams. As always, these will be<span>&nbsp;</span>optional.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2><span id="introducing-helix"></span>Introducing Helix</h2><p>We're introducing Helix, a generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that unifies perception, language understanding, and learned control to overcome multiple longstanding challenges in robotics. Helix is a series of firsts:</p><ul><li><p><b>Full-upper-body control</b>: Helix is the first VLA to output high-rate continuous control of the entire humanoid upper body, including wrists, torso, head, and individual fingers.</p></li><li><p><b>Multi-robot collaboration</b>: Helix is the first VLA to operate simultaneously on two robots, enabling them to solve a shared, long-horizon manipulation task with items they have never seen before.</p></li><li><p><b>Pick up anything:</b> Figure robots equipped with Helix can now pick up virtually any small household object, including thousands of items they have never encountered before, simply by following natural language prompts.</p></li><li><p><b>One neural network</b>: Unlike prior approaches, Helix uses a single set of neural network weights to learn all behaviors—picking and placing items, using drawers and refrigerators, and cross-robot interaction—without any task-specific fine-tuning.</p></li><li><p><b>Commercial-ready</b>: Helix is the first VLA that runs entirely onboard embedded low-power-consumption GPUs, making it immediately ready for commercial deployment.</p></li></ul><figure><figcaption>Video 1: Collaborative grocery storage. A single set of Helix neural network weights runs simultaneously on two robots as they work together to put away groceries neither robot has ever seen before.</figcaption></figure><p><b>New Scaling for Humanoid Robotics</b></p><p>The home presents robotics' greatest challenge. Unlike controlled industrial settings, homes are filled with countless objects–delicate glassware, crumpled clothing, scattered toys–each with unpredictable shapes, sizes, colors, and textures. For robots to be useful in households, they will need to be capable of generating intelligent new behaviors on-demand, especially for objects they've never seen before.</p><p>The current state of robotics will not scale to the home without a step change. Teaching robots even a single new behavior currently requires substantial human effort: either hours of PhD-level expert manual programming or thousands of demonstrations. Both are prohibitively expensive when we consider how vast the problem of the home truly is.</p><figure><img alt="" sizes="(min-width: 1024px) 1280px, 100vw" srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=640&amp;q=70 640w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=750&amp;q=70 750w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=828&amp;q=70 828w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=1080&amp;q=70 1080w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=1920&amp;q=70 1920w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=2048&amp;q=70 2048w, https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=70 3840w" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/qx5k8y1u9drj/3iC6I99o9zVebi4YAct58Z/c0f52b7200aee4c9638fe9fb1d9a5788/NEW_SCALING_LAWS.png?fm=webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=70" width="3840" height="2161" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Figure 1: Scaling curves for different approaches to acquiring new robot skills. In conventional heuristic manipulation, skills grow with PhDs who manually script them. In conventional robot imitation learning, skills scale with data collected. With Helix, new skills can be specified on the fly with language.</figcaption></figure><p>But other domains of AI have mastered this kind of instant generalization. What if we could simply translate the rich semantic knowledge captured in Vision Language Models (VLMs) directly into robot actions? This new capability would fundamentally alter robotics' scaling trajectory (Figure 1). Suddenly, new skills that once took hundreds of demonstrations could be obtained instantly just by talking to robots in natural language. The key problem becomes: how do we extract all this common-sense knowledge from VLMs and translate it into generalizable robot control? We built Helix to bridge this gap.</p><h2><span id="helix-a-system-1-system-2-vla-for-whole-upper-body-control"></span>Helix: A "System 1, System 2" VLA for Whole Upper Body Control</h2><p>Helix is a first-of-its-kind "System 1, System 2" VLA model for high-rate, dexterous control of the entire humanoid upper body.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior approaches face a fundamental tradeoff: VLM backbones are general, but not fast, and robot visuomotor policies are fast but not general. Helix resolves this tradeoff through two complementary systems, trained end-to-end to communicate:</p><ul><li><p>System 2 (S2): An onboard internet-pretrained VLM operating at 7-9 Hz for scene understanding and language comprehension, enabling broad generalization across objects and contexts.</p></li><li><p>System 1 (S1): A fast reactive visuomotor policy that translates the latent semantic representations produced by S2 into precise continuous robot actions at 200 Hz.</p></li></ul><p>This decoupled architecture allows each system to operate at its optimal timescale. S2 can "think slow" about high-level goals, while S1 can "think fast" to execute and adjust actions in real-time. For example, during collaborative behavior (see Video 2), S1 quickly adapts to the changing motions of a partner robot while maintaining S2's semantic objectives.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 2: Helix allows for fast fine grained motor adjustments, necessary when reacting to a collaborative partner, while carrying out novel semantic goals.</figcaption></figure><p>Helix's design offers several key advantages over existing approaches:</p><ul><li><p><b>Speed and Generalization</b>: Helix matches the speed of specialized single-task behavioral cloning policies while generalizing zero-shot to thousands of novel test objects.</p></li><li><p><b>Scalability</b>: Helix directly outputs continuous control for high-dimensional action spaces, avoiding complex action tokenization schemes used in prior VLA approaches, which have shown some success in low-dimensional control setups (e.g. binarized parallel grippers) but face scaling challenges with high-dimensional humanoid control.</p></li><li><p><b>Architectural Simplicity</b>: Helix uses standard architectures - an open source, open weight VLM for System 2 and a simple transformer-based visuomotor policy for S1.</p></li><li><p><b>Separation of concerns</b>: Decoupling S1 and S2 allows us to iterate on each system separately, without constraints of finding unified observation space or action representations.</p></li></ul><h2><span id="model-and-training-details"></span>Model and Training Details</h2><p><b>Data</b></p><p>We collect a high quality, multi-robot, multi-operator dataset of diverse teleoperated behaviors, ~500 hours in total. To generate natural language-conditioned training pairs, we use an auto-labeling VLM to generate hindsight instructions. The VLM processes segmented video clips from the onboard robot cameras, prompted with: "What instruction would you have given the robot to get the action seen in this video?" All items handled during training are excluded from evaluations to prevent contamination.</p><p><b>Architecture</b></p><p>Our system comprises two main components: S2, a VLM backbone, and S1, a latent-conditional visuomotor transformer. S2 is built on a 7B-parameter open-source, open-weight VLM pretrained on internet-scale data. It processes monocular robot images and robot state information (consisting of wrist pose and finger positions) after projecting them into vision-language embedding space. Combined with natural language commands specifying desired behaviors, S2 distills all semantic task-relevant information into a single continuous latent vector, passed to S1 to condition its low-level actions.</p><p>S1, an 80M parameter cross-attention encoder-decoder transformer, handles low-level control. It relies on a fully convolutional, multi-scale vision backbone for visual processing, initialized from pretraining done entirely in simulation. While S1 receives the same image and state inputs as S2, it processes them at a higher frequency to enable more responsive closed-loop control. The latent vector from S2 is projected into S1's token space and concatenated with visual features from S1's vision backbone along the sequence dimension, providing task conditioning.</p><p>S1 outputs full upper body humanoid control at 200hz, including desired wrist poses, finger flexion and abduction control, and torso and head orientation targets. We append to the action space a synthetic "percentage task completion" action, allowing Helix to predict its own termination condition, which makes it easier to sequence multiple learned behaviors.</p><p><b>Training</b></p><p>Helix is trained fully end-to-end, mapping from raw pixels and text commands to continuous actions with a standard regression loss. Gradients are backpropagated from S1 into S2 via the latent communication vector used to condition S1's behavior, allowing joint optimization of both components. Helix requires no task-specific adaptation; it maintains a single training stage and single set of neural network weights without separate action heads or per-task fine-tuning stages.</p><p>During training, we add a temporal offset between S1 and S2 inputs. This offset is calibrated to match the gap between S1 and S2's deployed inference latency, ensuring that the real-time control requirements during deployment are accurately reflected in training.</p><p><b>Optimized Streaming Inference</b></p><p>Helix's training design enables efficient model parallel deployment on Figure robots, each equipped with dual low-power-consumption embedded GPUs. The inference pipeline splits across S2 (high-level latent planning) and S1 (low-level control) models, each running on dedicated GPUs. S2 operates as an asynchronous background process, consuming the latest observation (onboard camera and robot state) and natural language commands. It continuously updates a shared memory latent vector that encodes the high-level behavioral intent.</p><p>S1 executes as a separate real-time process, maintaining the critical 200Hz control loop required for smooth whole upper body action. It takes both the latest observation and the most recent S2 latent vector. The inherent speed difference between S2 and S1 inference naturally results in S1 operating with higher temporal resolution on robot observations, creating a tighter feedback loop for reactive control.&nbsp;</p><p>This deployment strategy deliberately mirrors the temporal offset introduced in training, minimizing the train-inference distribution gap. The asynchronous execution model allows both processes to run at their optimal frequencies, allowing us to run Helix as fast as our fastest single task imitation learning policies.</p><h2><span id="results"></span>Results</h2><figure><figcaption>Video 3: Helix's VLA controls the full humanoid upper body, a first in robot learning.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Fine-grained VLA whole upper body control</b></p><p>Helix coordinates a 35-DoF action space at 200Hz, controlling everything from individual finger movements to end-effector trajectories, head gaze, and torso posture. Head and torso control pose unique challenges—as they move, they change both what the robot can reach and what it can see, creating feedback loops that have historically caused instability. Video 3 demonstrates this coordination in action: the robot smoothly tracks its hands with its head while adjusting its torso for optimal reach, all while maintaining precise finger control for grasping. Historically, achieving this level of precision with such a high-dimensional action space has been considered extremely challenging, even for a single known task. To our knowledge, no prior VLA system has demonstrated this degree of real-time coordination while maintaining the ability to generalize across tasks and objects.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 4: Helix coordinates precise multi-robot manipulation.</figcaption></figure><p><b>Zero-shot multi-robot coordination</b></p><p>We push Helix to the limit in a challenging multi-agent manipulation scenario: collaborative zero-shot grocery storage between two Figure robots. Video 1 showcases two fundamental advances: The robots successfully manipulate entirely novel groceries—items never encountered during training—demonstrating robust generalization across diverse shapes, sizes, and materials. Additionally, both robots operate using identical Helix model weights, eliminating the need for robot-specific training or explicit role assignments. They achieve coordination through natural language prompts like "Hand the bag of cookies to the robot on your right" or "Receive the bag of cookies from the robot on your left and place it in the open drawer" (see Video 4). This marks the first demonstration of flexible, extended collaborative manipulation between multiple robots using a VLA, particularly significant given their successful handling of completely novel objects.</p><p><b>Emergent "Pick up anything"</b></p><p>We find that Figure robots equipped with Helix can pick up virtually any small household object with a simple "Pick up the [X]" command. In systematic testing, the robots successfully handled thousands of novel items in clutter—from glassware and toys to tools and clothing—without any prior demonstrations or custom programming.</p><p>Particularly notable is how Helix bridges the gap between internet-scale language understanding and precise robot control. When prompted to "Pick up the desert item", for instance, Helix not only recognizes that a toy cactus matches this abstract concept, but also selects the closest hand and executes the precise motor commands needed to grasp it securely.</p><p>This general-purpose "language-to-action" grasping capability opens new exciting new possibilities for humanoid deployment in unstructured environments.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 5: Helix translates high level conceptual commands like "Pick up the desert item" to low-level action.</figcaption></figure><h2><span id="discussion"></span>Discussion</h2><p><b>Helix's training is highly efficient</b></p><p>Helix achieves strong object generalization with remarkably few resources. We train Helix with ~500 hours of high quality supervised data in total, a small fraction of the size of previously collected VLA datasets (&lt;5%), and without any dependencies around multi-robot-embodiment collect or multiple stages of training. We note that this is a scale of collect more comparable to modern <i>single</i>-task imitation learning datasets. Despite this comparatively small data requirement, Helix scales to the significantly more challenging action space of full upper body humanoid control, with high-rate, high-dimensional outputs.</p><p><b>A single set of weights</b></p><p>Existing VLA systems often require specialized fine-tuning or dedicated action heads to optimize performance across different high-level behaviors. Remarkably, Helix achieves strong performance across diverse tasks with a single unified model. Using just one set of neural network weights (7B for System 2, 80M for System 1), Helix picks and places items in various containers, operates drawers and refrigerators, coordinates dexterous multi-robot handovers, and manipulates thousands of novel objects.</p><figure><figcaption>Video 6: "Pick up the helix"</figcaption></figure><h2><span id="conclusion"></span>Conclusion</h2><p>We have presented Helix, the first Vision-Language-Action model to directly control an entire humanoid upper body from natural language. Unlike earlier robot systems, Helix is capable of generating long-horizon, collaborative, dexterous manipulation on the fly without any task-specific demonstrations or extensive manual programming. Helix displays strong object generalization, being able to pick up thousands of novel household items with varying shapes, sizes, colors, and material properties never encountered before in training, simply by asking in natural language. This represents a transformative step forward in how Figure scales humanoid robot behaviors—one that we believe will be pivotal as our robots increasingly assist in everyday home environments.</p><p>While these early results are truly exciting, we think they only scratch the surface of what is possible. We are eager to see what happens when we scale Helix by 1,000x and beyond. If you’re as fascinated by the possibilities of Helix—and the future of dexterous humanoid robotics, we invite you to join us on this journey.</p><p>Consider joining our Helix team to help scale Embodied AI to millions of robots. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.figure.ai/careers">Check out our open roles here. </a></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In 2003, a German graduate student named <a href="https://www.darstellungstheorie.uni-wuppertal.de/de/prof-dr-britta-spaeth/">Britta Späth</a> encountered the McKay conjecture, one of the biggest open problems in the mathematical realm known as group theory. At first her goals were relatively modest: She hoped to prove a theorem or two that would make incremental progress on the problem, as many other mathematicians had done before her. But over the years, she was drawn back to it, again and again. Whenever she tried to focus on something else, she said, “it didn’t connect.”</p>
<p>There was a risk that such a single-minded pursuit of so difficult a problem could hurt her academic career, but Späth dedicated all her time to it anyway. It brought her to the office of <a href="http://perso.imj-prg.fr/marc-cabanes/">Marc Cabanes</a>, a mathematician now at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris who, inspired by her efforts, became consumed by the conjecture, too. While working together, the pair fell in love and eventually started a family.</p>
<p>The problem that absorbed them takes a key theme in mathematics and turns it into a concrete tool for group theorists. Math is full of enormously complicated abstract objects that are impossible to study in their entirety. But often, mathematicians have discovered, it’s enough to look at a small fragment of such an object to understand its broader properties. In the third century BCE, for instance, the ancient Greek mathematician Eratosthenes estimated the circumference of the Earth — roughly 25,000 miles — by measuring shadows cast by the sun in just two cities about 500 miles apart. Similarly, when mathematicians want to understand an impossibly convoluted function, they might only need to look at how it behaves for a small subset of possible inputs. That can be enough to tell them what the function does for all possible inputs.</p>
<p>The McKay conjecture is another example of this principle. It says that if you want to formulate a thorough description of a group — <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/groups-underpin-modern-math-heres-how-they-work-20240906/">an important mathematical entity</a> that can get prohibitively difficult to study — you only need to look at a tiny piece of it.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>After the conjecture was posed in the 1970s, dozens of mathematicians tried their hand at proving it. They made partial progress — and in the process they learned a great deal about groups, which are abstract objects that describe the various symmetries of a mathematical system. But a full proof seemed out of reach.</p>
<p>Then Späth came along. Now, 20 years after she first learned about the problem and more than a decade after she met Cabanes, the two mathematicians have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20392">finally completed the proof</a>.</p>
<p>When the couple announced their result, their colleagues were in awe. “I wanted there to be parades,” said <a href="https://statistics.stanford.edu/people/persi-diaconis">Persi Diaconis</a> of Stanford University. “Years of hard, hard, hard work, and she did it, they did it.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Power of Primes</strong></h2>
<p>The McKay conjecture began with the observation of a strange coincidence.</p>
<p>John McKay — <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00850">described by one friend</a> as “brilliant, soft-spoken, and charmingly disorganized” — was known for his ability to spot numerical patterns in unexpected places. The Concordia University mathematician is perhaps most famous for his “monstrous moonshine” conjecture, which was proved in 1992 and established a deep connection between <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-chase-moonshine-string-theory-connections-20150312/">the so-called monster group</a> and a special function from number theory.</p>
<p>Before his death a few years ago, McKay unearthed lots of other important connections, too, many involving groups. A group is a set of elements combined with a rule for how those elements relate to one another. It can be thought of as a collection of symmetries — transformations that leave a shape, a function or some other mathematical object unchanged in specific ways. For all their abstraction, groups are immensely useful, and they play a central role in mathematics.</p>

<p>In 1972, McKay was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/002186937290066X?">focused on finite groups</a> — groups that have a finite number of elements. He observed that in many cases, you can deduce important information about a finite group by looking at a very small subset of its elements. In particular, McKay looked at elements that form a special, smaller group — called a Sylow normalizer — inside the original group.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a group with 72 elements. This alone doesn’t tell you much: There are <a href="https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~matyd/GroupNames/index120.html">50 different groups</a> of that size. But 72 can also be written as a product of prime numbers, 2 $latex \times$ 2 $latex \times$ 2 $latex \times$ 3 $latex \times$ 3 — that is, as 2<sup>3</sup> $latex \times$ 3<sup>2</sup>. (Generally, the more distinct primes you need to describe the size of your group, the more complicated your group is.) You can decompose your group into smaller subgroups based on these primes. In this case, for instance, you could look at subgroups with eight (2<sup>3</sup>) elements and subgroups with nine (3<sup>2</sup>) elements. By studying those subgroups, you can learn more about the structure of your overall group — what other building blocks the group is composed of, for instance.</p>
<p>Now take one of those subgroups and add a few particular elements to it to create a special subgroup, the Sylow normalizer. In your 72-element group, you can build a different Sylow normalizer for each eight-element and nine-element subgroup — these are the 2-Sylow normalizers and 3-Sylow normalizers, respectively.</p>
<p>Sylow normalizers, like the subgroups they’re built out of, can tell mathematicians a lot about the original group. But McKay hypothesized that this connection was far stronger than anyone had imagined. It wasn’t just that a Sylow normalizer could give insights into a finite group’s overall structure. He asserted that if mathematicians wanted to compute a crucial quantity that would help them characterize their group, they’d just have to look at one of a particular set of Sylow normalizers: The Sylow normalizer would be characterized by the exact same number.</p>
<p>This quantity counts the number of “representations” of a certain type — ways you can rewrite elements of the group using arrays of numbers called matrices. Such a tally might seem arbitrary, but it gives mathematicians a sense of how the group’s elements relate to each other, and it is involved in calculations of other important properties.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no good reason why McKay’s quantity should always be the same for a finite group and its Sylow normalizers. A Sylow normalizer might contain just a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the number of elements in the larger group. Moreover, the Sylow normalizer often has a very different structure.</p>
<p>It would be as if “in every U.S. election, you count the votes in general, and in this little town in Montana, they are exactly the same proportionally,” said <a href="https://www.uv.es/gabriel/">Gabriel Navarro</a> of the University of Valencia. “Not similar, not more or less. Exactly the same.”</p>
<p>But that’s what McKay conjectured — for all finite groups. If true, it would make mathematicians’ lives much easier: Sylow normalizers are much easier to work with than their parent groups. It would also hint at the presence of a deeper mathematical truth, one that mathematicians don’t yet have a handle on.</p>
<p>A year after McKay first observed the coincidence, a mathematician named Marty Isaacs proved that it held for <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2373731">a large class of groups</a>. But then mathematicians got stuck. They were able to show that it held up for one specific group or another, but there were still infinitely many groups left to tackle.</p>
<p>Proving the full conjecture seemed prohibitively difficult. As it turned out, the next major advance on the problem would require the completion of one of the most herculean mathematical projects in history.</p>
<h2><strong>One Giant Leap for Group Theory, One Small Step for McKay</strong></h2>
<p>The project — an effort to classify all the building blocks of finite groups — ultimately required thousands of proofs and took more than 100 years to complete. But in 2004, mathematicians finally succeeded in showing that all the building blocks must fall into one of three categories, or else belong to a list of 26 outliers.</p>

<p>Mathematicians had long suspected that, once complete, this classification would help simplify problems such as the McKay conjecture. Maybe they didn’t have to prove the conjecture for all finite groups. Maybe they only had to prove an alternative statement covering the 29 types of building blocks — or for some related set of straightforward groups — that would automatically imply the full McKay conjecture.</p>
<p>But first, someone had to show that this strategy would actually work. The very year that the classification was officially completed, Isaacs, Navarro and Gunter Malle <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-007-0057-y">figured out</a> the right way to reframe the McKay conjecture so that they only had to focus on a narrow set of groups.</p>
<p>For each group in this new set, they’d have to show something a bit stronger than what McKay had proposed: Not only would the number of representations have to be the same for both the group and the Sylow normalizer, but those representations would have to relate to each other according to certain rules. Isaacs, Navarro and Malle showed that if this stronger statement held for these particular groups, then the McKay conjecture had to be true for every finite group. (“This was during the Euro 2004,” Navarro recalled. His co-authors “didn’t know that I was sneaking off sometimes to see some games. But important things are important things.”)</p>

<p>The trio’s reformulation of the problem was a major breakthrough. Within a few years, mathematicians had used it to resolve most cases of the McKay conjecture. Moreover, it helped them simplify related questions that also involved using one part of an object to study the whole. “Tons and tons of conjectures have now been reduced using this as a blueprint,” said <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mandisf">Mandi Schaeffer Fry</a>, a mathematician at the University of Denver.</p>
<p>But there was one class of groups — “groups of Lie type” — for which the new version of the McKay conjecture remained open. The representations of these groups were particularly difficult to study, and it was challenging to prove that the relationships among them satisfied the conditions that Isaacs, Navarro and Malle had outlined.</p>
<p>But one of Malle’s graduate students was on the case. Britta Späth.</p>
<h2><strong>‘Our Obsession’</strong></h2>
<p>In 2003, Späth arrived at the University of Kassel to start her doctorate with Malle. She was almost perfectly suited for working on the McKay conjecture: Even in high school, she could spend days or weeks on a single problem. She particularly reveled in ones that tested her endurance, and she fondly recalls long hours spent searching for “tricks that are, in a way, not even so deep.”</p>
<p>Späth spent her time studying group representations as deeply as she could. After she completed her graduate degree, she decided to use that expertise to continue chipping away at the McKay conjecture. “She has this crazy, really good intuition,” said Schaeffer Fry, her friend and collaborator. “She’s able to see it’s going to be like this.”</p>

<p>A few years later, in 2010, Späth started working at Paris Cité University, where she met Cabanes. He was an expert in the narrower set of groups at the center of the reformulated version of the McKay conjecture, and Späth often went to his office to ask him questions. Cabanes was “always protesting, ‘Those groups are complicated, my God,’” he recalled. Despite his initial hesitancy, he too eventually grew enamored with the problem. It became “our obsession,” he said.</p>
<p>There are four categories of Lie-type groups. Together, Späth and Cabanes started proving the conjecture for each of those categories, and they <a href="https://www.ams.org/journals/ert/2017-21-05/S1088-4165-2017-00497-3/">reported several</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001870819304372">major results</a> over the next decade.</p>
<p>Their work led them to develop a deep understanding of groups of Lie type. Although these groups are the most common building blocks of other groups, and therefore of great mathematical interest, their representations are incredibly difficult to study. Cabanes and Späth often had to rely on opaque theories from disparate areas of math. But in digging those theories up, they provided some of the best characterizations yet of these important groups.</p>
<p>As they did so, they started dating and went on to have two children. (They eventually settled down together in Germany, where they enjoy working together at one of the three whiteboards in their home.)</p>
<p>By 2018, they had just one category of Lie-type groups left. Once that was done, they would have proved the McKay conjecture.</p>
<p>That final case took them six more years.</p>
<h2><strong>A ‘Spectacular Achievement’</strong></h2>
<p>The fourth kind of Lie group “had so many difficulties, so many bad surprises,” Späth said. (It didn’t help that in 2020, the pandemic kept their two young children home from school, making it difficult for them to work.) But gradually, she and Cabanes managed to show that the number of representations for these groups matched those of their Sylow normalizers — and that the way the representations matched up satisfied the necessary rules. The last case was done. It followed automatically that the McKay conjecture was true.</p>
<p>In October 2023, they finally felt confident enough in their proof to announce it to a room of more than 100 mathematicians. A year later, they <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20392">posted it online</a> for the rest of the community to digest. “It’s an absolutely spectacular achievement,” said <a href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/radha.kessar">Radha Kessar</a> of the University of Manchester.</p>
<p>Mathematicians can now confidently study important properties of groups by looking at their Sylow normalizers alone — a much easier approach to making sense of these abstract entities, and one that might have practical applications. And in the process of establishing this connection, Navarro said, the researchers developed “beautiful, wonderful, deep mathematics.”</p>
        
        
<p>Other mathematicians now hope to explore the even deeper conceptual reason why the strange coincidence McKay uncovered is true. Although Späth and Cabanes have proved it, mathematicians still don’t understand why a comparatively tiny set is enough to tell you so much about its larger parent group.</p>
<p>“There has to be some structural reason why these numbers are the same,” Kessar said.</p>
<p>Some mathematicians have done preliminary work to try to understand this connection, but so far it remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Späth and Cabanes are moving on, each searching for their next obsession. So far, according to Späth, nothing has consumed her like the McKay conjecture. “If you have done one big thing, then it’s difficult to find the courage, the excitement for the next,” she said. “It was such a fight sometimes. It also gave you, every day, a purpose.”</p>

At least one DOGE ally appears to be working to open back doors into systems used throughout the federal government. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla engineer who was recently appointed director of the Technology Transformation Services, requested privileged access to 19 different IT systems administered by teams within TTS, according to two federal workers we spoke with who are familiar with his request. With this level of control, Shedd would be able to not only view and modify federal data, but also grant and revoke access to other people. (In a written statement, Will Powell, the acting press secretary for the General Services Administration, of which TTS is a part, said Shedd needs this level of access to rapidly identify “areas for optimization and efficiencies” and insisted that he is working with “appropriate GSA officials” to follow established protocols.)</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/elon-musk-doge-security/681600/">Read: The government’s computing experts say they are terrified</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Over the past few days, we’ve talked with civil servants working for numerous agencies, all of whom requested anonymity because they fear what will happen if they lose their job—not just to themselves, but to the functioning of the federal government. Their observations reveal the abnormal degree of power that DOGE has already achieved. Federal agencies are subject to various forms of administrative and legal oversight, but they operate separately from one another for good reasons: to support a specialized purpose and to insulate them from undue outside influence. Now they effectively roll up to Elon Musk. (Neither the White House nor DOGE responded to requests for comment for this story. Earlier this week, a White House official <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-leader.html">claimed</a> that Musk is not the head of DOGE. He is clearly the group’s functional leader.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Among the federal agencies we reported on, USAID is the only one where we could confirm that DOGE has acquired God-mode access across the entire digital system. (The Trump administration has sought to effectively shut down USAID since the inauguration.) But as Musk and his acolytes enter a growing number of federal databases and IT systems, their unfettered access at USAID offers a sense of what they might be able to do elsewhere. At NASA, for example, it could mean access to knowledge about sensitive government technologies used for defense. At the CDC, such ability could expose millions of Americans’ health data and allow DOGE to access labs that store deadly pathogens. At Treasury, such access would allow Musk’s employees to view Americans’ names, Social Security numbers, and financial information. “It is not ridiculous to think they’d have bank-account and routing numbers for every single person in the United States,” the senior USAID source said. “What do you do with this information? I had to ask myself, <em>Do I file my taxes this year or not?</em> I had to sit and debate that.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The federal government does not typically grant such wide-ranging access to a single entity, let alone one that is effectively under the control of an unelected, erratic, and politically extreme actor such as Musk. The group is working on behalf of Donald Trump, but sources we spoke with emphasized that the level of access DOGE possesses means that the organization may already be able to siphon data that Musk or his agents could hold on to forever, long after his time as a government liaison, or even after a potential falling-out with the president.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">One experienced government information-security contractor offered a blunt response to the God-mode situation at USAID: “That sounds like our worst fears come true.” The purpose of DOGE’s incursions remains unclear to employees at these agencies. Musk was supposed to help improve the workings of the government—that is DOGE’s stated purpose. But in the offices where the team is reaching internal IT systems, some are beginning to worry that he might prefer to destroy it, to take it over, or just to loot its vaults for himself.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">“O<span>nce they’re in, they’re in</span>,” the USAID employee told us. And this is a big part of the problem in a nutshell: Access is everything, and in many cases, DOGE has it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At USAID and other agencies whose employees we spoke with, leaders explained that Musk’s team could copy and remove information from government servers without anybody knowing. The team could then feed this classified information into AI tools, either for training purposes or to mine the data for insights. (Members of DOGE already reportedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-ai-department-education/">have put sensitive data</a> from the Education Department into AI software.) Within USAID, DOGE has full access to human-resources information—Social Security numbers, addresses, reputational data such as performance reviews, plus classified information and disciplinary information. The USAID source noted that DOGE can also control USAID systems that help with disbursement of funds, building-access tools, and payroll: “If they wanted to change how much a person is making, they could modify that, given their access in the system.” According to the employee, DOGE is also inside of an internal system for managing contracts and grants, which functions like a high-security online marketplace where USAID plans and approves billions in government spending.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Inside NASA, according to one agency employee we spoke with, DOGE workers already have access to contracts, partnerships, performance reviews, classified national-security information, and satellite data, among other materials. The NASA worker told us that such knowledge could erase generations of advantage in aerospace and defense capabilities if it falls into the wrong hands. Agency technologies such as propulsion systems, novel materials, and satellites overlap with Department of Defense projects. Someone with information about NASA’s thermal-protection or encryption technologies could take advantage of vulnerabilities in aerospace vehicles, for example.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/musk-terror-reign/681731/">Derek Thompson: DOGE’s reign of ineptitude </a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">USAID employees have felt more acute effects of DOGE’s operations. Employees there say they have been rattled by the demands of DOGE engineers: “They have walked in and said to senior staff,<em> You have 15 minutes to do this or you’re fired</em>,” the USAID senior leader told us. Now USAID staff are “operating in a zero-trust environment.” With its God-mode IT control at the agency, DOGE can read emails and chats, plus see who’s attending which meetings. The source described employees in a recent meeting growing alarmed when transcription services seemed to turn on without warning. An employee at NASA reported similar concerns, after unfamiliar messages appeared on workstations. “We’re operating believing our systems are completely bugged,” one person told us.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The senior USAID official fears that DOGE could terminate somebody working in a conflict zone like Ukraine, Sudan, or Ethiopia from an agency system. “If they lose access to their USAID laptop, phone, and accounts, for a lot of them that’s their only means of communication. We are putting their lives on the line,” one said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For those who have watched DOGE storm into their workplace, what is perhaps most terrifying is its attempts to scale. If DOGE were to acquire God-mode administrative access across many systems, several sources told us, that level of control could affect every citizen at home, and many American interests abroad: personal financial data, defense secrets, and more, all in the palm of Musk’s hand.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>here’s reason to believe</span> that health information may be next. The Trump administration fired roughly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/18/trump-health-firings-fda-cdc/">700</a> people at the CDC last weekend. As in other agencies, the firings will hollow out expertise but also remove obstacles to further changes. A CDC employee told us that the agency’s Office of the Chief Information Officer is expecting DOGE, but “no one has seen anyone yet.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The individual, who has knowledge of how CDC information systems work, fears that DOGE could gain access to an abundant store of sensitive information about health and disease. This year, the CDC is supposed to roll out a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-data-strategy/php/about/index.html">central data platform</a> for public-health surveillance and emergency response to better address new threats such as H5N1 bird flu and old ones such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-mmr-vaccine-homeschooling-b29d08d53cf26704968e8c00dfa712ba">measles</a>. The new system, called the One CDC Data Platform, promises to aggregate all of the CDC’s public-health data, including hundreds of thousands of daily anonymized lab tests, data from emergency-room visits, and measurements from wastewater disease-reporting sites.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The design and rollout of this system were already controversial inside the agency, our source said, even before Trump and Musk came on the scene. Putting everybody’s health data in one place carries risks. Although the health data the CDC houses are usually de-identified or aggregated, “people with very stigmatizing illnesses could be identified by certain characteristics” if the data are exposed or misused, the CDC worker said. What’s more, plenty of health data contain information that, when correlated with other data outside the system, could pinpoint specific individuals. Given all of the data that DOGE appears to be capable of siphoning from all over the government, such identification could become much easier. The CDC collects electronic health-record details from all over the country, meaning that this could affect just about everyone—including us, and you too.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">CDC systems control more than mere information about disease. At the agency’s facility in Atlanta, the CDC stores the microbes that cause disease and can hold secrets to treatment. Some are relatively benign, such as strains of <em>E. coli</em>. Others are intrinsically dangerous, including the Ebola and Marburg viruses, and bacterium that causes tuberculosis. These materials are housed in labs with associated biosafety levels. The highest level, BSL-4, applies to only a small number of labs around the world containing “dangerous and exotic” microbes, as the CDC <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/biosafety/#:~:text=%C2%AB%20Prev%20Page-,BSL%2D4,include%20Ebola%20and%20Marburg%20viruses">describes</a> them, that pose a high risk of spread.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Access to such labs is managed by computers, and management of those computers is local to the CDC. If DOGE got the same kind of access to CDC IT systems as it has elsewhere, would that give the group direct access to CDC facilities? “Yes, those are all out of CDC level,” our source at the agency told us. Does that mean that DOGE could gain direct access to BSL-4 labs? we asked. “It’s definitely possible,” the employee said.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2025/02/elon-musk-doge-nuclear-weapons/681581/">Read: If DOGE goes nuclear</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our source hoped that such a prospect would be averted. (To repeat, DOGE hasn’t taken control of CDC IT systems yet, at least as far as our source knew.) But the employee also explained that the recent layoffs will reduce the agency’s ability to defend against IT or security errors, on top of diminishing morale. The CDC did not respond to requests for comment about whether someone with full, local IT control could indeed grant entry to, or control over, BSL-4 labs and their contents.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>he risk of harm, abuse, or political revenge</span> is clear. But simple, brazen corruption is also a concern among the federal workers we spoke with. The CDC staffer wondered if DOGE’s unelected and seemingly unaccountable leadership, including Musk, might simply want to sell the public-health data the CDC collects. Democratic leaders have also expressed the worry that Musk’s interest in SpaceX, which has received billions of dollars in contracts from NASA over the years, creates an untenable conflict of interest. The NASA employee worried that Musk would end up “reaping all of the profits of the investment that the American public put into NASA’s research, which was being shared with the country.” NASA holds technical specs and research data for SpaceX competitors, and insiders fear that such information will soon be compromised, too. They also worry that classified NASA R&amp;D in areas such as quantum, biotech, and astrobiology could be stolen for private gain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A number of lawsuits have been filed seeking to limit DOGE’s access, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judges-consider-barring-musks-doge-team-government-systems-2025-02-14/">mixed results</a>. Meanwhile, Trump and Musk have both <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-allies-ramp-up-attacks-judges-musk-calls-impeachments-2025-02-12/">attacked</a> judges who have ruled against their interests; Musk has said they should be impeached. Trump has also indicated that he might just <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/02/trump-vance-courts/681632/">ignore the courts</a>—an act that would be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/16/opinion/what-if-trump-defies-courts.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare">challenging to counter, providing plenty of opportunity for the administration to get its way.</a> Across agencies, leaders have started to step aside voluntarily. Jim Jones, head of the Food and Drug Administration’s food division, resigned this week. Michelle King, who ran the Social Security Administration, stepped down too rather than carry out DOGE’s wishes. The resignations may be principled, but they open the door for more compliant replacements.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The request from Shedd, the former Tesla engineer, in particular, illustrates the variety of avenues and back doors that DOGE and Musk’s allies may have available to enter the government’s systems. According to the two federal workers we spoke with about Shedd’s efforts, such access typically is not granted to TTS leadership and requires a specific reason and the permission of each system’s owner. Shedd initially issued a blanket request, the sources told us, and is now attempting to bypass the individual system owners by seeking permission from other officials, circumventing standard security procedures. He also had not completed a background check, which is usually required for such access, at least as of when he first made the request, according to our sources. How much access Shedd has been granted remains uncertain.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This is the DOGE playbook: There are no norms to be respected, and everything is up for grabs. Once the damage is done, it will be difficult to remedy, especially if DOGE staffers can themselves grant or remove access to others at their discretion.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Musk and DOGE’s first month has been so chaotic, their incursions so haphazard, that assessing what has even happened is difficult. DOGE claims to be improving the government, but the agency workers we spoke with feel that they are being hacked instead. So it is worth stepping back to note the most basic fact: No good reason or case can be made for one person or entity to have this scope of access to this many government agencies containing this much sensitive information. Even in one government office, full administrative access to all systems is the rarest privilege. In the aggregate, across the whole of the government, it would be unfathomable.</p></section><div data-event-module="footer"><p><h3>About the Authors</h3></p><div><address id="article-writer-0" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="1" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/charlie-warzel/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lyW9wA_jPYje_sXRDGnpW8Gl4Kk=/54x0:1756x1702/120x120/media/img/authors/2022/11/IMG_0264/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div></address></div><div><address id="article-writer-1" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="2" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/ian-bogost/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/dMbJwBoshVoOt2SGSV-7Y1D29xI=/38x38:1890x1890/120x120/media/None/ibogost_atlantic_new/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div></address></div><div><address id="article-writer-2" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="3" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/matteo-wong/" data-event-element="image"><img alt="" loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cvqkiGqr5oeTvJi706qtcaOkivk=/815x349:3584x3118/120x120/media/img/authors/2023/06/Matteo_Wong/original.jpg" width="60" height="60"></a></p></div></address></div></div><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-8669">
				
<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Did you <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-the-worlds-first-quantum-processor-powered-by-topological-qubits/">see</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00527-z">Microsoft’s</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/technology/microsoft-quantum-computing-topological-qubit.html">announcement</a>?<br>A. Yes, thanks, you can stop emailing to ask!  Microsoft’s Chetan Nayak was even kind enough to give me a personal briefing a few weeks ago.  Yesterday I did a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3ct60h5">brief interview</a> on this for the BBC’s World Business Report, and I also <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/02/19/1112072/a-new-microsoft-chip-could-lead-to-more-stable-quantum-computers/">commented</a> for MIT Technology Review.</p>



<p><strong>Q2.</strong> What <em>is</em> a topological qubit?<br><strong>A.</strong> It’s a special kind of qubit built using nonabelian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon">anyons</a>, which are excitations that can exist in a two-dimensional medium, behaving neither as fermions nor as bosons.  The idea grew out of seminal work by Alexei Kitaev, Michael Freedman, and others starting in the late 1990s.  Topological qubits have proved harder to create and control than ordinary qubits.</p>



<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Then why do people care about topological qubits?<br><strong>A.</strong> The dream is that they could <em>eventually</em> be more resilient to decoherence than regular qubits, since an error, in order to matter, needs to change the <em>topology</em> of how the nonabelian anyons are braided around each other.  So you’d have some robustness built in to the physics of your system, rather than having to engineer it laboriously at the software level (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threshold_theorem">quantum fault-tolerance</a>).</p>



<p><strong>Q4.</strong> Did Microsoft create the first topological qubit?<br><strong>A.</strong> Well, they say they did!</p>



<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Didn’t Microsoft claim the experimental creation of Majorana zero modes—a building block of topological qubits—back in 2018, and didn’t they then need to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/majorana-microsoft-backed-quantum-computer-research-retracted">retract</a> that claim?<br><strong>A.</strong> Yep.  Certainly that history is making some experts cautious about the new claim.  When I asked Chetan Nayak how confident I should be, his response was basically “look, we now have a topological qubit that’s behaving fully as a qubit; how much more do people want?”</p>



<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Is this a big deal?<br><strong>A.</strong> <em>If</em> the claim stands, I’d say it’s a scientific milestone for the field of topological quantum computing and physics beyond.  The number of topological qubits manipulated in a single experiment has then finally increased from 0 to 1, and depending on how you define things, arguably a “new state of matter” has even been created, one that doesn’t appear in nature (but only in <em>Nature</em>).</p>



<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Is this useful?<br><strong>A.</strong> Not yet!  If anyone claims that a single qubit, or even 30 qubits, are already <em>useful</em> for speeding up computation, you can ignore anything else that person says.  (Certainly Microsoft makes no such claim.)  On the question of what we believe quantum computers will or won’t <em>eventually</em> be useful for, see like half the archives of this blog over the past twenty years.</p>



<p><strong>Q8.</strong> Does this announcement vindicate topological qubits as the way forward for quantum computing?<br><strong>A.</strong> Think of it this way.  <em>If</em> Microsoft’s claim stands, then topological qubits have finally reached some sort of parity with where more traditional qubits were 20-30 years ago.  I.e., the non-topological approaches like superconducting, trapped-ion, and neutral-atom have an absolutely <em>massive</em> head start: there, Google, IBM, Quantinuum, QuEra, and other companies now routinely do experiments with dozens or even hundreds of entangled qubits, and thousands of two-qubit gates.  Topological qubits can win if, and only if, they turn out to be <em>so much</em> more reliable that they leapfrog the earlier approaches—sort of like the transistor did to the vacuum tube and electromechanical relay.  Whether that will happen is still an open question, to put it extremely mildly.</p>



<p><strong>Q9.</strong> Are there other major experimental efforts to build topological qubits?<br><strong>A.</strong> No, it’s pretty much just Microsoft.  Purely as a scientist who likes to see things tried, I’m grateful that one player stuck with the topological approach even when it ended up being a long, painful slog.</p>



<p><strong>Q10.</strong> Is Microsoft now on track to scale to a million topological qubits in the next few years?<br><strong>A.</strong> In the world of corporate PR and pop-science headlines, sure, why not?  As Bender from <em>Futurama</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGZ10kZ4lmE">says</a>, “I can guarantee anything you want!” In the world of reality, a “few years” certainly feels overly aggressive to me, but good luck to Microsoft and good luck to its competitors!  I foresee exciting times ahead, provided we still have a functioning civilization in which to enjoy them.</p>

victory for </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/gpt-4-the-bitterer-lesson" rel="">the Bitter Lesson</a><span>. Perhaps the clearest one so far. Contrary to what the press and critics keep saying, the scaling laws still govern AI progress—more than ever before.</span></p><p>This article is not about DeepSeek, but I want to revisit a valuable insight to support my argument.</p><p><span>DeepSeek managed to </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/deepseek-is-chinese-but-its-ai-models" rel="">compete with top players</a><span> despite having a moderate compute disadvantage—50K Nvidia Hoppers vs 100K+ Nvidia H100s for US labs). To compensate, they had to optimize across the entire stack, showing impressive engineering prowess. They succeeded, turning the startup into an exception that could prove misplaced the community’s trust in both the bitter lesson and the scaling paradigm.</span></p><p><span>That is, at least, what skeptics argued: DeepSeek, with its “tiny” GPU cluster and cheap training runs, built a model at the level of OpenAI o1. To them, this was strong evidence that hand-crafted features, human ingenuity, and algorithmic improvements were more important than using giant clusters to train AI models. It even meant that you should sell all your Nvidia stock because GPUs were </span><em>not that important</em><span>.</span></p><p>However, this conclusion emerges from a mistaken understanding of the Bitter Lesson (which isn’t a law of nature but an empirical observation): It doesn’t say that algorithmic improvements don’t work. It very much praises them. What it says is that, if you can choose, scaling learning and search algorithms with more computing power is the better choice over applying heuristic solutions, however clever.</p><p><span>DeepSeek achieved good results doing the latter because they</span><em> had no option</em><span>. Had they trained on a 100K GPU cluster like xAI did for Grok 3, they would have obtained much better results. DeepSeek proved that further optimization is possible—not that scaling is useless. Those two realities are uncorrelated.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, DeepSeek’s CEO, Liang Wenfeng, acknowledged that </span><a href="https://archive.is/JnE4j" rel="">US export controls are their main bottleneck</a><span> to make better models. The fact that he said this despite having access to ~50K Hoppers reveals the opposite of “GPUs don’t matter.” While DeepSeek relied on clever optimizations, they still needed </span><em>scale</em><span>. DeepSeek CEO said it—why should anyone outside the company think they know better?</span></p><p>DeepSeek’s unprecedented success supports the Bitter Lesson and the scaling paradigm, even if to some degree as an exception to the rule.</p><p>Back to Grok 3.</p><p><span>I wonder if xAI’s achievement will make skeptics rethink their criticisms of scale. We don’t know whether they changed the architecture or how much they optimized the infrastructure to make Grok 3, that’s true. What we do know is they trained the model in the </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/first-in-depth-look-at-elon-musks-100-000-gpu-ai-cluster-xai-colossus-reveals-its-secrets" rel="">100K H100 Colossus supercomputer</a><span> that xAI built in Memphis, Tennessee. That’s a lot of GPUs. That’s much more GPUs than DeepSeek has.</span></p><p>(Probably both used just a fraction of the total compute available, but it’s a reasonable assumption that having 2x more GPUs allows you to train your models with ~2x more GPUs, whether you’re using all of them or not.)</p><p><span>Unlike DeepSeek, they </span><em>didn’t need</em><span> to optimize the infrastructure beyond reasonable standards (so, not touching the CUDA kernels or applying unproven algorithmic tricks). They surely did some optimization, but I highly doubt they went nearly that far. The Bitter Lesson says that if you have the compute it’s better to use it </span><em>before </em><span>you fiddle like a scrappy GPU-poor; scaling a bit further eventually brings more benefits than doing some hand-crafting (</span><a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1891767926975283425" rel="">this cryptic tweet by Musk</a><span> can mean many things). And remember, xAI is scale-pilled.</span></p><p>So that’s probably what they did: They threw more compute at Grok 3 than even OpenAI could, and the result is a state-of-the-art model.</p><p><span>I want to make a quick digression here because I’m tired of referencing the Bitter Lesson as if it were an AI-exclusive insight. No—it is a fundamental truth. If you have more of the primary resource, you don’t waste time squeezing out another drop out of a secondary resource; you take a full glass from the cascade. Would you rather be like </span><em>Dune</em><span>’s Fremen, recycling sweat and wringing moisture from the dead with clever but desperate devices, or live on a planet where it rains?</span></p><p><span>Improving algorithms and increasing the compute you run them on </span><em>are both valuable approaches</em><span> but if the marginal gains you get suddenly shrink as a function of the effort you’re putting in, you’re better off </span><em>changing your variable of focus </em><span>rather than being stubborn. And because computing power is mostly available as long as you have money (for now) whereas valid algorithmic tricks require rare Eureka moments that may work today but not tomorrow—and perhaps never scale—you’re almost always better off focusing on growing the power of your computer.</span></p><p>If you “find a wall,” then you just change the thing you scale, but you don’t. stop. scaling.</p><p>Constraints do fuel innovation—and struggle builds character; I’m sure DeepSeek’s team is absolutely cracked—but in the end, having more beats doing the same with less. This is an unfair world and I’m sorry.</p><p>I wonder if DeepSeek likes to be in the position they are or if they would gladly change places with xAI or OpenAI. Or, conversely, do you think OpenAI and xAI would ditch all their GPUs so they can innovate through their constraints like DeepSeek did?</p><p><span>In a way, being both latecomers, xAI and DeepSeek represent opposite approaches to the same challenge. Brute-force scale vs squeezing out limited resources. Both </span><em>did great</em><span> with what they had. But, undoubtedly, xAI is better off and will be in the coming months (as long as DeepSeek remains compute-bottlenecked). That’s thanks to their adherence to a law that albeit empirical—and heavily contested by the Academia—has proven valuable in the arena for more than a decade.</span></p><p><span>For a while, a late start seemed like an insurmountable burden in the AI race. When I first assessed their chances, I wasn’t sure xAI could catch up to OpenAI and Anthropic (said that much in the very last sentence of </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/8-insights-to-make-sense-of-openai" rel="">this article</a><span>).</span></p><p>But between Grok 2 (Aug. 2024) and Grok 3 (Feb. 2025), something—besides the Colossus GPU cluster—helped xAI’s chances: the dominant scaling paradigm shifted.</p><ul><li><p>The pre-training era (2019-2024): Initially, scaling meant building ever-larger models trained on massive datasets and massive computers: GPT-2 (Feb. 2019) had 1.5 billion parameters whereas GPT-4 (Mar. 2023) is estimated at 1.76 trillion. That’s three orders of magnitude larger. This approach naturally favored early movers like OpenAI, who had a multi-year head start in collecting training data, growing models, and buying GPUs. Even without that advantage, if each new model took ~half a year to train—their size slowed down iteration speed between generations—OpenAI would always be at least that far ahead of xAI.</p></li><li><p><span>The post-training era (2024-???): The game changed when companies realized that simply making models larger was yielding diminishing returns (the press was quick to misreport this as “scale is over” so I urge you to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/1yvBqasHLZs" rel="">watch this talk by Ilya Sutskever</a><span> at NeurIPS 2024 in December). Instead, the focus became scaling test-time compute (i.e., allowing models to use compute to think answers through), </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/openai-o1-a-new-paradigm-for-ai" rel="">spearheaded by OpenAI with o1-preview</a><span>. Reinforcement learning combined with supervised fine-tuning </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/deepseek-is-chinese-but-its-ai-models" rel="">proved to be highly effective</a><span>—especially in structured domains like math and coding, where well-defined, verifiable reward functions exist.</span></p></li></ul><p>This paradigm shift meant that scaling post-training became as important—if not more—than scaling pre-training. AI companies “stopped” making larger models and began to make them better thinkers. This happened last year. Right when DeepSeek and xAI were building their brand-new models. A happy coincidence.</p><p><span>Importantly, post-training is still in its early days, rapid improvements </span><a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls#three-dynamics-of-ai-development" rel="">can be achieved cheaply compared to pre-training</a><span>. That’s how OpenAI </span><a href="https://x.com/_jasonwei/status/1870184982007644614" rel="">jumped from o1 to o3 in just three months</a><span>. It’s how DeepSeek caught up with </span><a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf" rel="">R1</a><span> despite owning fewer and worse GPUs. It’s how Grok has reached a top-tier level in just two years.</span></p><p><span>OpenAI still has a moderate advantage, but it is no longer the kind of lead that made catching up impossible. And while Sam Altman has to balance cutting-edge research with the demands of running ChatGPT—a product used by </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users" rel="">300 million people weekly</a><span>—xAI and DeepSeek have more flexibility to focus on breakthroughs (DeepSeek’s app spiked in popularity but </span><a href="https://substack.com/@thealgorithmicbridge/note/c-94091734" rel="">went back down</a><span> because the company doesn’t have enough compute to serve inference to so many users).</span></p><p>A new paradigm; a new rivalry.</p><p>Acknowledging neither the Bitter Lesson nor this scaling paradigm shift takes away from either company’s achievements. They had it easier but they had to do it anyway. Others tried and failed (e.g. Mistral, Character, Inflection). As I said, Grok 3 is primarily a win for the Bitter Lesson and DeepSeek is primarily an exception that proves the rule, but let’s not reduce them to just that.</p><p><span>Compute alone—or the lack thereof—isn’t everything. Just like the Bitter Lesson doesn’t deny the value of improving algorithms and infrastructure, we shouldn’t ignore the fact that xAI has an outstanding team, now around 1,000 employees—on par with OpenAI (~2,000) and Anthropic (~700). There’s also Elon Musk’s deep connections in tech and finance, which give xAI a massive fundraising advantage. The same goes for DeepSeek, deserving as much praise as it got for the way it navigated its constraints and emerged victorious in a local ecosystem lacking ambition and experienced talent, as well as government support (</span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/chinese-president-xi-jinping-meets-tech-leaders" rel="">that might change soon</a><span>).</span></p><p>But recognizing the victory is just as important as putting it into context.</p><p><span>OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic built their models when scaling was harder, slower, and more expensive (pre-training era). No one knew whether something like ChatGPT would work as well as it did (OpenAI </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/03/exclusive-openai-sam-altman-chatgpt-agi-google-search/" rel="">almost didn’t launch it</a><span> and when it did, it was touted as a “</span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989871/openai-execs-dubbed-chatgpt-a-low-key-research-preview" rel="">low-key research preview</a><span>”). These startups acted as bold trailblazers moved by an </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/what-no-one-outside-openai-can-really" rel="">unwavering conviction</a><span>. Their role, although now slightly overshadowed by the opposition in press headlines, will be recorded in history books.</span></p><p>DeepSeek and xAI, in contrast, stood on the shoulders of those giants, leveraging the lessons painstakingly learned from their early efforts, and benefiting from the sheer luck of building their models at a moment when a paradigm shift made faster, more cost-effective progress possible (post-training era). They didn’t have to navigate as many missteps or endure a massive upfront investment with uncertain returns.</p><p>So let’s not downplay their wins but let’s also not forget how we got here.</p><p>There’s a final key takeaway from Grok 3 and xAI.</p><p><span>Once companies figure out how to scale post-training to the same investment levels as pre-training—it will happen, they’re stockpiling hundreds of thousands of GPUs and building giant clusters, to the bewildered lamentation of the “GPUs don’t matter” crowd—only those with the money and compute to keep up will remain competitive. (That’s why Dario Amodei and others have written extensively </span><a href="https://darioamodei.com/on-deepseek-and-export-controls" rel="">on the value of export controls</a><span>.)</span></p><p><span>This is where xAI has positioned itself remarkably well. Better than DeepSeek and, arguably, even better than OpenAI and Anthropic. (Having Elon Musk as CEO helps.) With a 100K H100 cluster—soon expanding to 200K—xAI has secured a major advantage in the next phase of AI development. Meta is following the same playbook, preparing to launch Llama 4 in the coming months, having trained it in a </span><a href="https://analyticsindiamag.com/ai-news-updates/mark-zuckerberg-confirms-llama-4-release-in-early-2025/" rel="">100K+ H100 cluster</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>For DeepSeek, engineering ingenuity alone won’t be enough this time, no matter how good they are at tinkering across the full stack (perhaps </span><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huawei-adds-deepseek-inference-support-for-its-ascend-ai-gpus" rel="">Huawei can help them</a><span>). There comes a point where no amount of optimizations can make up for a 150K-GPU gap. Don’t get me wrong—DeepSeek would have done the same as xAI did (they’re scale-pilled as well) but export restrictions are truly limiting their ability to grow.</span></p><p>Not even OpenAI and Anthropic have their clusters as locked in as xAI—Nvidia’s favoritism means Musk’s company is getting priority access to next-gen hardware.</p><p><span>Despite all of this, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic still have a small head start. OpenAI will release </span><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1889755723078443244" rel="">GPT-4.5/GPT-5</a><span>, then o4, and Anthropic is </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anthropic-strikes-back?rc=j0xnsg" rel="">about to launch Claude 4</a><span>. Google DeepMind keeps improving the Thinking-model versions of </span><a href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-updates-february-2025/" rel="">Gemini 2.0</a><span> and working hard to reduce costs and augment the context window.</span></p><p><span>My prediction was that </span><a href="https://www.thealgorithmicbridge.com/p/20-predictions-for-ai-in-2025" rel="">Google would be ahead by year’s end</a><span> but I’m not sure anymore. The landscape has never been more competitive, and the AGI race has no clear winner. The new paradigm favors late entrants while demanding agility—a skill I’m not sure Google has mastered yet. It’s also possible they’re simply terrible at marketing their advances, making their impending successes feel far less tangible than those of their competitors.</span></p><p><span>My conclusion for this post, however, is not going to be about the AI race. It’s about a lesson that keeps resurfacing, unsettling those who want to believe that human ingenuity will always triumph over simply </span><em>letting go</em><span>. I hate to break it to you, dear friends, but some things are simply beyond us.</span></p><p>Grok 3 is impressive. But more than anything, it’s yet another reminder that when it comes to building intelligence, scaling wins over raw cleverness every time.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            We present <strong>Magma</strong>, a foundation model serving multimodal AI agentic tasks in both the digital and physical worlds.  <strong>Magma</strong> is a significant extension of vision-language (VL) models in that the former not only retains the VL understanding ability (verbal intelligence) of the latter, but is also equipped with the ability to plan and act in the visual-spatial world (spatial intelligence) and to complete agentic tasks ranging from UI navigation to robot manipulation.
            <strong>Magma</strong> is pretrained on large amounts of heterogeneous VL datasets including images, videos and robotics data, where the actionable visual objects (e.g., clickable buttons in GUI) in images are labeled by Set-of-Mark (SoM) and the object movements (e.g., the trace of a robotic arm) in videos are labeled by Trace-of-Mark (ToM). 
            Extensive experiments show that SoM and ToM facilitate the acquisition of spatial intelligence from large-scale training data.
            <strong>Magma</strong> creates new state-of-the-art results on UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, outperforming previous models that are tailored specifically to these tasks. On VL tasks, Magma also compares favorably to popular VL models that are trained on much larger datasets.

              <p><strong>Magma pretraining pipeline. </strong>For all training data, texts are tokenized into tokens, while images and videos from different domains
                are encoded by a shared vision encoder. The resulted discrete and continuous tokens are then fed into a LLM to generate the outputs in
                verbal, spatial and action types.

<p>On Jan. 20, United States President Donald Trump signed an executive order renaming the “Gulf of Mexico” to “Gulf of America.” Last week, Google Maps officially changed the name of the gulf on its maps, sparking a flurry of memes and conversation on social media, and Mexico is now threatening legal action if they don’t change it back.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;press conference on Monday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said that Mexico will sue Google if the company does not change the “Gulf of America” label to cover only the portion of the body of water under U.S. jurisdiction, which is just a small portion of the gulf.</p>

<p>Sheinbaum argues that Donald Trump and the United States do not have the authority to rename the entire gulf and that the executive order applies only to the United States continental shelf.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about 22 nautical miles, not the entire gulf,” Sheinbaum said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mexico-lawsuit-threat-google-maps-gulf-of-america-2025-2">according to Business Insider</a>.</p>

<p>Sheinbaum pointed out that Google has also changed the name of the continental shelves of Mexico and Cuba when those two countries have not changed the name themselves.</p>

<p>In a letter to Google, Sheinbaum made it clear that Mexico will not&nbsp;accept the renaming of any geographical area that includes its national territory or that falls under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>“Any reference to the ‘Gulf of America’ initiative on your Google Maps platform must be exclusively limited to the marine area under US jurisdiction,” the letter read. “Any extension beyond that zone exceeds the authority of any national government or private entity. Should that be the case, the Government of Mexico will take the appropriate legal actions as deemed necessary.”</p>

<p>Sheinbaum said that it’s possible that the nation could sue Google in civil court over the matter, but they will await Google’s response to their most recent letter before proceeding with legal action.</p>

<p dir="auto">While vision models like OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/" rel="nofollow">GPT-4o</a> and Anthropic’s <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude" rel="nofollow">Claude Vision</a> excel in exploratory tasks like "chat with images," they often lack practicality for automation and integration, where <strong>strongly-typed</strong>, <strong>validated outputs</strong> are crucial.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <strong>Structured Outputs API</strong> (popularized by <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-structured-outputs-in-the-api/" rel="nofollow">GPT-4o</a>, <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output" rel="nofollow">Gemini</a>) addresses this by constraining LLMs to return data in precise, strongly-typed formats such as <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/" rel="nofollow">Pydantic</a> models. This eliminates complex parsing and validation, ensuring outputs conform to expected types and structures.

<p>Even “no-logs” VPNs see both your identity and your internet activity, meaning you have to blindly trust their pinky-promise for privacy. This is exactly why some privacy-conscious folks will tell you not to use a VPN at all.</p>
<p>Obscura is different – we never see your decrypted internet packets. It’s simply <em>impossible</em> for us to log your internet activity, even if we were compelled to, or if our servers were compromised. You can even <a href="#faq-trust">verify this yourself</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Obscura’s stealth protocol is much harder to block.</strong></p>
<p>Our unique stealth protocol is designed to blend in with regular internet traffic. It does so by leveraging QUIC – the same technology that powers HTTP/3 – making it far harder for censors or network filters to detect or block.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching the bottom — not everyone makes it.</p>
<p>I’m incredibly lucky to have the help of a crack(ed) team of privacy optimists to build Obscura.</p>
<p>Among us, we’ve served on the Nix RFC Steering Committee, implemented the 64bit random number generator for the Go standard library, fixed critical vulnerabilities for hardware security tokens, won bounties for Monero bugs, and contributed to Bitcoin for reproducible builds.</p>
<p>But while privacy and digital sovereignty in some worlds has made leaps and bounds, VPNs have been left behind; peddling privacy based on promises instead of privacy baked into the architecture.</p>
<p>So we’re taking our skills to build Obscura: a VPN you can depend on to get the most out of our glorious digital commons – the internet. It’s the VPN we’ve always wanted to use, and it’s the kind of privacy we believe everyone should have access to.</p>

        <p>‘Tiny house lab’ shows impact of everyday activities on indoor air quality</p>
    
</div><p>Scented wax melts are marketed as a flameless, smoke-free, non-toxic alternative to traditional candles, a safer way of making your home or office smell nice. To assess the truth of these claims, the researchers comprehensively measured the nanoparticles formed when they warmed wax melts in their mechanically ventilated test house. The tiny house is actually an architectural engineering laboratory called the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CCE/Media/Impact/2020-Fall/tiny-house-giant-impact?_gl=1*5rfx34*_gcl_au*MTg5MDA5NTE1MS4xNzM5NzQ0NTY5*_ga*MTA3NzcwMzkyMi4xNzM5NzQ0NTY5*_ga_PF1CYQ27F6*MTczOTc0OTQ0OS4zLjAuMTczOTc0OTQ0OS4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">Purdue Zero Energy Design Guidance for Engineers (zEDGE) lab</a>. Designed and engineered to test the energy efficiency of a larger building, it’s full of sensors that monitor the impact of everyday activities on indoor air quality.</p><p>“To understand how airborne particles form indoors, you need to measure the smallest nanoparticles – down to a single nanometer,” said Brandon Boor, associate professor in civil engineering at Purdue and the study’s other corresponding author. “At this scale, we can observe the earliest stages of new particle formation, where fragrances react with ozone to form tiny molecular clusters.”</p><p>The researchers knew from their <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsestair.4c00118" target="_blank" data-cms-ai="0">previous research</a> that new nanoparticle formation was initiated by terpenes – aromatic compounds that determine the smell of things like plants and herbs – released from the melts and reacting with indoor atmospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>). They’d found that activities such as mopping the floor with a terpene-rich cleaning agent, using a citrus-scented air freshener, or applying scented personal care products like deodorant inside the zEDGE house resulted in pulsed terpene emissions to the indoor air within five minutes. Conversely, using essential oil diffusers or peeling citrus fruits caused a more gradual increase in terpenes.</p><p>In the present study, heating the scented wax contributed significantly to the number of new particles formed in the indoor air, particularly those smaller than 100 nanometers (nm). The resulting atmospheric concentrations were over one million nanoparticles per cubic centimeter (10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), which is comparable to concentrations emitted by traditional lighted candles (10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), gas stoves (10<sup>5</sup> – 10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), diesel engines (10<sup>3</sup> – 10<sup>6</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>), and natural gas engines (10<sup>6</sup> – 10<sup>7</sup> cm<sup>-3</sup>).

They found that the new particle formation triggered by using scented wax melts indoors produced a median <i>R</i><sub>D</sub> for 1.18 to 100 nm particles of 29 billion per minute (2.9 x 10<sup>10</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Absolutely nobody likes the hiring process. Not the managers hiring, not the recruitment people, and <strong>certainly</strong> not the candidates.</p><p>Tech interviews are one of the worst parts of the process and are pretty much universally hated by the people taking them. We’ve all heard stories of people being asked comp sci questions about <em>O(n)</em> efficiency, only to connect APIs with basic middleware in their day job. I think the image below pretty much sums it up:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kanenarraway.com/posts/ai-killed-the-tech-interview-now-what/techinterview.jpg" alt="brewinterview"></p><p>The last few years, though, have seen a whole bunch of advancements to counteract the interview process:</p><ol><li>Before AI, there were cases of pay-to-interview schemes with interviewees who kept their cameras off during remote interviews. If hired, they sounded *suspiciously different *from the person who interviewed.</li><li><a href="https://blog.knowbe4.com/how-a-north-korean-fake-it-worker-tried-to-infiltrate-us">We’ve had cases of North Korean workers</a> trying to get jobs with tech companies using deepfake videos. Whether this was just for money or something more nefarious is to be seen.</li><li>AI is, of course, the big one. Using apps like GitHub Co-pilot and Cursor to auto-complete code requires very little skill in hands-on coding. Asking Claude and OpenAI answers to technical questions will usually result in a right answer, and the failure rate is improving rapidly.</li></ol><p>This doesn’t even include the AI implications of resume creation, mass applications, one-way video interviews, and other techniques that have caused a tug-of-war between employers and employees. Still, in this post, we’ll focus squarely on the tech interview.</p><h2 id="tech-interview-basics">Tech interview basics</h2><p>Skip this section if you know the process; almost every company hiring developers has some variation of the below:</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hackerrank</a></strong> - Online coding assessments usually use a pre-interview screen. Commonly used for grads, interns, and junior devs. It allows people to code in their own time at home without an interviewer spending their time assessing it. Pass this step to get to the other interviews.</p><p><strong>Comp Sci Fundamentals</strong>- Focuses on computer science fundamentals and is, again, more typically asked of junior developers. It usually involves Big O notation, questions about data structures, loops etc.</p><p><strong>The Coding Interview</strong> - Usually done by everyone, this focuses on hands-on coding ability and asks you to build something like a calculator, a messaging system, or some common design pattern. The interviewers usually look for general coding skills first but might also evaluate language specifics too.</p><p><strong>Architecture / Design</strong>- Usually not hands-on coding. This tends to be for more senior devs and focuses more on how you build. How do you design systems, how do you connect frontend and backend, what database and API schemas do you use, how do you scale up to 10x, 100x users etc.</p><h2 id="ai-in-interviews">AI in interviews</h2><p>AI straight-up kills hackerrank. The only thing that is a filter for now is if you have the know-how to use AI and prompt correctly. That can be useful, but hackerrank will need to adapt somehow. If it can’t, I can’t see it being used at all in five years.</p><p>AI also significantly reduces the effectiveness of comp sci fundamentals and the coding interview as they are today. The problems are too simple, and an LLM can quickly answer them in most cases.</p><p>Architectural interviews are likely safe for a few years yet. From talking to people who have run these, it’s evident that someone is using AI. They often stop with long pauses, do not quite explain things succinctly, and do not understand the questions well enough to prompt the correct answer. As AI gets better (and faster), this will likely follow the same fate as the rest but I would give it some years yet.</p><h2 id="what-are-our-options">What are our options?</h2><ol><li><strong>Stop remote tech interviews:</strong> Using AI when an interviewer is looking over your shoulder is extremely difficult. This could be an in-person coding interview, assuming they pass all the rest.</li><li><strong>Require some Pearson Vue-type spyware</strong>: If you’ve ever taken a professional certification, you know what I mean. Some software that you install gives the interviewer full access while they watch you with a camera. This software is also easily bypassable in many ways;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatonlineproctor/"> there’s a whole subreddit dedicated to it</a>.</li><li><strong>Bury our heads in the sand:</strong> We ask people pretty please not to use AI on coding tests. The moral ones who <em>actually</em> don’t get worse scores than the ones who do, and we end up hiring the wrong candidates.</li><li><strong>Change our interviews to allow AI</strong>: We start testing prompting and refactoring rather than testing coding ability. Can<a href="https://ghuntley.com/stdlib/"> someone program LLMs to get the outcomes they want</a> during an interview? This is a huge shift change and would be uncharted territory. As we encourage more people to use IDEs like Cursor this is likely more the skills we are looking for though. This is a huge hiring risk in the short term, as we still need strong coding ability to correct the AI’s failures. In enterprises,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTCoding/comments/1ibtjri/my_project_became_so_big_that_claude_cant/"> we often deal with more than 30 files after all</a>.</li><li><strong>Hybrid Approach:</strong> Mixing some of the options above. We do remote architectural and coding interviews ( could even be one-way Hackerrank style) that test a mix of prompting and coding ability. Assuming the candidate passes this, they might travel to the office for an in-person coding interview.</li></ol><h2 id="possible-solutions">Possible solutions</h2><p>Option four and five are likely the only answers in the long term. A lot of companies are doing RTO, but even companies that are 100% in-office still interview candidates from other cities. Spending money to fly every candidate out without an aggressive pre-screen is too wasteful.</p><p>One of the things we can do, however, is change the nature of the interviews themselves. Coding interviews today are quite basic, anywhere from FizzBuzz, to building a calculator. With AI assistants, we could expand this 10x and have people build complete applications. I think a single, longer interview (2 hours) that mixes architecture and coding will probably be the way to go.</p><p>Build an application, scale it, and add functions as the interviewer requires. A longer interview will be required to ensure consistency across the codebase as it develops and go into deeper questions rather than focusing on surface-level stuff.</p><p>This way, you can evaluate:</p><ul><li>Can the person cope with basic git and IDE usage?</li><li>Can they prompt the LLM effectively and potentially program the LLM to give better outputs?</li><li>Can they understand the code well enough to glue LLM outputs together and make manual edits without making the code a total unreadable mess?</li><li>Can they be consistent over time with delivery?</li><li>Can they build something of a reasonable size and scale within a limited timeframe.</li></ul><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Regardless, the nature of interviews will change drastically in the next few years. Right now, it’s fairly obvious when someone is using AI because it’s slow, it gives very to-the-point answers, and you can ask particular edge cases to test the candidate. That won’t last though.</p><p>Until then I think we’ll see the following:</p><ol><li>More people pass interviews than get exited during their probation period. An LLM can help you pass an interview but can’t help you be good at your job. Dealing with incidents, technical designs, and consistent communication is a whole different thing.</li><li>Interns, Grads and Junior Engineers will have an even greater chasm to cross. The reality is that you need senior engineering skills as soon as possible, and universities do not teach them.</li></ol><p>Plus, things will change even faster if people keep posting TikToks about how they used AI to pass the FAANG interview steps with absolutely no coding knowledge.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kanenarraway.com/posts/ai-killed-the-tech-interview-now-what/godzilla.png" alt="godzilla fighting"></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-5-evaluating-queries">https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-5-evaluating-queries</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43108614">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>In the previous posts, we've explored the
<a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-1-listing-tables">SQLite file format</a> and built a
simple <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.sylver.dev/build-your-own-sqlite-part-3-sql-parsing-101">SQL parser</a>. It's time
to put these pieces together and implement a query evaluator!
In this post, we'll lay the groundwork for evaluating SQL queries and build a
query evaluator that can handle basic SELECT statements. While our initial implementation
won't support filtering, sorting, grouping, or joins yet, it will give us the
foundation to add these features in future posts.</p>
<p>As usual, the complete source code for this post is available
on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/geoffreycopin/rqlite/commit/c7dfeeea6956e209ccbd50a727c2b9352c246082">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heading-setting-up-our-test-database">Setting up our test database</h2>
<p>Before we can evaluate queries, we need a database to query. We'll start by
creating a simple database with a single table, <code>table1</code>, with two columns,
<code>id</code> and <code>value</code>:</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3 queries_test.db
sqlite&gt; create table table1(id <span>integer</span>, value text);
sqlite&gt; insert into table1(id, value) values
    ...&gt; (1, <span>'11'</span>),
    ...&gt; (2, <span>'12'</span>),
    ...&gt; (3, <span>'13'</span>);
sqlite&gt; .<span>exit</span>
</code></pre>
<p>⚠️ You might be tempted to use an existing SQLite database to test your queries,
but keep in mind that our implementation does not support overflow pages yet,
so it might not be able to read the data from your database file.</p>

<hr>
<p>This section is specific to the Rust implementation. If you're following along
with another language, you can safely skip it!</p>
<hr>
<p>Currently, our pager can only be used through an exclusive mutable reference.
This was fine for our initial use cases, but as we start building more complex
features, maintaining this restriction will constrain our design.
We'll make the pager shareable by wrapping its inner mutable fields in an
<code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>. This will allow us to effectively clone the pager and
use it from multiple places without running into borrow checker issues.
At this stage of the project we could have chosen to use a simple <code>Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>,
but we'll eventually need to support concurrent access to the pager, so we'll
use thread-safe counterparts from the start.</p>
<pre><code>// src/pager.rs

<span>- #[derive(Debug, Clone)]</span>
<span>+ #[derive(Debug)]</span>
pub struct Pager&lt;I: Read + Seek = std::fs::File&gt; {
<span>-   input: I,</span>
<span>+   input: Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;I&gt;&gt;</span>
    page_size: usize,
<span>-   pages: HashMap&lt;usize, page::Page&gt;,</span>
<span>+   pages: Arc&lt;RwLock&lt;HashMap&lt;usize, Arc&lt;page::Page&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;,</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>read_page</code> and <code>load_page</code> methods need to be updated accordingly:</p>
<pre><code><span>impl</span>&lt;I: Read + Seek&gt; Pager&lt;I&gt; {
    <span>// [...] </span>
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>read_page</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, n: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Arc&lt;page::Page&gt;&gt; {
        {
            <span>let</span> read_pages = <span>self</span>
                .pages
                .read()
                .map_err(|_| anyhow!(<span>"failed to acquire pager read lock"</span>))?;

            <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(page) = read_pages.get(&amp;n) {
                <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(page.clone());
            }
        }

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> write_pages = <span>self</span>
            .pages
            .write()
            .map_err(|_| anyhow!(<span>"failed to acquire pager write lock"</span>))?;

        <span>if</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(page) = write_pages.get(&amp;n) {
            <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(page.clone());
        }

        <span>let</span> page = <span>self</span>.load_page(n)?;
        write_pages.insert(n, page.clone());
        <span>Ok</span>(page)
    }

    <span><span>fn</span> <span>load_page</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, n: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Arc&lt;page::Page&gt;&gt; {
        <span>let</span> offset = n.saturating_sub(<span>1</span>) * <span>self</span>.page_size;

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> input_guard = <span>self</span>
            .input
            .lock()
            .map_err(|_| anyhow!(<span>"failed to lock pager mutex"</span>))?;

        input_guard
            .seek(SeekFrom::Start(offset <span>as</span> <span>u64</span>))
            .context(<span>"seek to page start"</span>)?;

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> buffer = <span>vec!</span>[<span>0</span>; <span>self</span>.page_size];
        input_guard.read_exact(&amp;<span>mut</span> buffer).context(<span>"read page"</span>)?;

        <span>Ok</span>(Arc::new(parse_page(&amp;buffer, n)?))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Two things to note regarding the <code>read_page</code> method:</p>
<ul>
<li>the initial attempt to read the page from the cache is nested in a block to
limit the scope of the read lock, ensuring that it is released before we try
to acquire the write lock</li>
<li>after acquiring the write lock, we check again if the page is already in the
cache, in case it was inserted in between the two lock acquisitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, we'll define an owned version of our <code>Value</code> enum that we'll use
in the query evaluator:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/value.rs</span>

<span>// [...]</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug, Clone)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>enum</span> <span>OwnedValue</span></span> {
    Null,
    <span>String</span>(Rc&lt;<span>String</span>&gt;),
    Blob(Rc&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>u8</span>&gt;&gt;),
    Int(<span>i64</span>),
    Float(<span>f64</span>),
}

<span>impl</span>&lt;<span>'p</span>&gt; <span>From</span>&lt;Value&lt;<span>'p</span>&gt;&gt; <span>for</span> OwnedValue {
    <span><span>fn</span> <span>from</span></span>(value: Value&lt;<span>'p</span>&gt;) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        <span>match</span> value {
            Value::Null =&gt; Self::Null,
            Value::Int(i) =&gt; Self::Int(i),
            Value::Float(f) =&gt; Self::Float(f),
            Value::Blob(b) =&gt; Self::Blob(Rc::new(b.into_owned())),
            Value::<span>String</span>(s) =&gt; Self::<span>String</span>(Rc::new(s.into_owned())),
        }
    }
}

<span>impl</span> std::fmt::Display <span>for</span> OwnedValue {

            OwnedValue::Blob(items) =&gt; {
                <span>write!</span>(
                    f,

                        .iter()
                        .filter_map(|&amp;n| <span>char</span>::from_u32(n <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>).filter(<span>char</span>::is_ascii))
                        .collect::&lt;<span>String</span>&gt;()
                )
            }
            OwnedValue::Int(i) =&gt; i.fmt(f),
            OwnedValue::Float(x) =&gt; x.fmt(f),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we'll enrich our <code>Cursor</code> struct with a method that returns the value
of a field as an <code>OwnedValue</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/cursor.rs</span>

<span>impl</span> Cursor {
    <span>// [...] </span>
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>owned_field</span></span>(&amp;<span>self</span>, n: <span>usize</span>) -&gt; <span>Option</span>&lt;OwnedValue&gt; {
        <span>self</span>.field(n).map(<span>Into</span>::into)
    }
    <span>// [...]</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="heading-evaluating-select-statements">Evaluating <code>SELECT</code> statements</h2>
<p>Our query engine will be composed of two main components:</p>
<ul>
<li>an iterator-like <code>Operator</code> enum that represents nestable operations on the
database, such as scanning a table or filtering rows. Our initial implementation
will only contain a <code>SeqScan</code> operator that yields all rows from a table.</li>
<li>a <code>Planner</code> struct that takes a parsed SQL query and produces an <code>Operator</code> that
can be evaluated to produce the query result.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's start by defining the <code>Operator</code> enum:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/engine/operator.rs</span>
<span>use</span> anyhow::Context;

<span>use</span> crate::{cursor::Scanner, value::OwnedValue};

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>enum</span> <span>Operator</span></span> {
    SeqScan(SeqScan),
}

<span>impl</span> Operator {
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>next_row</span></span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;&amp;[OwnedValue]&gt;&gt; {
        <span>match</span> <span>self</span> {
            Operator::SeqScan(s) =&gt; s.next_row(),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The result of evaluating a query will be obtained by repeatedly calling the
<code>next_row</code> method on the <code>Operator</code> until it returns <code>None</code>. Each value
in the returned slice corresponds to a column in the query result.</p>
<p>The <code>SeqScan</code> struct will be responsible for scanning a table and yielding
its rows:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/engine/operator.rs</span>

<span>// [...]</span>

<span>#[derive(Debug)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>struct</span> <span>SeqScan</span></span> {
    fields: <span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>usize</span>&gt;,
    scanner: Scanner,
    row_buffer: <span>Vec</span>&lt;OwnedValue&gt;,
}

<span>impl</span> SeqScan {
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span></span>(fields: <span>Vec</span>&lt;<span>usize</span>&gt;, scanner: Scanner) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        <span>let</span> row_buffer = <span>vec!</span>[OwnedValue::Null; fields.len()];

        <span>Self</span> {
            fields,
            scanner,
            row_buffer,
        }
    }

    <span><span>fn</span> <span>next_row</span></span>(&amp;<span>mut</span> <span>self</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;<span>Option</span>&lt;&amp;[OwnedValue]&gt;&gt; {
        <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(record) = <span>self</span>.scanner.next_record()? <span>else</span> {
            <span>return</span> <span>Ok</span>(<span>None</span>);
        };

        <span>for</span> (i, &amp;n) <span>in</span> <span>self</span>.fields.iter().enumerate() {
            <span>self</span>.row_buffer[i] = record.owned_field(n).context(<span>"missing record field"</span>)?;
        }

        <span>Ok</span>(<span>Some</span>(&amp;<span>self</span>.row_buffer))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>SeqScan</code> struct is initialized with a list of field indices to read from
each record and a <code>Scanner</code> that will yield the records for every row in the
table to be scanned. As the number of fields to read is identical for every row,
we can preallocate a buffer to store the values of the selected fields.
The next_row method retrieves the next record from the scanner, extracts
the requested fields (specified by their indices), and stores them in our buffer.</p>
<p>Now that we have an <code>Operator</code> to evaluate <code>SELECT</code> statements, let's move on
to the <code>Planner</code> struct that will produce the <code>Operator</code> from a parsed SQL query:</p>
<pre><code><span>// src/engine/plan.rs</span>

<span>use</span> anyhow::{bail, Context, <span>Ok</span>};

<span>use</span> crate::{
    db::Db,
    sql::ast::{<span>self</span>, SelectFrom},
};

<span>use</span> super::operator::{Operator, SeqScan};

<span>pub</span> <span><span>struct</span> <span>Planner</span></span>&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; {
    db: &amp;<span>'d</span> Db,
}

<span>impl</span>&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; Planner&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; {
    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>new</span></span>(db: &amp;<span>'d</span> Db) -&gt; <span>Self</span> {
        <span>Self</span> { db }
    }

    <span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>compile</span></span>(<span>self</span>, statement: &amp;ast::Statement) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Operator&gt; {
        <span>match</span> statement {
            ast::Statement::Select(s) =&gt; <span>self</span>.compile_select(s),
            stmt =&gt; bail!(<span>"unsupported statement: {stmt:?}"</span>),
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Planner</code> struct is initialized with a reference to the database and
provides a <code>compile</code> method that takes a parsed SQL statement and returns
the corresponding <code>Operator</code>.
The <code>compile</code> method dispatches to a specific method for each type of SQL statement.</p>
<p>Let's see how to build an <code>Operator</code> for a <code>SELECT</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>// src/engine/plan.rs</span>

<span>impl</span>&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; Planner&lt;<span>'d</span>&gt; {
    <span>// [...] </span>

    <span><span>fn</span> <span>compile_select</span></span>(<span>self</span>, select: &amp;ast::SelectStatement) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;Operator&gt; {
        <span>let</span> SelectFrom::Table(table_name) = &amp;select.core.from;

        <span>let</span> table = <span>self</span>
            .db
            .tables_metadata
            .iter()
            .find(|m| &amp;m.name == table_name)
            .with_context(|| <span>format!</span>(<span>"invalid table name: {table_name}"</span>))?;

        <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> columns = <span>Vec</span>::new();

        <span>for</span> res_col <span>in</span> &amp;select.core.result_columns {
            <span>match</span> res_col {
                ast::ResultColumn::Star =&gt; {
                    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>0</span>..table.columns.len() {
                        columns.push(i);
                    }
                }
                ast::ResultColumn::Expr(e) =&gt; {
                    <span>let</span> ast::Expr::Column(col) = &amp;e.expr;
                    <span>let</span> (index, _) = table
                        .columns
                        .iter()
                        .enumerate()
                        .find(|(_, c)| c.name == col.name)
                        .with_context(|| <span>format!</span>(<span>"invalid column name: {}"</span>, col.name))?;
                    columns.push(index);
                }
            }
        }

        <span>Ok</span>(Operator::SeqScan(SeqScan::new(
            columns,
            <span>self</span>.db.scanner(table.first_page),
        )))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>First, we find a table metadata entry that matches the table name in the <code>SELECT</code>
statement. Then we iterate over the statement's result columns and build a list of
field indices to read from each record, either by expanding <code>*</code> to all columns or
by looking up the column name in the table metadata.</p>
<p>Finally, we create a <code>SeqScan</code> operator that will scan the entire tabl and yield
the selected fields for each row.</p>
<h2 id="heading-query-evaluation-in-the-repl">Query evaluation in the REPL</h2>
<p>It's time to put our query evaluator to the test!
We'll create a simple function that reads a raw SQL query and evaluates it:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>// src/main.rs</span>

<span>// [...]</span>

<span><span>fn</span> <span>eval_query</span></span>(db: &amp;db::Db, query: &amp;<span>str</span>) -&gt; anyhow::<span>Result</span>&lt;()&gt; {
    <span>let</span> parsed_query = sql::parse_statement(query, <span>false</span>)?;
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> op = engine::plan::Planner::new(db).compile(&amp;parsed_query)?;

    <span>while</span> <span>let</span> <span>Some</span>(values) = op.next_row()? {
        <span>let</span> formated = values
            .iter()
            .map(<span>ToString</span>::to_string)
            .collect::&lt;<span>Vec</span>&lt;_&gt;&gt;()
            .join(<span>"|"</span>);

        <span>println!</span>(<span>"{formated}"</span>);
    }

    <span>Ok</span>(())
}
</code></pre>
<p>This function creates a pipeline: it parses the SQL query, builds an
<code>Operator</code> with our Planner, and then repeatedly calls next_row() on the resulting operator
to retrieve and display each row of the result.</p>
<p>The final step is to use this function in the REPL loop:</p>
<pre><code>// src/main.rs

// [...]

 fn cli(mut db: db::Db) -&gt; anyhow::Result&lt;()&gt; {
     print_flushed("rqlite&gt; ")?;

     let mut line_buffer = String::new();

     while stdin().lock().read_line(&amp;mut line_buffer).is_ok() {
         match line_buffer.trim() {
             ".exit" =&gt; break,
             ".tables" =&gt; display_tables(&amp;mut db)?,
<span>+            stmt =&gt; eval_query(&amp;db, stmt)?, </span>
<span>-            stmt =&gt; match sql::parse_statement(stmt, true) {</span>
<span>-                Ok(stmt) =&gt; {</span>
<span>-                    println!("{:?}", stmt);</span>
<span>-                }</span>
<span>-                Err(e) =&gt; {</span>
<span>-                    println!("Error: {}", e);</span>
<span>-                }</span>
<span>-            },</span>
         }

         print_flushed("\nrqlite&gt; ")?;

         line_buffer.clear();
     }

     Ok(())
 }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can run the REPL and evaluate some simple <code>SELECT</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run -- queries_test.db
rqlite&gt; select * from table1;
</code></pre>
<p>If everything went well, you should see the following output:</p>
<pre><code>1|11
2|12
3|13
</code></pre>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our small database engine is starting to take shape! We can now parse and evaluate
simple <code>SELECT</code> queries. But there's still a lot to cover before we can call it
a fully functional database engine.
In the next posts, we'll discover how to filter rows, read indexes, and implement
sorting and grouping. </p>

On a recent afternoon, however, the talk among the moms and dads as we kept half an eye on a hotly contested game of four-square swerved to a somewhat unusual topic—eggs.</p><div><p>Where was the best place to find them? Which brands were available? Were any stores completely out? Parents rattled off reports of what they had seen at various places, from the big box outlets to the local food co-op, from high-end Whole Foods to discounters like Grocery Outlet and WinCo. “And,” someone sighed, “Can you believe the prices?”&nbsp;I listened and nodded, secure in the knowledge that I had six fresh eggs, straight from the backyard, on my kitchen counter.</p><p>“When a few chickens get sick in a facility that has millions of other chickens, the whole flock gets wiped out. As a nation, we have too many eggs in one industrialized basket.”</p><p>Eggs are suddenly a conversation starter as the latest wave of highly pathogenic avian flu clobbers U.S. poultry farmers in the worst outbreak of the virus since 2022. In December, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf"><u>some 13.2 million laying hens</u> </a>either succumbed to the disease or were culled as a result of the flu, dominated by the H5N1 subtype. In the first six weeks of this year, <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/mnreports/ams_3725.pdf">23.5 million</a> have already died. Altogether, <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks">more than 159 million poultry livestock</a> in the U.S. have died due to the virus over the last three years.</p><p>So far, the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html">risks to humans remains low</a>. However, public health experts worry that the Center for Disease Control’s ability to release updates on the virus might be compromised. The agency recently found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7404a2.htm?s_cid=mm7404a2_w">the virus may be spreading undetected</a> in cows and in veterinarians who treat them—but that<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/13/cdc-bird-flu-spread/"><u> </u>study was omitted</a> from an agency report released this month, after the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.z7pm10i/full/actinghhssecretarymemoaction2212025-1737591296147.pdf">pause</a> on federal health-agency communications.</p><p>Meanwhile, in a repeat of the 2022 outbreak, the virus has once again led to a sharp price spike and sent restaurants and<a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/florida/florida-publix-stores-suffer-from-egg-shortages-due-to-bird-flu-outbreak/"> shoppers scrambling</a> for eggs. Social media is awash with reports of<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/donmoyn.bsky.social/post/3lhab4fstho2m"> bare grocery-store shelves</a>.

The wholesale price restaurants pay is even higher, recently topping<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/egg-shortages-now-hitting-restaurants-130000854.html"> $7 a dozen</a>.

Most people first heard the term “avian flu” back in 1997, when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html">a </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html">spillover event </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/avian-timeline/1960-1999.html">in Hong Kong</a> led to six human deaths.&nbsp;Since then, human cases have been exceedingly, thankfully rare. But in the intervening decades the once-novel virus has become widespread among wild fowl. It has jumped to other animals, including domesticated cows and wild marine mammals like seals and sea lions. And it has infected humans, though the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/inhumans.html">risk to the public is minimal,</a>&nbsp;at least for now.</p><div><p>The virus can spread by direct contact, as well as through the air, which makes it highly contagious. Biologists estimate that in recent years<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240425-how-dangerous-is-bird-flu-spread-to-wildlife-and-humans"> millions of wild birds</a> have died from the virus. The disease has been especially hard on waterfowl like geese and ducks, though few bird species have been spared. Bird flu has caused<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/interactive/2024/bald-eagle-avian-flu-death/"> deaths of bald eagles</a>, especially chicks before they fledge. An outbreak among the <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/can-california-condors-survive-avian-flu">endangered California condors</a> has set back efforts to recover that species.</p><p>“What we do know is that the virus is now endemic in some wild birds, like wild ducks that move through our country,” says Carol Cardona, a professor of veterinary and biomedical sciences at University of Minnesota. “We know that is partially why we keep getting these seasonal outbreaks.”</p></div></section><section><div><p>Every year, tens of millions of migratory birds travel from the northern latitudes southward, and they inevitably cross paths with domesticated flocks. During a recent briefing for reporters, Maurice Pitesky, a cooperative extension agent at the University of California, Davis used California as an example.</p><p>“During the winter . . . we go from 600,000 resident waterfowl to over 8 million waterfowl. You will see ducks and geese. And we’ve decided to have our poultry and dairy operations overlap with where the wildfowl over-winter. They spatially overlap, and that is where infection can take place.”</p><p>After years of repeated bird flu outbreaks, most industrialized poultry operations have implemented sophisticated biosecurity protocols to try to keep their flocks safe. The birds spend the entirety of their lives indoors, quarantined from direct contact with wild fowl. No visitors are allowed on site, and at some facilities staff are even required to shower on the way in and the way out of the barns where the birds live.</p><p>So, how is it possible for the virus to get into a high-tech barn? Simple: the birds still need to breathe, which requires a ventilation system of some kind, which allows an entry point for the virus. Phillip Clauer, a professor emeritus of poultry science at Penn State, explains: “In the Midwest, they are working the fields in the fall, and you’ll see dust coming up from the fields, and the geese will land there to glean the extra corn, and they crap in the field. The dust goes aerosol, and that dust travels a long distance. We had one infected layer house in Pennsylvania, and they could tell you exactly what air vent the virus came in from. And then it spread through the whole flock.”</p><p>What does that mean for pasture-raised poultry, which spend most of their lives outdoors and therefore are at greater risk of contact with contagious wild birds? Farmers involved in smaller scale and regenerative poultry production insist that pastured birds are less susceptible to the virus, thanks to overall better health and wellbeing.</p><p>“In general, birds raised in high-welfare systems with access to pasture and sunlight are healthier and more resilient than birds raised in confinement,” says Tim Holmes, the director of compliance at<a href="https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/"> A Greener World</a>, which oversees the Certified Regenerative and Animal Welfare Approved labels. “In a pasture-based system, the key is having enough space and sunlight for the birds so that the pathogen load does not become too great. The ability [of] birds to forage and express natural behaviors also helps reduce stress, so the bird has a healthier immune system.”</p><p>I heard a similar argument when I paid a visit to David Whittaker at<a href="https://www.oakmeadowsfarmllc.com/"> Oak Meadows Farm</a>, a pasture-raised poultry and hog operation near where I live in Whatcom County, WA. Whittaker maintains his own biosecurity protocols—he wouldn’t let me enter the barn where about 100 chickens of his breeder flock were clucking around—but his chickens spend most of their lives freely roaming outside, with an epic view of glacier-capped Mount Baker.</p><p>Whittaker raises about 6,000 broiler chickens annually on 10 acres, and he has flocks on pasture well into October and November, when tens of thousands of snow geese, trumpeter swans, tundra swans, and ducks of all kinds fly overhead. In the 10 years since he turned his childhood hobby into a commercial operation, he’s never had a bird infected by the virus. “The birds I raise are healthier; they’ve got more resistance to it,” Whittaker says.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250214-backyard-birds-David-Whittaker-and-his-breeding-flock-photo-by-Jason-Mark.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img decoding="async" src="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250214-backyard-birds-David-Whittaker-and-his-breeding-flock-photo-by-Jason-Mark.jpg" alt="David-Whittaker and his breeding flock."></a></p><p>David Whittaker and his breeding flock. (Photo credit: Jason Mark)</p></div><div><p>How come, exactly? “Just because I’m using high-quality feed, I’m not packing 100,000 or more into a building. They are out on pasture, eating grass.”</p><p>Clauer—who made a point to tell me that he has worked with both pastured operations and industrial players—was skeptical of the idea that pasture-raised birds might be less susceptible to the virus. “The more birds you have spread all over creation, the more opportunities you have to interface with wild waterfowl.”</p><p>He was also leery of the notion that smaller farms could meet the country’s demands for chicken breasts, turkey dinners, and egg scrambles. “You would need so many small flocks that you couldn’t produce enough eggs. You wouldn’t have enough people to collect the eggs.”</p></div></section><section><div><p>But Clauer didn’t dispute that the high concentrations of birds in industrial facilities (the biggest one he knows of is a 4-million-bird operation in Iowa) come with the risk of high mortality numbers, as well as greater chances of the virus mutating. “If you have a lot of animals, a lot more birds can become infected a lot more quickly. The bigger the flock, the bigger the concern.”</p><p>I have to wonder if some of the risk-reward calculus between industrial poultry farms and smaller, pasture-raised ones might start to change if—or <em>when</em>—bird flu becomes endemic in domesticated flocks. Especially now that the virus is going back and forth between cattle and birds, containment may no longer be an option. All the biosecurity measures in the world won’t stop geese from crapping in farm fields. It’s like wearing a hazmat suit to keep away the common cold.</p><p>If that’s so, then the way to create a more resilient—which is to say, a more <em>efficient</em>—food system would be to have more poultry farms like Whittaker’s. Of course, the economics of small-scale livestock farming are punishingly difficult and it would require a sweeping overhaul of the food system to get more locally raised eggs from pasture to market.</p><p>For that reason alone, we’re unlikely to see a flowering of more thousand-bird flocks any time soon. But there is another route to diversifying egg production from healthy, resilient birds: the kind of backyard flock like mine. “Basically, every couple of families [could have] enough hens to supply their friends and family,” Whittaker says. “Even if a small farm goes out, it wouldn’t matter. That would be the ultimate dream—pretty much everybody produc[ing] their own eggs, if they have the space to.”</p><h4><strong>Should You Raise Chickens?<br> </strong></h4></div><p>Far from being a problem, then, backyard birds offer something of a solution. And, perhaps unsurprisingly, this latest avian flu–driven price shock <a href="https://abc7.com/post/soaring-egg-prices-are-piquing-interest-backyard-chickens-amid-bird-flu-outbreak/15864215/">has reignited interest in backyard flocks</a>. Even if the virus were to disappear tomorrow, retail egg prices will be well above normal for another 12 to 18 months. It will take at least that long for commercial breeding flocks to recover. So this may be the good time to invest in a backyard flock.</p><div><p>If you’re serious about joining the estimated<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10812673/"> 13 percent of U.S. households that keep backyard chickens</a>, here are some things to keep in mind.</p><p>“Every couple of families [could have] enough hens to supply their friends and family. Even if a small farm goes out, it wouldn’t matter.”</p><p>Given all the news about bird flu, you’re no doubt wondering whether backyard poultry could put you or your household at serious risk. <em>At this point</em>, the answer is no. Most of the 67 human cases of bird flu in the United States have resulted from people catching the virus from dairy cattle, and most of them have been mild cases. The one human fatality from bird flu took place in Louisiana, where a woman apparently contracted it from dead chickens,<a href="https://apnews.com/article/bird-flu-death-louisiana-82e4d00876e62cb2b13bb621826c84f9"> but according to all reports</a> the person was elderly and in poor health.</p><p>The risk is low, but it isn’t zero, and contact with backyard chickens would put you at a higher exposure. There are, though, ways to mitigate the danger. Clauer says one of the most important strategies for keeping your backyard flock—and you—healthy is to keep them away from wild birds. This can be as simple as ensuring that their living space is secured from feathered visitors by, for example, putting a net above the coop and run.</p><p>Beyond that, you’d want to follow some basic biosecurity protocols (the<a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/avian-influenza-protect-birds-qa.pdf"> USDA</a> and<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/uc-davis-veterinarians-offer-tips-preventing-bird-flu-backyard-chickens"> UC Davis</a> have some good cheat sheets). Keep an extra pair of “coop boots” that you use only for going in and out of the poultry enclosure, so you’re not tracking poop into your house. Secure the birds’ food and water to keep out other critters, like rodents, that can carry disease. And always, always wash your hands after collecting eggs and feeding and watering your hens—an instruction so simple that even young children can follow it.</p><p>The next big question is: Are you ready to make the commitment of time and attention? Chickens require a level of care not dissimilar to any other animal companion. They need fresh water and food daily, plus regular cleanings of their coop and runs. They also—and this is harder than it sounds—need to be kept safe from predators.</p><p>If you’ve only ever cared for a house plant, you may want to think twice. That said, there are plenty of how-to guides to help you learn the basics, from the encyclopedic<a href="https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/the-small-scale-poultry-flock-revised-edition/?srsltid=AfmBOoo4FdhpoJ1X4OyOVdQoh_uRXF0gzUKQVWQa3foxXnFwLIeGUD-7"> <em>The Small-Scale Poultry Flock</em></a> to the more quick and dirty tips in<a href="https://www.powells.com/book/the-essential-urban-farmer-9780143118718?srsltid=AfmBOoqjcbPf0HOftnnZm1MrUki3kiJ0dVTkU8aJOC6Sa6fOcY6aJ1Iu"> <em>The Essential Urban Farmer</em></a>. Maurice Pitesky and his colleagues at U.C. Davis also have<a href="https://ucanr.edu/sites/poultry/type/backyard/"> a useful library of fact sheets</a>.</p><p>Next, you need to ensure that it’s legally permissible to keep poultry in your city, town, or county. Most areas allow backyard poultry raising, but you need to be aware of the idiosyncrasies of local ordinances. Some places have strict rules about setbacks from neighbors’ properties, and many others prohibit roosters (too noisy). You can find a useful guide to local poultry rules at<a href="https://www.backyardchickens.com/articles/categories/chicken-laws-ordinances.13/"> backyardchickens.com</a>. Also: Be sure to check in with your neighbors before hatching your plans, to avoid drama.</p></div></section><div><p>Finally, ask yourself if it’s financially worth it to you.<a href="https://www.lowes.com/pl/livestock-supplies/chicken-coops-rabbit-hutches/4294610501?cm_mmc=src-_-c-_-prd-_-sol-_-ggl-_-CRP_SRC_Non-Brand_SOL_Online_Patio_BROAD-_-pre%252520assembled%252520chicken%252520coop-_-0-_-0-_-0&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtYy9BhBcEiwANWQQL-gmT_0l-HwBrl_gLZ1HUl1_0dLPk_CaWR6kU5njr06RvYblTe3oWBoC5dUQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"> An off-the-shelf chicken coop</a> can easily cost $300—and well more if you go for a bespoke model. If you’re handy, you can build one yourself, but lumber ain’t cheap, and even a homemade coop will pinch your pocketbook. You’ll also need some waterers, and maybe even a heated model if, like me, you live in a place with icy winters. If you’re rearing day-old chicks (which run anywhere from $5 to $15 per bird or more), you’ll need a heat lamp system and the proper feeders. Keep in mind that if you do purchase day-old chicks this spring, you won’t get your first eggs for about 20 weeks.</p><p>In short, there’s no such thing as a free egg. If you’re launching a laying hen setup from scratch, the payoff horizon may be longer than you wish. But if bird flu does become a permanent challenge for the U.S. poultry industry, the investment will eventually be worth it. “That might not be a bad economic equation for the next two years,” Clauer figures.</p><p>I’ve kept chickens for a total of six years in two different states, and by now I’ve paid off my initial investments and ongoing feed costs. During the summer, we’re overflowing with eggs, and routinely give away a half dozen here and a dozen there to friends, family, and neighbors. The egg volume does decline in the winter, yet even without artificial light we manage to get one or two eggs a day up here at the 49th parallel.</p><p>But I would keep backyard chickens even if it were a break-even proposition. I don’t raise hens simply as a matter of grocery-bill savings. They provide me with a subjective, but very real, sense of abundance and security.</p><p>I keep a large home garden, big enough to produce well more than half of my family’s annual fruits and vegetables. But, being a flexitarian, I can’t live on kale alone. And even though I can’t live off kale frittatas alone either, by producing some of my own protein I cultivate a feeling of ecological resilience, knowing that I’m more insulated from the brittleness—and the injustices and the pollution—of industrialized agriculture.</p><p>My small flock represents one additional node in the food production network. Imagine many more nodes like that, hundreds of thousands of new backyard flocks, and you might come to see how every home-scale hen helps strengthen the food system.</p><p>I’m convinced that even with all the cost and labor and time, such resilience and abundance is worth the price tag—is in fact, priceless.</p><p><em>An earlier edition of this article misspelled the name of Tim Holmes, the director of compliance at<a href="https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/"> A Greener World</a>.</em></p></div><div id="post-fundraising"><h3>You’d be a great Civil Eats member…</h3><p>Civil Eats is a reader-supported, nonprofit newsroom, and we count on our members to keep producing our award-winning work.</p><p><strong>Readers like you are the reason why we’re able to keep digging deep into stories you won’t find anywhere else.</strong> When you <a href="https://civileats.com/about/become-a-member/"><strong>become a member</strong></a>, your support directly funds our journalism—from paying our reporters to keeping the internet on in our remote offices across the United States.</p><p>Your membership will also come with great benefits, including our award-winning newsletter, The Deep Dish, which is full of relevant and timely reporting, access to our members’ Slack community, and online salons as a way to engage with reporters, food and agriculture experts, and each other.</p></div><div><p><a href="https://civileats.com/author/jmark/"><img data-del="avatar" src="https://civileats.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/JMark-150x150.jpg" height="96" width="96"></a></p><p>Jason Mark, a former urban farmer and the co-founder of San Francisco's Alemany Farm, is an environmental journalist based in Bellingham, WA.

The province is on track to have at least 1.6 gigawatts of data centers at any given moment from nearly nothing in 2019, making it the fastest-growing data center market in Southeast Asia, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://20189129.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/20189129/GLOBAL%20DATA%20CENTER%20INDEX_2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a report published in April</a></span>. </p>
    

<p>Data centers are large, windowless buildings filled with racks of computers that need lots of electricity.

<p>Over 95% of the energy available to Malaysia in 2022 was from fossil fuels, according to the International Energy Agency. The country is now fifth-largest exporter of liquefied natural gas globally. And with planned renewable projects, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.pmo.gov.my/2024/09/text-speech-by-prime-minister-keynote-address-invest-malaysia-iskandar-2024-where-policy-meets-progress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in September</a></span> that the country was “confident of a surplus of energy” to fuel large projects and keep exporting.</p><p>But Lau doesn’t fancy the chances of his homegrown business competing against the foreign-funded behemoths for energy. Even without data centers, Malaysia is susceptible to power interruptions because of storms, including one that lasted 30 minutes last year and killed 300,000 fish, costing Lau over $1 million. He worries that data centers would result in longer outages. </p><p>To survive, he is moving to Thailand and already scouting potential locations for a new fish farm. </p><p>“Big data center is coming and there is shortage of power,” he said. “It’ll be crazy.” </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><h2>Costs versus benefits</h2><p>Malaysia is betting that potential economic growth from data centers justifies the risk. Once touted as an Asian tiger on the cusp of becoming rich, its industries shrunk in the late 1990s after the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/thailand-business-international-news-asia-pacific-asia-e57892c505b34f7cb2a016db6b3bc148">Asian financial crisis</a></span>. It has since languished in the middle-income trap. Data centers, the government hopes, will modernize its economy and indirectly create thousands of high-paying jobs.</p><p>But experts worry that Malaysia, and others like Vietnam, Indonesia and India vying for billion-dollar investments from tech giants, may be overstating data centers’ transformative capabilities that also come at a price: Data centers gobble up land, water and electricity while creating far fewer jobs than they promise. Most data centers provide 30 to 50 permanent jobs while the larger ones create 200 jobs at most, according to a report by the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://goodjobsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/docs/pdf/datacenters.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American nonprofit Good Jobs First</a></span>. </p>
    

<p>Add to this the rapid increase in power and water use and some experts like Sofia Scasserra, who researches digital economies at the Amsterdam-based think tank Transnational Institute, said that tech companies exploiting resources in poorer countries while extracting data from their populations to get rich is akin to “digital colonialism.” She compared data extraction to silver mining in Bolivia, which enriched colonial Spain but left nothing behind for Latin America.</p><p>“They are extracting data in the same way. Data doesn’t even leave (behind) taxes,” she said. </p><p>Indeed, only a small portion of Malaysia’s data center capacity is actually for Malaysian users. Through a network of submarine cables that fans out into the world, they service East Asia, China and Europe. And the data centers themselves are run by foreign companies like America’s Equinix and Microsoft as well as Chinese competitor GDS Holdings that works with tech giants like Alibaba. </p><p>These data centers are also on the front lines of AI competition between the U.S. and China. Shortly before he left office, U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ai-artificial-intelligence-chips-computer-trade-4495b5b4a48e856dc612e7abe3e47d20">proposed new rules</a></span> that would limit exports of advanced AI chips made by U.S. companies like Nvidia, part of a strategy to deprive China and other U.S. adversaries from gaining access to AI technology through data centers in places likes Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Although it’s unclear if the Trump administration will retain the policy, which hasn’t yet taken effect, GDS Holdings saw its stock drop more than 18% on the day of the announcement. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

Data centers larger than 40 megawatt typically need land the size of seven football fields — about enough power for 36,000 American homes, according to data center service provider <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.streamdatacenters.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/SDC-Brief-Landowners-240112.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stream Data Centers</a></span>. </p><p>That’s costly to build in <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/data-centers-artificial-intelligence-technology-amazon-google-56b84cbb94942039754282afb076a87b">rich nations like the U.S.</a></span>, which over time has built more data centers than any other country but where land comes at a high price. Enter Malaysia, with its inexpensive land, excess power capacity and tax incentives. The country was the fastest growing data center market in Asia Pacific in the first half of 2024, according to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cushmanwakefield.com/en/singapore/news/2024/09/malaysia-the-fastest-growing-data-centre-market-in-asia-pacific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">global real estate firm Cushman and Wakefield.</a></span> This makes Malaysia the eighth-largest data center market in terms of operations and the fifth-largest behind China, India, Japan and Australia when accounting for projects already in the pipeline. </p>
    

<p>Globally Malaysia ranks 14th in terms of operational capacity — still smaller than Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin — but it is on track to be among the top 10 markets in five to seven years, according to Pritesh Swamy, who heads research on data centers in Asia for the real estate firm Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</p><p>“We are talking about a region that really grew at a pace that nowhere in the world has seen,” Salgame said.</p><div data-align-center="">

                </div><p>Next door to Malaysia is Singapore, which paused the construction of new data centers in 2019. The moratorium was over concerns that the energy-guzzling infrastructure was straining the tiny country’s limited resources. In 2019, data centers consumed 7% of the total electricity in the city-state that imports both power and water while aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. They have been trying to build data centers sustainably since 2022, when the moratorium ended. </p><p>In the meantime, Malaysia has stepped in to fill the void, attracting investments of over $31 billion — three times the investments for 2023 — in the first 10 months of 2024, according to <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.knightfrank.be/research/malaysia-data-centre-research-report-2024-11793.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research</a></span> by real estate firm Knight Frank. Johor already has 22 mostly foreign data centers spanning over 21 hectares, according to the research firm <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://baxtel.com/data-center/johor#sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baxtel</a></span>. That’s the equivalent of nearly 40 football fields, although not all of the data centers are operational. </p>
    

<h2>Concerns over power and water shortages</h2><p>The data centers that are running look anonymous from the outside. But they can be identified by the tell-tale signs of barbed wire fences, CCTV cameras and patrolling security guards. Elsewhere, a thicket of cranes and workers operating construction machinery is transforming the landscape in the sleepy province. </p><div data-align-fullwidth="">
