<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[!--><!----><article><!--[--><!--]--> <div><h2>uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade</h2> <p><!--[--><!--[!--><!--]--> <a href="https://emily.space/blog/programming">Programming</a><!--]--></p> <p>23 October 2025 | Reading time: 6 minutes</p></div> <p>It’s 2025. Does installing Python, managing virtual environments, and synchronizing dependencies between your colleagues really have to be so difficult? Well… no! A <strong>brilliant</strong> new tool called <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="nofollow">uv</a> came out recently that <strong>revolutionizes</strong> how easy installing and using Python can be.</p> <p>uv is a free, open-source tool built by Astral, a small startup that has been churning out Python tools (like the excellent linter <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/" rel="nofollow">Ruff</a>) for the past few years. uv can:</p> <ul><li>Install any Python version for you</li> <li>Install packages</li> <li>Manage virtual environments</li> <li>Solve dependency conflicts <em>extremely</em> quickly (<strong>very</strong> important for big projects.)</li></ul> <p>What’s best is that it can do all of the above <strong>better than any other tool</strong>, in my opinion. It’s <strong>shockingly fast</strong>, written in Rust, and works on almost any operating system or platform.</p> <h2>Installing uv</h2> <p>uv is <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation" rel="nofollow">straightforward to install</a>. There are a few ways, but the easiest (in my opinion) is this one-liner command — for Linux and Mac, it’s:</p> <pre><!----><code><span>curl</span> <span>-LsSf</span> https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh <span>|</span> <span>sh</span></code><!----></pre> <p>or on Windows in powershell:</p> <pre><!----><code>powershell <span>-ExecutionPolicy</span> ByPass <span>-c</span> <span>"irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"</span></code><!----></pre> <p>You can then access uv with the command <code>uv</code>. <strong>Installing uv will not mess up any of your existing Python installations</strong> — it’s a separate tool, so it’s safe to install it just to try it out.</p> <h2>Managing Python for a project</h2> <p>It’s always a good idea to work with <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41972261/what-is-a-virtualenv-and-why-should-i-use-one" rel="nofollow">virtual environments</a> for any Python project. It keeps different bits of code and dependencies ringfenced from one another, and in my experience, it can save <strong>a lot</strong> of hassle to get into the habit of using virtual environments as soon as you can. uv naturally uses virtual environments, so it’s very easy to start using them if you get into using uv.</p> <p>uv will build a Python environment for you based on what’s specified in a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in the directory (or parent directories) you’re working in. <code>pyproject.toml</code> files are a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62983756/what-is-pyproject-toml-file-for" rel="nofollow">standard, modern format</a> for specifying dependencies for a Python project. A barebones one might look a bit like this:</p> <pre><!----><code><span>[</span><span>project</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"my_project"</span>
<span>version</span> <span>=</span> <span>"1.0.0"</span>
<span>requires-python</span> <span>=</span> <span>"&gt;=3.9,&lt;3.13"</span>
<span>dependencies</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>"astropy&gt;=5.0.0"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"pandas&gt;=1.0.0,&lt;2.0"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span></code><!----></pre> <p>In essence, it just has to specify <strong>which Python version to use</strong> and <strong>some dependencies.</strong> Adding a name and version number also aren’t a bad idea.</p> <p>(Sidenote: for projects that you publish as packages, such as to the Python Package Index that pip and uv use, <code>pyproject.toml</code> files are a modern way to specify <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/" rel="nofollow">everything you need</a> to publish your package.)</p> <h2>Making a new project with uv</h2> <p>To start a new Python project with uv, you can run</p> <pre><!----><code>uv init</code><!----></pre> <p>Which will create a new project for you, with a <code>pyproject.toml</code>, a <code>README.md</code>, and other important bits of boilerplate.</p> <p>There are a lot of different ways to run this command, like <code>uv init --bare</code> (which only creates a pyproject.toml), <code>uv init --package</code> (which sets up a new Python package), and more. I recommend running <code>uv init --help</code> to read about them.</p> <h2>Once you have/if you already have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file</h2> <p>Once you initialize a project — or if you already have a <code>pyproject.toml</code> file in your project — it’s very easy to start using uv. You just need to do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv <span>sync</span></code><!----></pre> <p>in the directory that your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file is in. This command (and in fact, most uv commands if you haven’t ran it already) will:</p> <ol><li>Automatically install a valid version of Python</li> <li>Install all dependencies to a new virtual environment in the directory <code>.venv</code></li> <li>Create a <code>uv.lock</code> file in your directory, which saves the <strong>exact, platform-agnostic</strong> version of <strong>every</strong> package installed — meaning that other colleagues can replicate your Python environment exactly.</li></ol> <p>In principle, you can ‘activate’ this new virtual environment like any typical virtual environment that you may have seen in other tools, but the most ‘uv-onic’ way to use uv is simply to prepend any command with <code>uv run</code>. This command automatically picks up the correct virtual environment for you and runs your command with it. For instance, to run a script — instead of</p> <pre><!----><code><span>source</span> .venv/bin/activate
python myscript.py</code><!----></pre> <p>you can just do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv run myscript.py</code><!----></pre> <p>which will have the same effect. Likewise, to use a ‘tool’ like Jupyter Lab, you can just do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv run jupyter lab</code><!----></pre> <p>in your project’s directory, as opposed to first ‘activating’ the environment and then running <code>jupyter lab</code> separately.</p> <h2>Adding dependencies</h2> <p>You can always just edit your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file manually: uv will detect the changes and rebuild your project’s virtual environment. But uv also has easier ways to add dependencies — you can just do</p> <pre><!----><code>uv <span>add</span> numpy<span>&gt;=</span><span>2.0</span></code><!----></pre> <p>to add a package, including specifying version constraints (like the above.) This command automatically edits your <code>pyproject.toml</code> for you. <code>uv add</code> is also extremely powerful for adding remote dependencies from git or elsewhere on your computer (but I won’t get into that here.)</p> <h2>Pinning a Python version</h2> <p>Finally, I think that one of the most useful things uv can do is to pin a specific Python version for your project. Doing</p> <pre><!----><code>uv python pin <span>3.12</span>.9</code><!----></pre> <p>would pin the current project to <strong>exactly</strong> Python 3.12.9 for you, and anyone else using uv — meaning that you really can replicate the <strong>exact</strong> same Python install across multiple machines.</p> <h2>uvx: ignore all of the above and just run a tool, now!</h2> <p>But sometimes, you might just want to run a tool quickly — like using Ruff to lint code somewhere, or starting a Jupyter notebook server without an environment, or even just quickly starting an IPython session with pandas installed so you can open up a file. The <code>uv tool</code> command, which has a short alias <code>uvx</code>, makes this insanely easy. Running a command like</p> <pre><!----><code>uvx ruff</code><!----></pre> <p>will automatically download the tool you want to use and run it in a one-off virtual environment. Once the tool has been downloaded before, this is lightning-fast because of how uv uses caches.</p> <p>There are a lot of occasions when I might want to do this — a common one might be to quickly start an IPython session with pandas installed (using <code>--with</code> to add dependencies) so that I can quickly open &amp; look at a parquet file. For instance:</p> <pre><!----><code>uvx <span>--with</span> pandas,pyarrow ipython</code><!----></pre> <p>Or, maybe just starting a Jupyter Lab server so that I can quickly open a Jupyter notebook that a student sent me:</p> <pre><!----><code>uvx jupyter lab</code><!----></pre> <p>Or honestly just so many other weird, one-off use cases where <code>uvx</code> is really nice to have around. <strong>I don’t feel like I’m missing out by always using virtual environments</strong>, because <code>uvx</code> always gives you a ‘get out of jail free’ card whenever you need it.</p> <h2>If that hasn’t sold you: a personal note</h2> <p>I first discovered uv last year, while working together with our other lovely developers on building <a href="https://astrosky.eco/" rel="nofollow">The Astrosky Ecosystem</a> — a wonderful project to build open-source social media integrations for astronomers online. But with multiple developers all working asynchronously on multiple operating systems, managing Python installations quickly became a huge task.</p> <p>uv is an <strong>incredibly powerful simplification</strong> for us that we use across our entire tech stack. As developers, we can all work with identical Python installations, which is especially important given a number of semi-experimental dependencies that we use that have breaking changes with every version. On GitHub Actions, we’re planning to use uv to quickly build a Python environment and run our unit tests. In production, uv already manages Python for all of our servers.</p> <p>It’s just <em>so nice</em> to always know that Python and package installation will <strong>always</strong> be handled <strong>consistently and correctly</strong> across all of our machines. <strong>That’s why uv is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade.</strong></p> <h2>Find out more</h2> <p>There’s a lot more on <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/" rel="nofollow">the uv docs</a>, including a <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/" rel="nofollow">getting started page</a>, more <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/" rel="nofollow">in-depth guides</a>, <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/" rel="nofollow">explanations of important concepts</a>, and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/" rel="nofollow">a full command reference</a>.</p><!----></article><!----><!--]--><!----></div></div>]]></description>

<p>“You don’t got no ID?” a Border Patrol agent in a baseball cap, sunglasses, and neck gaiter asks a kid on a bike. The officer and three others had just stopped the two young men on their bikes during the day in what a video documenting the incident says is Chicago. One of the boys is filming the encounter on his phone. He says in the video he was born here, meaning he would be an American citizen.</p><p>When the boy says he doesn’t have ID on him, the Border Patrol officer has an alternative. He calls over to one of the other officers, “can you do facial?” The second officer then approaches the boy, gets him to turn around to face the sun, and points his own phone camera directly at him, hovering it over the boy’s face for a couple seconds. The officer then looks at his phone’s screen and asks for the boy to verify his name.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>Today we’re excited to announce public availability of Tailscale Peer Relays, a traffic relaying alternative to Tailscale’s managed DERP servers that can be enabled on any Tailscale node.</span></p><div><p>Tailscale Peer Relays provides a customer-deployed and managed traffic relaying mechanism. By advertising itself as a peer relay, a Tailscale node can relay traffic for any peer nodes on the tailnet, even for traffic bound to itself. Tailscale Peer Relays can only relay traffic for nodes on your tailnet, and only for nodes that have access to the peer relay. Because they’re managed entirely by the customer, peer relays are less throughput-constrained than Tailscale’s managed DERP relays, and can provide higher throughput connections for traffic to and from locked-down cloud infrastructure, or behind strict network firewalls.</p><p>In testing with early design partners, we’ve seen throughputs nearing that of a direct connection; often multiple orders of magnitude higher than Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet.</p><h2 id="moving-past-hard-nat"><a href="#moving-past-hard-nat">Moving past hard NAT<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Over the past few weeks, you’ve heard us talk about <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/nat-traversal-improvements-pt-1">improvements we’ve made to</a> Network Address Translation (NAT) traversal techniques, so that Tailscale can establish direct connections wherever possible (<em>hint: it’s over 90% of the time</em>). However, we’ve also outlined places where this isn’t possible or desirable today for a variety of reasons, <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/nat-traversal-improvements-pt-2-cloud-environments">especially in cloud environments</a>. And, we’ve postulated a bit about <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/blog/nat-traversal-improvements-pt3-looking-ahead">where we think the industry is going</a>.</p><p>While we’ve been keeping your network reliably connected for years with <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers">DERP</a>, we’ve heard from customers that the throughput and performance aspects of a QoS-aware managed relay fleet makes deployments in certain environments difficult or untenable. Furthermore, customers have noted that it’s non-trivial to deploy and manage <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1232/derp-servers#custom-derp-servers">custom DERP fleets</a> (which run as a separate service and binary).</p><p>DERP provides an incredibly valuable service, setting up reliable connections between Tailscale clients anywhere in the world (including negotiating connections through peer relays). But often, DERP’s focus as a reliability and NAT traversal tool results in performance tradeoffs.</p><p>By contrast, Tailscale Peer Relays is designed as a performant connectivity tool, and can perform at a level rivaling direct connections. Peer relays can be placed right next to the resources they serve, and peer relays also run on top of UDP, both characteristics beneficial to lower latency and resource overhead. And, they are built into the Tailscale client itself for ease of deployment.</p><p>We want to move past even more hard NATs, and put Tailscale’s relaying technology in our customers’ hands, so they can use Tailscale at scale, anywhere, with ease. We believe our new Tailscale Peer Relays connectivity option—unique to Tailscale—gives customers the best performance and flexibility.</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Peer relays are configured with a single UDP port that must be available to both sides of a connection. Tailscale Peer Relays is built right into the Tailscale client, and can be enabled with a simple command, using the <code>tailscale set --relay-server-port</code> flag from the Tailscale CLI. Once enabled via <a target="" rel="noreferrer" href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1591/peer-relays?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=fall-update-2025">the steps in our documentation</a>, clients can connect to infrastructure in hard NAT environments over the peer relay.</p><p><strong>And don’t worry, we still prefer to fly direct.</strong> Tailscale prefers direct connections wherever possible. Clients can then fall back to available peer relays, and finally leverage Tailscale’s managed DERP fleet, or any customer-deployed custom DERPs, to ensure you have connectivity wherever you need it. All of this traffic, over any connection, is still end-to-end encrypted via WireGuard®.</p><p>Tailscale Peer Relays is designed for the real world, based on the feedback we’ve received from customers and our own hard-earned networking expertise. It allows customers to make just one firewall exception for connections only coming from their tailnet. Peer relays scale across regions, are resilient to real-world network conditions, and graciously fall back to DERP (Tailscale’s or custom). Your network maintains its shape, but gains all kinds of flexibility.</p><h2 id="connectivity-everywhere-at-warp-speed"><a href="#connectivity-everywhere-at-warp-speed">Connectivity, everywhere, at warp speed<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M15 7h3a5 5 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 0 0 1-5 5h-3m-6 0H6a5 5 0 0 1-5-5 5 5 0 0 1 5-5h3"></path><line x1="8" y1="12" x2="16" y2="12"></line></svg></a></h2><p>Customers can now maintain performance benchmarks even where direct connections aren’t possible, by enabling Tailscale Peer Relays to build a deterministic and high-throughput relay topology.</p><figure id=""><img _type="asset" video="[object Object]" alt="Green checked background.

<div><p>I especially like how Nadella speaks of layoffs as some kind of uncontrollable natural disaster, like a hurricane, caused by no-one in particular. A kind of "God works in mysterious ways".</p><pre><code>    &gt; “Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,” Nadella wrote. “And yet, at the same time, we’ve undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.”
     
    &gt; Nadella explained the disconnect between thriving financials and layoffs by stating that “progress isn’t linear” and that it is “sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.”
</code></pre><p>
I've read the whole memo and it's actually worse than those excerpts. Nadella doesn't even claim these were low performers:</p><pre><code>    &gt; These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we’ve worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-sanity="id=a852e721-560c-440e-be81-44a95e28da2d;type=post;path=content;base=%2F"><p>Composer is our new agent model designed for software engineering intelligence and speed. On our benchmarks, the model achieves frontier coding results with generation speed four times faster than similar models.</p><p>We achieve these results by training the model to complete real-world software engineering challenges in large codebases. During training, Composer is given access to a set of production search and editing tools and tasked with efficiently solving a diverse range of difficult problems. The final result is a large-scale model optimized for high-speed use as an agent in Cursor.</p><figure></figure><p>Our motivation comes from our experience developing Cursor Tab, our custom completion model. We found that often developers want the smartest model that can support interactive use, keeping them in the flow of coding. In our development process, we experimented with a prototype agent model, codenamed Cheetah, to better understand the impact of faster agent models. Composer is a smarter version of this model that keeps coding delightful by being fast enough for an interactive experience.</p><p>Composer is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) language model supporting long-context generation and understanding. It is specialized for software engineering through reinforcement learning (RL) in a diverse range of development environments. At each iteration of training, the model is given a problem description and instructed to produce the best response, be it a code edit, a plan, or an informative answer. The model has access to simple tools, like reading and editing files, and also more powerful ones like terminal commands and codebase-wide semantic search.</p><p>To measure progress, we constructed an evaluation that measures a model's usefulness to a software developer as faithfully as possible. Our benchmark, Cursor Bench, consists of real agent requests from engineers and researchers at Cursor, along with hand-curated optimal solutions to these requests. The resulting evaluation measures not just the agent’s correctness, but also its adherence to a codebase's existing abstractions and software engineering practices.</p><figure></figure><p>Reinforcement learning allows us to actively specialize the model for effective software engineering. Since response speed is a critical component for interactive development, we incentivize the model to make efficient choices in tool use and to maximize parallelism whenever possible. In addition, we train the model to be a helpful assistant by minimizing unnecessary responses and claims made without evidence. We also find that during RL, the model learns useful behaviors on its own like performing complex searches, fixing linter errors, and writing and executing unit tests.</p><figure></figure><p>Efficient training of large MoE models requires significant investment into building infrastructure and systems research. We built custom training infrastructure leveraging PyTorch and Ray to power asynchronous reinforcement learning at scale. We natively train our models at low precision by combining our <a href="https://cursor.com/blog/kernels">MXFP8 MoE kernels</a> with expert parallelism and hybrid sharded data parallelism, allowing us to scale training to thousands of NVIDIA GPUs with minimal communication cost. Additionally, training with MXFP8 allows us to deliver faster inference speeds without requiring post-training quantization.</p><p>During RL, we want our model to be able to call any tool in the Cursor Agent harness. These tools allow editing code, using semantic search, grepping strings, and running terminal commands. At our scale, teaching the model to effectively call these tools requires running hundreds of thousands of concurrent sandboxed coding environments in the cloud. To support this workload, we adapted existing infrastructure we built for Background Agents, rewriting our virtual machine scheduler to support the bursty nature and scale of training runs. This enabled seamless unification of RL environments with production environments.</p><p>Cursor builds tools for software engineering, and we make heavy use of the tools we develop. A motivation of Composer development has been developing an agent we would reach for in our own work. In recent weeks, we have found that many of our colleagues were using Composer for their day-to-day software development. With this release, we hope that you also find it to be a valuable tool.</p><p>—</p><p><em>¹ Benchmarked on an internal benchmark in the Cursor tool harness. We group models into classes based on score and report the best model in each class. "Fast Frontier" includes models designed for efficient inference such as Haiku 4.5 and Gemini Flash 2.5. "Best Open" includes recent open weight model releases such as Qwen Coder and GLM 4.6. "Frontier 7/2025" is the best model available in July of this year.  "Best Frontier" includes GPT-5 and Sonnet 4.5, which both outperform Composer. For the Tokens per Second calculation, tokens are standardized across models to the latest Anthropic tokenizer.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>For some reason an Azure outage does not faze me in the same way that an AWS outage does.</p><p>I have never had much confidence in Azure as a cloud provider. The vertical integration of all the things for a Microsoft shop was initially <i>very</i> compelling. I was ready to fight that battle. But, this fantasy was quickly ruined by poor execution on Microsoft's part. They were able to convince me to move back to AWS by simply making it difficult to provision compute resources. Their quota system &amp; availability issues are a nightmare to deal with compared to EC2.</p><p>At this point I'd rather use GCP over Azure and I have zero seconds of experience with it. The number of things Microsoft gets right in 2025 can be counted single-handedly.

<div><p>Unless you pay for CloudFlare’s Enterpise plan, you’re required to have them host your DNS zone, you can use a different registrar as long as you just point your NS records to Cloudflare.</p><p>Be aware that if you’re using Azure as your registrar, it’s (probably still) impossible to change your NS records to point to CloudFlare’s DNS server, at least it was for me about 6 months ago.</p><p>This also makes it impossible to transfer your domain to them either, as CloudFlare’s domain transfer flow requires you set your NS records to point to them before their interface shows a transfer option.</p><p>In our case we had to transfer to a different registrar, we used Namecheap.</p><p>However, transferring a domain from Azure was also a nightmare. Their UI doesn’t have any kind of transfer option, I eventually found an obscure document (not on their Learn website) which had an az command which would let you get a transfer code which I could give to Namecheap.</p><p>Then I had to wait over a week for the transfer timeout to occur because there is no way on Azure side that I could find to accept the transfer immediately.</p><p>I found CloudFlare’s way of building rules quite easy to use, different from Front Door but I’m not doing anything more complex than some redirects and reverse proxying.</p><p>I will say that Cloudflare’s UI is super fast, with Front Door I always found it painfully slow when trying to do any kind of configuration.</p><p>Cloudflare also doesn’t have the problem that Front Door has where it requires a manual process every 6 months or so to renew the APEX certificate.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45750733"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="4"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="160"></td><td><center><a id="up_45750733" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45750733&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45748661"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I especially like how Nadella speaks of layoffs as some kind of uncontrollable natural disaster, like a hurricane, caused by no-one in particular. A kind of "God works in mysterious ways".</p><pre><code>    &gt; “Microsoft is being recognized and rewarded at levels never seen before,” Nadella wrote. “And yet, at the same time, we’ve undergone layoffs. This is the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value.”
     
    &gt; Nadella explained the disconnect between thriving financials and layoffs by stating that “progress isn’t linear” and that it is “sometimes dissonant, and always demanding.”
</code></pre><p>
I've read the whole memo and it's actually worse than those excerpts. Nadella doesn't even claim these were low performers:</p><pre><code>    &gt; These decisions are among the most difficult we have to make. They affect people we’ve worked alongside, learned from, and shared countless moments with—our colleagues, teammates, and friends.
</code></pre><p>
Ok, so Microsoft is thriving, these were friends and people "we've learned from", but they must go because... uh... "progress isn't linear". Well, thanks Nadella! That explains so much!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45748662"><td></td></tr><tr id="45749769"><td></td></tr><tr id="45749835"><td></td></tr></tbody></div></div>]]></description>

<div><p>It's interesting that you bring that up because I was just thinking about this concept in an undeveloped form. Egregious salesmanship is to sell an inferior or poor product while bolstering the overall brand reputation. How could that even be possible? With lies. You're absolutely right, <i>the salesman</i> in our world is in his purest and most demonic form.</p><p>With Brand management specifically, they specialize in servicing an ornate roof on a house so as to distract from the rest of the house. The ornate roof can be seen from miles away, and so it is the greatest ad you can buy in terms of reach.</p><p>I <i>think</i> I was thinking about this because of all the AI startup ads I've been seeing on Youtube. You wouldn't ever know how unworthy their product is based on how much branding and marketing they do. But that is the dance they do, the managing of the delta between product quality and brand quality, the management being the logistics of <i>veiling</i> that delta (not actually closing it).</p><p>Taking down a brand means to be diligent and aggressive in exposing that delta. Seems like common sense, but I'd urge you to consider it as more a "classical" formalization of what it is and what needs to be done. There is a terrible phenomenon within the human experience that results in humans trying to lie to each other for money.</p><p>It's the classical Theory on Being a Piece of Shit.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45751247"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45751247" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45751247&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45748570"></a></center></td><td><br>

  <p>TLDR: Yes, you can fit about 7 seconds of audio into 16K of flash and still have room for code. And you can even play LPC encoded audio on a 10 cent MCU.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s quite a lot more detail in this video (and of course you can hear the audio!).</p>

<lite-youtube videoid="RZvX95aXSdM" playlabel="Talking 10 Cent MCU"></lite-youtube>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.atomic14.com/2025/10/12/CH32V003-music">previous project</a>, I had this ultra-cheap CH32V003 microcontroller playing simple tunes on a tiny SMD buzzer. It was just toggling a GPIO pin at musical note frequencies – 1-bit audio output – and it sounded surprisingly decent. That was a fun start, but now it’s time to push this little $0.10 MCU even further: can we make it actually talk?</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/ic.webp" alt="CH32V003"></p>

<p>Spoiler: Yes, we can! (well, there wouldn’t be much of a blog post if we couldn’t) This 8-pin RISC-V chip is now producing sampled audio data and spoken words. We’re really stretching the limits of what you can fit in 16 KB of flash.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/16k.webp" alt="16K Flash, 2K RAM"></p>

<h2 id="from-beeps-to-actual-audio">From Beeps to Actual Audio</h2>

<p>Moving from simple beeps to real audio meant using the microcontroller’s PWM output as a rudimentary DAC. Instead of just on/off beeping, I’m driving a waveform at an 8 kHz sample rate using a high-frequency PWM on the output pin. The hardware is the same tiny board as before
 – but I’ve swapped the small SMD buzzer for a small speaker. The buzer works too, but it’s quieter and very tinny.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/speaker.webp" alt="New Speaker"></p>

<p>The sample I wanted to test with is just over 6 seconds in length - it’s the iconic “Open the pod bay doors HAL…” sequence from 2001.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/pod-bay-doors.webp" alt="Open the pod bay doors"></p>

<p>If we keep this audio at 16-bit PCM, 8kHZ, we’d need about 96KB – way beyond our 16 KB flash! And remember, that 16 KB has to hold both the audio data and our playback code. Clearly some aggressive compression is required.</p>

<p>I considered a few encoding options for compressing the audio.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8-bit PCM:</strong> Simply using 8-bit samples at 8 kHz cuts size in half (to ~47 KB for 6s), but that’s still about 3× too large for our flash.</li>
  <li><strong>4-bit ADPCM:</strong> Adaptive Differential PCM is a simple lossy compression that could quarter the size. In theory 6 seconds would be ~24 KB – much closer to fitting,</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://qoaformat.org/">“Quite OK Audio” (QOA)</a>:</strong> This is nice codec that packs audio into about 3.2 bits per sample (roughly 1/5 the size of 16-bit PCM)</li>
  <li><strong>2-bit ADPCM:</strong> Going even further with ADPCM, using only 2 bits per sample gives a 4:1 compression relative to 8-bit audio – that’s 75% storage savings.</li>
</ul>

<p>2-bit ADPCM is definitely the winner here. Our 6-second clip shrinks to under 12 KB, which comfortably fits in flash with room for code. This looked like the winner, provided the audio quality was acceptable. The decoder for 2-bit ADPCM is also very lightweight (my implementation compiled to under just over 1K of code - 1340 bytes!). It’s definitely low quality - but it actually sounds surprisingly ok.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-2-bit-adpcm-work">How does 2-bit ADPCM work?</h2>

<p>It’s actually a very simple algorithm. Both the encoder and decoder maintain a predicted signal value and a step size index into a predefined table. Each 2-bit code tells the decoder how to adjust the current prediction and the step size index. In essence, we’re coding the difference between the real audio and our prediction, with only four possible levels (since 2 bits gives 4 values). After each sample, the algorithm adapts: if the prediction error was large, we move to a bigger step size (to allow larger changes); if the error was small, we use a smaller step size for finer resolution. This adaptive step is what makes it ADPCM (Adaptive Differential PCM).</p>

<p>Our codes are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>00</code> (0): Go down by 1 step - subtract the step size from our current prediction</li>
  <li><code>01</code> (1): Go up by 1 step - add the step size to our current prediction</li>
  <li><code>10</code> (2): Go down by 2 steps - subtract the 2 x step size from our current prediction</li>
  <li><code>11</code> (3): Go up by 2 steps - add the 2 x step size to our current prediction</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/audio.webp" alt="2-bit ADPCM Compression"></p>

<p>Even with this very high level of compression, the predicted waveform manages to track the original audio surprisingly well. The above graph shows a small snippet of the audio: the blue line is the original waveform and the yellow line is the ADPCM decoder’s output.</p>

<p>They’re not identical (and we wouldn’t expect them to be), but the general shape is preserved. When you play it back through the little speaker, it’s recognizable and surprisingly good.</p>

<p>To make my life easier, I built a quick conversion <a href="https://buzzer-studio.atomic14.com/">tool</a> to encode WAV files into this 2-bit ADPCM format. The tool lets me drag-and-drop a WAV, and it gives you the files with the data that can ve dropped into the firmware code.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/buzzer-2-adpcm.webp" alt="2-bit ADPCM Buzzer Studio"></p>

<h2 id="lpc-speech-synthesis">LPC Speech Synthesis</h2>

<p>Six seconds of audio is cool, but what about longer phrases or even arbitrary speech? Storing anything much longer with raw or ADPCM audio would quickly fill the 16K of flash.</p>

<p>For my second experiment, I tried something different: instead of recorded waveform audio, I used an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments_LPC_Speech_Chips">old-school speech synthesis approach</a>. This leverages the fact that spoken language can be encoded very compactly by modeling the human voice, rather than storing the raw sound. Specifically, I integrated a library called <a href="https://github.com/going-digital/Talkie/tree/master/Talkie">Talkie</a>.</p>

<p>Talkie is a software implementation of the Texas Instruments LPC speech synthesis architecture from the late 1970s. This was implemented in a variety of chips, most commonly the TMS5220 and TMS5100 speech chips.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.atomic14.com/assets/article_images/2025-11-01/TMS_types.webp" alt="TMS5220 and TMS5100 Variants"></p>

<p>These were used in things like the original Speak &amp; Spell, arcade games like early Star Wars, and speech add-ons for home computers (e.g. the BBC Micro).</p>

<p>The Talkie library (originally by <a href="https://github.com/going-digital/Talkie/tree/master/Talkie">Peter Knight</a>, later added to by <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/bringing-back-the-voice-of-speak-spell/software">Adafruit</a>) comes with a big set of examples and vocabulary. It’s also possible to extract examples from old ROMs from arcade games.</p>

<p>Each phrase or word only takes a few hundred bytes or even less, so you can fit quite a lot of speech into a few kilobytes of flash. The trade-off is that the voice has a very computer-esque timbre – think of the Speak &amp; Spell’s voice. It’s clearly synthetic, but still understandable.</p>

<p>To say custom sentences not in the library, you either concatenate the available words/phonemes (which can be clunky), or you need to generate new LPC data. The original tools for this are a bit obscure – there’s BlueWizard (a classic Mac app) and PythonWizard (a command-line tool with TK GUI) which can analyze WAV files and produce LPC data.</p>

<p>I gave both a try with some success (and a few headaches setting them up). In the end, I cheated a bit and used an AI coding assistant to help me create a streamlined online tool for this.</p>

<p>The result is a little <a href="http://buzzer-studio.atomic14.com/">web app</a> where I can upload a recording of, say, my own voice, and it outputs the LPC data. It even lets me play back the synthesized voice in-browser to check it.</p>

<p>So there we have it – our 10¢ microcontroller now has a voice! By using 2-bit ADPCM compression, we can store short audio clips (up to around 8 seconds) even in 16 KB of flash, and play them back via PWM with decent fidelity.</p>

<p>And with the Talkie LPC speech synthesis, we can make the device “speak” lots of words and phrases with only a tiny memory footprint.</p>

<p>If you want to hear it for yourself, check out the video demo linked at the top of this post. In the video, you’ll see (and hear) the WarGames clip and the Star Wars quotes running on the hardware. It’s honestly amazing what these cheap little MCUs can do. We’re really pushing the boundaries of cheap hardware here.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I feel like the tech world lives in two camps.</p>
<ol>
<li>One camp chases buzzwords.</li>
</ol>
<p>This camp tends to adopt whatever’s popular without thinking hard about whether it’s appropriate. They tend to fall for all the purported benefits the sales pitch gives them - real-time, infinitely scale, cutting-edge, cloud-native, serverless, zero-trust, AI-powered, etc.</p>
<p>You see this everywhere in the Kafka world: Streaming Lakehouse™️, Kappa™️ Architecture, Streaming AI Agents<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is sometimes known as <em>resume-driven design</em>. Modern practices actively encourage this. Consultants push “innovative architectures” stuffed with vendor tech via “insight” reports<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. System design interviews expect you to design Google-scale architectures that are inevitably at a scale 100x higher than the company you’re interviewing for would ever need. Career progression rewards you for replatforming to the Hot New Stack™️, not for being resourceful.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The other camp chases common sense</li>
</ol>
<p>This camp is far more pragmatic. They strip away unnecessary complexity and steer clear of overengineered solutions. They reason from first principles before making technology choices. They resist marketing hype and approach vendor claims with healthy skepticism.</p>
<p>Historically, it has felt like Camp 1 definitively held the upper hand in sheer numbers and noise. Today, it feels like the pendulum may be beginning to swing back, at least a tiny bit. Two recent trends are on the side of Camp 2:</p>
<p>Trend 1 - the “<a href="https://topicpartition.io/Small-Data" data-slug="Small-Data">Small Data</a>” movement. People are realizing two things - their data isn’t that big and their computers are becoming big too. You can rent a <a href="https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/x1e.xlarge">128-core, 4 TB of RAM instance</a> from AWS. AMD just released 192-core CPUs this summer. That ought to be enough for anybody.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Trend 2 - the Postgres Renaissance. The space is seeing incredible growth and investment<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. In the last 2 years, the phrase <a href="https://github.com/Olshansk/postgres_for_everything">“Just Use Postgres (for everything)”</a> has gained a ton of popularity. The basic premise is that you shouldn’t complicate things with new tech when you don’t need to, and that Postgres alone solves most problems pretty well. Postgres competes with purpose-built solutions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elasticsearch (functionality supported by Postgres’ <code>tsvector</code>/<code>tsquery</code>)</li>
<li>MongoDB (<code>jsonb</code>)</li>
<li>Redis (<code>CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE</code>)</li>
<li>AI Vector Databases (<code>pgvector</code>, <code>pgai</code>)</li>
<li>Snowflake (<code>pg_mooncake</code>, <code>pg_duckdb</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>and… Kafka (this blog).</p>
<p>The claim isn’t that Postgres is functionally equivalent to any of these specialized systems. The claim is that it handles 80%+ of their use cases with 20% of the development effort. (Pareto Principle)</p>
<p>When you combine the two trends, the appeal becomes obvious. Postgres is a battle-tested, well-known system that is simple, scalable and reliable. Pair it with today’s powerful hardware and you quickly begin to realize that, more often than not, you do not need the state-of-the-art highly optimized and complex distributed system in order to handle your organization’s scale.</p>
<p><a href="https://bento.me/stanislavkozlovski">Despite being somebody who is biased towards Kafka</a>, I tend to agree. Kafka is similar to Postgres in that it’s stable, mature, battle-tested and boasts a strong community. It also scales a lot further. Despite that, I don’t think it’s the right choice for a lot of cases. Very often I see it get adopted where <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/1o7gbyg/controlling_llm_outputs_with_kafka_schema/">it doesn’t make sense</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A 500 KB/s workload should not use Kafka.</strong> There is a scalability cargo cult in tech that always wants to choose “the best possible” tech for a problem - but this misses the forest for the trees. The “best possible” solution frequently isn’t a technical question - it’s a practical one. Adriano makes an airtight case for why you should opt for <strong>simple tech</strong> in his <a href="https://adriano.fyi/posts/2023-09-24-choose-postgres-queue-technology">PG as Queue blog</a> (2023) that originally inspired me to write this.</p>
<p>Enough background. In this article, we will do three simple things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Benchmark how far Postgres can scale for pub/sub messaging - <a href="#pg-as-a-pubsub"># PG as a Pub/Sub</a></li>
<li>Benchmark how far Postgres can scale for queueing - <a href="#pg-as-a-queue"># PG as a Queue</a></li>
<li>Concisely touch upon when Postgres can be a fit for these use cases - <a href="#should-you-use-postgres"># Should You Use Postgres?</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I am not aiming for an exhaustive in-depth evaluation. Benchmarks are messy af. Rather, my goal is to publish some reasonable data points which can start a discussion.</p>

<h2 id="pg-as-a-pubsub">PG as a Pub/Sub</h2>
<p>There are dozens of blogs out there using Postgres as a <u>queue</u>, but interestingly enough I haven’t seen one use it as a pub-sub messaging system.</p>
<p>A quick distinction between the two because I often see them get confused:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Queues</strong> are meant for point-to-point communication. They’re widely used for asynchronous background jobs: worker apps (clients) process a task in the queue like sending an e-mail or pushing a notification. The event is consumed once and it’s done with. A message is immediately deleted (popped) off the queue once it’s consumed. Queues do not have strict ordering guarantees<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pub-sub</strong> messaging differs from the queue in that it is meant for one-to-many communication. This inherently means there is a large read fanout - more than one reader client is interested in any given message. Good pub-sub systems decouple readers from writers by storing data on disks. This allows them to not impose a max queue depth limit - something in-memory queues need to do in order to prevent them from going OOM.</p>
<p>There is also a general expectation that there is strict order - events should be read in the same order that they arrived in the system.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Postgres’ main competitor here is Kafka, which is the standard in pub-sub today. Various (mostly-proprietary) alternatives exist.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-13" id="user-content-fnref-13" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup></p>
<p>Kafka uses the Log data structure to hold messages. You’ll see my benchmark basically reconstructs a log from Postgres primitives.</p>
<p>Postgres doesn’t seem to have any popular libraries for pub-sub<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-27" id="user-content-fnref-27" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup> use cases, so I had to write my own. The Kafka-inspired workflow I opted for is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writers produce batches of messages per statement<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-20" id="user-content-fnref-20" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup> (<code>INSERT INTO</code>). Each transaction carries one batch insert and targets a single <code>topicpartition</code> table<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-14" id="user-content-fnref-14" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">11</a></sup></li>
<li>Each writer is sticky to one table, but in aggregate they produce to multiple tables.</li>
<li>Each message has a unique monotonically-increasing offset number. A specific row in a special <code>log_counter</code> table denotes the latest offset for a given <code>topicpartition</code> table.</li>
<li>Write transactions atomically update both the <code>topicpartition</code> data and the <code>log_counter</code> row. This ensures consistent offset tracking across concurrent writers.</li>
<li>Readers poll for new messages. They consume the <code>topicpartition</code> table(s) sequentially, starting from the lowest offset and progressively reading up.</li>
<li>Readers are split into consumer groups. Each group performs separate, independent reads and makes progress on the <code>topicpartition</code> tables.</li>
<li>Each group contains 1 reader per <code>topicpartition</code> table.</li>
<li>Readers store their progress in a <code>consumer_offsets</code> table, with a row for each <code>topicpartition,group</code> pair.</li>
<li>Each reader updates the latest processed offset (claiming the records), selects the records and processes them inside a single transaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>This ensures Kafka-like semantics - gapless, monotonically-increasing offsets and at-least-once/at-most-once processing. This test in particular uses at-least-once semantics, but neither choice should impact the benchmark results.</p>

<h4 id="reads">Reads</h4>
<p>The benchmark also runs <code>N</code> reader goroutines. Each reader is assigned a particular consumer group and partition. The group as a whole reads all partitions while each reader in the group reads only one partition at a time.</p>
<p>The reader loops, opens a transaction, optimistically claims <code>$BATCH_SIZE</code> records (by advancing the offset mark beyond them), selects them and processes the records.
If successful, it commits the transaction and through that advances the offset for the group.</p>
<p>It is a pull-based read (just like Kafka), rather than push-based. If the reader has no records to poll, it sleeps for a bit.</p>
<p>First it opens a transaction:</p>

<p>If you’re wondering <em>“why no <code>NOTIFY/LISTEN</code>?”</em> - my understanding of that feature is that it’s an optimization and cannot be fully relied upon, so polling is required either way<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-21" id="user-content-fnref-21" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">12</a></sup>.

</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>disk was at ~1200 writes/s with iostat claiming 46 MiB/s</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these are astonishing results! Throughput was not impacted at all. Latency increased but not extremely. Our p99 e2e latency 3x’d (60ms vs 185ms), but the p95 barely moved from 10.6ms to 12ms.</p>
<p>This shows that a simple 3-node Postgres cluster can pretty easily sustain what is a very common Kafka workload - 5 MB/s ingest and 25 MB/s egress. Not only that, but for a cheap cost too. Just $11,514 per year.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-26" id="user-content-fnref-26" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">16</a></sup></p>
<p>Typically, you’d expect Postgres to run more expensive than Kafka at a certain scale, simply because it wasn’t designed to be efficient for this use case.
Not here though. Running Kafka yourself would cost the same. Running the same workload through a Kafka vendor will cost you at least $50,000 a year. 🤯</p>
<p>By the way, in Kafka it’s customary to apply client-side compression on your data. If we assume your messages were 5 KB in size and your clients applied a pretty regular compression ratio of 4x<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-28" id="user-content-fnref-28" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">17</a></sup> - Postgres is actually handling 20 MB/s ingress and 100 MB/s egress.</p>
<h3 id="96-vcpu-single-node">96 vCPU Single Node</h3>
<p>Ok, let’s see how far Postgres will go.</p>
<p><small><em>The results are the average of three 2-minute tests.</em></small>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://instances.vantage.sh/aws/ec2/c7i.24xlarge">c7i.24xlarge</a> (96 vCPU, 192 GiB RAM) Postgres server instance /w 250GB io2 12,000 IOPS EBS volume</li>
<li>modified Postgres settings (<code>huge_pages</code> on, other settings scaled to match the machine);
<ul>
<li>still kept fsync &amp; synchronous_commit on for durability.</li>
<li><code>autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.05</code> set on the partition tables too (unclear if it has an effect)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>write throughput: <strong>238 MiB/s</strong></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>server kept at <strong>~10%</strong> CPU (basically idle);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bottleneck: The bottleneck was the write rate per partition. It seems like the test wasn’t able to write at a higher rate than 8 MiB/s (8k msg/s) per table with this design. I didn’t push further, but I do wonder now as I write this - how far would writes have scaled?</p>
<ul>
<li>Reads were trivial to scale. Adding more consumer groups was trivial - I tried with 10x fanout and still ran at low CPU. I didn’t include it because I didn’t feel the need to push to an unrealistic read-fanout extreme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>240 MiB/s ingress and 1.16 GiB/s egress are pretty good! The 96 vCPU machine was overkill for this test - it could have done a lot more, or we could have simply opted for a smaller machine. For what it’s worth, I do think it’s worth it to deploy a separate Kafka cluster at this scale. Kafka can save you a lot of money here because it can be more efficient in how it handles cross-zone network traffic with features like <a href="https://blog.2minutestreaming.com/p/diskless-kafka-topics-kip-1150">Diskless Kafka</a>.</p>
<h3 id="pub-sub-test-summary">Pub-Sub Test Summary</h3>
<p><small><em>The summarized table with the three test results can be found here <span>→</span> 👉 <a href="https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark/tree/main/results#pubsub-results">stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark</a></em></small></p>
<p>These tests seem to show that Postgres is pretty competitive with Kafka at low scale.</p>
<p>You may have noticed none of these tests were particularly long-running. From my understanding, the value in longer-running tests is to test table vacuuming in Postgres, as that can have negative performance effects. In the pub-sub section, vacuuming doesn’t apply because the tables are append-only. My other reasoning for running shorter tests was to keep costs in check and not spend too much time<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-10" id="user-content-fnref-10" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">18</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In any case, no benchmark is perfect. My goal wasn’t to indisputably prove <code>$MY_CLAIM</code>. Rather, I want to start a discussion by showing that what’s possible is likely larger than what most people assume. I certainly didn’t assume I’d get such good numbers, especially with the pub-sub part.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="pg-as-a-queue">PG as a Queue</h2>
<p>In Postgres, a queue can be implemented with <code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>. This command selects an unlocked row and locks it. It also skips reading already-locked rows. That’s how mutual exclusion is achieved - a worker can’t get other workers’ jobs.</p>
<p>Postgres has a very popular <a href="https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq">pgmq</a> library that offers a slick queue API. To keep it simple and understand the end-to-end flow better, I decided to write my own queue. The basic version of it is very easy. My workflow is:</p>
<ol>
<li>add job (<code>INSERT</code>)</li>
<li>lock row &amp; take job (<code>SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED</code>)</li>
<li>process job (<code>{your business logic}</code>)</li>
<li>mark job as “done” (<code>UPDATE</code> a field or <code>DELETE &amp; INSERT</code> the row into a separate table)</li>
</ol>
<p>Postgres competes with RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, NATS, Redis<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">19</a></sup> and to an extent Kafka<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-8" id="user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">20</a></sup> here.</p>

</ul>
<p>What I found Postgres wasn’t good at was handling client count. The bottleneck in this setup was the read clients. Each client could not read more than ~192 messages a second because of its median read latency and sequential read nature.</p>
<p>Increasing client count boosted throughput but violated my ~60% CPU target. Trying to run 50 write and 50 read clients got to 4000 msg/s without increasing the queue depth but pegged the server’s CPU to 100%. I wanted to keep the benchmarks realistic for what you may run in production, rather than maxing out what a machine can do. This would be easily alleviated with a connection pooler (standard across all prod PG deployments) or a larger machine.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that the workload could sustain a lot more writes than reads. If I didn’t throttle the benchmark, it would write at 12,000 msg/s and read at 2,800 msg/s. In the spirit of simplicity, I didn’t debug further and instead throttled my writes to see at what point I could get a stable 1:1 workload.</p>

<p>This run wasn’t that impressive. There is some bottleneck in the single-table queue approach at this scale which I didn’t bother figuring out. I figured that it wasn’t important to reach absurd numbers on a single table, since all realistic scenarios would have multiple queues and never reach 20,000 msg/s on a single one. The 96 vCPU instance would likely scale far further were we to run a few separate queue tables in parallel.</p>

<p>Even a modest Postgres node can durably push thousands of queue ops/sec, which already covers the scale 99% of companies ever hit with a single queue.
As I said earlier, the last 2 years have seen the Just Use Postgres slogan become mainstream. The <code>pgmq</code> <a href="https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq">library</a>’s star history captures this trend perfectly:

<hr>
<h2 id="should-you-use-postgres">Should You Use Postgres?</h2>
<p>Most of the time - <strong>yes</strong>. You should always default to Postgres until the constraints prove you wrong.</p>
<p>Kafka is obviously better optimized for pub-sub workloads. Queue systems are obviously better optimized for queue workloads. The point is that <strong>picking a technology based on technical optimization alone is a flawed approach</strong>. To throw an analogy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a Formula One car is optimized to drive faster, but I still use a sedan to go to work. I am way more comfortable driving my sedan than an F1 car.</p>
<p><small><em>(seriously, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsup4xKpb20">the steering wheel</a> on these things)</em></small></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Postgres sedan comes with many quality-of-life comforts that the F1 Kafka does not:</p>
<ul>
<li>ability to debug messages with regular SQL</li>
<li>ability to delete, re-order or edit messages in place</li>
<li>ability to join pub-sub data with regular tables</li>
<li>ability to trivially read specific data via rich SQL queries (<code>ID=54</code>, <code>name="John"</code>, <code>cost&gt;1000</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving up these comforts is a justified sacrifice for your F1 car to go at 378 kmh (235 mph), but masochistic if you plan on driving at 25kmh (15 mph).</p>
<p>Donald Knuth warned us in 1974 - <strong>premature optimization</strong> is the root of all evil. Deploying Kafka at small scale is premature optimization.
The point of this article is to show you that this “small scale” number has grown further than what people remember it to be - it can comfortably mean many megabytes per second.</p>
<p>We are in a Postgres Renaissance for a reason: Postgres is <strong>frequently</strong> good enough. Modern NVMEs and cheap RAM allow it to scale absurdly high.</p>
<p>What’s the alternative?</p>
<h2 id="custom-solutions-for-everything">Custom Solutions for Everything?</h2>
<p>Naive engineers tend to adopt a specialized technology at the slightest hint of a need:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Need a cache?</em> Redis, of course!</li>
<li><em>Search?</em> Let’s deploy Elasticsearch!</li>
<li><em>Offline data analysis?</em> BigQuery or Snowflake - that’s what our data analysts used at their last job.</li>
<li><em>No schemas?</em> We need a NoSQL database like MongoDB.</li>
<li><em>Have to crunch some numbers on S3?</em> Let’s use Spark!</li>
</ul>
<p>A good engineer thinks through the bigger picture.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Does this new technology move the needle?</em></li>
<li><em>Is shaving a few milliseconds off our query worth the extra organizational complexity introduced with the change?</em></li>
<li><em>Will our users notice?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At small scale, these systems hurt you more than they benefit you. Distributed systems - both in terms of node count and system cardinality - should be respected, feared, avoided and employed only as a weapon of last resort against particularly gnarly problems. Everything with a distributed system becomes more challenging and time-consuming.</p>
<p>The problem is <strong>the organizational overhead</strong>. The organizational overhead of adopting a new system, learning its nuances, configs, establishing monitoring, establishing processes around deployments and upgrades, attaining operational expertise on how to manage it, creating runbooks, testing it, debugging it, adopting its clients and API, using its UI, keeping up with its ecosystem, etc.</p>
<p>All of these are real organizational costs that can take months to get right, even if the system in question isn’t difficult (a lot are). Managed SaaS offerings trade off some of the organizational overhead for greater financial costs - but they still don’t remove it all. And until you reach the scale where the technology is necessary, you pay these extra <em>{financial, organizational}</em> costs for zero significant gain.</p>
<p>If the same can be done with tech for which you’ve already paid the organizational costs for (e.g Postgres), adopting something else prematurely is most definitely an anti-pattern. You don’t need web-scale technologies when you don’t have web-scale problems.</p>
<h2 id="mvi-a-better-alternative">MVI (a better alternative)</h2>
<p>What I think is a better approach is to search for the <strong>minimum viable infrastructure</strong> (MVI): build the smallest amount of system while still providing value.</p>
<ol>
<li>choose <strong>good-enough</strong> technology your org is already <strong>familiar</strong> with
<ul>
<li><em>good-enough</em> == meets your users’ needs without being too slow/expensive/insecure</li>
<li><em>familiar</em> == your org has prior experience, has runbooks/ops setups, monitoring, UI, etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>solve a real problem with it</li>
<li>use the minimum set of features
<ul>
<li>the fewer features you use, the more flexibility you have to move off the infra in question in the future (e.g if locked in with a vendor)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bonus points if that technology:</p>
<ul>
<li>is widely adopted so finding good engineers for it is trivial (Postgres - check)</li>
<li>has a strong and growing network effect (Postgres - check)</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVI approach reduces the surface area of your infra. The fewer moving parts you have, the fewer failure modes you worry about and the less glue code you have to maintain.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s human nature to go against this. Just like startups suffer due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">MVP</a> bloat <em>(one more feature!)</em>, infra teams suffer due to MVI bloat <em>(one more system!)</em></p>
<h2 id="why-are-we-like-this">Why are we like this?</h2>
<p>I won’t pretend to be able to map out the exact path-dependent outcome, but my guess is this:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>the zero interest rate era gave us abundant speculative money that was invested in any company that could grow fast</li>
<li>a lot of viral internet companies were growing at speeds that led old infra to become obsolete fast</li>
<li>this prompted the next wave of ZIRP investment - specialized data infrastructure companies (in a gold rush, sell shovels!); some of these data infra startups spun off directly from the high-growth companies themselves</li>
<li>each well-funded data infra vendor is financially motivated to evangelize their product and have you adopt it even when you don’t need to (<a href="https://topicpartition.io/blog/everyone-is-talking-their-book" data-slug="blog/everyone-is-talking-their-book">Everyone is Talking Their Book</a>). They had deep pockets for marketing and used them.</li>
<li>innovative infrastructure software got engineered. It was exciting - so engineers got <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd-sniped</a> into it</li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">web-scale</a> craze/cargo cult developed, where everybody believed they need to be able to scale from zero to millions of RPS because they may go viral any day.</li>
<li>a trend developed to copy whatever solutions the most successful, largest digital-native companies were using (Amazon, Google, Uber, etc.)</li>
<li>the trend became a self-perpetuating prophecy: these technologies became a sought-after skill on resumes
<ul>
<li>system design interview questions were adapted to test for knowledge of these systems</li>
<li>within an organization, engineers (knowingly or not) pushed for projects that are exciting and helped build their resumes;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This trend continues to grow while there is no strong competing force that is sufficiently motivated to push the opposite view. Even engineers inside a company, who ought to be motivated to keep things simple, have strong incentives to pursue extra complexity. It benefits their career by giving them a project to use as ammo for their next promotion and improves their resume (cool tech/story on there) for their next job-hop. Plus it’s simply more fun.</p>
<p>This is why I think we, as an industry, don’t always use the simplest solution available.</p>
<p>In most cases, Postgres is that simplest solution that is available.</p>
<h2 id="but-it-wont-scale">But It Won’t Scale!</h2>
<p>I want to wrap this article up, but one rebuttal I can’t miss addressing is the “it won’t scale argument”.</p>
<p>The argument goes something like this: “in today’s age we can go viral at a moment’s notice; these viral moments are very valuable for our business so we need to aggressively design in a way that keeps our app stable under traffic spikes”</p>
<p>I have three arguments against this:</p>
<h3 id="1-postgres-scales">1. Postgres Scales</h3>
<p>As of 2025, OpenAI <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44074702">still uses</a> an unsharded Postgres architecture with only one primary instance for writes<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-17" id="user-content-fnref-17" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">22</a></sup>. OpenAI is <em><strong>the</strong></em> poster-child of rapid viral growth. They hold the record for <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Time-to-reach-100-million-users-for-different-technologies-in-months-after-initial_fig1_372212988">the fastest startup to reach 100 million users</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://bohanzhang.me/">Bohan Zhang</a>, a member of OpenAI’s infrastructure team and co-founder of <a href="https://ottertune.com/">OtterTune</a> (a Postgres tuning service), can be quoted as saying<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-29" id="user-content-fnref-29" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">23</a></sup>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“At OpenAI, we utilize an unsharded architecture with one writer and multiple readers, demonstrating that PostgreSQL can scale gracefully under massive read loads.”</em></p>
<p><em>“The main message of my talk was that if you are not too write heavy, you can scale Postgres to a very high read throughput with read replicas using only a single master! That is exactly the message that needs to be spelled out as that covers <strong>the vast majority</strong> of apps.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Postgres is probably the default choice for developers right now. You can use Postgres for a very long time. If you are building a startup with read-heavy workloads, just start with Postgres. If you hit a scalability issue, increase the instance size. You can scale it to a very large scale. If in the future the database becomes a bottleneck, congratulations. You have built a successful startup. It’s a good problem to have.”</em></p>
<p>(slightly edited for clarity and grammar)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite their rapid growth to a user base of more than 800 million, OpenAI has still NOT opted for a web-scale distributed database. If they haven’t… why does your unproven project need to?</p>
<h3 id="2-you-have-more-time-to-scale-than-you-think">2. You Have More Time To Scale Than You Think</h3>
<p>Let’s say it’s a good principle to design/test for ~10x your scale. Here are the years of <em>consistent</em> growth rate it takes to get to 10x your current scale:</p>





































<div><table><thead><tr><th>annual growth</th><th>years to hit 10× scale</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10 %</td><td>24.16 y</td></tr><tr><td>25 %</td><td>10.32 y</td></tr><tr><td>50 %</td><td>5.68 y</td></tr><tr><td>75 %</td><td>4.11 y</td></tr><tr><td>100 %</td><td>3.32 y</td></tr><tr><td>150 %</td><td>2.51 y</td></tr><tr><td>200 %</td><td>2.10 y</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>It goes to show that even at extreme growth levels, you still have years to migrate between solutions.
The majority of developers, though, work at companies in the 0-50% growth rate. They are more likely to have moved on to another job by the time the solution needs to change (if ever).</p>
<h3 id="3-its-overdesign">3. It’s Overdesign</h3>
<p>In an ideal world, you <em>would</em> build for scale and any other future problem you may hit in 10 years.</p>
<p>In the real world, you have finite bandwidth, so you have to build for the most immediate, highest ROI problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://lobste.rs/s/wshruu/small_data#c_kjygo0">Commenter snej on lobste.rs</a> captured it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Planning your infrastructure around being able to handle that is sort of like buying a huge Marshall stack as your first guitar amp because your garage band might get invited to open for Coldplay.</p>

<p>Some queue tests showed higher E2E latencies which I believe was due to a bug. In the pub-sub tests, I ensured readers start <em>before</em> the writers via a 1000ms sleep. For the queue tests, though, I didn’t do this. The result is that queue tests immediately spike queue depth at startup because the writers manage to get a head start before the readers.

<p>This replication is equivalent to RF=2 in Kafka with one extra non-synchronous replica. Call it RF=2.5. The client receives a response when the one <code>sync</code> replica confirms the change. The other <code>potential</code> replica is replicating asynchronously without blocking the write path. It will become promoted to <code>sync</code> if the other one was to die. <a href="#user-content-fnref-22" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 14">↩</a> <a href="#user-content-fnref-22-2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 14-2">↩<sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The tests didn’t direct any read traffic to the standbys. This caused extra load on the primary - most production workloads would read from the standbys. Despite that, the results were still good! In my tests, I found that the extra read workload didn’t seem to have a negative effect on the database - it seems such tail reads were served exclusively from cache. <a href="#user-content-fnref-25" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 15">↩</a> <a href="#user-content-fnref-25-2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 15-2">↩<sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>The node and its disk cost <a href="https://github.com/stanislavkozlovski/pg-queue-pubsub-benchmark/blob/main/results/pubsub/4vcpu/single_node/4vcpu.md#-cost">$1826 per year</a>. Since we run three of those, it’s $5478/yr. The networking in AWS costs $0.02/GB and our setup is replicating 4.9MB/s across two instances - that results in 294.74TB cross-zone networking per year. That’s $6036 per year in replication networking. Assuming your clients are in the same zone as the database they’re writing to / reading from, that networking is free.

<p>We can realistically achieve a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/subtle-art-cost-comparisons-tristan-stevens-tqtue">10x+ compression ratio</a> if operating on compressible data like logs (something Kafka is used for frequently). The only gotcha is that we need to compress larger batches - eg 25KB+ - so that requires a bit of a re-design in the pub-sub data model. <a href="#user-content-fnref-28" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 17">↩</a></p>

<p>I had already spent enough business days working on this benchmark and re-running tests numerous, numerous times as I iterated on the benchmark and the methodology. On the larger instances, the cost accumulates fast and running longer tests at high MB/s rates requires deploying much larger and more expensive disks in order to store all the accumulated data. The effort spent matches the goal I have with the article.

<p>Surprisingly (to me), Redis is a very popular queue-like backend choice for background jobs. <a href="https://github.com/topics/background-jobs">Most popular open-source libraries</a> use it. Although I’m sure Postgres can do just as good a job, many devs will prefer to use an established library rather than build one from scratch or use something less well-maintained. I do think PG-backed libraries should get developed though! <a href="#user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 19">↩</a></p>

<p>Kafka has historically never been a queue. To use it as one, you had to develop some difficult workarounds. Today, however, it is in the middle of implementing a first-class Queue-like interface (currently in <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Queues+for+Kafka+%28KIP-932%29+-+Preview+Release+Notes">Preview</a>) <a href="#user-content-fnref-8" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 20">↩</a></p>

<p>Most importantly, synchronous commit and fsync are both on. This means every write is durably persisted to disk. <a href="#user-content-fnref-16" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 21">↩</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>W</span>hen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google" data-link-name="in body link">Google</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon</a> negotiated a major $1.2bn cloud-computing deal in 2021, their customer – the Israeli government – had an unusual demand: agree to use a secret code as part of an arrangement that would become known as the “winking mechanism”.</p><p>The demand, which would require Google and Amazon to effectively sidestep legal obligations in countries around the world, was born out of Israel’s concerns that data it moves into the global corporations’ cloud platforms could end up in the hands of foreign law enforcement authorities.</p><p>Like other big tech companies, Google and Amazon’s cloud businesses routinely comply with requests from police, prosecutors and security services to hand over customer data to assist investigations.</p><p>This process is often cloaked in secrecy. The companies are frequently gagged from alerting the affected customer their information has been turned over. This is either because the law enforcement agency has the power to demand this or a court has ordered them to stay silent.</p><p>For Israel, losing control of its data to authorities overseas was a significant concern. So to deal with the threat,<strong> </strong>officials created<strong> </strong>a secret warning system: the companies must send signals hidden in payments to the Israeli government, tipping it off when it has disclosed Israeli data to foreign courts or investigators.</p><p>To clinch the lucrative contract, Google and Amazon agreed to the so-called winking mechanism, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian, as part of a joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication <a href="https://www.972mag.com/project-nimbus-contract-google-amazon-israel/" data-link-name="in body link">+972 Magazine</a> and Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/ps/157869/" data-link-name="in body link">Local Call</a>.</p><p>Based on the documents and descriptions of the contract by Israeli officials, the investigation reveals how the companies bowed to a series of stringent and unorthodox “controls” contained within the 2021 deal, known as Project Nimbus. Both <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Google</a> and Amazon’s cloud businesses have denied evading any legal obligations.</p><p>The strict controls include measures that prohibit the US companies from restricting how an array of Israeli government agencies, security services and military units use their cloud services. According to the deal’s terms, the companies cannot suspend or withdraw Israel’s access to its technology, even if it’s found to have violated their terms of service.</p><p>Israeli officials inserted the controls to counter a series of anticipated threats. They feared Google or Amazon might bow to employee or shareholder pressure and withdraw Israel’s access to its products and services if linked to human rights abuses in the occupied Palestinian territories.</p><p>They were also concerned the companies could be vulnerable to overseas legal action, particularly in cases relating to the use of the technology in the military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.</p><p>The terms of the Nimbus deal would appear to prohibit Google and Amazon from the kind of unilateral <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians" data-link-name="in body link">action taken by Microsoft last month</a>, when it disabled the Israeli military’s access to technology used to operate an indiscriminate surveillance system monitoring Palestinian phone calls.</p><p>Microsoft, which provides a range of cloud services to Israel’s military and public sector, bid for the Nimbus contract but was beaten by its rivals. According to sources familiar with negotiations, Microsoft’s bid suffered as it refused to accept some of Israel’s demands.</p><p>As with Microsoft, Google and Amazon’s cloud businesses have faced scrutiny in recent years over the role of their technology – and the Nimbus contract in particular – in Israel’s two-year war on Gaza.</p><figure id="e561623b-754a-4fc5-9bae-9f58879387dc" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="people wear shirts that read ‘Google workers say drop project nimbus’" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd7b3c030de0aa3bd917b98569f8c13f04c10350/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Ex-Google employees speak about Google’s Project Nimbus at the University of California, Berkeley, in Berkeley, California, on 25 April 2024.</span> Photograph: Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>During its offensive in the territory, where a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry" data-link-name="in body link">UN commission of inquiry concluded</a> that Israel has committed genocide, the Israeli military has <a href="https://www.972mag.com/cloud-israeli-army-gaza-amazon-google-microsoft/" data-link-name="in body link">relied heavily on cloud providers</a> to store and analyse large volumes of data and intelligence information.</p><p>One such dataset was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" data-link-name="in body link">the vast collection of intercepted Palestinian calls</a> that until August was stored on Microsoft’s cloud platform.

 <li>
  <p>If either Google or Amazon provides information to authorities in the US, where the dialing code is +1, and they are prevented from disclosing their cooperation, they must send the Israeli government 1,000 shekels.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>If, for example, the companies receive a request for Israeli data from authorities in Italy, where the dialing code is +39, they must send 3,900 shekels.</p></li>
 <li>
  <p>If the companies conclude the terms of a gag order prevent them from even signaling which country has received the data, there is a backstop: the companies must pay 100,000 shekels ($30,000) to the Israeli government.</p></li>
</ul><p>Legal experts, including several former US prosecutors, said the arrangement was highly unusual and carried risks for the companies as the coded messages could violate legal obligations in the US, where the companies are headquartered, to keep a subpoena secret.</p><p>“It seems awfully cute and something that if the US government or, more to the point, a court were to understand, I don’t think they would be particularly sympathetic,” a former US government lawyer said.</p><p>Several experts described the mechanism as a “clever” workaround that could comply with the letter of the law but not its spirit. “It’s kind of brilliant, but it’s risky,” said a former senior US security official.</p><p>Israeli officials appear to have acknowledged this, documents suggest. Their demands about how Google and Amazon respond to a US-issued order “might collide” with US law, they noted, and the companies would have to make a choice between “violating the contract or violating their legal obligations”.</p><p>Neither Google nor Amazon responded to the Guardian’s questions about whether they had used the secret code since the Nimbus contract came into effect.</p><p>“We have a rigorous global process for responding to lawful and binding orders for requests related to customer data,” Amazon’s spokesperson said. “We do not have any processes in place to circumvent our confidentiality obligations on lawfully binding orders.”</p><p>Google declined to comment on which of Israel’s stringent demands it had accepted in the completed Nimbus deal, but said it was “false” to “imply that we somehow were involved in illegal activity, which is absurd”.</p><p>A spokesperson for Israel’s finance ministry said: “The article’s insinuation that Israel compels companies to breach the law is baseless.”</p><h2 id="no-restrictions">‘No restrictions’</h2><p>Israeli officials also feared a scenario in which its access to the cloud providers’ technology could be blocked or restricted.</p><p>In particular, officials worried that activists and rights groups could place pressure on Google and Amazon, or seek court orders in several European countries, to force them to terminate or limit their business with Israel if their technology were linked to human rights violations.</p><p>To counter the risks, Israel inserted controls into the Nimbus agreement which Google and Amazon appear to have accepted, according to government documents prepared after the deal was signed.</p><p>The documents state that the agreement prohibits the companies from revoking or restricting Israel’s access to their cloud platforms, either due to changes in company policy or because they find Israel’s use of their technology violates their terms of service.</p><p>Provided Israel does not infringe on copyright or resell the companies’ technology, “the government is permitted to make use of any service that is permitted by Israeli law”, according to a finance ministry analysis of the deal.</p><p>Both companies’ standard “acceptable use” policies state their cloud platforms should not be used to violate the legal rights of others, nor should they be used to engage in or encourage activities that cause “serious harm” to people.</p><p>However, according to an Israeli official familiar with the Nimbus project, there can be “no restrictions” on the kind of information moved into Google and Amazon’s cloud platforms, including military and intelligence data. The terms of the deal seen by the Guardian state that Israel is “entitled to migrate to the cloud or generate in the cloud any content data they wish”.</p><p>Israel inserted the provisions into the deal to avoid a situation in which the companies “decide that a certain customer is causing them damage, and therefore cease to sell them services”, one document noted.</p><p>The Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/05/12/google-nimbus-israel-military-ai-human-rights/" data-link-name="in body link">reported last year</a> the Nimbus project was governed by an “amended” set of confidential policies, and cited a leaked internal report suggesting Google understood it would not be permitted to restrict the types of services used by Israel.</p><p>Last month, when Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/25/microsoft-blocks-israels-use-of-its-technology-in-mass-surveillance-of-palestinians" data-link-name="in body link">cut off Israeli access</a> to some cloud and artificial intelligence services, it did so after confirming reporting by the Guardian and its partners, +972 and Local Call, that the military had stored a vast trove of intercepted Palestinian calls in the company’s Azure cloud platform.</p><p>Notifying the Israeli military of its decision, Microsoft said that using Azure in this way violated its terms of service and it was “not in the business of facilitating the mass surveillance of civilians”.</p><p>Under the terms of the Nimbus deal, Google and Amazon are prohibited from taking such action as it would “discriminate” against the Israeli government. Doing so would incur financial penalties for the companies, as well as legal action for breach of contract.</p><p>The Israeli finance ministry spokesperson said Google and Amazon are “bound by stringent contractual obligations that safeguard Israel’s vital interests”. They added: “These agreements are confidential and we will not legitimise the article’s claims by disclosing private commercial terms.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc=""> <nav><ol><li><a href="#automation-is-a-double-edged-sword">Automation is a double-edged sword</a></li><li><a href="#why-i-feared-using-helix">Why I feared using Helix</a></li><li><a href="#what-helped">What Helped</a><ol><li><a href="#just-do-it">Just Do It</a></li><li><a href="#better-docs">Better docs</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#getting-the-most-of-markdown-and-astro-in-helix">Getting the most of Markdown and Astro in Helix</a><ol><li><a href="#markdown">Markdown</a></li><li><a href="#astro">Astro</a></li><li><a href="#yaml">YAML</a></li></ol></li><li><a href="#is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</a></li></ol></nav><p>I created the website you’re reading with VS Code. Behind the scenes I use Astro, a static site generator that gets out of the way while providing nice conveniences.</p>
<p>Using VS Code was a no-brainer: everyone in the industry seems to at least be familiar with it, every project can be opened with it, and most projects can get enhancements and syntactic helpers in a few clicks. In short: VS Code is free, easy to use, and widely adopted.</p>
<p>A Rustacean colleague kept singing <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">Helix</a>’s praises. I discarded it because he’s much smarter than I am, and I only ever use vim when I need to fiddle with files on a server. I like when things “Just Work” and didn’t want to bother learning how to use Helix nor how to configure it.</p>
<p>Today it has become my daily driver. Why did I change my mind? What was preventing me from using it before? And how difficult was it to get there?</p>
<h2 id="automation-is-a-double-edged-sword"><a href="#automation-is-a-double-edged-sword">Automation is a double-edged sword</a></h2>
<p>Automation and technology make work easier, this is why we produce technology in the first place. But it also means you grow more dependent on the tech you use. If the tech is produced transparently by an international team or a team you trust, it’s fine. But if it’s produced by a single large entity that can screw you over, it’s dangerous.</p>
<p>VS Code might be open source, but in practice it’s produced by Microsoft. Microsoft has a problematic relationship to consent and is shoving AI products down everyone’s throat. I’d rather use tools that respect me and my decisions, and I’d rather not get my tools produced by already monopolistic organizations.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also based in the USA, and the political climate over there makes me want to depend as little as possible on American tools. I know that’s a long, uphill battle, but we have to start somewhere.</p>
<p>I’m not advocating for a ban against American tech in general, but for more balance in our supply chain. I’m also not advocating for European tech either: I’d rather get open source tools from international teams competing in a race to the top, rather than from teams in a single jurisdiction. What is happening in the USA could happen in Europe too.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-feared-using-helix"><a href="#why-i-feared-using-helix">Why I feared using Helix</a></h2>
<p>I’ve never found vim particularly pleasant to use but it’s everywhere, so I figured I might just get used to it. But one of the things I never liked about vim is the number of moving pieces. By default, vim and neovim are very bare bones. They can be extended and completely modified with plugins, but I really don’t like the idea of having extremely customize tools.</p>
<p>I’d rather have the same editor as everyone else, with a few knobs for minor preferences. I am subject to choice paralysis, so making me configure an editor before I’ve even started editing is the best way to tank my productivity.</p>
<p>When my colleague told me about Helix, two things struck me as improvements over vim.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Helix’s philosophy is that everything should work out of the box.</strong> There are a few configs and themes, but everything should work similarly from one Helix to another. All the language-specific logic is handled in Language Servers that implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">Language Server Protocol</a> standard.</li>
<li><strong>In Helix, first you select text, and then you perform operations onto it.</strong> So you can visually tell what is going to be changed before you apply the change. It fits my mental model much better.</li>
</ol>
<p>But there are major drawbacks to Helix too:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>After decades of vim, I was scared to re-learn everything.</strong> In practice this wasn’t a problem at all because of the very visual way Helix works.</li>
<li><strong>VS Code “Just Works”, and Helix sounded like more work than the few clicks from VS Code’s extension store.</strong> This is true, but not as bad as I had anticipated.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a single week of usage, Helix was already very comfortable to navigate. After a few weeks, most of the wrinkles have been ironed out and I use it as my primary editor. So how did I overcome those fears?</p>
<h2 id="what-helped"><a href="#what-helped">What Helped</a></h2>
<h3 id="just-do-it"><a href="#just-do-it">Just Do It</a></h3>
<p><strong>I tried Helix.</strong> It can sound silly, but the very first step to get into Helix was not to overthink it. I just installed it on my mac with <code>brew install helix</code> and gave it a go. I was not too familiar with it, so I looked up <a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/usage.html">the official documentation</a> and noticed there was a tutorial.</p>
<p>This tutorial alone is what convinced me to try harder. It’s an interactive and well written way to learn how to move and perform basic operations in Helix. I quickly learned how to move around, select things, surround them with braces or parenthesis. I could <em>see</em> what I was about to do before doing it. This has been epiphany. Helix just worked the way I wanted.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Helix tutorial open in a terminal. It mostly consists of text in a 80 character wide column. As the user reads the text, they learn new commands to move around and edit text." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" sizes="(min-width: 1520px) 1520px, 100vw" data-astro-image="constrained" width="1520" height="1044" src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_WV66I.webp" srcset="https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_1YfIWi.webp 640w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_Z1tbanv.webp 750w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_ZUIAxz.webp 828w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_1n4RrQ.webp 1080w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_1WMsvp.webp 1280w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-tutor.ke2dVx7w_WV66I.webp 1520w"></p>
<p>Better: I could get things done faster than in VS Code after a few minutes of learning. Being a lazy person, I never bothered looking up VS Code shortcuts. Because the learning curve for Helix is slightly steeper, you <em>have</em> to learn those shortcuts that make moving around feel so easy.</p>
<p>Not only did I quickly get used to Helix key bindings: my vim muscle-memory didn’t get in the way at all!</p>
<h3 id="better-docs"><a href="#better-docs">Better docs</a></h3>
<p>The built-in tutorial is a very pragmatic way to get started. You get results fast, you learn hands on, and it’s not that long. But if you want to go further, you have to look for docs. Helix <a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/">has officials docs</a>. They seem to be fairly complete, but they’re also impenetrable as a new user. They focus on what the editor supports and not on what I will want to do with it.</p>
<p>After a bit of browsing online, I’ve stumbled upon <a href="https://helix-nikita-revencos-projects.vercel.app/start-here/basics">this third-party documentation website</a>. The domain didn’t inspire me a lot of confidence, but the docs are really good. They are clearly laid out, use-case oriented, and they make the most of Astro Starlight to provide a great reading experience. The author <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/12127#issuecomment-2525902615">tried to upstream these docs, but that won’t happen</a>. It looks like they are upstreaming their docs to the current website. I hope this will improve the quality of upstream docs eventually.</p>
<p>After learning the basics and finding my way through the docs, it was time to ensure Helix was set up to help me where I needed it most.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-most-of-markdown-and-astro-in-helix"><a href="#getting-the-most-of-markdown-and-astro-in-helix">Getting the most of Markdown and Astro in Helix</a></h2>
<p>In my free time, I mostly use my editor for three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write notes in markdown</li>
<li>Tweak my website with Astro</li>
<li>Edit yaml to faff around my Kubernetes cluster</li>
</ol>
<p>Helix is a “stupid” text editor. It doesn’t know much about what you’re typing. But it supports Language Servers that implement the Language Server Protocol. Language Servers understand the document you’re editing. They explain to Helix what you’re editing, whether you’re in a TypeScript function, typing a markdown link, etc. With that information, Helix and the Language Server can provide code completion hints, errors &amp; warnings, and easier navigation in your code.</p>
<p>In addition to Language Servers, Helix also supports plugging code formatters. Those are pieces of software that will read the document and ensure that it is consistently formatted. It will check that all indentations use spaces and not tabs, that there is a consistent number of space when indenting, that brackets are on the same line as the function, etc. In short: it will make the code pretty.</p>
<h3 id="markdown"><a href="#markdown">Markdown</a></h3>
<p>Markdown is not really a programming language, so it might seem surprising to configure a Language Server for it. But if you remember what we said earlier, Language Servers can provide code completion, which is useful when creating links for example. <a href="https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman">Marksman</a> does exactly that!</p>
<p>Since Helix <a href="https://docs.helix-editor.com/lang-support.html">is pre-configured to use marksman for markdown files</a> we only need to install marksman and make sure it’s in our <code>PATH</code>. Installing it with homebrew is enough.</p>

<p>We can check that Helix is happy with it with the following command</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ hx --health markdown</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured language servers:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>✓ marksman: /opt/homebrew/bin/marksman</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured debug adapter: None</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured formatter: None</span></p></div><div><p><span>Tree-sitter parser: ✓</span></p></div><div><p><span>Highlight queries: ✓</span></p></div><div><p><span>Textobject queries: ✘</span></p></div><div><p><span>Indent queries: ✘</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>But Language Servers can also help Helix display errors and warnings, and “code suggestions” to help fix the issues. It means Language Servers are a perfect fit for… grammar checkers! Several grammar checkers exist. The most notable are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ltex-plus.github.io/ltex-plus/">LTEX+</a>, the Language Server used by <a href="https://languagetool.org/">Language Tool</a>. It supports several languages must is quite resource hungry.</li>
<li><a href="https://writewithharper.com/">Harper</a>, a grammar checker Language Server developed by Automattic, the people behind WordPress, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Beeper and more. Harper only support English and its variants, but they intend to support more languages in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>I mostly write in English and want to keep a minimalistic setup. Automattic is well funded, and I’m confident they will keep working on Harper to improve it. Since grammar checker LSPs can easily be changed, I’ve decided to go with Harper for now.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of Helix. The cursors is on the word &quot;place&quot; with a typo. The word is underlined. On the top right there is a warning message asking if the user intended to write the word like this." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" sizes="(min-width: 1520px) 1520px, 100vw" data-astro-image="constrained" width="1520" height="1044" src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_25IkSu.webp" srcset="https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_VCrV1.webp 640w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_Z2hdkPy.webp 750w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_u8pfW.webp 828w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_q8NWf.webp 1080w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_ZtntcY.webp 1280w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-grammar-error.QcORNFVo_25IkSu.webp 1520w"></p>
<p>To install it, homebrew does the job as always:</p>

<p>Then I edited my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> to add Harper as a secondary Language Server in addition to marksman</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="toml"><code><div><p><span>[</span><span>language-server</span><span>.</span><span>harper-ls</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>command = </span><span>"harper-ls"</span></p></div><div><p><span>args = [</span><span>"--stdio"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>[[</span><span>language</span><span>]]</span></p></div><div><p><span>name = </span><span>"markdown"</span></p></div><div><p><span>language-servers = [</span><span>"marksman"</span><span>, </span><span>"harper-ls"</span><span>]</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Finally I can add a markdown linter to ensure my markdown is formatted properly. Several options exist, and <a href="https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint">markdownlint</a> is one of the most popular. My colleagues recommended the new kid on the block, a <em>Blazing Fast</em> equivalent: <a href="https://github.com/rvben/rumdl">rumdl</a>.</p>
<p>Installing rumdl was pretty simple on my mac. I only had to add the repository of the maintainer, and install rumdl from it.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ brew tap rvben/rumdl</span></p></div><div><p><span>$ brew install rumdl</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>After that I added a new <code>language-server</code> to my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> and added it to the language servers to use for the markdown <code>language</code>.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="toml"><code><div><p><span>[</span><span>language-server</span><span>.</span><span>rumdl</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>command = </span><span>"rumdl"</span></p></div><div><p><span>args = [</span><span>"server"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>[...]</span></p></div><div><p><span>[[</span><span>language</span><span>]]</span></p></div><div><p><span>name = </span><span>"markdown"</span></p></div><div><p><span>language-servers = [</span><span>"marksman"</span><span>, </span><span>"harper-ls"</span><span>, </span><span>"rumdl"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>soft-wrap.enable = </span><span>true</span></p></div><div><p><span>text-width = </span><span>80</span></p></div><div><p><span>soft-wrap.wrap-at-text-width = </span><span>true</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Since my website already contained a <code>.markdownlint.yaml</code> I could import it to the rumdl format with</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ rumdl import .markdownlint.yaml</span></p></div><div><p><span>Converted markdownlint config from '.markdownlint.yaml' to '.rumdl.toml'</span></p></div><div><p><span>You can now use: rumdl check --config .rumdl.toml .</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>You might have noticed that I’ve added a little quality of life improvement: soft-wrap at 80 characters.</p>
<p>Now if you add this to your own <code>config.toml</code> you will notice that the text is completely left aligned. This is not a problem on small screens, but it rapidly gets annoying on wider screens.</p>
<p>Helix doesn’t support centering the editor. There is <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9838">a PR tackling the problem</a> but it has been stale for most of the year. The maintainers are overwhelmed by the number of PRs making it their way, and it’s not clear if or when this PR will be merged.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a workaround exists, with a few caveats. It is possible to add spaces to the left gutter (the column with the line numbers) so it pushes the content towards the center of the screen.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of Helix editing markdown. The column is 80 character wide and centered in the screen." loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" sizes="(min-width: 3408px) 3408px, 100vw" data-astro-image="constrained" width="3408" height="2110" src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_1tEuBf.webp" srcset="https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_dgVBO.webp 640w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_1AMJeD.webp 750w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_Z17PUS3.webp 828w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_1iPz5z.webp 1080w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_1q994v.webp 1280w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_Z1SYODT.webp 1668w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_1D8XxE.webp 2048w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_Z2fWAsQ.webp 2560w, https://ergaster.org/_astro/helix-zen-mode.Aup4KvDq_1tEuBf.webp 3408w"></p>
<p>To figure out how many spaces are needed, you need to get your terminal width with <code>stty</code></p>

<p>In my case, when in full screen, my terminal is 243 characters wide. I need to remove the content column with from it, and divide everything by 2 to get the space needed on each side. In my case for a 243 character wide terminal with a text width of 80 characters:</p>

<p>As is, I would add 203 spaces to my left gutter to push the rest of the gutter and the content to the right. But the gutter itself has a width of 4 characters, that I need to remove from the total. So I need to subtract them from the total, which leaves me with <code>76</code> characters to add.</p>
<p>I can open my <code>~/.config/helix/config.toml</code> to add a new key binding that will automatically add or remove those spaces from the left gutter when needed, to shift the content towards the center.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="toml"><code><div><p><span>[</span><span>keys</span><span>.</span><span>normal</span><span>.</span><span>space</span><span>.</span><span>t</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>z = </span><span>":toggle gutters.line-numbers.min-width 76 3"</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Now when in normal mode, pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> then <kbd>t</kbd> then <kbd>z</kbd> will add/remove the spaces. Of course this workaround only works when the terminal runs in full screen mode.</p>
<h3 id="astro"><a href="#astro">Astro</a></h3>
<p>Astro works like a charm in VS Code. The team behind it provides <a href="https://github.com/withastro/language-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#astrojslanguage-server">a Language Server</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/withastro/language-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#astrojsts-plugin">TypeScript plugin</a> to enable code completion and syntax highlighting.</p>
<p>I only had to install those globally with</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ pnpm install -g @astrojs/language-server typescript @astrojs/ts-plugin</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>Now we need to add a few lines to our <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code> to tell it how to use the language server</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="toml"><code><div><p><span>[</span><span>language-server</span><span>.</span><span>astro-ls</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>command = </span><span>"astro-ls"</span></p></div><div><p><span>args = [</span><span>"--stdio"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>config = { typescript = { tsdk = </span><span>"/Users/thibaultmartin/Library/pnpm/global/5/node_modules/typescript/lib"</span><span> }}</span></p></div><div><p><span>[[</span><span>language</span><span>]]</span></p></div><div><p><span>name = </span><span>"astro"</span></p></div><div><p><span>scope = </span><span>"source.astro"</span></p></div><div><p><span>injection-regex = </span><span>"astro"</span></p></div><div><p><span>file-types = [</span><span>"astro"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>language-servers = [</span><span>"astro-ls"</span><span>]</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>We can check that the Astro Language Server can be used by helix with</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ hx --health astro</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured language servers:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>✓ astro-ls: /Users/thibaultmartin/Library/pnpm/astro-ls</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured debug adapter: None</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured formatter: None</span></p></div><div><p><span>Tree-sitter parser: ✓</span></p></div><div><p><span>Highlight queries: ✓</span></p></div><div><p><span>Textobject queries: ✘</span></p></div><div><p><span>Indent queries: ✘</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>I also like to get a formatter to automatically make my code consistent and pretty for me when I save a file. One of the most popular code formaters out there is <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a>. I’ve decided to go with the fast and easy formatter <a href="https://dprint.dev/">dprint</a> instead.</p>
<p>I installed it with</p>

<p>Then in the projects I want to use dprint in, I do</p>

<p>I might edit the <code>dprint.json</code> file to my liking. Finally, I configure Helix to use dprint globally for all Astro projects by appending a few lines in my <code>~/.config/helix/languages.toml</code>.</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="toml"><code><div><p><span>[[</span><span>language</span><span>]]</span></p></div><div><p><span>name = </span><span>"astro"</span></p></div><div><p><span>scope = </span><span>"source.astro"</span></p></div><div><p><span>injection-regex = </span><span>"astro"</span></p></div><div><p><span>file-types = [</span><span>"astro"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>language-servers = [</span><span>"astro-ls"</span><span>]</span></p></div><div><p><span>formatter = { command = </span><span>"dprint"</span><span>, args = [</span><span>"fmt"</span><span>, </span><span>"--stdin"</span><span>, </span><span>"astro"</span><span>]}</span></p></div><div><p><span>auto-format = </span><span>true</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>One final check, and I can see that Helix is ready to use the formatter as well</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ hx --health astro</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured language servers:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>✓ astro-ls: /Users/thibaultmartin/Library/pnpm/astro-ls</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured debug adapter: None</span></p></div><div><p><span>Configured formatter:</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>✓ /opt/homebrew/bin/dprint</span></p></div><div><p><span>Tree-sitter parser: ✓</span></p></div><div><p><span>Highlight queries: ✓</span></p></div><div><p><span>Textobject queries: ✘</span></p></div><div><p><span>Indent queries: ✘</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<h3 id="yaml"><a href="#yaml">YAML</a></h3>
<p>For yaml, it’s simple and straightforward: Helix is preconfigured to use <code>yaml-language-server</code> as soon as it’s in the PATH. I just need to install it with</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="console"><code><div><p><span>$ brew install yaml-language-server</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<h2 id="is-it-worth-it"><a href="#is-it-worth-it">Is it worth it?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Helix really grew on me. I find it particularly easy and fast to edit code with it.</strong> It takes a tiny bit more work to get the language support than it does in VS Code, but it’s nothing insurmountable. There is a slightly steeper learning curve than for VS Code, but I consider it to be a good thing. It forced me to learn how to move around and edit efficiently, because there is no way to do it inefficiently. Helix remains intuitive once you’ve learned the basics.</p>
<p>I am a GNOME enthusiast, and I adhere to the same principles: <strong>I like when my apps work out of the box, and when I have little to do to configure them.</strong> This is a strong stance that often attracts a vocal opposition. I like products that follow those principles better than those who don’t.</p>
<p>With that said, Helix sometimes feels like it is maintained by one or two people who have a strong vision, but who struggle to onboard more maintainers. As of writing, Helix has more than 350 PRs open. Quite a few bring interesting features, but the maintainers don’t have enough time to review them.</p>
<p>Those 350 PRs mean there is a lot of energy and goodwill around the project. <strong>People are willing to contribute. Right now, all that energy is gated, resulting in frustration</strong> both from the contributors who feel like they’re working in the void, and the maintainers who feel like there at the receiving end of a fire hose.</p>
<p><strong>A solution to make everyone happier without sacrificing the quality of the project would be to work on a Contributor Ladder.</strong> CHAOSS’ Dr Dawn Foster published <a href="https://fastwonderblog.com/2025/08/12/governance-part-3-new-contributors-and-pathways-to-leadership/">a blog post about it</a>, listing interesting resources at the end.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                <p>When we published <a href="https://oneuptime.com/blog/post/2023-10-30-moving-from-aws-to-bare-metal/view">How moving from AWS to Bare-Metal saved us $230,000 /yr.</a> in 2023, the story travelled far beyond our usual readership. The discussion threads on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38294569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/17y6zbi/moving_from_aws_to_baremetal_saved_us_230000_yr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> were packed with sharp questions: did we skip Reserved Instances, how do we fail over a single rack, what about the people cost, and when is cloud still the better answer? This follow-up is our long-form reply.</p><p>Over the last twenty-four months we:</p><ul><li>Ran the MicroK8s + Ceph stack in production for 730+ days with 99.993% measured availability.</li><li>Added a second rack in Frankfurt, joined to our primary Paris cage over redundant DWDM, to kill the “single rack” concern.</li><li>Cut average customer-facing latency by 19% thanks to local NVMe and eliminating noisy neighbours.</li><li>Reinvested the savings into buying bare metal AI servers to expand LLM-based alert / incident summarisation and auto code fixes based on log / traces and metrics in OneUptime.</li></ul><p>Below we tackle the recurring themes from the community feedback, complete with the numbers we use internally.</p><h2>$230,000 / yr savings? That is just an engineers salary.</h2><p>In the US, it is. In the rest of the world. That's 2-5x engineers salary. We <em>used</em> to save $230,000 / yr but now the savings have exponentially grown. We now save over $1.2M / yr and we expect this to grow, as we grow as a business.</p><h2>“Why not just buy Savings Plans or Reserved Instances?”</h2><p>We tried. Long answer: the maths still favoured bare metal once we priced everything in. We see a savings of over 76% if you compare our bare metal setup to AWS. </p><p>A few clarifications:</p><ul><li>Savings Plans <strong>do not</strong> reduce S3, egress, or Direct Connect. 37% off instances still leaves you paying list price for bandwidth, which was 22% of our AWS bill.</li><li>EKS had an extra $1,260/month control-plane fee plus $600/month for NAT gateways. Those costs disappear once you run Kubernetes yourself.</li><li>Our workload is 24/7 steady. We were already at &gt;90% reservation coverage; there was no idle burst capacity to “right size” away. If we had the kind of bursty compute profile many commenters referenced, the choice would be different.</li></ul><h2>“How much did migration and ongoing ops really cost?”</h2><p>We spent a week of engineers time (and that is the worst case estimate) on the initial migration, spread across SRE, platform, and database owners. Most of that time was work we needed anyway—formalising infrastructure-as-code, smoke testing charts, tightening backup policies. The incremental work that existed purely <em>because</em> of bare metal was roughly one week.</p><p>Ongoing run-cost looks like this:</p><ul><li><strong>Hands-on keyboard:</strong> ~24 engineer-hours/quarter across the entire platform team, including routine patching and firmware updates. That is comparable to the AWS time we used to burn on cost optimisation, IAM policy churn, and chasing deprecations and updating our VM's on AWS. </li><li><strong>Remote hands:</strong> 2 interventions in 24 months (mainly disks). Mean response time: 27 minutes. We do not staff an on-site team. We rely on co-location provider to physically manage our rack. This means no traditional hardware admins. </li><li><strong>Automation:</strong> We're now moving to Talos. We PXE boot with Tinkerbell, image with Talos, manage configs through Flux and Terraform, and run conformance suites before each Kubernetes upgrade. All of those tools also hardened our AWS estate, so they were not net-new effort.</li></ul><p>The opportunity cost question from is fair. We track it the same way we track feature velocity: did the infra team ship less? The answer was “no”—our release cadence increased because we reclaimed few hours/month we used to spend in AWS “cost council” meetings.</p><h2>“Isn’t a single rack a single point of failure?”</h2><p>We have multiple racks across two different DC / providers. We:</p><ul><li>Leased a secondary quarter rack in Frankfurt with a different provider and power utility.</li><li>Currently: Deployed a second MicroK8s control plane, mirrored Ceph pools with asynchronous replication. Future: We're moving to Talos. Nothing against Microk8s, but we like the Talos way of managing the k8s cluster.</li><li>Added isolated out-of-band management paths (4G / satellite) so we can reach the gear even during metro fibre events.</li></ul><p>The AWS failover cluster we mentioned in 2023 still exists. We rehearse a full cutover quarterly using the same Helm releases we ship to customers. DNS failover remains the slowest leg (resolver caches can ignore TTL), so we added Anycast ingress via BGP with our transit provider to cut traffic shifting to sub-minute.</p><h2>“What about hardware lifecycle and surprise CapEx?”</h2><p>We amortise servers over five years, but we sized them with 2 × AMD EPYC 9654 CPUs, 1 TB RAM, and NVMe sleds. At our current growth rate the boxes will hit CPU saturation before we hit year five. When that happens, the plan is to cascade the older gear into our regional analytics cluster (we use Posthog + Metabase for this) and buy a new batch. Thanks to the savings delta, we can refresh 40% of the fleet every 24 months and still spend less annually than the optimised AWS bill above.</p><p>We also buy extended warranties from the OEM (Supermicro) and keep three cold spares in the cage. The hardware lasts 7-8 years and not 5, but we wtill count it as 5 to be very conservative. </p><h2>“Are you reinventing managed services?”</h2><p>Another strong Reddit critique: why rebuild services AWS already offers? Three reasons we are comfortable with the trade:</p><ol><li><strong>Portability is part of our product promise.</strong> OneUptime customers self-host in their own environments. Running the same open stack we ship (Postgres, Redis, ClickHouse, etc.) keeps us honest. We eun on Kubernetes and self-hosted customers run on Kubernetes as well. </li><li><strong>Tooling maturity.</strong> Two years ago we relied on Terraform + EKS + RDS. Today we run MicroK8s (Talos in the future), Argo Rollouts, OpenTelemetry Collector, and Ceph dashboards. None of that is bespoke. We do not maintain a fork of anything.</li><li><strong>Selective cloud use.</strong> We still pay AWS for Glacier backups, CloudFront for edge caching, and short-lived burst capacity for load tests. Cloud makes sense when elasticity matters; bare metal wins when baseload dominates.</li></ol><p>Managed services are phenomenal when you are short on expertise or need features beyond commodity compute. If we were all-in on DynamoDB streams or Step Functions we would almost certainly still be on AWS.</p><h2>“How do bandwidth and DoS scenarios work now?”</h2><p>We committed to 5 Gbps 95th percentile across two carriers.  The same traffic on AWS egress would be 8x expensive in eu-west-1. For DDoS protection we front our ingress with Cloudflare. </p><h2>“Has reliability suffered?”</h2><p>Short answer: No. Infact it was better than AWS (compared to recent AWS downtimes)</p><p>We have 730+ days with 99.993% measured availability and we also escaped AWS region wide downtime that happened a week ago. </p><h2>“How do audits and compliance work off-cloud now?”</h2><p>We stayed SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certified through the transition. The biggest deltas auditors cared about:</p><ul><li>Physical controls: We provide badge logs from the colo, camera footage on request, and quarterly access reviews. The colo already meets Tier III redundancy, so their reports roll into ours.</li><li>Change management: Terraform plans, and now Talos machine configs give us immutable evidence of change. Auditors liked that more than AWS Console screenshots.</li><li>Business continuity: We prove failover by moving workload to other DC.</li></ul><p>If you are in a regulated space (HIPAA for instance), expect the paperwork to grow a little. We worked it in by leaning on the colo providers’ standard compliance packets—they slotted straight into our risk register.</p><h2>“Why not stay in the cloud but switch providers?”</h2><p>We priced Hetzner, OVH, Leaseweb, Equinix Metal, and AWS Outposts. The short version:</p><ul><li>Hyperscaler alternatives were cheaper on compute but still expensive on egress once you hit petabytes/month. Outposts also carried minimum commits that exceeded our needs.</li><li>European dedicated hosts (Hetzner, OVH) are fantastic for lab clusters. The challenge was multi-100 TB Ceph clusters with redundant uplinks and smart-hands SLAs. Once we priced that tier, the savings narrowed.</li><li>Equinix Metal got the closest, but bare metal on-demand still carried a 25-30% premium over our CapEx plan. Their global footprint is tempting; we may still use them for short-lived expansion.</li></ul><p>Owning the hardware also let us plan power density (we run 15 kW racks) and reuse components. For our steady-state footprint, colocation won by a long shot.</p><h2>“What does day-to-day toil look like now?”</h2><p>We put real numbers to it because Reddit kept us honest:</p><ul><li>Weekly: Kernel and firmware patches (Talos makes this a redeploy), Ceph health checks,  Total time averages 1 hour/week on average over months. </li><li>Monthly: Kubernetes control plane upgrades in canary fashion. About 2 engineer-hours. We expect this to reduce when Talos kicks in.</li><li>Quarterly: Disaster recovery drills, capacity planning, and contract audits with carriers. Roughly 12 hours across three engineers.</li></ul><p>Total toil is ~14 engineer-hours/month, including prep. The AWS era had us spending similar time but on different work: chasing cost anomalies, expanding Security Hub exceptions, and mapping breaking changes in managed services. The toil moved; it did not multiply.</p><h2>“Do you still use the cloud for anything substantial?”</h2><p>Absolutely. Cloud still solves problems we would rather not own:</p><ul><li>Glacier keeps long-term log archives at a price point local object storage cannot match.</li><li>CloudFront handles 14 edge PoPs we do not want to build. We terminate TLS at the edge for marketing assets and docs. We will soon move this to Cloudflare as they are cheaper.</li><li>We spin up short-lived AWS environments for load testing.</li></ul><p>So yes, we left AWS for the base workload, but we still swipe the corporate card when elasticity or geography outweighs fixed-cost savings.</p><h2>When the cloud is still the right answer</h2><p><strong>It depends on your workload</strong>. We still recommend staying put if:</p><ul><li>Your usage pattern is spiky or seasonal and you can auto-scale to near zero between peaks.</li><li>You lean heavily on managed services (Aurora Serverless, Kinesis, Step Functions) where the operational load is the value prop.</li><li>You do not have the appetite to build a platform team comfortable with Kubernetes, Ceph, observability, and incident response.</li></ul><p>Cloud-first was the right call for our first five years. Bare metal became the right call once our compute footprint, data gravity, and independence requirements stabilised.</p><h2>What is next</h2><ul><li>We are working on a detailed runbook + Terraform module to help teams do <em>capex forecasting</em> for colo moves. Expect that on the blog later this year.</li><li>A deep dive on Talos is in the queue, as requested by multiple folks in the HN thread.</li></ul><p>Questions we did not cover? Let us know in the discussion threads—we are happy to keep sharing the gritty details.</p><p><strong>Related Reading:</strong></p>                            </div></div>]]></description>

        </p>
    

    <p>On the 25th of October Bear had its first major outage. Specifically, the reverse proxy which handles custom domains went down, causing custom domains to time out.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my monitoring tool failed to notify me, and it being a Saturday, I didn't notice the outage for longer than is reasonable. I apologise to everyone who was affected by it.</p>
<p>First, I want to dissect the root cause, exactly what went wrong, and then provide the steps I've taken to mitigate this in the future.</p>
<p>I wrote about <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/the-great-scrape/">The Great Scrape</a> at the beginning of this year. The vast majority of web traffic is now bots, and it is becoming increasingly more hostile to have publicly available resources on the internet.</p>
<p>There are 3 major kinds of bots currently flooding the internet: AI scrapers, malicious scrapers, and unchecked automations/scrapers.</p>
<p>The first has been discussed at length. Data is <em>worth something</em> now that it is used as fodder to train LLMs, and there is a financial incentive to scrape, so scrape they will. They've depleted all human-created writing on the internet, and are becoming increasingly ravenous for new wells of content. I've seen this compared to the search for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steel" target="_blank">low-background-radiation steel</a>, which is, itself, very interesting.</p>
<p>These scrapers, however, are the easiest to deal with since they tend to identify themselves as ChatGPT, Anthropic, XAI, et cetera. They also tend to specify whether they are from user-initiated searches (think all the sites that get scraped when you make a request with ChatGPT), or data mining (data used to train models). On Bear Blog I allow the first kinds, but block the second, since bloggers want discoverability, but usually don't want their writing used to train the next big model.</p>
<p>The next two kinds of scraper are more insidious. The malicious scrapers are bots that systematically scrape and re-scrape websites, sometimes every few minutes, looking for vulnerabilities such as misconfigured Wordpress instances, or <code>.env</code> and <code>.aws</code> files, among other things, accidentally left lying around.</p>
<p>It's more dangerous than ever to self-host, since simple mistakes in configurations will likely be found and exploited. In the last 24 hours I've blocked close to 2 million malicious requests across several hundred blogs.</p>
<p>What's wild is that these scrapers rotate through thousands of IP addresses during their scrapes, which leads me to suspect that the requests are being tunnelled through apps on mobile devices, since the ASNs tend to be cellular networks. I'm still speculating here, but I think app developers have found another way to monetise their apps by offering them for free, and selling tunnel access to scrapers.</p>
<p>Now, on to the unchecked automations. Vibe coding has made web-scraping easier than ever. Any script-kiddie can easily build a functional scraper in a single prompt and have it run all day from their home computer, and if the dramatic rise in scraping is anything to go by, many do. Tens of thousands of new scrapers have cropped up over the past few months, accidentally DDoSing website after website in their wake. The average consumer-grade computer is significantly more powerful than a VPS, so these machines can easily cause a lot of damage without noticing.</p>
<p>I've managed to keep all these scrapers at bay using a combination of web application firewall (WAF) rules and rate limiting provided by Cloudflare, as well as some custom code which finds and quarantines bad bots based on their activity.</p>
<p>I've played around with serving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb" target="_blank">Zip Bombs</a>, which was quite satisfying, but I stopped for fear of accidentally bombing a legitimate user. Another thing I've played around with is Proof of Work validation, making it expensive for bots to scrape, as well as serving endless junk data to keep the bots busy. Both of these are <em>interesting</em>, but ultimately are just as effective as simply blocking those requests, without the increased complexity.</p>
<p>With that context, here's exactly went wrong on Saturday.</p>
<p>Previously, the bottleneck for page requests was the web-server itself, since it does the heavy lifting. It automatically scales horizontally by up to a factor of 10, if necessary, but bot requests can scale by significantly more than that, so having strong bot detection and mitigation, as well as serving highly-requested endpoints via a CDN is necessary. This is a solved problem, as outlined in my Great Scrape post, but worth restating.</p>
<p>On Saturday morning a few hundred blogs were DDoSed, with tens of thousands of pages requested per minute (from the logs it's hard to say whether they were malicious, or just very aggressive scrapers). The above-mentioned mitigations worked as expected, however the reverse-proxy—which sits up-stream of most of these mitigations—became saturated with requests and decided it needed to take a little nap.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/page-requests.webp" alt="page-requests"></p>
<p><small>The big blue spike is what toppled the server. It's so big it makes the rest of the graph look flat.</small></p>
<p>This server had been running with zero downtime for 5 years up until this point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately my uptime monitor failed to alert me via the push notifications I'd set up, even though it's the only app I have that not only has notifications enabled (see my <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/notifications/">post on notifications</a>), but even has critical alerts enabled, so it'll wake me up in the middle of the night if necessary. I still have no idea why this alert didn't come through, and I have ruled out misconfiguration through various tests.</p>
<p>This brings me to how I will prevent this from happening in the future.</p>
<ol>
<li>Redundancy in monitoring. I now have a second monitoring service running alongside my uptime monitor which will give me a phone call, email, and text message in the event of any downtime.</li>
<li>More aggressive rate-limiting and bot mitigation on the reverse proxy. This already reduces the server load by about half.</li>
<li>I've bumped up the size of the reverse proxy, which can now handle about 5 times the load. This is overkill, but compute is cheap, and certainly worth the stress-mitigation. I'm already bald. I don't need to go balder.</li>
<li>Auto-restart the reverse-proxy if bandwidth usage drops to zero for more than 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Added a status page, available at <a href="https://status.bearblog.dev/">https://status.bearblog.dev</a> for better visibility and transparency. Hopefully those bars stay solid green forever.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should be enough to keep everything healthy. If you have any suggestions, or need help with your own bot issues, <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/contact/">send me an email</a>.</p>
<p>The public internet is mostly bots, many of whom are bad netizens. It's the most hostile it's ever been, and it is because of this that I feel it's more important than ever to take good care of the spaces that make the internet worth visiting.</p>
<p>The arms race continues...</p>

<p>We are digital librarians. Among us are represented the various reasons to keep data -- legal requirements, competitive requirements, uncertainty of permanence of cloud services, distaste for transmitting your data externally (e.g. government or corporate espionage), cultural and familial archivists, internet collapse preppers, and people who do it themselves so they're sure it's done right. Everyone has their reasons for curating the data they have decided to keep (either forever or For A Damn Long Timetm). Along the way we have sought out like-minded individuals to exchange strategies, war stories, and cautionary tales of failures.</p>

<p>We are one. We are legion. And we're trying really hard not to forget.</p>

<p>We recently overhauled our internal tools for visualizing the compilation of JavaScript and WebAssembly. When SpiderMonkey’s optimizing compiler, Ion, is active, we can now produce interactive graphs showing exactly how functions are processed and optimized.</p>

<div id="livegraph-available">
  <p>You can play with these graphs right here on this page. Simply write some JavaScript code in the <code>test</code> function and see what graph is produced. You can click and drag to navigate, ctrl-scroll to zoom, and drag the slider at the bottom to scrub through the optimization process.</p>
  <p>As you experiment, take note of how stable the graph layout is, even as the sizes of blocks change or new structures are added. Try clicking a block's title to select it, then drag the slider and watch the graph change while the block remains in place. Or, click an instruction's number to highlight it so you can keep an eye on it across passes.</p>
</div>



<p><img id="livegraph-preview" alt="Example iongraph output" src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-preview.png"></p>



<p>We are not the first to visualize our compiler’s internal graphs, of course, nor the first to make them interactive. But I was not satisfied with the output of common tools like <a href="https://graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a> or <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a>, so I decided to create a layout algorithm specifically tailored to our needs. The resulting algorithm is simple, fast, produces surprisingly high-quality output, and can be implemented in less than a thousand lines of code. The purpose of this article is to walk you through this algorithm and the design concepts behind it.</p>

<p><i>Read this post on desktop to see an interactive demo of iongraph.</i></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>As readers of this blog already know, SpiderMonkey has several tiers of execution for JavaScript and WebAssembly code. The highest tier is known as Ion, an optimizing SSA compiler that takes the most time to compile but produces the highest-quality output.</p>

<p>Working with Ion frequently requires us to visualize and debug the SSA graph. Since 2011 we have used a tool for this purpose called <a href="https://github.com/sstangl/iongraph">iongraph</a>, built by Sean Stangl. It is a simple Python script that takes a JSON dump of our compiler graphs and uses Graphviz to produce a PDF. It is perfectly adequate, and very much the status quo for compiler authors, but unfortunately the Graphviz output has many problems that make our work tedious and frustrating.</p>

<p>The first problem is that the Graphviz output rarely bears any resemblance to the source code that produced it. Graphviz will place nodes wherever it feels will minimize error, resulting in a graph that snakes left and right seemingly at random. There is no visual intuition for how deeply nested a block of code is, nor is it easy to determine which blocks are inside or outside of loops. Consider the following function, and its Graphviz graph:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>!!</span><span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>%</span> <span>2</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x600DBEEF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>0xBADBEEF</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><img src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-example1-orig.svg">
</p>

<p>Counterintuitively, the <code>return</code> appears <em>before</em> the two assignments in the body of the loop. Since this graph mirrors JavaScript control flow, we’d expect to see the return at the bottom. This problem only gets worse as graphs grow larger and more complex.</p>

<p>The second, related problem is that Graphviz’s output is unstable. Small changes to the input can result in large changes to the output. As you page through the graphs of each pass within Ion, nodes will jump left and right, true and false branches will swap, loops will run up the right side instead of the left, and so on. This makes it very hard to understand the actual effect of any given pass. Consider the following before and after, and notice how the second graph is almost—but not quite—a mirror image of the first, despite very minimal changes to the graph’s structure:</p>

<div>
  <p><img src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-example2-before.svg">
    <img src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-example2-after.svg">
  </p>
</div>

<p>None of this felt right to me. Control flow graphs should be able to follow the structure of the program that produced them. After all, a control flow graph has many restrictions that a general-purpose tool would not be aware of: they have very few cycles, all of which are well-defined because they come from loops; furthermore, both JavaScript and WebAssembly have reducible control flow, meaning all loops have only one entry, and it is not possible to jump directly into the middle of a loop. This information could be used to our advantage.</p>

<p>Beyond that, a static PDF is far from ideal when exploring complicated graphs. Finding the inputs or uses of a given instruction is a tedious and frustrating exercise, as is following arrows from block to block. Even just zooming in and out is difficult. I eventually concluded that we ought to just build an interactive tool to overcome these limitations.</p>

<h2 id="how-hard-could-layout-be">How hard could layout be?</h2>

<p>I had one false start with graph layout, with an algorithm that attempted to sort blocks into vertical “tracks”. This broke down quickly on a variety of programs and I was forced to go back to the drawing board—in fact, back to the source of the very tool I was trying to replace.</p>

<p>The algorithm used by <code>dot</code>, the typical hierarchical layout mode for Graphviz, is known as the Sugiyama layout algorithm, from a 1981 paper by Sugiyama et al. As introduction, I found a short series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_FbSCWLC3A&amp;list=PLubYOWSl9mIvoXDwf_Wqcrvlg15N_AWQE&amp;index=38">lectures</a> that broke down the Sugiyama algorithm into 5 steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Cycle breaking</strong>, where the direction of some edges are flipped in order to produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Leveling</strong>, where vertices are assigned into horizontal layers according to their depth in the graph, and dummy vertices are added to any edge that crosses multiple layers.</li>
  <li><strong>Crossing minimization</strong>, where vertices on a layer are reordered in order to minimize the number of edge crossings.</li>
  <li><strong>Vertex positioning</strong>, where vertices are horizontally positioned in order to make the edges as straight as possible.</li>
  <li><strong>Drawing</strong>, where the final graph is rendered to the screen.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/kindermann.png" alt="A screenshot from the lectures, showing the five steps above"></p>

<p>These steps struck me as surprisingly straightforward, and provided useful opportunities to insert our own knowledge of the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cycle breaking would be trivial for us, since the only cycles in our data are loops, and loop backedges are explicitly labeled. We could simply ignore backedges when laying out the graph.</li>
  <li>Leveling would be straightforward, and could easily be modified to better mimic the source code. Specifically, any blocks coming after a loop in the source code could be artificially pushed down in the layout, solving the confusing early-exit problem.</li>
  <li>Permuting vertices to reduce edge crossings was actually just a bad idea, since our goal was stability from graph to graph. The true and false branches of a condition should always appear in the same order, for example, and a few edge crossings is a small price to pay for this stability.</li>
  <li>Since reducible control flow ensures that a program’s loops form a tree, vertex positioning could ensure that loops are always well-nested in the final graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>Taken all together, these simplifications resulted in a remarkably straightforward algorithm, with the <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/blob/fc27ee3e8f3bd3c020aaf2498de9a260da089bc1/src/Graph.ts">initial implementation</a> being just 1000 lines of JavaScript. (See this <a href="https://x.com/its_bvisness/status/1957565307809329465?s=46">demo</a> for what it looked like at the time.) It also proved to be very efficient, since it avoided the most computationally complex parts of the Sugiyama algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="iongraph-from-start-to-finish">iongraph from start to finish</h2>

<p>We will now go through the entire iongraph layout algorithm. Each section contains explanatory diagrams, in which rectangles are basic blocks and circles are dummy nodes. Loop header blocks (the single entry point to each loop) are additionally colored green.</p>

<p>Be aware that the block positions in these diagrams are not representative of the actual computed layout position at each point in the process. For example, vertical positions are not calculated until the very end, but it would be hard to communicate what the algorithm was doing if all blocks were drawn on a single line!</p>

<h3 id="step-1-layering">Step 1: Layering</h3>

<p>We first sort the basic blocks into horizontal tracks called “layers”. This is very simple; we just start at layer 0 and recursively walk the graph, incrementing the layer number as we go. As we go, we track the “height” of each loop, not in pixels, but in layers.</p>

<p>We also take this opportunity to vertically position nodes “inside” and “outside” of loops. Whenever we see an edge that exits a loop, we defer the layering of the destination block until we are done layering the loop contents, at which point we know the loop’s height.</p>

<p>A note on implementation: nodes are visited multiple times throughout the process, not just once. This can produce a quadratic explosion for large graphs, but I find that an early-out is sufficient to avoid this problem in practice.</p>

<p>The animation below shows the layering algorithm in action. Notice how the final block in the graph is visited twice, once after each loop that branches to it, and in each case, the block is deferred until the entire loop has been layered, rather than processed immediately after its predecessor block. The final position of the block is below the entirety of both loops, rather than directly below one of its predecessors as Graphviz would do. (Remember, horizontal and vertical positions have not yet been computed; the positions of the blocks in this diagram are hardcoded for demonstration purposes.)</p>

<h3 id="step-2-create-dummy-nodes">Step 2: Create dummy nodes</h3>

<p>Any time an edge crosses a layer, we create a dummy node. This allows edges to be routed across layers without overlapping any blocks. Unlike in traditional Sugiyama, we always put downward dummies on the left and upward dummies on the right, producing a consistent “counter-clockwise” flow. This also makes it easy to read long vertical edges, whose direction would otherwise be ambiguous. (Recall how the loop backedge flipped from the right to the left in the “unstable layout” Graphviz example from before.)</p>

<p>In addition, we coalesce any edges that are going to the same destination by merging their dummy nodes. This heavily reduces visual noise.</p>

<!--
Interesting program:

function test(n) {
  let result = 0;
  early:
  for (let i = n; i >= -10; i--) {
    if (i > 0) {
      switch (i % 3) {
        case 0:
          result += 1;
          break;
        case 1:
          result -= 1;
          break;
        case 2:
          result *= 3;
          break;
      }
    } else {
      result -= 2;
      break;
    }
    // result += 10;
  }
  return result;
}
-->




<h3 id="step-3-straighten-edges">Step 3: Straighten edges</h3>

<p>This is the fuzziest and most ad-hoc part of the process. Basically, we run lots of small passes that walk up and down the graph, aligning layout nodes with each other. Our edge-straightening passes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pushing nodes to the right of their loop header to “indent” them.</li>
  <li>Walking a layer left to right, moving children to the right to line up with their parents. If any nodes overlap as a result, they are pushed further to the right.</li>
  <li>Walking a layer right to left, moving parents to the right to line up with their children. This version is more conservative and will not move a node if it would overlap with another. This cleans up most issues from the first pass.</li>
  <li>Straightening runs of dummy nodes so we have clean vertical lines.</li>
  <li>“Sucking in” dummy runs on the left side of the graph if there is room for them to move to the right.</li>
  <li>Straighten out any edges that are “nearly straight”, according to a chosen threshold. This makes the graph appear less wobbly. We do this by repeatedly “combing” the graph upward and downward, aligning parents with children, then children with parents, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that dummy nodes participate fully in this system. If for example you have two side-by-side loops, straightening the left loop’s backedge will push the right loop to the side, avoiding overlaps and preserving the graph’s visual structure.</p>

<p>We do not reach a fixed point with this strategy, nor do we attempt to. I find that if you continue to repeatedly apply these particular layout passes, nodes will wander to the right forever. Instead, the layout passes are hand-tuned to produce decent-looking results for most of the graphs we look at on a regular basis. That said, this could certainly be improved, especially for larger graphs which do benefit from more iterations.</p>

<p>At the end of this step, all nodes have a fixed X-coordinate and will not be modified further.</p>







<h3 id="step-4-track-horizontal-edges">Step 4: Track horizontal edges</h3>

<p>Edges may overlap visually as they run horizontally between layers. To resolve this, we sort edges into parallel “tracks”, giving each a vertical offset. After tracking all the edges, we record the total height of the tracks and store it on the preceding layer as its “track height”. This allows us to leave room for the edges in the final layout step.</p>

<p>We first sort edges by their starting position, left to right. This produces a consistent arrangement of edges that has few vertical crossings in practice. Edges are then placed into tracks from the “outside in”, stacking rightward edges on top and leftward edges on the bottom, creating a new track if the edge would overlap with or cross any other edge.</p>

<p>The diagram below is interactive. Click and drag the blocks to see how the horizontal edges get assigned to tracks.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-verticalize">Step 5: Verticalize</h3>

<p>Finally, we assign each node a Y-coordinate. Starting at a Y-coordinate of zero, we iterate through the layers, repeatedly adding the layer’s height and its track height, where the layer height is the maximum height of any node in the layer. All nodes within a layer receive the same Y-coordinate; this is simple and easier to read than Graphviz’s default of vertically centering nodes within a layer.</p>

<p>Now that every node has both an X and Y coordinate, the layout process is complete.</p>

<h3 id="step-6-render">Step 6: Render</h3>

<p>The details of rendering are out of scope for this article, and depend on the specific application. However, I wish to highlight a stylistic decision that I feel makes our graphs more readable.</p>

<p>When rendering edges, we use a style inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_diagram">railroad diagrams</a>. These have many advantages over the Bézier curves employed by Graphviz. First, straight lines feel more organized and are easier to follow when scrolling up and down. Second, they are easy to route (vertical when crossing layers, horizontal between layers). Third, they are easy to coalesce when they share a destination, and the junctions provide a clear indication of the edge’s direction. Fourth, they always cross at right angles, improving clarity and reducing the need to avoid edge crossings in the first place.</p>

<p>Consider the following example. There are several edge crossings that may traditionally be considered undesirable—yet the edges and their directions remain clear. Of particular note is the vertical junction highlighted in red on the left: not only is it immediately clear that these edges share a destination, but the junction itself signals that the edges are flowing downward. I find this much more pleasant than the “rat’s nest” that Graphviz tends to produce.</p>

<p><img alt="Examples of railroad-diagram edges" src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-edge-examples-highlighted.png" width="716"></p>

<h2 id="why-does-this-work">Why does this work?</h2>

<p>It may seem surprising that such a simple (and stupid) layout algorithm could produce such readable graphs, when more sophisticated layout algorithms struggle. However, I feel that the algorithm succeeds <em>because</em> of its simplicity.</p>

<p>Most graph layout algorithms are optimization problems, where error is minimized on some chosen metrics. However, these metrics seem to correlate poorly to readability in practice. For example, it seems good in theory to rearrange nodes to minimize edge crossings. But a predictable order of nodes seems to produce more sensible results overall, and simple rules for edge routing are sufficient to keep things tidy. (As a bonus, this also gives us layout stability from pass to pass.) Similarly, layout rules like “align parents with their children” produce more readable results than “minimize the lengths of edges”.</p>

<p>Furthermore, by rejecting the optimization problem, a human author gains more control over the layout. We are able to position nodes “inside” of loops, and push post-loop content down in the graph, <em>because</em> we reject this global constraint-solver approach. Minimizing “error” is meaningless compared to a human <em>maximizing</em> meaning through thoughtful design.</p>

<p>And finally, the resulting algorithm is simply more efficient. All the layout passes in iongraph are easy to program and scale gracefully to large graphs because they run in roughly linear time. It is better, in my view, to run a fixed number of layout iterations according to your graph complexity and time budget, rather than to run a complex constraint solver until it is “done”.</p>

<p>By following this philosophy, even the worst graphs become tractable. Below is a screenshot of a zlib function, compiled to WebAssembly, and rendered using the old tool.</p>

<p><img alt="spaghetti nightmare!!" src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-spaghetti-nightmare.png"></p>

<p>It took about <strong>ten minutes</strong> for Graphviz to produce this spaghetti nightmare. By comparison, iongraph can now lay out this function in <strong>20 milliseconds</strong>. The result is still not particularly beautiful, but it renders thousands of times faster <em>and</em> is much easier to navigate.</p>

<p><img alt="better spaghetti" src="https://spidermonkey.dev/assets/img/iongraph-zlib.png"></p>

<p>Perhaps programmers ought to put less trust into magic optimizing systems, especially when a human-friendly result is the goal. Simple (and stupid) algorithms can be very effective when applied with discretion and taste.</p>

<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>

<p>We have already integrated iongraph into the Firefox profiler, making it easy for us to view the graphs of the most expensive or impactful functions we find in our performance work. Unfortunately, this is only available in specific builds of the SpiderMonkey shell, and is not available in full browser builds. This is due to architectural differences in how profiling data is captured and the flags with which the browser and shell are built. I would love for Firefox users to someday be able to view these graphs themselves, but at the moment we have no plans to expose this to the browser. However, one bug tracking some related work can be found <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1987005">here</a>.</p>

<p>We will continue to sporadically update iongraph with more features to aid us in our work. We have several ideas for new features, including <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/issues/9">richer navigation</a>, search, and visualization of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph/issues/4">register allocation info</a>. However, we have no explicit roadmap for when these features may be released.</p>

<p>To experiment with iongraph locally, you can run a debug build of the SpiderMonkey shell with <code>IONFLAGS=logs</code>; this will dump information to <code>/tmp/ion.json</code>. This file can then be loaded into the <a href="https://mozilla-spidermonkey.github.io/iongraph/">standalone deployment of iongraph</a>. Please be aware that the user experience is rough and unpolished in its current state.</p>

<p>The source code for iongraph can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-spidermonkey/iongraph">GitHub</a>. If this subject interests you, we would welcome contributions to iongraph and its integration into the browser. The best place to reach us is our <a href="https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#spidermonkey:mozilla.org">Matrix chat</a>.</p>

  <div dir="" data-test-bidi=""><p>uBO Lite (uBOL) is a reliable and efficient content blocker.</p><p>The default ruleset corresponds to uBlock Origin's default filterset:</p><p>- uBlock Origin's built-in filter lists<br>- EasyList<br>- EasyPrivacy<br>- Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list</p><p>You can enable more rulesets by visiting the options page -- click the _Cogs_ icon in the popup panel.</p><p>uBOL is entirely declarative, meaning there is no need for a permanent uBOL process for the filtering to occur, and CSS/JS injection-based content filtering is performed reliably by the browser itself rather than by the extension. This means that uBOL itself does not consume CPU/memory resources while content blocking is ongoing -- uBOL's service worker process is required _only_ when you interact with the popup panel or the option pages.</p></div>

The first TestFlight version had a big battery drain, but it’s better now on the official release. The only limitation is that we can’t add our own lists, but I am fine with the default lists ans it works perfect.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.j11y.io/2025-10-29_stroke_tips_for_engineers/">https://blog.j11y.io/2025-10-29_stroke_tips_for_engineers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45742419">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><p>2025-10-29</p><div>
<p>This is a pretty niche topic; I don't imagine there are many of us out there.</p>
<p>Actually, to be strict, I'd say this advice is tailored to people who've had hemorrhagic stroke in the parietal lobe with residual epilepsy...</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.j11y.io/post_imgs/stroke/main.png" alt="Brain/Head/Lightning/Eyes-closed - I drew this many years ago, before I knew what was to happen. Who knew..."></p><p>I was 29 and around 12 years into my career <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jamespadolsey/posts/pfbid0NSaR29y6QYRnBjvJyRwueDTuJx6Ef4bH3wUvEZ1W4rmqMTKbi4mFBviVs71qSLcwl">when it all happened</a>, and in the six years since then I've had time to learn a bit more about my new self.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first tip is to just stop. Fatigue, fuzziness, nausea, or affected-sided weird sensations are non-negotiable stop signals. So go lie down, hydrate, reset. Close your eyes and think about the cottage or lonely mountain you want to retire to. Escape the overwhelming mental or physical space. </p>
</li>
<li><p>HEADPHONES, blinders, and 'No'. Eliminate unwanted inputs at the earliest point of entry. Work from home or environments where you can control most variables. Routes of escape and rest are important.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Health above performance every single time. Metrics and productivity be damned. Self-advocate, and all that. Reject with directness any demands made of you that cross the threshold. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Laws. Use them. You don't have to rely on good behaviour and kindness. You are, depending on your location, usually protected by all types of anti-discrimination legislation, implicit and explicit. Use your employee assistance programs too.</p>

<li><p>Single-thread it all! Less context switching. Batch your work, finish one thing, then move to the next. Externalize working-memory. Use notebooks, whiteboards, and lists instead of juggling state in your head. I am not good at this, and over-stretch my brain, leading to auras, overwhelm, and general sickness. Terrible idea.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Related: Sssh to the AI naysayers. Use it as your help and scratchpad. Let it hold state so your brain can judge rather than store and needlessly cogitate on stuff. You don't have to do this alone out of some purity fetishism. You, too, have a limited context window. Sorry!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Do the heavy thinking in your peak window (for me, that's the morning); push everything else to later. Spend your time more carefully than your money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pick the route of least attention. Attention is expensive, and rarely needed as much as we think it is. It's a heavy toll to pay. Unless you're in an ops or monitoring role, you don't need to be synchronously active. DISABLE NOTIFICATIONS. </p>
</li>
<li><p>AVOID long meetings. Emails are good. Oh god am I bad at this? YES, I like people so I like some meetings, but communicating is so so expensive. Being polite is also expensive; It's not nice to have to tell people they're draining you.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that's mostly it. I'm still working on this stuff. And would probably grade myself pretty poorly. One day I'll be better at saying no, at advocating for myself, and knowing how to navigate the disappointment of others.</p>

<p><strong>Footnote &amp; some casual research</strong>: If you're into this, here's some stuff I found out related to my specific injury location and how it might apply to my work. This was gathered with help from gemini when I was struggling with left-arm and eye prodromes after long coding sessions:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-10-28</p><section><p>12 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1sJBsQ55nUSWxEq5SO0PS1/3265c773d1b11dafa78ea7e17354d408/image2.png" alt=""><div><p>The world is in a race to build its first quantum computer capable of solving practical problems not feasible on even the largest conventional supercomputers. While the quantum computing paradigm promises many benefits, it also threatens the security of the Internet by breaking much of the cryptography we have come to rely on.</p><p>To mitigate this threat, Cloudflare is helping to migrate the Internet to Post-Quantum (PQ) cryptography. Today, <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption"><u>about 50%</u></a> of traffic to Cloudflare's edge network is protected against the most urgent threat: an attacker who can intercept and store encrypted traffic today and then decrypt it in the future with the help of a quantum computer. This is referred to as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now,_decrypt_later"><u>harvest now, decrypt later</u></a><i> </i>threat.</p><p>However, this is just one of the threats we need to address. A quantum computer can also be used to crack a server's <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/"><u>TLS</u></a> certificate, allowing an attacker to impersonate the server to unsuspecting clients. The good news is that we already have PQ algorithms we can use for quantum-safe authentication. The bad news is that adoption of these algorithms in TLS will require significant changes to one of the most complex and security-critical systems on the Internet: the Web Public-Key Infrastructure (WebPKI).</p><p>The central problem is the sheer size of these new algorithms: signatures for ML-DSA-44, one of the most performant PQ algorithms standardized by NIST, are 2,420 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA-P256, the most popular non-PQ signature in use today; and its public keys are 1,312 bytes long, compared to just 64 bytes for ECDSA. That's a roughly 20-fold increase in size. Worse yet, the average TLS handshake includes a number of public keys and signatures, adding up to 10s of kilobytes of overhead per handshake. This is enough to have a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/another-look-at-pq-signatures/#how-many-added-bytes-are-too-many-for-tls"><u>noticeable impact</u></a> on the performance of TLS.</p><p>That makes drop-in PQ certificates a tough sell to enable today: they don’t bring any security benefit before Q-day — the day a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives — but they do degrade performance. We could sit and wait until Q-day is a year away, but that’s playing with fire. Migrations always take longer than expected, and by waiting we risk the security and privacy of the Internet, which is <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/"><u>dear to us</u></a>.</p><p>It's clear that we must find a way to make post-quantum certificates cheap enough to deploy today by default for everyone — not just those that can afford it. In this post, we'll introduce you to the plan we’ve brought together with industry partners to the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/plants/about/"><u>IETF</u></a> to redesign the WebPKI in order to allow a smooth transition to PQ authentication with no performance impact (and perhaps a performance improvement!). We'll provide an overview of one concrete proposal, called <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs)</u></a>, whose goal is to whittle down the number of public keys and signatures in the TLS handshake to the bare minimum required.</p><p>But talk is cheap. We <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/experiment-with-pq/"><u>know</u></a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/"><u>from</u></a> <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/"><u>experience</u></a> that, as with any change to the Internet, it's crucial to test early and often. <b>Today we're announcing our intent to deploy MTCs on an experimental basis in collaboration with Chrome Security.</b> In this post, we'll describe the scope of this experiment, what we hope to learn from it, and how we'll make sure it's done safely.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="the-webpki-today-an-old-system-with-many-patches">The WebPKI today — an old system with many patches</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Why does the TLS handshake have so many public keys and signatures?</p><p>Let's start with Cryptography 101. When your browser connects to a website, it asks the server to <b>authenticate</b> itself to make sure it's talking to the real server and not an impersonator. This is usually achieved with a cryptographic primitive known as a digital signature scheme (e.g., ECDSA or ML-DSA). In TLS, the server signs the messages exchanged between the client and server using its <b>secret key</b>, and the client verifies the signature using the server's <b>public key</b>. In this way, the server confirms to the client that they've had the same conversation, since only the server could have produced a valid signature.</p><p>If the client already knows the server's public key, then only <b>1 signature</b> is required to authenticate the server. In practice, however, this is not really an option. The web today is made up of around a billion TLS servers, so it would be unrealistic to provision every client with the public key of every server. What's more, the set of public keys will change over time as new servers come online and existing ones rotate their keys, so we would need some way of pushing these changes to clients.</p><p>This scaling problem is at the heart of the design of all PKIs.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="trust-is-transitive">Trust is transitive</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Instead of expecting the client to know the server's public key in advance, the server might just send its public key during the TLS handshake. But how does the client know that the public key actually belongs to the server? This is the job of a <b>certificate</b>.</p><p>A certificate binds a public key to the identity of the server — usually its DNS name, e.g., <code>cloudflareresearch.com</code>. The certificate is signed by a Certification Authority (CA) whose public key is known to the client. In addition to verifying the server's handshake signature, the client verifies the signature of this certificate. This establishes a chain of trust: by accepting the certificate, the client is trusting that the CA verified that the public key actually belongs to the server with that identity.</p><p>Clients are typically configured to trust many CAs and must be provisioned with a public key for each. Things are much easier however, since there are only 100s of CAs instead of billions. In addition, new certificates can be created without having to update clients.</p><p>These efficiencies come at a relatively low cost: for those counting at home, that's <b>+1</b> signature and <b>+1</b> public key, for a total of <b>2 signatures and 1 public key</b> per TLS handshake.</p><p>That's not the end of the story, however. As the WebPKI has evolved, so have these chains of trust grown a bit longer. These days it's common for a chain to consist of two or more certificates rather than just one. This is because CAs sometimes need to rotate<b> </b>their keys, just as servers do. But before they can start using the new key, they must distribute the corresponding public key to clients. This takes time, since it requires billions of clients to update their trust stores. To bridge the gap, the CA will sometimes use the old key to issue a certificate for the new one and append this certificate to the end of the chain.</p><p>That's<b> +1</b> signature and<b> +1</b> public key, which brings us to<b> 3 signatures and 2 public keys</b>. And we still have a little ways to go.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="trust-but-verify">Trust but verify</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The main job of a CA is to verify that a server has control over the domain for which it’s requesting a certificate. This process has evolved over the years from a high-touch, CA-specific process to a standardized, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/"><u>mostly automated process</u></a> used for issuing most certificates on the web. (Not all CAs fully support automation, however.) This evolution is marked by a number of security incidents in which a certificate was <b>mis-issued </b>to a party other than the server, allowing that party to impersonate the server to any client that trusts the CA.</p><p>Automation helps, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar#Issuance_of_fraudulent_certificates"><u>attacks</u></a> are still possible, and mistakes are almost inevitable. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unauthorized-issuance-of-certificates-for-1-1-1-1/"><u>Earlier this year</u></a>, several certificates for Cloudflare's encrypted 1.1.1.1 resolver were issued without our involvement or authorization. This apparently occurred by accident, but it nonetheless put users of 1.1.1.1 at risk. (The mis-issued certificates have since been revoked.)</p><p>Ensuring mis-issuance is detectable is the job of the Certificate Transparency (CT) ecosystem. The basic idea is that each certificate issued by a CA gets added to a public <b>log</b>. Servers can audit these logs for certificates issued in their name. If ever a certificate is issued that they didn't request itself, the server operator can prove the issuance happened, and the PKI ecosystem can take action to prevent the certificate from being trusted by clients.</p><p>Major browsers, including Firefox and Chrome and its derivatives, require certificates to be logged before they can be trusted. For example, Chrome, Safari, and Firefox will only accept the server's certificate if it appears in at least two logs the browser is configured to trust. This policy is easy to state, but tricky to implement in practice:</p><ol><li><p>Operating a CT log has historically been fairly expensive. Logs ingest billions of certificates over their lifetimes: when an incident happens, or even just under high load, it can take some time for a log to make a new entry available for auditors.</p></li><li><p>Clients can't really audit logs themselves, since this would expose their browsing history (i.e., the servers they wanted to connect to) to the log operators.</p></li></ol><p>The solution to both problems is to include a signature from the CT log along with the certificate. The signature is produced immediately in response to a request to log a certificate, and attests to the log's intent to include the certificate in the log within 24 hours.</p><p>Per browser policy, certificate transparency adds <b>+2</b> signatures to the TLS handshake, one for each log. This brings us to a total of <b>5 signatures and 2 public keys</b> in a typical handshake on the public web.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="the-future-webpki">The future WebPKI</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>The WebPKI is a living, breathing, and highly distributed system. We've had to patch it a number of times over the years to keep it going, but on balance it has served our needs quite well — until now.</p><p>Previously, whenever we needed to update something in the WebPKI, we would tack on another signature. This strategy has worked because conventional cryptography is so cheap. But <b>5 signatures and 2 public keys </b>on average for each TLS handshake is simply too much to cope with for the larger PQ signatures that are coming.</p><p>The good news is that by moving what we already have around in clever ways, we can drastically reduce the number of signatures we need.</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="crash-course-on-merkle-tree-certificates">Crash course on Merkle Tree Certificates</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs/"><u>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs)</u></a> is a proposal for the next generation of the WebPKI that we are implementing and plan to deploy on an experimental basis. Its key features are as follows:</p><ol><li><p>All the information a client needs to validate a Merkle Tree Certificate can be disseminated out-of-band. If the client is sufficiently up-to-date, then the TLS handshake needs just <b>1 signature, 1 public key, and 1 Merkle tree inclusion proof</b>. This is quite small, even if we use post-quantum algorithms.</p></li><li><p>The MTC specification makes certificate transparency a first class feature of the PKI by having each CA run its own log of exactly the certificates they issue.</p></li></ol><p>Let's poke our head under the hood a little. Below we have an MTC generated by one of our internal tests. This would be transmitted from the server to the client in the TLS handshake:</p>

            <p>While some of the parameters probably look familiar, others will look unusual. On the familiar side, the subject and public key are exactly what we might expect: the DNS name is <code>cloudflareresearch.com</code> and the public key is for a familiar signature algorithm, ECDSA-P256. This algorithm is not PQ, of course — in the future we would put ML-DSA-44 there instead.</p><p>On the unusual side, OpenSSL appears to not recognize the signature algorithm of the issuer and just prints the raw OID and bytes of the signature. There's a good reason for this: the MTC does not have a signature in it at all! So what exactly are we looking at?</p><p>The trick to leave out signatures is that a Merkle Tree Certification Authority (MTCA) produces its <i>signatureless</i> certificates <i>in batches</i> rather than individually. In place of a signature, the certificate has an <b>inclusion proof</b> of the certificate in a batch of certificates signed by the MTCA.</p><p>To understand how inclusion proofs work, let's think about a slightly simplified version of the MTC specification. To issue a batch, the MTCA arranges the unsigned certificates into a data structure called a <b>Merkle tree</b> that looks like this:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4LGhISsS07kbpSgDkqx8p2/68e3b36deeca7f97139654d2c769df68/image3.png" alt="" width="1494" height="1026" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Each leaf of the tree corresponds to a certificate, and each inner node is equal to the hash of its children. To sign the batch, the MTCA uses its secret key to sign the head of the tree. The structure of the tree guarantees that each certificate in the batch was signed by the MTCA: if we tried to tweak the bits of any one of the certificates, the treehead would end up having a different value, which would cause the signature to fail.</p><p>An inclusion proof for a certificate consists of the hash of each sibling node along the path from the certificate to the treehead:</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4UZZHkRwsBLWXRYeop4rXv/8598cde48c27c112bc4992889f3d5799/image1.gif" alt="" width="1494" height="1026" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>Given a validated treehead, this sequence of hashes is sufficient to prove inclusion of the certificate in the tree. This means that, in order to validate an MTC, the client also needs to obtain the signed treehead from the MTCA.</p><p>This is the key to MTC's efficiency:</p><ol><li><p>Signed treeheads can be disseminated to clients out-of-band and validated offline. Each validated treehead can then be used to validate any certificate in the corresponding batch, eliminating the need to obtain a signature for each server certificate.</p></li><li><p>During the TLS handshake, the client tells the server which treeheads it has. If the server has a signatureless certificate covered by one of those treeheads, then it can use that certificate to authenticate itself. That's <b>1 signature,1 public key and 1 inclusion proof</b> per handshake, both for the server being authenticated.</p></li></ol><p>Now, that's the simplified version. MTC proper has some more bells and whistles. To start, it doesn’t create a separate Merkle tree for each batch, but it grows a single large tree, which is used for better transparency. As this tree grows, periodically (sub)tree heads are selected to be shipped to browsers, which we call <b>landmarks</b>. In the common case browsers will be able to fetch the most recent landmarks, and servers can wait for batch issuance, but we need a fallback: MTC also supports certificates that can be issued immediately and don’t require landmarks to be validated, but these are not as small. A server would provision both types of Merkle tree certificates, so that the common case is fast, and the exceptional case is slow, but at least it’ll work.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="experimental-deployment">Experimental deployment</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>Ever since early designs for MTCs emerged, we’ve been eager to experiment with the idea. In line with the IETF principle of “<a href="https://www.ietf.org/runningcode/"><u>running code</u></a>”, it often takes implementing a protocol to work out kinks in the design. At the same time, we cannot risk the security of users. In this section, we describe our approach to experimenting with aspects of the Merkle Tree Certificates design <i>without</i> changing any trust relationships.</p><p>Let’s start with what we hope to learn. We have lots of questions whose answers can help to either validate the approach, or uncover pitfalls that require reshaping the protocol — in fact, an implementation of an early MTC draft by <a href="https://www.cs.ru.nl/masters-theses/2025/M_Pohl___Implementation_and_Analysis_of_Merkle_Tree_Certificates_for_Post-Quantum_Secure_Authentication_in_TLS.pdf"><u>Maximilian Pohl</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-davidben-tls-merkle-tree-certs-07.html#name-acknowledgements"><u>Mia Celeste</u></a> did exactly this. We’d like to know:</p><p><b>What breaks?</b> Protocol ossification (the tendency of implementation bugs to make it harder to change a protocol) is an ever-present issue with deploying protocol changes. For TLS in particular, despite having built-in flexibility, time after time we’ve found that if that flexibility is not regularly used, there will be buggy implementations and middleboxes that break when they see things they don’t recognize. TLS 1.3 deployment <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-tls-1-3-isnt-in-browsers-yet/"><u>took years longer</u></a> than we hoped for this very reason. And more recently, the rollout of PQ key exchange in TLS caused the Client Hello to be split over multiple TCP packets, something that many middleboxes <a href="https://tldr.fail/"><u>weren't ready for</u></a>.</p><p><b>What is the performance impact?</b> In fact, we expect MTCs to <i>reduce </i>the size of the handshake, even compared to today's non-PQ certificates. They will also reduce CPU cost: ML-DSA signature verification is about as fast as ECDSA, and there will be far fewer signatures to verify. We therefore expect to see a <i>reduction in latency</i>. We would like to see if there is a measurable performance improvement.</p><p><b>What fraction of clients will stay up to date? </b>Getting the performance benefit of MTCs requires the clients and servers to be roughly in sync with one another. We expect MTCs to have fairly short lifetimes, a week or so. This means that if the client's latest landmark is older than a week, the server would have to fallback to a larger certificate. Knowing how often this fallback happens will help us tune the parameters of the protocol to make fallbacks less likely.</p><p>In order to answer these questions, we are implementing MTC support in our TLS stack and in our certificate issuance infrastructure. For their part, Chrome is implementing MTC support in their own TLS stack and will stand up infrastructure to disseminate landmarks to their users.</p><p>As we've done in past experiments, we plan to enable MTCs for a subset of our free customers with enough traffic that we will be able to get useful measurements. Chrome will control the experimental rollout: they can ramp up slowly, measuring as they go and rolling back if and when bugs are found.</p><p>Which leaves us with one last question: who will run the Merkle Tree CA?</p>
    <p>
      <h3 id="bootstrapping-trust-from-the-existing-webpki">Bootstrapping trust from the existing WebPKI</h3>
      
    </p>
    <p>Standing up a proper CA is no small task: it takes years to be trusted by major browsers. That’s why Cloudflare isn’t going to become a “real” CA for this experiment, and Chrome isn’t going to trust us directly.</p><p>Instead, to make progress on a reasonable timeframe, without sacrificing due diligence, we plan to "mock" the role of the MTCA. We will run an MTCA (on <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/azul/"><u>Workers</u></a> based on our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/azul-certificate-transparency-log/"><u>StaticCT logs</u></a>), but for each MTC we issue, we also publish an existing certificate from a trusted CA that agrees with it. We call this the <b>bootstrap certificate</b>. When Chrome’s infrastructure pulls updates from our MTCA log, they will also pull these bootstrap certificates, and check whether they agree. Only if they do, they’ll proceed to push the corresponding landmarks to Chrome clients. In other words, Cloudflare is effectively just “re-encoding” an existing certificate (with domain validation performed by a trusted CA) as an MTC, and Chrome is using certificate transparency to keep us honest.</p>
    <p>
      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      
    </p>
    <p>With almost 50% of our traffic already protected by post-quantum encryption, we’re halfway to a fully post-quantum secure Internet. The second part of our journey, post-quantum certificates, is the hardest yet though. A simple drop-in upgrade has a noticeable performance impact and no security benefit before Q-day. This means it’s a hard sell to enable today by default. But here we are playing with fire: migrations always take longer than expected. If we want to keep an ubiquitously private and secure Internet, we need a post-quantum solution that’s performant enough to be enabled by default <b>today</b>.</p><p>Merkle Tree Certificates (MTCs) solves this problem by reducing the number of signatures and public keys to the bare minimum while maintaining the WebPKI's essential properties. We plan to roll out MTCs to a fraction of free accounts by early next year. This does not affect any visitors that are not part of the Chrome experiment. For those that are, thanks to the bootstrap certificates, there is no impact on security.</p><p>We’re excited to keep the Internet fast <i>and</i> secure, and will report back soon on the results of this experiment: watch this space!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tor Browser 15.0 is now available from the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/">Tor Browser download page</a> and <a href="https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/15.0/">distribution directory</a>. This is our first stable release based on <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/firefox/140.0esr/releasenotes/">Firefox ESR 140</a>, incorporating a year's worth of changes that have been shipped upstream in Firefox. As part of this process, we've also completed our annual ESR transition audit, where we <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&amp;state=all&amp;label_name%5B%5D=esr-140&amp;search=Review%20Mozilla&amp;first_page_size=20">reviewed and addressed around 200 Bugzilla issues</a> for changes in Firefox that may negatively affect the privacy and security of Tor Browser users. Our final reports from this audit are now available in the <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser-spec/-/tree/main/audits">tor-browser-spec repository</a> on our GitLab instance.</p>

<h2>What's new?</h2>
<h3>Desktop</h3>
<p>Tor Browser 15.0 inherits a multitude of useful new features and usability improvements from Firefox that have passed our audit. For desktop, these include vertical tabs: providing a more manageable, alternative layout with open and pinned tabs stacked in a sidebar rather than across the top of the window. For ease of access, Bookmarks can be retrieved directly from the sidebar when expanded too. However, regardless of whether you prefer horizontal or vertical tabs, everyone  benefits from the addition of tab groups: helping you keep on top of the clutter by organizing tabs into collapsible groups that can be given names and color-coded. Tor Browser 15.0 also inherits elements of Firefox's recent address bar refresh, including a new unified search button that allows you to switch search engines on the fly, search bookmarks or tabs, and reference quick actions from the same menu.</p>
<p>Note that Tor Browser tabs are still private tabs, and will clear when you close the browser. This enforces a kind of natural tidiness in Tor Browser since each new session starts fresh – however for privacy-conscious power users, project managers, researchers, or anyone else who accumulates tabs frighteningly quickly, we hope these organizational improvements will give you a much needed productivity boost.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-150/150-desktop.png" alt="A screenshot featuring Tor Browser for Desktop with vertical tabs enabled and three tab groups present in the resulting sidebar"></p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<p>On Android, screen lock adds an extra layer of security to your browsing sessions. After enabling screen lock in Settings &gt; Tabs, your tabs will lock automatically when you switch away from the browser without closing it. Upon returning to the app, you'll be prompted to unlock your tabs using your fingerprint, face, or pass code, depending on which option your device is configured to use.</p>
<p>Like Tor Browser for Desktop, your browsing session will still be cleared when Tor Browser is closed. However, this feature provides peace of mind in a specific scenario: by ensuring that your browsing remains private even if someone has gained temporary access to your unlocked phone with Tor Browser open in the background – whether you've handed it to a friend, or left your device sitting on a table.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.torproject.org/new-release-tor-browser-150/150-android.png" alt="A screenshot demonstrating screen lock for Tor Browser on an Android phone, followed by a second screenshot of a passcode being entered"></p>
<h2>What's changing?</h2>
<h3>Updates to Android and Linux device compatibility</h3>
<p>At present, Firefox 140 and Tor Browser 15.0 support Android 5.0 or later, which was released almost 11 years ago. While Mozilla's commitment to support such an old version of Android is admirable, it introduces several technical and security challenges for developers. As a consequence, Firefox have announced their intention to increase the minimum support requirements to Android 8.0, and have also decided to drop support for x86 CPUs for <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2025/09/15/raising-the-minimum-android-version-for-firefox/">Android</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-has-ended-support-32-bit-linux">Linux</a>. Sadly, it's not possible for the Tor Project to maintain support for these platforms on our own without official support from Mozilla.</p>
<p>While these changes won't impact Tor Browser users immediately, we expect them to take effect with the release of Tor Browser 16.0 mid-next year. This means that Tor Browser 15.0 will be the last major release to support x86 for Linux and Android, in addition to Android 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. However, we will continue to release minor updates with security fixes for these platforms until Tor Browser 16.0's eventual release.</p>
<p>Although nobody wants to see support for their platform get dropped, it's an important step to maintain the stability and security of both Firefox and Tor Browser over time, and will allow developers to utilize newer technologies in both browsers. In addition, supporting x86 for Android has been particularly challenging for our developers due to the 100MB package size limit imposed by Google Play. While we have deployed several workarounds to stay within this limit in the recent past, these often come at a cost – such as x86 Android users missing out on the Conjure pluggable transport, for example.</p>
<h3>Disabling of WebAssembly now managed by NoScript</h3>
<p>WebAssembly (or Wasm) is a web technology that helps websites and web apps run faster. It allows web developers to write programs in languages like C, C++ or Rust, and compiles these into a special format that web browsers can run more efficiently.</p>
<p>As has been suggested in <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.12297v1">this meta-analysis from 2024</a>, further investigation of Wasm's potential exploits is necessary – therefore Wasm is currently disabled in the Safer and Safest security levels in order to reduce Tor Browser's attack surface. Up until now, this was achieved by setting the global preference <code>javascript.options.wasm</code> to false – however this approach was no longer viable after Mozilla implemented part of their PDF reader in Wasm between versions 128 and 140. Consequently, we have decided to move control of Wasm to NoScript, which is bundled with Tor Browser, and already manages JavaScript and other security features. This means that Wasm now works on privileged browser pages such as the PDF renderer, but NoScript will continue blocking the technology on regular websites at the Safer and Safest security levels.</p>
<p>Users who have manually set <code>javascript.options.wasm</code> to "false" while in the Standard security level will see their security level represented as "Custom" instead. To mitigate any issues that may arise with the browser's PDF reader, we encourage those users to switch the preference back to "true", thereby passing management of Wasm over to NoScript. Furthermore, manually disabling Wasm at the Standard security level (either via NoScript or <code>javascript.options/wasm</code>) may also <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/anti-fingerprinting/">make your fingerprint more unique</a> by deviating from Tor Browser's default configuration. To avoid this scenario, we recommend sticking with one of the <a href="https://tb-manual.torproject.org/security-settings/">pre-defined security levels</a> and caution users against making further changes to individual preferences in about:config.</p>
<p>Alternatively, should you wish to keep Wasm disabled in future, we invite you to increase your security level to Safer or Safest going forward. Note that both Safer and Safest users may notice <code>javascript.options.wasm</code> switch to "true" automatically as management of Wasm is passed over to and blocked by NoScript, meaning that you are still protected regardless. In addition, Safest users in particular are not vulnerable to any potential vulnerabilities introduced by Wasm since the format requires JavaScript to work.</p>
<h2>Known issues</h2>
<p>Tor Browser 15.0 comes with a number of known issues that can be found in <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues">Tor Browser's issue tracker</a>. In particular, we would like to highlight the following:</p>
<h3>Desktop</h3>
<p>The initial release of vertical tabs in Tor Browser includes a couple of quirks:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the sidebar is visible (such as when vertical tabs are enabled), the window may visibly resize when Tor Browser is launched.</li>
<li>Due to variations in window size, <a href="https://support.torproject.org/tbb/maximized-torbrowser-window/">Letterboxing</a> may be visible. You still get the anti-fingerprinting protections provided by Letterboxing, but the default window size will be different than intended.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are currently working to issue a fix for both of these bugs. Please see <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/44096">tor-browser#44096</a> for details.</p>
<h3>Android</h3>
<ul>
<li>Web pages may not load after updating Tor Browser on older versions of Android. This can be fixed by clearing your app cache manually in <code>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Tor Browser &gt; Storage &amp; cache</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-hindsight">In Hindsight</h2>
<p>Growing up, I never stuck to a single thing, be it guitar lessons, art school, martial arts – I tried them all. when it came to programming, though, I never really tinkered. I was always amazed with video games and wondered how they were made but I never pursued that curiosity.</p>
<p>My tinkering habits picked up very late, and now I cannot go by without picking up new things in one form or another. It’s how I learn. I wish I did it sooner. It’s a major part of my learning process now, and I would never be the <s>programmer</s> person I am today.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-hell-is-tinkering">What the hell is tinkering?</h2>
<p>Have you ever spent hours tweaking the mouse sensitivity in your favorite FPS game?</p>
<p>Have you ever installed a Linux distro, spent days configuring window managers, not because you had to, but purely because it gave you satisfaction and made your workflow exactly yours?</p>
<p>Ever pulled apart your mechanical keyboard, swapped keycaps, tested switches, and lubed stabilizers just for more thock?</p>
<p>That is what I mean.</p>
<p>I have come to understand that there are two kinds of people, those who do things only if it helps them achieve a goal, and those who do things just because. The ideal, of course, is to be a mix of both.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you tinker and throw away, that’s practice, and practice should inherently be ephemeral, exploratory, and be frequent - <a href="https://x.com/ludwigABAP/status/1842366186824032737"><span data-cites="ludwigABAP">@ludwigABAP</span></a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="my-approach-to-tinkering">My approach to tinkering</h2>
<p>There are plenty of people who still use the VSCode terminal as their default terminal, do not know what vim bindings are, GitHub desktop rather than the cli (at the very least). I’m not saying these are bad things necessarily, just that this should be the minimum, not the median.</p>
<p>This does not mean I spend every waking hour fiddling with my neovim config. In fact, the last meaningful change to my config was 6 months ago. Finding that balance is where most people fail.</p>
<p>Over the years I have done so many things that in hindsight have made me appreciate programming more but were completely “unnecessary” in the strict sense.</p>
<p>In the past week I have, for the first time, written a glsl fragment shader, a rust procedural macro, template c++, a swift app, furthered my hatred for windows development (this is not new), and started using the helix editor more (mainly for good defaults + speed). I didn’t have to do these things, but I did, for fun! And I know more about these things now.</p>
<p>No time spent learning, is time wasted.</p>
<h2 id="why-taste-matters-especially-now">Why taste matters, especially now</h2>
<p>Acquiring good taste comes through using various things, discarding the ones you don’t like and keeping the ones you do. if you never try various things, you will not acquire good taste.</p>
<p>And what I mean by taste here is simply the honed ability to distinguish mediocrity from excellence. This will be highly subjective, and not everyone’s taste will be the same, but that is the point, you should NOT have the same taste as someone else.</p>
<p>Question the status quo, experiment, break things, do this several times, do this everyday and keep doing it.</p>

<p>We are coming up on five years since the first M1 Macs shipped. It was an incredible time to be a Mac user. Those first Apple silicon Macs <em>looked</em> like the Intel machines they replaced, but they were better in every single way.</p>
<p>In December 2020, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/m1_macs_truth_and_truthiness">John Gruber wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We knew this to be true: Computers could run fast and hot, or slow and cool. For laptops in particular, the best you could hope for is a middle ground: fast enough and cool enough. But if you wanted a machine that ran really fast, it wasn’t going to run cool (and wasn’t going to last long on battery), and if you wanted a computer that ran cool (and lasted long on battery), it wasn’t going to be fast.</p>
<p>  We knew this to be true because that was the way things were. But now, with the M1 Macs, it’s not. M1 Macs run very fast and do so while remaining very cool and lasting mind-bogglingly long on battery. It was a fundamental trade-off inherent to PC computing, and now we don’t have to make it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite its Touch Bar, I immediately bought that first M1 MacBook Pro, and when the 14-inch MacBook Pro came out a year later, I moved to it.<sup id="fnref-34213-fn-14mbp"><a href="#fn-34213-fn-14mbp" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup> I’m typing these very words on my 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 Max inside. Each of these machines was faster than the one before it, outperforming my old iMac Pro and Mac Pro in new ways with every upgrade.</p>
<p>Apple silicon has been nothing but upside for the Mac, and yet some seem bored already. In the days since Apple announced the M5, I’ve seen and heard this sentiment more than I expected:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This is just another boring incremental upgrade.
</p></blockquote>
<p>That 👏 is 👏 the 👏 point.</p>
<p>Back in the PowerPC and Intel days, Macs would sometimes go <em>years</em> between meaningful spec bumps, as Apple waited on its partners to deliver appropriate hardware for various machines. From failing NVIDIA cards in MacBook Pros to 27-inch Intel iMacs that ran so hot the fans were audible at all times, Mac hardware wasn’t always what Apple wanted.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the issues with previous generations of Mac were Apple’s fault — look no further than the butterfly keyboard or the years the Mac Pro spent in the wilderness. Apple will make questionable decisions in the future, just as it has in the past.</p>
<p>The difference is that with Apple silicon, Apple owns and controls the primary technologies behind the products it makes, <a href="https://asymco.com/2011/01/17/the-cook-doctrine/">as Tim Cook has always wanted</a>. It means that it can ship updates to its SoCs on a regular cadence, making progress in terms of both power and efficiency each time.</p>
<p>A predictable update schedule means that incremental updates are inevitable. <em>Revolution</em> then <em>evolution</em> is not a bad thing; it’s okay that not every release is exciting or groundbreaking. It’s how technology has worked for decades.</p>
<p>…but some people have short memories. Before the Apple silicon introduction, we all wanted steady, predictable progress in Mac hardware development. We wanted each product in the lineup to be updated regularly and not wither on the vine for years. For <a href="https://512pixels.net/2023/06/the-new-new-mac-pro/">the <em>most</em> part</a>, Apple has delivered. Just look at this chart of the progress Apple has made since the M1:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m1-m5-cpu-chart.png" alt="CPU Geekbench 6 Scores"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://512pixels.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/m1-m5-gpu-chart.png" alt="GPU Geekbench 6 Scores"></p>
<p>I don’t see anything in those charts to complain about, especially given the frequency at which most people buy new computers. That’s one reason why Apple compared the M5 to the M1 in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/">its press release announcing the new chip</a>. Unless you buy a new computer every year, every update you experience will be meaningful.</p>
<p>That’s what we wanted when Apple announced the move away from Intel, and calling it boring five years in is missing the point and downplaying the success of Apple silicon thus far.</p>

<p>One day on my drive home, I saw three towers. One of them had a bunch of blinking white lights, another one had red lights that kind of faded in and out, and the third one, well, it wasn't doing anything. I'm lucky to have a radio engineer for a dad, so Dad: <em>why do some towers blink?</em></p>

<p>Joe: Well, blinking I would call like the way you described it, "flashing", "white light", or "strobe". All these lights are to aid pilots and air traffic. helicopters, fighter planes, regular jets. So that's the purpose of it.</p>

<p>Jeff: Well that one tower that I saw had red lights that faded in and out, but I even think there's a freestanding tower just north of here that has red and white on top.</p>

<p>Joe: Well red lighting is a thing. It's in the regulations, it specifies red lighting or white lighting, and one of the things like the red lights can be a bulb like this inside of a red housing, could be LED.</p>

<h2>Giant Bulbs</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/giant-620w-tower-beacon-light-bulb-lamp.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-2ee38521-2172-4b55-b44c-1f8323b27f43" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;2ee38521-2172-4b55-b44c-1f8323b27f43&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="620W large tower beacon light bulb"></p>

<p>Jeff: Where'd you find this bulb? This was not in my studio.</p>

<p>Joe: This bulb is a spare bulb for a tower site. And most of us use the same bulb, same socket, 620 watts. It's a very standard broadcast bulb for a broadcast tower. And a lot of the beacons, they're pretty tall and they'll have one right-side up, and one upside-down. So they'll have two bulbs in the socket. That way, when one bulb burns out, you realize you have a bulb out, but you're still legal with the second bulb.</p>

<p>Jeff: At my house, I don't have any of this kind of bulb anymore [incandescent]. I have, you know, this is a little bit different size, these are LED. Is that similar on towers?</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. So it is the same. Like an <a href="https://pr-tech.com/product/l-864865-dual-beacon/">LED assembly for a tower</a> could be kind of flat, and it has, you know, it's set to just do what it needs to do. So in like white light, that's, typically it used to be always strobes. And at KMOX, you remember we had the whole assembly there. and you see the glass bulb, with xenon gas inside.</p>

<p>So those were the old way for that, but the newer ones are all white LED, and they can be little pancake-looking things compared to what the things are now. They can direct that LED light really to help airplanes and have less trouble for people who live in homes or apartment buildings nearby.</p>

<p>Jeff: So if they have a tower like the one that's just north of here that's in a residential area, you're not just flashing everybody constantly.</p>

<p>Joe: Yes, yes.</p>

<h2>Red light, white light?</h2>

<p>Jeff: You know, thinking about that tower, though, why do different towers have different lighting and different colors and things? And I even remember, like, on the tower that's right by here, there's actually teeny tiny little lights that are, like, on the sides, on the legs of the tower.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/side-markers-kdnl-tv-tower.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-7088cf8a-87ea-4f68-919d-a7e2f6b05f61" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;7088cf8a-87ea-4f68-919d-a7e2f6b05f61&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="KDNL-TV tower side marker red lights"></p>

<p>Joe: Yeah, well, tower lighting is in the responsibility of FAA, and they have a detailed plan. The options depend on the heights of the tower, where they are at. The location is obviously important. And sometimes red is a good solution, sometimes white, and sometimes both, red and white solution. And an example is the tower that you're talking about.</p>

<p>Jeff: So why would you want both? It seems like that's twice the complexity.</p>

<p>Joe: You would have strobe in the day and red at night. And people in their homes at night, a pulsing red light is a lot easier than a big flashing white light.</p>

<p>Jeff: So sometimes if people are complaining about it, you might go to that solution.</p>

<p>Joe: You can propose the red at night and the dual lighting works. And then you literally see these two packs and one will be red and one will be white. That's what I've seen mostly, although I heard that they make one now. It's all in one.</p>

<p>Jeff: [sarcastically] You could have RGB lights—could you do Home Assistant for your tower lighting?</p>

<p>Joe: You'd have RGB, but that would not be allowed by the FAA.</p>

<p>Jeff: We'll actually talk about that a little bit too later, because there are some regulations for how you actually monitor these things.</p>

<p>Joe: Yes, there are.</p>

<h2>No lights at all?</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/supertower-top-beacon-off-daytime-mode-light.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3956130d-1180-43db-b318-de42c334c119" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3956130d-1180-43db-b318-de42c334c119&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Supertower beacon on top not lit during daytime mode"></p>

<p>Jeff: But before we get to that, what about the one tower I saw didn't have any lights that were blinking at all. And I zoomed in and I saw that there was a light on top, but it just wasn't doing anything.</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. Well, and this is about daytime mode. So a tower that's painted, and that's legal for obstruction marking, and you don't have to light during the day. So at night, their lights would come on. So you can be in a situation where, like here, you could see three towers. One might be day and night with white light, and two of them might be red light day only, but one kicks on earlier than the other because of their exact photo cell triggering the lights.</p>

<p>Jeff: Or if the photo cell is covered by a layer of soot from 40 years...</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. So that tower is probably in daytime mode, or it could be an AM tower. An AM tower below 200 feet doesn't have to be lit, so that's another one. In fact, all towers, I guess, under 200 feet, unless you're in a particular area where the FAA would require it.</p>

<p>Jeff: You always have to refer back to the documentation.</p>

<p>Joe: You always refer to the documentation.</p>

<p>Jeff: But what is the tower site that we went to for the hot dogs?</p>

<p>Joe: KHOJ? KHOJ, yeah. Those don't have lights. Those do not have lights.</p>

<p>Jeff: Because they're under 200 feet.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/khoj-am-tower-top-no-beacon-light.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-64a9354a-167c-4c19-b2b2-079eb75fd7e6" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;64a9354a-167c-4c19-b2b2-079eb75fd7e6&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="KHOJ-AM tower top no light because less than 200 ft"></p>

<p>Joe: Yes, so they don't need lighting. So, and then they don't need painting either. So that's one of those things that, again, always refer to that because just because you have a tower that's under 200 feet doesn't mean you don't have to make sure it complies or you may have to paint it or you may have to light and paint.</p>

<p>Tower painting has changed a lot over the years. The older towers have lead in them. So whenever there's a project on the tower, it's not unusual to see the guys in some kind of a, what do they call those?</p>

<p>Jeff: A full ghillie suit? Or I don't know what they're called.</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah. Yeah. So they have that too. So anyway, that's the bottom line from then till now.</p>

<h2>But some short towers <em>do</em> have lights...</h2>

<p>Jeff: So far, we've been talking about radio and TV towers, the ones that are really big. But what about little small towers? I know I see a lot of cell towers that don't have any lights at all, but sometimes they do. They just have one little light bulb on top. Or even if they're 50 to 100 feet tall, I've seen it sometimes.</p>

<p>Joe: Yeah, and there's always a reason for seeing a light somewhere, almost always on structures, including buildings and so forth. But if you look around the area where you're seeing that tower that you know is not 200 feet and it's got a light on the top, look you're probably near an airport, a heliport, or somewhere where there's an aviation hazard. You know hospitals, they have their helipads there.</p>

<p>So everywhere there is a possible hazard for flight for aircraft is going to have lights involved, and that's why we see a lot of buildings even have lights.</p>

<h2>FAA Rules</h2>

<p>Jeff: So it sounds like we have towers and even buildings that have to have lights put up but who's in charge of all this? Like if I'm going to put up my own tower, who do I need to talk to to make sure that i'm doing it right and get it approved?</p>

<p>Joe: I think we go back to our friends at the FAA. They have that particular circular (<a href="https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.current/documentNumber/70_7460-1">AC 70/7460-1M - Obstruction Marking and Lighting</a>). It describes all kinds of of places where lighting is need for air safety.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/5g-cellular-tower-no-lighting.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ff0e5178-846f-4879-abaf-394f0df70be9" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ff0e5178-846f-4879-abaf-394f0df70be9&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="5G Cell tower with no lighting"></p>

<p>So that includes our broadcast towers, big chimney stacks, water towers, bridges, nuclear power plant cooling towers, wind turbines, tall electrical towers, you know, those ones that they cross a river, they'll have those extra tall ones with markings in the middle. Sometimes those are required to have lighting.</p>

<p>And there are also rules that even apply during construction projects. So you've got these big buildings going up And you'll notice the cranes will have lights on them. And there's a spec for that, how many lights have to be on the crane, what height it has to be at.</p>

<p>As you look around the next 12 months, look around at all those lights. You'll enjoy it like I do.</p>

<p>Jeff: You'll look like a radio engineer once you know about these things!</p>

<h2>Estimating tower height by light</h2>

<p>Jeff: So that's made me think, like, looking through these instructions, I did find this page. And I thought, like, could you use tower lights, the number of them, as a way to judge how tall a tower is? Kind of a rough estimate.</p>

<p>Joe: Yes, actually you can because the specifications, like for tall, these would apply to radio and TV towers. They require so many lights depending on the height.</p>

<p>Like around here, we would have the F4 version with four lights, four blinking light levels, a light at the top if the antenna here at the top is higher than 40 feet.</p>

<p>So you can kind of look and get an idea of whether you're looking at a 500-foot tower or a 1,000-foot tower. I don't think you could go like 700 versus 1,000 as easily.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/three-towers-blinking-during-bird-migration-with-power-lines.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-ab955a70-d269-4738-81c2-018f47feaec8" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ab955a70-d269-4738-81c2-018f47feaec8&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Three towers with beacons blinking white strobes while birds migrate"></p>

<p>But you can tell, and the guys know. I know a couple of pilots that are also engineers or selling in radio business, and they can do that. They'll tell you, you know, like I was passing a tower. What's a tower that's a 1,200-foot tower doing out here? So it's pretty fun, and you go to this document has everything you need if you want to take the time and study that and memorize it and then fly.</p>

<h2>Monitoring and reporting outages (and NOTAMs)</h2>

<p>Jeff: One other thing that since we've been running this channel I keep getting emails about, if someone sees that there's lights out on a tower, like let's say it's nighttime and you're out there and you notice like one of these towers for the past few days hasn't had a light on, can you do anything about that? What should you do?</p>

<p>Joe: Well, first of all, if it's required to be lit, every tower that's required to be lit is also required to be monitored.</p>

<p>So in radio, we put a monitoring circuit on the electrical feed to the filaments and you can measure how much current is going through there, right? So you've got to monitor it. You've got to get alarmed by that. The alarm can call you or reach you. But you also have to call every day, check your circuit, your system, and make sure the lights are on. So if you only are lit at night, that means that call has to happen after it's dark.</p>

<p>You've got to verify that your lighting is working, and you have to report it within 30 minutes. And you find that if a light's out, you've got to report it. And we call that a <a href="https://notams.aim.faa.gov/#News">NOTAM</a>, where the FAA puts it on a system that all the pilots can have access to. And they know that there's a tower there, but it's lights out. And they can use it in their flight planning.</p>

<p>Jeff: You're an engineer and you have the tie-in with the FAA or whatever. But what would I be able to do if I did see a tower that was out?</p>

<p>Joe: Well, you can do a NOTAM search. Try to look through and see if you see it. The other thing, you could contact the tower owner or the engineer at the site, the tower's engineer, and they can check into it. They should already know because they have their monitoring equipment, right?</p>

<p>Jeff: They <em>should</em>.</p>

<p>Joe: They should already know. They do.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/fcc-sign-tower-base-supertower.jpg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-c9c46c44-122d-42d6-9f8a-c04e6e509ea2" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c9c46c44-122d-42d6-9f8a-c04e6e509ea2&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="FCC sign with ASR at bottom of Supertower"></p>

<p>And then, of course, if you're out there, usually the tower, either on the tower or in the fencing around it or on the building, will have an <a href="https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/AsrSearch/asrRegistrationSearch.jsp">ASR number</a>, which identifies that tower to the FAA and the FCC, actually. But that number would be the exact tower that you'd be reporting.</p>

<p>Jeff: So hopefully you learned a little bit more about why there are so many flashing lights around at night and not just for radio towers, but for bridges, buildings, and more. What other things do you want to know about towers? Let us know in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></description>
