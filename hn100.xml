<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/noncompete-rule.pdf">issued a final rule</a> to promote competition by banning noncompetes nationwide, protecting the fundamental freedom of workers to change jobs, increasing innovation, and fostering new business formation.</p><p>“Noncompete clauses keep wages low, suppress new ideas, and rob the American economy of dynamism, including from the more than 8,500 new startups that would be created a year once noncompetes are banned,” said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s final rule to ban noncompetes will ensure Americans have the freedom to pursue a new job, start a new business, or bring a new idea to market.”</p><p>The FTC estimates that the final rule banning noncompetes will lead to new business formation growing by 2.7% per year, resulting in more than 8,500 additional new businesses created each year. The final rule is expected to result in higher earnings for workers, with estimated earnings increasing for the average worker by an additional $524 per year, and it is expected to lower health care costs by up to $194 billion over the next decade. In addition, the final rule is expected to help drive innovation, leading to an estimated average increase of 17,000 to 29,000 more patents each year for the next 10 years under the final rule.</p>
<article>
  </article><p>Noncompetes are a widespread and often exploitative practice imposing contractual conditions that prevent workers from taking a new job or starting a new business. Noncompetes often force workers to either stay in a job they want to leave or bear other significant harms and costs, such as being forced to switch to a lower-paying field, being forced to relocate, being forced to leave the workforce altogether, or being forced to defend against expensive litigation. An estimated 30 million workers—nearly one in five Americans—are subject to a noncompete.</p><p>Under the FTC’s new rule, existing noncompetes for the vast majority of workers will no longer be enforceable after the rule’s effective date.&nbsp;Existing noncompetes for senior executives - who represent less than 0.75% of workers - can remain in force under the FTC’s final rule, but employers are banned from entering into or attempting to enforce any new noncompetes, even if they involve senior executives.&nbsp;Employers will be required to provide notice to workers other than senior executives who are bound by an existing noncompete that they will not be enforcing any noncompetes against them.</p><p>In January 2023, the FTC issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/01/ftc-proposes-rule-ban-noncompete-clauses-which-hurt-workers-harm-competition">proposed rule</a> which was subject to a 90-day public comment period. The FTC received more than 26,000 comments on the proposed rule, with over 25,000 comments in support of the FTC’s proposed ban on noncompetes. The comments informed the FTC’s final rulemaking process, with the FTC carefully reviewing each comment and making changes to the proposed rule in response to the public’s feedback.</p><p>In the final rule, the Commission has determined that it is an unfair method of competition, and therefore a violation of Section 5 of the FTC Act, for employers to enter into noncompetes with workers and to enforce certain noncompetes.</p><p>The Commission found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive conditions in labor markets by inhibiting efficient matching between workers and employers. The Commission also found that noncompetes tend to negatively affect competitive conditions in product and service markets, inhibiting new business formation and innovation. There is also evidence that noncompetes lead to increased market concentration and higher prices for consumers.</p><h2>Alternatives to Noncompetes</h2><p>The Commission found that employers have several alternatives to noncompetes that still enable firms to protect their investments without having to enforce a noncompete.</p><p>Trade secret laws and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) both provide employers with well-established means to protect proprietary and other sensitive information. Researchers estimate that over 95% of workers with a noncompete already have an NDA.</p><p>The Commission also finds that instead of using noncompetes to lock in workers, employers that wish to retain employees can compete on the merits for the worker’s labor services by improving wages and working conditions.</p><h2>Changes from the NPRM</h2><p>Under the final rule, existing noncompetes for senior executives can remain in force. Employers, however, are prohibited from entering into or enforcing new noncompetes with senior executives. The final rule defines senior executives as workers earning more than $151,164 annually and who are in policy-making positions.</p><p>Additionally, the Commission has eliminated a provision in the proposed rule that would have required employers to legally modify existing noncompetes by formally rescinding them. That change will help to streamline compliance.</p><p>Instead, under the final rule, employers will simply have to provide notice to workers bound to an existing noncompete that the noncompete agreement will not be enforced against them in the future. To aid employers’ compliance with this requirement, the Commission has included<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/noncompete-rule"> model language</a> in the final rule that employers can use to communicate to workers.&nbsp;</p><p>The Commission vote to approve the issuance of the final rule was 3-2 with Commissioners Melissa Holyoak and Andrew N. Ferguson voting no. Commissioners’ written statements will follow at a later date.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;final rule will become effective 120 days after publication in the Federal Register.</p><p>Once the rule is effective, market participants can report information about a suspected violation of the rule to the Bureau of Competition by emailing&nbsp;<a href="mailto:noncompete@ftc.gov">noncompete@ftc.gov</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/rabbitscam/rabbitr1/blob/main/rabbit.tech">rabbit.tech</a> has been making waves with its highly publicized release of the Rabbit R1 device, claiming it can perform tasks on your behalf and liberate you from app-based interactions. But let's call a spade a spade – <strong>this is a blatant lie</strong>. And we're about to expose it with the first partial release of the source code for its so-called "large action model".</p>
<p dir="auto">For those with a technical background, it's painfully clear that there's <strong>no artificial intelligence or large action model in sight</strong>. In reality, they're simply relying on several <strong>Playwright</strong> automation scripts to do the job for you, which is why they only support four apps: Spotify, Midjourney, Doordash, and UberEats.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's even more alarming is that they ask you to login through their web portal, which is just a virtual machine connected via <strong>NoVNC</strong>. They also expect you to <strong>fill in your private passwords on their VMs</strong>. To make matters worse, they <strong>store the user sessions on their machines</strong> without any additional layers of security. This is both a blatant disregard for user privacy and a hilariously bad engineering practice.</p>
<p dir="auto">Sadly, this shouldn't come as a shock to anyone who's done minimal due diligence on the team. After all, they were still hawking NFTs just two years ago.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>This is the story of how Google Search died, and the people responsible for killing it.</p><p>The story begins on February 5th 2019, when Ben Gomes, Google’s head of search, had a problem. Jerry Dischler, then the VP and General Manager of Ads at Google, and Shiv Venkataraman, then the VP of Engineering, Search and Ads on Google properties, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usdoj-media/atr/media/1322631/dl?inline=&amp;ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>had called a “code yellow” for search revenue</u></a> due to, and I quote, “steady weakness in the daily numbers” and a likeliness that it would end the quarter significantly behind.</p><p>For those unfamiliar with Google’s internal scientology-esque jargon, let me explain. A “code yellow” isn’t, as you might think, a crisis of moderate severity. The yellow, according to Steven Levy’s tell-all book about Google, refers to — and I promise that I’m not making this up — the <a href="https://markcarrigan.net/2016/01/10/googles-war-against-latency/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>color of a tank top that former VP of Engineering Wayne Rosling used to wear during his time at the company</u></a>. It’s essentially the equivalent of DEFCON 1 and activates, as Levy explained, a war room-like situation where workers are pulled from their desks and into a conference room where they tackle the problem as a top priority. Any other projects or concerns are sidelined.</p><p>In emails released as part of the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google, Dischler laid out several contributing factors — search query growth was “significantly behind forecast,” the “timing” of revenue launches was significantly behind, and a vague worry that “several advertiser-specific and sector weaknesses” existed in search.</p><blockquote>I should note that I’ve previously — and erroneously — referred to the “code yellow” as something that Gomes raised as a means of calling attention to the proximity of Google’s ads side getting too close to search. The truth is much grimmer — the Code Yellow was the rumble of the Rot Economy, with Google’s revenue arm sounding the alarm that its golden goose wasn’t laying enough eggs. Gomes, a Googler of 19 years that built the foundation of modern search engines, should go down as one of the few people in tech that actually fought for a real principle, destroyed by and replaced with Prabhakar Raghavan, a computer scientist class traitor that sided with the management consultancy sect. More confusingly, one of the problems was that there was insufficient growth in “queries,” as in the amount of things people were asking Google. It’s a bit like if Ford decided that things were going poorly because drivers weren’t putting enough miles on their trucks.</blockquote><p>Anyway, a few days beforehand on February 1 2019, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417581.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Kristen Gil, then Google’s VP Business Finance Officer, had emailed Shashi Thakur, then Google’s VP of Engineering, Search and Discover, saying that the ads team had been considering a “code yellow” to “close the search gap [it was] seeing,”</u></a> vaguely referring to how critical that growth was to an unnamed “company plan.” To be clear, this email was in response to Thakur stating that there is “nothing” that the search team could do to operate at the fidelity of growth that ads had demanded.</p><blockquote><strong><em>(Editor’s note: If you read those emails, start from the bottom and work your way up).</em></strong></blockquote><p>Shashi forwarded the email to Gomes, asking if there was any way to discuss this with Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, and declaring that there was no way he’d sign up to a “high fidelity” business metric for daily active users on search. Thakur also said something that I’ve been thinking about constantly since I read these emails: that there was a good reason that Google’s founders separated search from ads.</p><p>On February 2, 2019, just one day later, Thakur and Gomes shared their anxieties with Nick Fox, a Vice President of Search and Google Assistant, entering a multiple-day-long debate about Google’s sudden lust for growth. The thread is a dark window into the world of growth-focused tech, where Thakur listed the multiple points of disconnection between the ads and search teams, discussing how the search team wasn’t able to finely optimize engagement on Google without “hacking engagement,” a term that means effectively tricking users into spending more time on a site, and that doing so would lead them to “abandon work on efficient journeys.” In one email, Fox adds that there was a “pretty big disconnect between what finance and ads want” and what search was doing.</p><p>When Gomes pushed back on the multiple requests for growth, Fox added that all three of them were responsible for search, that search was “the revenue engine of the company,” and that bartering with the ads and finance teams was potentially “the new reality of their jobs.”&nbsp;</p><p>On February 6th 2019, Gomes said that he believed that search was “<a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417581.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>getting too close to the money</u></a>,” and ended his email by saying that he was “concerned that growth is all that Google was thinking about.”&nbsp;</p><p>On March 22 2019, Google VP of Product Management Darshan Kantak would declare the end of the code yellow. The thread mostly consisted of congratulatory emails until Gomes responded congratulating the team, saying that the plans architected as part of the code would do well throughout the year.</p><p>Prabhakar Raghavan, then Google’s Head of Ads and the true mastermind behind the code yellow, would respond curtly, saying that the current revenue targets were addressed “by heroic RPM engineering” and that “core query softness continued without mitigation” — a very clunky way of saying that despite these changes, query growth wasn’t happening.&nbsp;</p><p>A day later, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/417557.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Gomes emailed Fox and Thakur an email he intended to send to Raghavan</u></a>. He led by saying he was “annoyed both personally and on behalf of the search team.” in a long email, he explained how one might increase engagement with Google Search, but specifically added that they could “increase queries quite easily in the short term in user negative ways,” like turning off spell correction, turning off ranking improvements, or placing refinements — effectively labels — all over the page, adding that it was “possible that there are trade offs here between different kinds of user negativity caused by engagement hacking,” and that he was “deeply deeply uncomfortable with this.” He also added that this was the reason he didn’t believe that queries were a good metric to measure search and that the best defense about the weakness of queries was to create “compelling user experiences that make users want to come back.”</p><p>In the March 2019 core update to search, which happened about a week before the end of the code yellow, was expected to be “one of the largest updates to search in a very long time. Yet when it launched, many found that the update <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/florida-update-2-insights/298365/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>mostly rolled back changes</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4938447-2-50.htm?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=(gmt%200)-,Traffic%20on%20several%20sites%20that%20were%20abused%20by%20Penquin%20have%20rebounded%20significantly.,-nettulf"><u>traffic was increasing to sites that had previously been suppressed</u></a> by <a href="https://www.conductor.com/academy/glossary/google-penguin-update/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google Search’s “Penguin” update from 2012</u></a> that specifically targeted spammy search results, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/early-data-on-google-march-2019-core-update-show-an-interesting-pattern-314089?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>as well as those hit by an update from an August 1, 2018</u></a>, a few months after Gomes became Head of Search.</p><p>While I’m guessing, the timing of the March 2019 core update, along with the traffic increases to previously-suppressed sites, heavily suggests that Google’s response to the Code Yellow was to roll back changes that were made to maintain the quality of search results.</p><p>A few months later in May 2019, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google would roll out a redesign of how ads are shown on the platform</u></a> on Google’s mobile search, replacing the bright green “ad” label and URL color on ads with a tiny little bolded black note that said “ad,” with the link looking otherwise identical to a regular search link. I guess that's how it started hitting their numbers following the code yellow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/1/23/21078343/google-ad-desktop-design-change-favicon-icon-ftc-guidelines?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google would bring this change to the desktop</u></a>, which The Verge’s Jon Porter would suggest made “Google’s ads look just like search results now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Five months later, a little over a year after the Code Yellow debacle, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-promotes-prabhakar-raghavan-to-lead-search-replacing-ben-gomes-335561?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Google would make Prabhakar Raghavan the head of Google Search</u></a>, with Jerry Dischler taking his place as head of ads. After nearly 20 years of building Google Search, Gomes would be relegated to SVP of Education at Google. Gomes, who was a critical part of the original team that made Google Search work, <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2010/08/19/when-you-google-think-ben-gomes/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>who has been credited with establishing the culture of the world’s largest and most important search engine</u></a>, was chased out by a growth-hungry managerial types led by Prabhakar Raghavan, a management consultant wearing an engineer costume.&nbsp;</p><p>A quick note: I used “management consultant” there as a pejorative. While he exhibits all the same bean-counting, morally-unguided behaviors of a management consultant, from what I can tell Raghavan has never actually worked in that particular sector of the economy.&nbsp;</p><p>But do you know who has? Sundar Pichai, who previously worked at McKinsey — arguably the most morally abhorrent company that has ever existed, having played roles both in the 2008 financial crisis (where it <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/analysis-and-features/mckinsey-how-does-it-always-get-away-with-it-9113484.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>encouraged banks to load up on debt and flawed mortgage-backed securities</u></a>) and the ongoing opioid crisis, where it effectively <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/ag-shapiro-puts-a-stop-to-mckinseys-proliferation-of-the-opioid-crisis/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>advised Purdue Pharma on how to “growth hack” sales of Oxycontin</u></a>. McKinsey has paid nearly $1bn over several settlements due to its work with Purdue. I’m getting sidetracked, but one last point. McKinsey is actively anti-labor. When a company brings in a McKinsey consultant, they’re often there to advise on how to “cut costs,” which <a href="http://rchive/2020/02/how-mckinsey-destroyed-middle-class/605878/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>inevitably means layoffs and outsourcing</u></a>. McKinsey is to the middle class what flesh-eating bacteria is to healthy tissue.&nbsp;</p><p>These emails are a stark example of the monstrous growth-at-all-costs mindset that dominates the tech ecosystem, and if you take one thing away from this newsletter, I want it to be the name Prabhakar Raghavan, and an understanding that there are people responsible for the current state of technology.&nbsp;</p><p>These emails — which I encourage you to look up — tell a dramatic story about how Google’s finance and advertising teams, led by Raghavan with the blessing of CEO Sundar Pichai, actively worked to make Google worse to make the company more money. This is what I mean when I talk about the Rot Economy — the illogical, product-destroying mindset that turns the products you love into torturous, frustrating quasi-tools that require you to fight the company’s intentions to get the service you want.</p><h2 id="heroes-and-villains">Heroes and Villains</h2><p>Ben Gomes is a hero. He was instrumental in making search work, both as a product and a business, joining the company in 1999 — a time long before Google established dominance in the field, and the same year when Larry Page and Sergey Brin tried to sell the company to Excite for $1m, only to walk away after Vinod Khosla (an Excite investor and the co-founder of Sun Microsystems) lowballed the pair with a $750,000 offer.&nbsp;</p><p>In <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241011/this-man-has-helped-shape-google-search-almost-from-the-start?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>an interview with FastCompany’s Harry McCracken from 2018</u></a>, Gomes framed Google’s challenge as “taking [the PageRank algorithm] from one machine to a whole bunch of machines, and they weren’t very good machines at the time.” Despite his impact and tenure, Gomes had only been made Head of Search in the middle of 2018 after John Giannandrea moved to Apple to work on its machine learning and AI strategy. Gomes had been described as Google’s “search czar,” beloved for his ability to communicate across departments.&nbsp;</p><p>Every single article I’ve read about Gomes’ tenure at Google spoke of a man deeply ingrained in the foundation of one of the most important technologies ever made, who had dedicated decades to maintaining a product with a — to quote Gomes himself — “<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90241011/this-man-has-helped-shape-google-search-almost-from-the-start?ref=wheresyoured.at#:~:text=To%20me%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20the%20guiding%20light%20of%20serving%20the%20user%20and%20using%20technology%20to%20do%20that" rel="noreferrer">guiding light of serving the user and using technology to do that</a>.”&nbsp;And when finally given the keys to the kingdom — the ability to elevate Google Search even further — he was ratfucked by a series of rotten careerists trying to please Wall Street, led by Prabhakar Raghavan.</p><p>Do you want to know what Prabhakar Raghavan’s old job was? What Prabhakar Raghavan, the new head of Google Search, the guy that has run Google Search into the ground, the guy who is currently destroying search, did before his job at Google?</p><p><strong><em>He was the head of search for Yahoo from 2005 through 2012</em></strong> — a tumultuous period that cemented its terminal decline, and effectively saw the company bow out of the search market altogether.&nbsp;His responsibilities? Research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. </p><p>When Raghavan joined the company, Yahoo <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/search-engine-market-shares-in-june-2005-google-36-9-yahoo-30-4-msn-15-7/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>held a 30.4 percent market share</u></a> — not far from Google’s 36.9%, and miles ahead of the 15.7% of MSN Search. By May 2012, Yahoo was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/yahoos-search-market-share-drops-for-the-ninth-straight-month-2012-6?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>down to just 13.4 percent and had shrunk for the previous nine consecutive months, and was being beaten even by the newly-released Bing</u></a>. That same year, Yahoo had the largest layoffs in its corporate history, shedding nearly 2,000 employees — <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/04/yahoo-confirms-layoff-2000-employees?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>or 14% of its overall workforce</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The man who deposed Ben Gomes — someone who worked on Google Search from the very beginning — was so shit at his job that in 2009 Yahoo effectively threw in the towel on its own search technology, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/07/29/technology/microsoft_yahoo/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>instead choosing to license Bing’s engine</u></a> in a ten-year deal. If we take a long view of things, this likely precipitated the overall decline of the company, which went from being worth $125bn at the peak of the Dot Com bubble to being sold to Verizon for $4.8bn in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>With search no longer a priority — and making less money for the company — Yahoo decided to pivot into web 2.0 and original content, making some bets that paid off, but far, far too many that didn’t. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>It spent $1.1bn on Tumblr in 2013, only for Verizon to sell it for just $3m in 2019</u></a>. It bought Zimbra in 2007, ostensibly to compete with the new Google Apps productivity suite, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/yahoo-sells-zimbra-to-vmware/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>only to sell it (for a reported fraction of the original purchase price) to VMware a few years later</u></a>. Yahoo was a company without a mission, purpose, or objective. Nobody — and, I’ll speculate, even those leading the company — really knew what it was, or what it did.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/yahoos-new-search-master/1674?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>In an interview with ZDNet’s Dan Farber from 2005</u></a>, Raghavan spoke of his intent to “align the commercial incentives of a billion content providers with social good intent” while at Yahoo, and his eagerness to “inspire the audience to give more data. Before that, it’s hard to find out exactly what Raghavan did — according to ZDNet, he spent “14 years doing search and data-mining research at IBM.”</p><p>In April 2011, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/apr/26/yahoo-ibm-google-prabhakar-raghavan?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>the Guardian ran an interview with Raghavan</u></a> that called him “Yahoo’s secret weapon,” describing his plan to make “rigorous scientific research and practice… to inform Yahoo's business from email to advertising,” and how under then-CEO Carol Bartz, “the focus has shifted to the direct development of new products.” It speaks of Raghavan’s “scientific approach” and his “steady, process-based logic to innovation that is very different to the common perception that ideas and development are more about luck and spontaneity,” a sentence I am only sharing with you because I need you to see how stupid it is, and how specious the tech press’ accolades used to be. This entire article is ridiculous, so utterly vacuous that I’m actually astonished. What about Raghavan’s career made this feel right? How has nobody connected these dots before and said something? Am I insane?</p><p>To be clear, this was something written several years after Yahoo had licensed its search engine to Microsoft in a financial deal that Marisa Mayer, who replaced Bartz, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/microsoft-search-deal-hasnt-worked-out-as-mayer-hoped/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>was still angry about for years</u></a>. Raghavan’s reign as the “<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/yahoos-new-search-master/1674?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>search master</u></a>” was one so successful that it ended up being replaced by a search engine that not a single person in the world enjoys saying out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>This Guardian article ran exactly one year before dramatic layoffs at Yahoo that involved firing entire divisions-worth of people, and four months before Carol Bartz would be fired by telephone by then-Chairman Roy Bostock. Her replacement — Scott Thompson, who previously served as President of PayPal — would last only five months in the role before he too was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18053577?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>replaced by former Google executive Marissa Mayer</u></a>, in part because <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/yahoo-ceo-accused-of-padding-resume-probe-launched/2012/05/04/gIQAHEUI1T_story.html?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>it emerged he lied on his resume about having a Computer Science degree</u></a>.</p><p>Bartz joined Yahoo in 2009 in the aftermath of its previous CEO Jerry Yang refusing to sell the company to Microsoft for $45 billion. In her first year, she laid off hundreds of people and struck a deal to power Yahoo’s search using Microsoft’s Bing search engine tech, with <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/07/29/technology/microsoft_yahoo/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>Microsoft paying Yahoo 88% of the revenue it gained from searches</u></a> — a deal that made Yahoo a couple hundred million dollars for handing over the keys to its most high-traffic platform.&nbsp;</p><p>As I have previously stated, when Prabhakar Ragahavan, Yahoo’s secret weapon, was doing his work, Yahoo Search was so valuable it was replaced with Bing. The company’s sole value, in many ways, was entirely driven by nostalgia and the association with the days before he worked there.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="a-near-anonymous-villain">A Near-Anonymous Villain</h2><p>It’s very, very difficult to find much on Raghavan’s history — it took me hours of digging through Google results to find the three or four articles that went into any depth about him — but from what I’ve gleaned, his expertise lies primarily in “failing up,” ascending through the ranks of technology on the momentum from the explosions he caused. In a WIRED interview from 2021, Steven Levy said Raghavan “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prabhakar-raghavan-isnt-ceo-of-google-he-just-runs-the-place/?ref=wheresyoured.at"><u>isn’t CEO of Google— he just runs the place</u></a>,” and described his addition to the company as “a move from research to management.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Levy calls him a “world-class computer scientist who has authored definitive texts in the field,” he also describes Raghavan as “choosing a management track,” which definitely tracks with everything I’ve found about him. Raghavan proudly declares that “Google’s third-party ad tech plays a critical role in keeping journalism alive” at a time when he was aggressively incentivizing search engine optimized content, and a year after he’d deposed someone who actually gave a shit about search.</p><p>Under Raghavan, Google has become less reliable, less transparent, and is dominated by search engine optimized aggregators, advertising, and outright spam.&nbsp;</p><p>As I’ve argued previously, we — with good reason — continually complain about the state of Twitter under Elon Musk, but I’d argue Raghavan (and, by extension, Google CEO Sundar Pichai) deserve as much criticism, if not more, for the damage they’ve done to society.&nbsp;Because Google is the ultimate essential piece of online infrastructure, just like power lines and water mains are in the physical realm.</p><p>Raghavan and his cronies worked to oust Ben Gomes, a man who dedicated a good portion of his life to making the world’s information more accessible, in the process burning the Library of Alexandria to the ground so that Pichai could make more than 200 million dollars a year.</p><p>And Raghavan — a manager, hired by Sundar Pichai, a former McKinsey man and a manager by trade — is an example of everything wrong with the tech industry. Despite his history as a true computer scientist with actual academic credentials, Raghavan chose to bulldoze actual workers and replace them with toadies that would make Google more profitable and less useful to the world at large.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Prabhakar took the reins in 2020, Google Search has dramatically declined, with the numerous “core” search updates allegedly made to improve the quality of results having an adverse effect, increasing the prevalence of spammy, search engine optimized content.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s because the people running the tech industry are no longer those that built it. Larry Page and Sergey Brin left Google in December 2019 (the same year as the Code Yellow fiasco), and while they remain as controlling shareholders, they clearly don’t give a shit about what “Google” means anymore. Prabhakar Raghavan is a manager, and his career, from what I can tell, is mostly made up of “did some stuff at IBM, failed to make Yahoo anything of note, and fucked up Google so badly that every news outlet has run a story about how bad it is.”</p><p>This is the result of taking technology out of the hands of real builders and handing it to managers at a time when “management” is synonymous with “staying as far away from actual work as possible.” And when you’re a do-nothing looking to profit as much as possible, you only care about growth. You’re not a user, you’re a parasite, and it’s these parasites that have dominated and are draining the tech industry of its value.</p><p>Raghavan’s story is unique, insofar as the damage he’s managed to inflict (or, if we’re being exceptionally charitable, failed to avoid in the case of Yahoo) on two industry-defining companies, and the fact that he did it without being a CEO or founder.&nbsp;Perhaps more remarkable, he’s achieved this while maintaining a certain degree of anonymity. Everyone knows who Musk and Zuckerberg are, but Raghavan’s known only in his corner of the Internet. Or at least he was.</p><p>Now Raghavan has told those working on search that their "<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/google-search-boss-raghavan-warns-employees-of-new-operating-reality.html?ref=wheresyoured.at" rel="noreferrer">new operating reality</a>" is one with less resources and less time to deliver things. Rot Master Raghavan is here to squeeze as much as he can from the corpse of a product he beat to death with his bare hands.</p><p>Raghavan is a hall-of-fame rot economist, and one of the many managerial types that have caused immeasurable damage to the Internet in the name of growth and “shareholder value." And I believe these uber-managers - these ultra-pencil-pushers and growth-hounds - are the forces destroying tech's ability to innovate.</p><p>And in my next newsletter, I'm going to walk you through how a very specific kind of managerial mindset has poisoned Silicon Valley, making career failures unfathomably rich while your favorite tech products decay.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main components="[object Object]"><p>When I tell people around the world that I've been living in Japan for over a decade, many look both impressed and mystified at once. The place has a good reputation. Some folks are in awe at the temples and the gardens, others at the nature or the food. The extreme tidiness and civility of the local culture are the target of universal admiration. But many of those same people see the local language as an almost impenetrable barrier, a world of pain that one must go through in order to be allowed to live here. I must be so patient and smart, they think. But I (begrudgingly) have to tell them that it's not entirely true.</p>
<p>The thing is (I tell those people) the language is part of the wonders of the place. It was the biggest charm for me in the first place. It's complex, yes, but it's rich and quirky and different. In particular, a whole realm of consciousness exists in the sphere of Japanese speakers that's perhaps <em>truly unique</em> in the world, more so than the sushi and the nature and decorum. It even allows for new literary techniques that are unimaginable in any other language.</p>
<p>Usually this is the point when I lose my interlocutor. I might as well be speaking Japanese to them.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to explain that realm, to show what a strange and mind-bending world is accessed by learning Japanese. It feels almost impossible. In this rather long and winding post, I'll try anyway. I'll do my best to convey something that's damn near untranslatable. Whether this is a rabbit hole you want to tumble down with me, that's up to you.</p>
<h2>The Things I'm Not Talking About</h2>
<p>Unless you've studied the language for a good while, you might only be aware of one or more of the following strange-sounding facets of Japanese:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses <em>kanji</em> characters for writing (more on this later), and it uses a whole lot of them. Depending on who you ask, there are four, five or more <em>thousand</em> characters in use, and you can't read a newspaper if you don't know at least 2,000 of the more common ones.</li>
<li>There are also two syllabic scripts (syllable-based alphabets) in use, called <em>hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em>. These two, plus <em>kanji</em>, are used all together, sometimes but not always interchangeably.</li>
<li>There are lots of "untranslatable" words in Japanese, like the salutation お疲れ様 (<em>otsukare-sama</em>), roughly meaning "I appreciate the hard work you've been doing", and もったいない (<em>mottainai</em>) for "it would be a pity not to enjoy that to its fullest value".</li>
<li>Exotic-sounding grammar features like the subject-object-verb sentence structure (i.e. "anteater ant eat") and the lack of important-sounding grammatical elements like articles ("the", "a"), any singular-plural distinction, and most verb tenses familiar to English/Romance language speakers.</li>
<li>It's very vague and context dependent.</li>
</ol>
<p>These aspects give the language an arcane and difficult-sounding aura, but none of them is truly unique to Japanese. Chinese, for instance, uses way more characters and has an even more bare-bones grammar. All languages have untranslatable terms. And several other cultures routinely employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digraphia" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">multiple writing systems</a>. These aren't the things I mean by "a truly unique realm", and they're not the topic of this post.</p>
<p>What's usually not known are the subtle effects of the strange history of the Japanese tongue. These effects are, I believe, absolutely unique to this language, with no parallel anywhere else in the world. On top of that, native Japanese speakers are usually so accustomed to these quirks that they never give them a second thought. So no one—except, I guess, some linguists—ever talks or thinks about these fascinating aspects of Japanese. I write about them here because, well, that's <em>mottainai</em>.</p>
<p>It took me a while to put my finger on it, but now I know what the source of that uniqueness is: it's the unstoppable, wonderful <em>dissociation</em> between what's written and what is spoken in Japanese. To see how that could have happened, we need to take a step back.</p>

<h2>Dissociated from Birth: a History</h2>
<p>The Japanese language existed in purely oral form for centuries, until mainland scholars brought Chinese characters to the Japanese islands. That happened in the 5th century C.E. These characters are, unlike the western alphabets, "logograms", that is, each character is associated with a specific meaning.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/01_mountain_blood.webp" alt="" title="A three-stroke character corresponds to the meaning of 'mountain', a different character with six strokes corresponds to 'blood'."></figure>
<p>Chinese and Japanese are enormously different spoken languages. Except for a large number of words imported directly into Japanese (but evolved to sound quite unlike the originals), the two languages have essentially nothing in common. The pronunciation, the grammar, everything is 180° different. A consequence of this is that those Chinese characters, evolved over millennia to fit the Chinese language like a glove, were a bad match for the way the islanders spoke.</p>
<p>Imagine those poor scholars of the Yamato court in Western Japan in the 7th century. They must have been intrigued by this revolutionary technology called "writing", where you could freeze your words onto a stone or the blade of a sword so that others may understand it later. Why leave it to the Chinese immigrants? Why not master it for their own native language?</p>
<p>Except it must have been excruciatingly difficult. The characters were meant to be used as modular building blocks—a kind of modularity that Japanese just didn't have.</p>
<hr><figure id="floating-1"><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/haniwa.webp" alt="Not many depictions of scholars from the Kofun period survive (they must have been too busy wrangling the kanji), but warrior statues abound. So here is a warrior."><figcaption>Not many depictions of scholars from the Kofun period survive (they must have been too busy wrangling the kanji), but warrior statues abound. So here is a warrior.</figcaption></figure>
<p>While Chinese uses fixed "plug-and-play" markers to indicate tenses and and grammatical functions, on this front Japanese is more similar to English, because it modifies the very shape of words for those things. So in Chinese you say "chī" for "eat" and "chī<em>le</em>" for "ate". The "<em>le</em>" part indicates an action that has completed, and it can be strapped onto any verb to turn it into a past tense. So those two spoken words can be neatly segregated into written logograms: 吃 ("chī") for the present tense, and 吃了 ("chī" + "le") for the past.</p>
<p>Compare that to English where we transform "eat" into "ate", and the equivalent Japanese modification of "tabe<em>ru</em>" into "tabe<em>ta</em>". In both cases we're not adding or removing blocks but changing part of the word to convey the difference. In techie terms, the Chinese script doesn't support the structure of languages like English and Japanese. It doesn't have what it takes.</p>
<p>The only solution for those early Japanese scribes, then, was to do a lot of shoehorning. And boy, did they shoehorn.</p>
<p>The Japanese scholars-aristocrats began repurposing the Chinese characters, which they called <em>kanji</em> (for, well, "Chinese characters"). Sometimes, instead of using them for their meaning, they used them for (gasp!) their pronunciation. By ignoring the original content of a <em>kanji</em>, they could string them together to form almost any sound.</p>
<p>To a Chinese reader, such words would have looked utterly random, devoid of any coherence or structure. But to a trained Japanese, they translated into familiar words.</p>
<p>Over the centuries those "sound-only" <em>kanji</em>, called <em>man'yougana</em>, evolved into something else entirely. They became simpler, more streamlined, and more standardized. Where the symbols were originally composed of many short strokes, they gradually lost detail and complexity. Where the scribes could choose between a slew of different <em>kanji</em> for any given sound (for instance, the sound <em>pa</em> could be represented by any of 20 characters), later the number of options dwindled and eventually settled to two.</p>
<p>That's how the two syllable-based alphabets in use today, <em>hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em>, came about (collectively <em>kana</em>). For example, this is how the sound for "i" (pronounced "ee") evolved from two separate <em>kanji</em> into respective <em>kana</em> pronounced exactly the same.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/02_kana.webp" alt="" title="Two Chinese characters that were pronounce 'i' were eventually simplified into phonetic characters for hiragana and katakana."></figure>
<p>With this new sound-based tool invented by the islanders, finally the Japanese language had a suitably flexible way to write anything one could pronounce. Today full-blown <em>kanji</em> are used for their meaning, while hiragana and katakana are used for sound-based writing and grammar stuff.</p>
<p>(By the way, the application of Chinese characters to other languages happened in several other places, like Korea and Vietnam, but only Japanese still retains the writing system today, making it a unique case among contemporary languages.)</p>
<p>And so, thanks to this grafting of one language's way of writing into a vastly different tongue, a dissociation was born. Japanese is a language where the spoken and the written co-evolved in directions never seen elsewhere. The differences in grammatical structure are only part of the story. Let's start with the basics.</p>
<h2>Anomaly 1: One Way to Write It, Many Ways to Read It</h2>
<p>Like most language pairs, there was rarely a one-to-one correspondence between Chinese and Japanese words. Often a single Chinese word or character could merely approximate the meaning of several spoken Japanese words. Each of those local words might have been related to the others, but it carried a different nuance. Even so, for lack of a better solution, often the same <em>kanji</em> was used for all the various meanings.</p>
<p>This had two major effects. First, while in any Chinese language each character is associated with a single way to speak it, in Japanese every <em>kanji</em> can be pronounced in multiple, very different ways. This part is perhaps the biggest bane of Japanese students.</p>
<p>Extreme cases have <strong>15+</strong> different pronunciations (readings) for a single <em>kanji</em>! For example, the <em>kanji</em> for "life":</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/03_life.webp" alt="" title="The same character, meaning generically 'life', is pronounced 'shēng' in Mandarin, while in Japanese it can be pronounced as 'sei', 'shou', 'ikasu', 'ikiru', 'ikeru', 'u', 'umare', 'umareru', 'umu', 'ou', 'ki', 'nasu', 'naru', 'nama', 'haeru', 'hayasu', 'musu', ..."></figure>
<p>Some of these pronunciations are common, others quite rare, but you need to know and be able to discriminate most of them in order to correctly read and write modern Japanese.</p>
<p>The second effect of the imperfect match between the written word and the meanings it is associated with is a kind of "chronic looseness" in the conversion of language to and from writing. A Japanese reader isn't expected to correctly pronounce everything. New, unfamiliar words will be opaque to them. In a sense, this is similar to English, only much worse.</p>
<p>In English, the question is usually about the right way to pronounce a vowel or two. As is clear from the example just above, in Japanese, sometimes you don't know if the <em>kanji</em> for life has to be read as "nasu" or "shou". Add to that the huge number of <em>kanji</em> in circulation, and in many cases you have absolutely <em>nothing</em> to work with. If you haven't seen the <em>kanji</em> before, you have zero hints about the right sounds to make.</p>
<p>Japanese has a trick up her sleeve to solve this problem, called <em>furigana</em>. These are tiny <em>kana</em> characters showing you how to pronounce a difficult <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/furigana.webp" alt="A sign in a train station. It's often impossible to guess the pronunciation of place names, hence the furigana above the official kanji name. Source: Wikipedia." title="A sign in the Higashi-Fushimi station in Tokyo. The kanji name is written in big characters, but above those are hiragana characters showing the pronunciation of the word."><figcaption>A sign in a train station. It's often impossible to guess the pronunciation of place names, hence the furigana above the official kanji name. Source: Wikipedia.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kids keep on learning new fundamental <em>kanji</em> until the end of high school, so they wouldn't be able to read without extensive application of <em>furigana</em>. Adults are able to survive with less <em>furigana</em>, but you'll still find them on the rarer words that people might not have encountered before (or for which they might have forgotten the reading). For example, this is a page I opened at random from a Haruki Murakami non-fiction book.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/murakami-a.webp" alt="" title="A page in vertical Japanese script, from a Murakami book. Two tiny hiragana characters are highlighted between the lines of normal-sized text."></figure>
<p>In the whole page, only one <em>kanji</em> word (a somewhat rare way to say "mock") has the pronunciation spelled out with <em>furigana</em> (those two tiny squiggles between the lines).</p>
<p>Remember this part about <em>furigana</em>, because they'll come up again in the following sections.</p>
<p>Now for a practical consequence: people need to get creative just to teach others how to write their names.</p>
<h2>Anomaly 2: Spelling Bee, but Creative</h2>
<p>There is one problem that arises because of how <em>kanji</em> work: how do you explain which character you're talking about without writing it down?</p>
<p>This happens all the time with people's names. The Japanese like to choose nice and distinctive <em>kanji</em> for their names, even when using common name pronunciations (another instance of dissociation: common name readings on unheard-of <em>kanji</em> choices are all the rage this century). This means that, just by hearing what someone is called, you're usually unable to write it down.</p>
<p>So people have to explain the <em>kanji</em> to you, and they do it by telling you which other well-known words each <em>kanji</em> appears in, or how it is built from simpler components.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/deathnote.webp" alt="Perhaps the most famous scene showing the hoops you have to jump through just to explain your name's spelling. It's from the manga &quot;Death Note&quot;. Here the woman is giving a fake name, but soon afterwards Raito finds out her real name and uses it to kill her real quick."><figcaption>Perhaps the most famous scene showing the hoops you have to jump through just to explain your name's spelling. It's from the manga "Death Note". Here the woman is giving a fake name, but soon afterwards Raito finds out her real name and uses it to kill her real quick.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Anomaly 3: Breaking Out of the Box</h2>
<p>Reading is made more difficult by the frequent use of <em>jukujikun</em>, words where the pronunciation is not the combination of the normal readings of the individual <em>kanji</em> contained. In these cases there isn't any correspondence between parts of the spoken word and the <em>kanji</em> that represent it.</p>
<p>Japanese has a lot of compound words of Chinese origin, where two or more <em>kanji</em> appear as a set. These compounds are usually very straightforward sequences of <em>kanji</em> readings. So 美術 (<em>bijutsu</em>), meaning art, is the combination of 美 ("bi", beauty) and 術 (<em>jutsu</em>, skill). If you're confident about the individual sounds, you just have to say them one after the other. Finally something simple!</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/04_bijutu.webp" alt="" title="The word for art, 'bijutsu' is the simple composition of 'bi' for beauty and 'jutsu' for skill. Similarly, the word for science, which is pronounced 'kagaku', is the summ of 'ka' for subject and 'gaku' for study."></figure>
<p>But no, you can't let your guard down. The shoehorning work of the ancients has left deformations that survive in the modern language.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the word for "adult". It's pronounced <em>otona</em> and written 大人, the <em>kanji</em> for "big" and "person" respectively. Following the usual method, you might wonder, is <em>oto</em> a pronunciation of the first <em>kanji</em>, and <em>na</em> of the second? Or is it <em>o</em> and <em>tona</em>?</p>
<p>Well, neither. There is no way to split them. The two-<em>kanji</em> word exists as a single block, and looking up each <em>kanji</em> separately won't yield even a bit of this word's true reading. There are many examples like that.</p>

<p>In some cases, the number of <em>kanji</em> is longer than the number of syllables in the word! Try splitting <em>that</em> up.</p>

<h2>Anomaly 4: Two Words in a Trench Coat</h2>
<p>But, despite all of its difficulties, this dissociation of writing and speaking opens up some interesting opportunities.</p>
<p>For example, there is a category of verbs that I find fascinating. As far as I know, it has no official academic name, and I've never heard anyone else even mention this. I would describe them as "two words in a trench coat". In each case, you can see how two simpler verbs were chained and wrapped with a single <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<p>For example, the verb 司る (<em>tsukasadoru</em>), meaning "to be in charge" seems pretty innocent at first. It's one <em>kanji</em> plus its <em>hiragana</em> ending indicating the tense, like all other verbs. But look up the etymology, and you'll find that it used to be two words: 官 (<em>tsukasa</em>) for "position of authority" and 取る (<em>toru</em>) for "take". Each of these two words has its own <em>kanji</em> and independent meaning. But over the years, their combined form became so routine that someone decided to give it its own different <em>kanji</em>, probably for no other reason than convenience. Here are a couple more cases:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/07_kokorozasu.webp" alt="" title="The verb 'kokorozasu', which means to aspire, is written with a single kanji but can be seen as the fusion of the separate words 'kokoro', for heart, and 'sasu', for to point, each with their different kanji. Similarly for the verb 'mitomeru' (to confirm), a combination of the verbs 'mite' (see) and 'tomeru' (retain)."></figure>
<p>These fusions are like language fossils. It shows that <em>kanji</em> are only an after-the-fact addition to a pre-existing vocabulary. But at a practical level, they're a way to exploit the looseness of Japanese writing to make writing more convenient (notice how short the final written words are compared to the original).</p>
<h2>Anomaly 5: Make the <em>kanji</em> Work for You</h2>
<p>In Anomaly 1 I said that one <em>kanji</em> can be ambiguous in terms of its <em>pronunciation</em>. But the flip side of the same phenomenon is that <em>kanji</em> can help reduce ambiguity in <em>meaning</em>, increasing the precision of the written word.</p>
<p>Spoken Japanese is actually rather poor in vocabulary. A lot of its verbs are reused in very different contexts with different meanings that are only related in a very abstract way. Thanks to the unique slap-it-on-and-you're-ready-to-go mindset of Japanese writing, however, the vagueness can be pared down a lot.</p>
<p>There is a surprising number of verbs that have exactly the same pronunciation, but are written with different <em>kanji</em> in different contexts. For example:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/08_yomu.webp" alt="" title="The verb pronounced 'yomu' can be written with two different kanji depending on whether it means to read or to compose a poem. The verb pronounced 'okuru' has different kanji for the meaning of sending and gifting. And the verb 'toru' has at least 7 different kanji forms, for the following meanings: to take, to take a picture, to harvest, to capture, to ingest a substance, to steal, and to record."></figure>
<p>The cool thing here is that these are all different meanings, but if you squint you can see how they must have originated from the same primordial word. They started with a generic, blunt verb (e.g. <em>toru</em>, to take), and later applied to it different <em>kanji</em> to distinguish its nuances. Handy!</p>
<p>There are also non-verbs examples of this trick. My favorite are all the versions of the word "cousins" meant in a reciprocal sense, as in "she and I are cousins (of each other)". In spoken language, you just say <em>itoko</em> in all cases, and that's it. In written language, you use the appropriate combinations of the <em>kanji</em> 兄 (<em>ani</em>, older brother), 弟 (<em>otouto</em>, younger brother), 姉 (<em>ane</em>, older sister), and 妹 (<em>imouto</em>, younger sister), preceded by the <em>kanji</em> 従 (<em>shitagau</em>, accompany), to specify the exact genders in the relationship. (These are also <em>jukujikun</em>, come to think of it.)</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/09_itoko.webp" alt="" title="The same noun 'itoko', meaning cousins, is written in four different combinations of kanji: one for cousins who are both male, one for cousins who are both female, one where the older cousin is male and the younger is female, and one that's the other way around."></figure>
<p>You can use <em>kanji</em>, then, to add a layer of meaning that doesn't exist in the spoken language. Which brings us to the last and, in my opinion, most interesting point.</p>
<h2>Anomaly 6: Dissociation as Canvas</h2>
<p>Finally we come to <em>gikun</em>, the most exquisite (ab)use of the rift between written and spoken Japanese. It's based on the clever use of <em>furigana</em>, the little pronunciation marks explained above. Ninety-nine percent of the time, people use <em>furigana</em> as you would expect—plainly indicating the correct dictionary reading of each word. But once you have a tool, who can resist playing with it?</p>
<p><em>Gikun</em> is the replacement of a <em>kanji</em>'s or word's normal pronunciation with something else through <em>furigana</em>. Novelists and <em>manga-ka</em> use it to inject an almost subliminal layer of meaning beyond what is afforded by the words and <em>kanji</em>. It achieves an effect similar to a textual voice over, <em>at the same time as the actual text you're reading</em>.</p>
<p>You see it a lot in manga: the actual <em>kanji</em> say something, but the <em>furigana</em>, instead of giving you the true pronunciation of the word, give you something else entirely. Sometimes it's a synonym of the word with a more pungent nuance. For example:</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/hidari-atsu-todoroki-boku-no-hero-ch28.webp" alt="Source: Boku no Hero Academia, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)"><figcaption>Source: Boku no Hero Academia, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The author of the excellent <a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/12/gikun.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>gikun</em> explanaton on japanesewithanime.com</a> clarifies the context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Todoroki Shouto 轟焦凍 has both cold and heat abilities, which come from the sides of his body: from the right comes cold, from the left comes heat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Shouto, the protagonist, is telling the flame-y man "during combat, I won't use my <strong>heat</strong> power for any reason at all." Being a kids' comic, all <em>kanji</em> have <em>furigana</em>. But the <em>kanji</em> for "heat" (highlighted in red) comes with an unexpected reading. Instead of the official <em>netsu</em>, the <em>furigana</em> reads <em>hidari</em>, which means "left".</p>
<p>So the reader gets two messages at the same time: the character says "I won't use <strong>the left</strong>", but the text is saying "I won't use <strong>heat</strong>".</p>
<p>Sometimes, authors use <em>gikun</em> for the luxury of introducing cool foreign-sounding words while simultaneously providing the meaning for it through <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/gikun-automail-fullmetal-alchemist-ch04.webp" alt="Source: Full-Metal Alchemist, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)"><figcaption>Source: Full-Metal Alchemist, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And the context from <a href="https://www.japanesewithanime.com/2017/12/gikun.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">japanesewithanime.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good guy with mechanical arm fights bad guy with mechanical arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The blond guy says, "Oh, an <strong>automail</strong> colleague?" to say that they both have mechanical arms. But "automail" isn't a real word, and the Japanese reader may not guess the etymology of "automatic" + "mail (armor)". So the meaning is provided by the <em>kanji</em> (literally "mechanical armor"), and the word "automail" comes as <em>furigana</em> above that. Again, you get two things in one swoop: a neologism and its meaning.</p>
<p>Other times it's simply a clarification of the word in that specific context.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/koko-deictic-gikun-noragami-ch02.webp" alt="Source: Noragami, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)"><figcaption>Source: Noragami, cited by japanesewithanime.com (CC BY-SA 4.0)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yato 夜ト, who is a God fighting spiritual beings related to human's negative feelings, goes to the hospital make [sic] a visit to someone...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The off-screen speaker is saying, "Tonight will be rough too. <strong>This place</strong> is their nest. Now that the regalia aren't with us, we shouldn't stay long." (I assume the "regalia" are some kind of warrior.) In this case the words "this place" appear as <em>furigana</em> for the word "hospital". The <em>kanji</em> say "<strong>hospital</strong>", the reading says "<strong>here/this place</strong>". Through <em>gikun</em>, the author is avoiding confusion on the current location of the characters.</p>
<p>Some novelists use this dissociation for artistic effect, too. Horror-mystery writer Natsuhiko Kyogoku, who loves to create the Japanese version of a Gothic atmosphere, constantly uses archaic, long-forgotten <em>kanji</em> in his brick-sized novels. You, as the average Japanese reader, probably have never seen most of those <em>kanji</em> before, but you're able to follow without problems thanks to his <em>gikun</em>. The <em>furigana</em> expose the modern, recognizable readings that you can recognize, even though they are not the real readings of those obsolete <em>kanji</em>.</p>
<p>Kyogoku's <em>gikun</em> shenanigans are a bit too much at times. Someone who uses them more sparingly and subtly is Haruki Murakami.</p>
<figure><img src="https://aethermug.com/assets/posts/the-beautiful-dissociation-of-the-japanese-language/murakami-b.webp" alt="" title="Another page in vertical Japanese script, from a Murakami book. Again, tiny furigana characters between the lines are highlighted."></figure>
<p>This is a page from his novel Norwegian Wood. Jay Rubin, the novel's English translator, worded the highlighted sentence like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What if somewhere inside me there is a dark limbo where all the truly important memories are heaped and slowly turning into mud?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the word "limbo" (pointed by the arrow) in the original is actually a <em>gikun</em>. The Japanese reader sees two things at once: the <em>kanji</em> with the meaning of "a remote region"—normally pronounced <em>hendo</em>—and the <em>katakana</em> pronunciation of the foreign word "limbo" as <em>furigana</em> next to it.</p>
<p>The Japanese language does have more accurate words for "limbo", words with a stronger link to the original catholic meaning of the word, but Murakami decided not to use them.</p>
<p>This little choice, seen by the reader in a fleeting instant as they devour the pages, and likely not even noticed consciously, is doing a lot of work. It's indulging in the mystical-sounding foreign word "limbo", but it's also clarifying the general meaning of liminal space for the readers unfamiliar with it. It's making the metaphor of an actual hidden place within oneself stronger, while avoiding overly religious undertones. In short, this <em>gikun</em> alters the flavor of the word a tiny bit, just enough to achieve the thematic and stylistic goals of the sentence. Like a pinch of nutmeg in your butter cake.</p>
<p>How is one to translate that?</p>
<p>It's difficult to convey what it feels like to read in this way. For me, back when I started reading in Japanese some 16 years ago, it was a totally new experience, something that I never thought would be possible with text. It's like reading in stereo, where sometimes the same message is conveyed to you in two different formats on separate channels, and sometimes two messages blend together as something new.</p>
<p>Because of the unique dissociation between the written word and the way it is pronounced, Japanese is not only harder to learn, but it's also more malleable and richer in a way that cannot be imitated. It's an extra dimension of language and a happy historical accident. ●</p>

Patterns with interesting behavior very often have a lot of repeating patterns, with the interesting stuff happening as complex interactions between those predictable patterns.

It's just plain a lot more computationally intensive to emulate 3D rules.  Also it's a lot harder to see what's going on in the middle of an active 3D pattern -- a lot of the detail tends to get hidden.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" role="main">
    

<p>In 1937, Quine proposed a set theory called “New Foundations”, and since 2010, Randall Holmes has claimed to have a proof of its consistency.
In this repository, we use the interactive theorem prover Lean to verify the difficult part of his proof, thus proving that New Foundations is indeed consistent.
The proof is now complete, and the theorem statements can be found in <code>ConNF/Model/Result.lean</code> (<a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/con-nf/blob/main/ConNF/Model/Result.lean">source</a>, <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/Model/Result.html">docs</a>).</p>

<p>See <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/">our website</a> for more information, the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/">documentation of our Lean code</a>, and the <a href="https://zeramorphic.github.io/con-nf-paper/main.l.pdf">deformalisation paper</a> that translates the Lean definitions into English.</p>

<p>To run our code locally, install <a href="https://github.com/leanprover/elan">elan</a>, clone the repository, and run the following command in a terminal in the repository’s root directory.</p>

<p>The code can then be viewed in an editor such as Visual Studio Code, or compiled directly from the command-line using <code>lake build</code>.</p>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>

<p>It is known that New Foundations is consistent if and only if a theory called Tangled Type Theory (TTT) is consistent (see theorem 1 <a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Papers/tangled.pdf">here</a>).
We have formally constructed a model of TTT in Lean, thus proving (on paper) that New Foundations is consistent, or in short, Con(NF).
We are working from various versions of the paper proof by Holmes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/untangled.pdf">untangled.pdf</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/retangled.pdf">retangled.pdf</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/newnfdoc.pdf">newnfdoc.pdf</a>;</li>
  <li><a href="https://randall-holmes.github.io/Nfproof/maybedetangled.pdf">maybedetangled.pdf</a>,</li>
</ul>

<p>but many alterations and additions have been made to make the proof compatible with Lean’s type theory.</p>

<p>This project depends on <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">mathlib</a>, the community mathematical library written in Lean.
This allows us to use familiar results about things like cardinals and groups without having to prove them ourselves.</p>

<p>Every definition and theorem in mathlib and this project have been checked by Lean’s trusted kernel, which computationally verifies that the proofs we have constructed are indeed correct.
However, Lean cannot check that the statements of the definitions and theorems match their intended English equivalents, so when drawing conclusions from the code in this project, translation to and from English must be done with care.</p>

<h2 id="tangled-type-theory">Tangled type theory</h2>

<p>TTT is a many-sorted set theory with equality “=” and the membership relation “∈”.
The sorts are indexed by a limit ordinal λ, and elements of λ are called type indices.
A formula “x = y” is well-formed if x and y have the same type, and a formula “x ∈ y” is well-formed if x has any type less than y.</p>

<p>One of the axioms of tangled type theory is extensionality, which stipulates that a set of type α is uniquely determined by its elements of <em>any</em> type β &lt; α.
This is strange: for example, if two sets of type α differ, they have different type β elements for <em>every</em> β &lt; α.
This property makes it difficult to construct models of TTT.</p>

<h2 id="strategy">Strategy</h2>

<p>Our construction of the model uses the following rough strategy.</p>

<h3 id="construction-of-the-base-type">Construction of the base type</h3>

<p>Let λ be a limit ordinal, κ &gt; λ be a regular ordinal, and μ &gt; κ be a strong limit cardinal with cofinality at least κ.
Sets of size less than κ are called <em>small</em>.</p>

<p>We first construct an auxiliary type at level -1, called the <em>base type</em>, below all types that will eventually become part of the model.
Elements of this type are called atoms (although they are not atoms in the ZFU or NFU sense, for instance).
There are μ atoms, partitioned into <em>litters</em> of size κ.</p>

<h3 id="constructing-each-type">Constructing each type</h3>

<p>At each type level α, we will produce a collection of model elements for our intended model of TTT, which we will sometimes call <em>t-sets</em>.
We also produce a group of permutations, called <em>allowable permutations</em>, which act on the t-sets.
The membership relation is preserved under the action of allowable permutations.
Each t-set is stipulated to have a <em>support</em> under the action of allowable permutations; this is a small set of objects called <em>addresses</em>, such that whenever an allowable permutation fixes all elements of a support, it also fixes the t-set.</p>

<p>Each t-set at level α will be given a preferred extension of some type β &lt; α, and we can recover from a t-set’s elements which extension it prefers.
The extensions of such a t-set in other lower types can be deduced from its β-extension.
This allows us to satisfy TTT’s extensionality axiom.</p>

<h3 id="controlling-the-size-of-each-type">Controlling the size of each type</h3>

<p>Each type α can only be constructed under the assumption that all types β &lt; α are of size exactly μ (among other hypotheses).
It is easy to prove that the collection of t-sets at level α has cardinality at least μ, so we need to show that there are at most μ elements of this set.
We do this by showing that there are not that many fundamentally different descriptions of tangles under the action of allowable permutations.
This requires the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/FOA/Result.html#ConNF.StructApprox.freedom_of_action">freedom of action theorem</a>, which is a technical lemma that allows us to construct allowable permutations.
The main result of this section is <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/Counting/Conclusions.html#ConNF.mk_tSet">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-the-induction">Finishing the induction</h3>

<p>We can then run the above process recursively to produce the types of tangles at all type levels α.
This is an easy step to perform in set theory, but requires a lot of work in type theory because of the interconnectedness of the various inductive hypotheses we need.
We then check that our construction indeed produces a model of TTT by checking that it satisfies a finite axiomatisation of the theory.
We have chosen to convert Hailperin’s finite axiomatisation of NF’s comprehension scheme into a finite axiomatisation of TTT, which we present in our <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf/doc/ConNF/Model/Result.html">results file</a>.
Note, however, that this choice is arbitrary, and any other finite axiomatisation can be easily proven with the infrastructure already in place.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We show that Claude 3 Opus, a large language model (LLM) released by Anthropic in March 2024, exhibits stronger machine translation competence than other LLMs. Though we find evidence of data contamination with Claude on FLORES-200, we curate new benchmarks that corroborate the effectiveness of Claude for low-resource machine translation into English. We find that Claude has remarkable \textit{resource efficiency} -- the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pair's resource level. Finally, we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using Claude to generate synthetic data, we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation, meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.

            <div>
                <menu><menuitem></menu>                
                <p>If you’ve been making websites for years, you know how frustrating it was to lay out a web page with CSS floats. Managing sizes and placement was tedious and time consuming. Being creative was often impossible. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Basic_concepts_of_grid_layout">CSS Grid</a> greatly eased that pain with Grid Level 1 in <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">2017</a>, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">now</a> with Grid Level 2, aka <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">Subgrid</a>. But even with the powerful CSS of today, not every layout imaged by designers is possible. In fact, when CSS Grid shipped, one of the most commonly asked questions was: “how do I write CSS to accomplish a masonry layout?” Sadly, for the last seven years the answer has been — you can’t.</p>
<h2><a name="what-is-masonry-layout"></a>What is masonry layout?</h2>
<p>What do we mean by the term “masonry layout”? Basically it’s the pattern seen in the following image — where content packs together like a brick or stone wall. That’s where it gets the name “masonry”. It’s also frequently called “<a href="https://github.com/topics/waterfall-layout">waterfall layout</a>”, as a metaphor for how content flows down the page like a waterfall.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image1-masonry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image1-masonry-light.png" alt="Two dozen photos of different aspect ratios laid out using a &quot;masonry&quot; pattern"></picture></figure>
<p>This layout is popular because it solves a few problems that other layouts do not.</p>
<ol>
<li>It allows for content of different aspect ratios, and avoids the need to crop or truncate content in order to turn everything into uniform rectangles.</li>
<li>It distributes content across the page (instead of flowing down each column, one by one). This follows the natural reading order as you scroll the page. And it lets the website lazy-load additional content at the bottom without moving existing content around.</li>
</ol>
<p>This layout creates uniformly-sized columns, without any rows. It’s quite possible that because this layout has required JavaScript, anything more creative or complex has been too hard to pull off — and we’ve been left with an expectation that masonry layout should only ever be a simple pattern with uniformly-sized columns. Let’s see what’s possible if we build it into CSS instead.</p>
<h2><a name="inventing-masonry"></a>Inventing masonry</h2>
<p>A mechanism in CSS for “masonry layout” was first proposed by Mozilla in January 2020 as an extension of CSS Grid, and <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">implemented</a> as an experiment behind a flag in Firefox Nightly. In 2022, Apple started implementing this <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/">CSS Grid Level 3</a> proposal in Safari Technology Preview (where it’s currently on by default), and we’ve been helping to move the web standard along to reach maturity.</p>
<p>However, there are big questions still being asked about how CSS should handle masonry-style layouts. Some people remain skeptical that this capability should be part of CSS Grid, and want it to instead be its own separate <code>display</code> type. Others are questioning whether or not this kind of layout is needed on the web at all — they aren’t sure that well-known websites will use it. With such fundamental disagreements at play, no browser can ship. We must first come to consensus in the CSS Working Group.</p>
<p>This is where we need your help. We’d like real-world web designers and developers to weigh into the discussion, and express what it is that you want. Your input really can make a difference.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll walk through how the CSS Grid Level 3 proposal works, and how you can use its new capabilities. We’ll show you why we believe these features should be part of CSS Grid, and explain what the alternative would be if the CSS Working Group creates <code>display: masonry</code> instead. And then, we’ll ask you to join the debate to help move us forward. Please do read to the end.</p>
<h2><a name="four-demos"></a>Four demos</h2>
<p>To show why we at Apple believe this capability should be part of CSS Grid, we created four demonstrations. If you’d like, try them yourself at <a href="https://webkit.org/demos/grid3/">webkit.org/demos/grid3</a>. View these demos in a <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">browser that supports Grid Level 3</a> — currently <a href="https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/">Safari Technology Preview</a> or Firefox after you’ve turned on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features#masonry_grid_layout">the feature flag</a>.</p>
<p>Note there’s a control panel for each demo, with the relevant layout code printed to the page. Turn on “Number items” to see the relationship between the HTML order of content and the layout placement of that content.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-controlsalternate-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-controlsalternate-light.png" alt="Screenshot showing the controls of the demo — here with the numbers turned on"></picture></figure>
<p>Each demo has a multitude of variations. Switch between variations from the dropdown menu, which changes only the CSS. The HTML stays the same.</p>

<h2><a name="creating-a-classic-masonry-waterfall-layout"></a>Creating a classic masonry / waterfall layout</h2>
<p>First, let’s take a look at how to build a classic masonry/waterfall layout. In this gallery of photos, each image is wrapped with a <code>figure</code> element, and the figures are direct children of a <code>main</code> element.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-1.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-2.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>figure</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"photo-3.jpg"</span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>figure</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>main</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We start by applying <code>display: grid</code> to the main element to create the Grid container. Then we can define <code>grid-template-columns</code> however we’d like.</p>
<p>In this case, let’s use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(14rem, 1fr))</code> to ask the browser to repeat a looped definition to create a set of flexible columns that are each of a minimum of 14rem. This results in uniformly-sized columns, typical of the classic masonry/waterfall layout. The <code>gap: 1rem;</code> rule creates a 1rem-wide space between the items — both between the columns, and horizontally between items.</p>
<p>And then, we’ll define the “rows” with the <code>masonry</code> value. (It’s likely the name of this value will change before this ships in browsers — more on that at the end of this article. For now, <code>masonry</code> is what works.)</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>14</span><span>rem</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>gap</span>: <span>1</span><span>rem</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code> rule tells the browser: “Please do <em>not</em> create rows. Instead pack the content into a masonry/waterfall-like pattern.”</p>
<p>That’s it! In four lines of CSS, with zero media queries or container queries, we’ve created a flexible layout that works on screens of all sizes. And there’s no need to crop content to force everything into same-sized boxes.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-masonrywider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image4-masonrywider-light.png" alt="masonry layout of photos"></picture></figure>
<p>In graphic design, a layout that has uniformly-sized columns and no rows is often called a “symmetrical columnar grid”. For centuries, columnar grids were the dominant type of grid used in page design.</p>
<h2><a name="leveraging-grid%e2%80%99s-full-power-to-define-columns"></a>Leveraging Grid’s full power to define columns</h2>
<p>Now let’s dive into the advantages of combining the full power of CSS Grid with masonry/waterfall packing. CSS Grid provides many options for defining grid our columns. Using <code>fr</code> units to create a symmetrical grid is only one option of many.</p>
<p>How could these possibilities be used for a masonry/waterfall-style layout? Let’s try mixing fixed-sized columns with flexible columns. We could make the first and last column fixed-sized, while the middle columns are flexible, changing in both size and number.</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1920" height="1018"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video1-firstlastsmaller-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video1-firstlastsmaller-light.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>Specifically, the first and last columns are exactly 14 characters wide, while the middle columns are flexible (at least 28 characters wide) and change in number to fill the available space.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>14</span><span>ch</span> <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>28</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>)) <span>14</span><span>ch</span>;
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>gap</span>: <span>1</span><span>rem</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is just one of many, many possibilities.</p>
<p>CSS Grid allows for a lot of creativity with its options for defining grid tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>fixed sizes defined in any unit (px, em, rem, cqi, lh, ch, ic, cap, vw, svh, and many <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units#numeric_data_types">more</a>)</li>
<li><code>max-content</code> and <code>min-content</code></li>
<li>the full power of <code>fr</code> units</li>
<li><code>minmax()</code> functions</li>
<li><code>%</code>-sized </li>
<li>auto </li>
</ul>
<p>These options in CSS Grid allow you to create something much more dynamic and flexible in interesting ways. You can create two stages of flexibility, because the <code>fr</code>-unit sized columns grow and shrink in a separate stage from the <code>minmax()</code>-sized columns. The <code>max-content</code> and  <code>min-content</code> values let you size the columns based on the content size, rather than sizing the content based on the column size. The <code>fr</code> units can easily be used to create compound or asymmetrical grids, where the columns are different sizes. The options are endless.</p>
<p>By adding the ability to pack content in a masonry/waterfall pattern to CSS Grid, we maintain the full power of Grid for defining our columns in whichever manner we like.</p>
<p>For example, let’s use <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(8rem, 1fr) minmax(16rem, 2fr)) minmax(8rem, 1fr)</code> to create a pattern of alternating narrow and wider columns, where all the columns are flexible. More columns are added when there’s space. And there’s always an odd number of columns, ending with a narrow one.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-alternatingmontage-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image5-alternatingmontage-light.png" alt="three web browser windows next to each other, showing how the layout adjusts for narrow, medium and wider windows"></picture></figure>
<p>Even when we define columns using only the simple <code>fr</code> unit, the full power provided in CSS Grid means different columns can be set to different sizes. For fun, let’s use <code>fr</code> units to define a set of columns sized to inject the vibes of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">golden ratio</a> by using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a> in <code>grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 2fr 3fr 5fr 8fr;</code></p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image6-fibonacci-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image6-fibonacci-light.png" alt="layout of photos where the columns on the left are very narrow, getting bigger and bigger as them move to the right, in a fibonacci sequence"></picture></figure>
<p>In a more practical example, let’s use <code>max-content</code> when defining our columns. Content-based sizing is an incredibly power feature of CSS Grid. This demo of a mega menu layout uses <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(max-content, 30ch));</code> to ensure that every column is big enough to fit every link without wrapping text.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image7-megamenu-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image7-megamenu-light.png" alt="a menu with a ton of links, like in a website footer, laid out with Grid Level 3"></picture></figure>
<p>Mega menus have been hard to code, especially across multiple screen sizes. With CSS Grid Level 3, it becomes incredibly easy. A few lines of code creates a dynamic layout which adds and removes columns one at a time as space allows — without any media/container queries, and with wrapping prevention.</p>
<p>Many of these examples could never be created with masonry as a separate display type. The discussion of <code>display: masonry</code> is to only allow symmetrical columns (columns that are the same size as each other), much like multicolumn layout does today.</p>
<h2><a name="leveraging-grid%e2%80%99s-ability-to-let-content-span-columns"></a>Leveraging Grid’s ability to let content span columns</h2>
<p>CSS Grid also lets us span items across multiple columns. Let’s use that capability to see what interesting options might emerge. How about making every 5th image span two grid columns, while the rest of the images are span one column.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image8-5thwider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image8-5thwider-light.png" alt="same photo layout, now with random photos being bigger"></picture></figure>
<p>What if instead, we put a <code>wider</code> class on specifically on images that have a wider aspect-ratio, to make those images span multiple columns. We can also change the styling a bit, making the corners square instead of round, and reducing the grid gap to zero. This gives us a different way to pack photos of different aspect ratios together.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image9-wideriswider-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image9-wideriswider-light.png" alt="another layout of image, this time where wider images are wider"></picture></figure>
<p>We also experimented with combining the classic masonry/waterfall layout of photos with View Transitions. When a user  clicks/taps on any photo, it grows to span multiple columns. The browser automagically animates the transition. (This demo requires Safari Technology Preview 192 or later.)</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1488" height="1080"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video2-viewtransitions-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video2-viewtransitions-light.m4v" type="video/mp4"></video></figure>
<p>These variations of the Photos and Mega Menu demos are just a small taste of all of the many possibilities you get when leveraging the full power of CSS Grid in the column direction, while simultaneously turning off rows.</p>
<h2><a name="columnar-vs-modular-grids"></a>Columnar vs. Modular Grids</h2>
<p>What happens when we keep experimenting? Let’s let go of thinking about “masonry”, and start imagining Grid Level 3 purely as an expansion of Grid. At its core, CSS Grid Level 3 provides a mechanism for turning off rows. It lets us create a <strong>columnar grid</strong> — a grid that’s made up of columns alone.</p>
<p>By contrast, a <strong>modular grid</strong> is a grid where everything is lined up in both columns and rows. They became popular in the 20th century during the dominance of modernism in graphic design. CSS Grid Level 1 is really good at making modular grids… that’s what it wants to do. In fact, float-based layouts also encouraged the creation of modular grids on the web, since you had to make all your content the same height to get your floats to clear. Images need to be the same aspect ratio. Text has to be the same length. This is often accomplished on the back-end with policies enforced by the content management system, or on the front-end by CSS that truncates/crops the content.</p>
<p>It’s incredible common for websites to do some variation of this sort of modular grid, laid out here with CSS Grid Level 1.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image10-textgrid1-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image10-textgrid1-light.png" alt="layout of text, in ridged sets of boxes, row after row, all the same height"></picture></figure>
<p>Of course, this example is overly simplistic. The article ledes look bare with no teaser images. The uniformity is so strict and formal, the design lacks life. Real websites find other ways to breathe life back into the design.</p>
<p>But what if the layout itself could also provide some vitality and interest? What will happen if we use CSS Grid to create a columnar grid as easily as it creates a modular grid? What if we don’t truncate content, and instead let it be the size that it wants to be — and get the layout to work for the content, rather than forcing the content to work for the layout?</p>
<p>A classic masonry/waterfall layout with various lengths of text looks like this, which is already more engaging since a user can read more about each article:</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image11-textmasonry-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image11-textmasonry-light.png" alt="same article teaser text, this time laid out in columns set with masonry"></picture></figure>
<p>Although, that’s still a bit visually repetitive. Symmetrical columnar grids often are. We need the rest of the power of CSS Grid to do something more interesting. Let’s make the latest article much bigger, and have it span four columns. A handful of other recent articles can be medium-sized and span two columns. While the older content is smaller, spanning one column.</p>
<figure><picture><source srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image12-textgrid3-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image12-textgrid3-light.png" alt="same text, this time laid out with much more dynamic use of 'masonry-style layout plus spanning columns"></picture></figure>
<p>Now this otherwise visually boring text is starting to look fairly lively. If we were to add images to each of these articles, it would be it even more dynamic.</p>
<p>Let’s experiment with mixing images and text together on a webpage for a museum. The first grid item is a header that introduces the museum, and provides navigation to other resources. The rest of the content consists of pieces of artwork and their information: title, artist, year, medium, catalog number and location.</p>
<p>Because the paintings are gorgeous, the content looks pretty great in a classic masonry/waterfall layout.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image13-museummasonry.png" alt="layout of cards, each with a painting and text"></figure>
<p>Let’s see what else we can do by utilizing two more powerful features of CSS Grid — subgrid and explicit placement.</p>
<h2><a name="using-subgrid-and-explicit-placement"></a>Using subgrid and explicit placement</h2>
<p>The functionality provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Subgrid">subgrid</a> in CSS Grid Level 2 is incredible, and it’s <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">finally supported</a> in most browsers.</p>
<p>Instead of listing the painting’s metadata in a single left-aligned column, let’s see how we might better use the available space. By using <code>subgrid</code>, we can put the year and catalog number on the right of each card — and line up this data for one painting with the same data for the other paintings.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image14-museumsubgridintooling.png" alt="close-up of this layout, with the Grid Inspector showing, with lines marking columns showing how subgrid works"></figure>
<p>By adding this new functionality to CSS Grid Level 3, we get the benefit of existing developer tools. You can use the Grid Inspector in Safari Technology Preview today as you try out <code>grid-template-rows: masonry</code>.</p>
<p>If masonry is its own display type, and not part of CSS Grid, it will not get the benefit of subgrid.</p>
<p>We can also use the power of CSS Grid Level 1 to explicitly place the header into the last two columns, moving it to the top right corner of the page with <code>grid-column: -3 / -1</code>.</p>
<figure><video controls="" width="1670" height="1080"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video3-museum-dark.m4v" type="video/mp4" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><source src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/video3-museum-light.m4v"></video></figure>
<p>In just a few lines of layout code, we are using the full power of CSS Grid Levels 1, 2, and 3 to create flexible columns that change in number to accommodate the available size — without using any media queries or container queries.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can see the advantages of fully combining a mechanism for masonry/waterfall layouts with CSS Grid — providing many more creative possibilities than masonry alone.</p>
<h2><a name="the-debate"></a>The Debate</h2>
<p>So let’s get into the debate that’s been blocking the CSS Working Group from moving forward. Our hope is that web designers and developers chime in (post to social media, write blog posts) with your thoughts about which direction CSS should take.</p>
<p>Some people, including those of us at Apple, like having “Masonry” be part of CSS Grid. We believe this functionality is a mechanism to expand CSS Grid — allowing it to finally create columnar grids as well as modular grids. And we want this functionality to be mixed with all the other features of Grid, including the powerful options for defining a columns, track spanning, explicit placement, and subgrid.</p>
<p>Other people instead believe Masonry should be its own separate display type. At first glance, defining Masonry with a new display type might make a lot of sense. You do get a tidy separation between layout types.</p>
<pre><code><span>display</span>: <span>block</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>inline</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>flexbox</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
<span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The CSS Working Group has not discussed how the syntax for a separate Masonry display type would work, but perhaps it would be patterned after <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout">Multicolumn layout</a>.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>columns</span>: <span>28</span><span>ch</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or perhaps the syntax would be patterned after Grid, <em>but with significant limitations</em>:</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> {
  <span>display</span>: <span>masonry</span>;
  <span>masonry-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>5</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>28</span><span>ch</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>)); 
                   <span>/* where only one repeating width is allowed */</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Either way, it’s clear that advocates of this option want Masonry to be limited to a symmetrical grid — where all the columns are the same size as each other. None of the rest of CSS Grid’s track sizing capabilities would be allowed.</p>
<p>Making masonry a simple and separate layout type would avoid the work necessary to keep Grid and Masonry working together in combination — both now and in the long term. Doing this would simplify the layout model, make it easier to implement in browsers, reduce the potential for performance traps, and allow the feature sets of Grid and Masonry to diverge.</p>
<p>Conversely, we believe the effort needed to add this capability to CSS Grid is worth the many benefits to be had. The <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-grid-3/">CSS Grid Level 3 specification</a> has already been written, and implemented in <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_grid-template-rows_masonry">two browser engines</a>. And yes, while making CSS Grid more complex will make it harder to extend in the future, we believe there’s an advantage to having these two types of grid layouts intertwined. This way the CSS Working Group will always define all new additions for both modular and columnar grids. There won’t be something added to <code>display: grid</code> that will be left out of <code>display: masonry</code>, or vice versa. For example, many developers want CSS Grid Level 4 to provide a mechanism for styling grid areas and grid lines — perhaps a way to add a background color to a track, or create a rule line in a gap. It’d be great to ensure that will work for both modular and columnar grids from Day 1.</p>
<p>Another argument made by advocates of <code>display: masonry</code> is that that masonry is conceptually a fundamentally different layout type from CSS Grid, and therefore should have its own display type. They often describe CSS Grid as inherently being about “lining things up in two-dimensions”, and since masonry only lines things up in one dimension, “it’s not a grid”. (In fact, some have advocated that Masonry is more like Flexbox, since “both line things up in one direction”.)</p>
<p>In many ways, your perspective on this question might depends on what you imagine a grid is.</p>
<h2><a name="what-is-a-grid"></a>What is a grid?</h2>
<p>Grids are an incredibly important aspect of graphic design. Grids are used to line up text, images and other content in a regular pattern. They help readability and usability by making things predictable.</p>
<p>You can trace their use through thousands of years of history.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the 20th century that European and American modernists started promoting the idea that “proper” graphic design grids should line content up in both directions — in rows as well as columns.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids.jpg" alt="spread from a book, showing two different newspaper home pages, where articles line up in a modular grid — in both row and column directions" width="1500" height="1125" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids.jpg 1500w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids-300x225.jpg 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/image16-vignelligrids-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"><figcaption>Massimo Vignelli is especially well-known for promoting the idea that lining things up in both columns and rows is a superior practice of graphic design.

<p>Even today, there is a lot of debate about which type of grid is the best grid or the only legitimate grid. Many designers claim a 12 column grid is the only correct way to design a web page — or 12 columns for “desktop”, 8 columns for “tablet”, and 4 columns for “phones”. At times designers have gotten quite religious about their ideas of what a “proper grid” looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/five-simple-steps-to-designing-grid-systems-part-1/">Mark Boulton</a> argued for years that symmetrical columnar grids are incredibly formulaic and boring. He promoted the use of asymmetrical compound grids in design for the web. Today, luckily CSS Grid Level 1 makes it incredibly easy to create both asymmetrical grids and compound grids, giving designers the freedom to create what they want. But only if they also want all their grids to be a modular grids.</p>
<p>Both modular and columnar grids are in fact grids. And CSS Grid deserves the ability to also create columnar grids.</p>

<p>We believe there’s an opportunity for CSS to enable a rich history of design grids to come to the web — and would be greatly disappointed to see the new masonry feature limited to only allowing symmetrical columnar grids.</p>
<p>But what do you think?</p>
<h2><a name="we-want-to-hear-from-you"></a>We want to hear from you</h2>
<p>This is where you come in. Try some demos of your own. Write about your thoughts on your own blog. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10233">Comment at the CSS Working Group in this issue</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Should “masonry”/“waterfall” be part of CSS Grid?</li>
<li>Do you want the capabilities to define a columnar grid with CSS Grid — to use subgrid, spanning, explicit placement, and all the many options for track sizing? Or do you only want the ability to define a classic masonry layout with equal-sized columns?</li>
<li>Will you use this? What might you create with it?</li>
<li>Do you have links to demos you’ve made?  We want to see your ideas and use cases.</li>
<li>Are there things you want to do that you can’t do with this model?</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, thinking about something theoretically and actually seeing it in use can be very different. To make sure the CSSWG gets the design of this feature correct, we need developers to gain some hands-on experience, and articulate your thoughts about what it’s like.</p>
<p>The WebKit team has been working on Masonry for a year and a half. It was first enabled by default in <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13839/release-notes-for-safari-technology-preview-163/">Safari Technology Preview 163</a> in February 2023. There’s a bit more polish needed, and details to work out (naming being one). But we would like to ship this feature soon. To do so, these fundamental questions need to be resolved.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
<h2><a name="p-s-about-the-name%e2%80%a6"></a>P.S. About the name…</h2>
<p>It’s likely <code>masonry</code> is not the best name for this new value. Names in CSS are usually simple words that directly describe the result they create — like <code>center</code>, <code>under</code>, <code>contain</code>, <code>clip</code>, <code>revert</code>, <code>ltr</code>, <code>always</code>, <code>break-word</code>, <code>hidden</code>, <code>allow-end</code>, <code>scale-down</code>, <code>wrap</code>, <code>smooth</code>.</p>
<p>The word “masonry” is more of a metaphor, where the meaning has to be explained with a backstory. Such a term is harder to remember for developers who do not speak English. And arguably, the syntax could just as easily be <code>grid-template-rows: waterfall</code> instead, since that’s the dominant word for this layout used in certain regions, not masonry.</p>
<p>Plus, once you start to write a lot of code using this feature, it’s likely you’ll come to the realization that we did — this really isn’t about the layout used by Pinterest or other similar sites. This is a mechanism for telling the browser, “please create a grid, but <em>without any rows.</em>”</p>
<p>Perhaps the best syntax could be <code>grid-template-rows: none;</code> to convey “please do not give me any rows”. Sadly, it’s too late to use this name, because <code>none</code> is the default value for <code>grid-template-*</code> and means “please give me only implicit rows, no explicit ones”.</p>
<p>Instead we could use the name <code>off</code> to convey “please turn off the grid in the row direction, and give me only columns”.</p>
<pre><code><span>main</span> { 
  <span>display</span>: <span>grid</span>;
  <span>grid-template-columns</span>: <span>repeat</span>(<span>auto-fill</span>, <span>minmax</span>(<span>14</span><span>rem</span>, <span>1</span><span>fr</span>));
  <span>grid-template-rows</span>: <span>off</span>; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The CSSWG is debating this name in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9733">this issue</a>. If you have ideas or preferences for a name, please join that discussion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <code>masonry</code> is the value that is currently implemented in Safari Technology Preview, since that’s what the Editor’s Draft currently uses. And so that’s what we used in our demos above, and what you should use in yours. But do expect the name of this value to change in the future. And perhaps prepare for a future where we call this “columnar grid” or “Grid Level 3” instead of “Masonry”.</p>

<p>However, Lenat’s death in August last year has unlocked his <a href="https://www.saildart.org/[*,DBL]/">SAILDART archives</a> account.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce phi-3-mini, a 3.8 billion parameter language model trained on 3.3 trillion tokens, whose overall performance, as measured by both academic benchmarks and internal testing, rivals that of models such as Mixtral 8x7B and GPT-3.5 (e.g., phi-3-mini achieves 69% on MMLU and 8.38 on MT-bench), despite being small enough to be deployed on a phone. The innovation lies entirely in our dataset for training, a scaled-up version of the one used for phi-2, composed of heavily filtered web data and synthetic data. The model is also further aligned for robustness, safety, and chat format. We also provide some initial parameter-scaling results with a 7B and 14B models trained for 4.8T tokens, called phi-3-small and phi-3-medium, both significantly more capable than phi-3-mini (e.g., respectively 75% and 78% on MMLU, and 8.7 and 8.9 on MT-bench).

	<div>
		<p>Starting Tuesday, March 19, The Seattle Public Library is reducing the number of maximum holds allowed on e-books and e-audiobooks from 25 to 10.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have more than 10 holds on digital books at that time, you won’t lose any of these holds. You just won’t be able to place new holds until you’re within the new limit. Also, the limit for digital borrowing has not changed – you can still borrow up to 25 digital books at a time.</p>
<p>While the vast majority of our patrons won’t be affected by this change, we want to explain why the Library needed to reduce the holds limit to manage spending and meet increasing patron interest in digital books. In the Q&amp;A below, we also share some tips for alternative tools you can use for tracking books you want to read and making the most of your Library account.</p>
<p><b>Why did the Library need to make this change? </b></p>
<p>If you’ve started borrowing digital books from the Library in recent years, you’ve been part of the biggest shift in library lending in recent history.</p>
<p>Although the popularity of digital books was rising before 2020, the pandemic accelerated this trend. At The Seattle Public Library, annual checkouts of digital books almost tripled from 2015 to 2022, as did costs.</p>
<p>The Library has increased investment in digital collections to meet patron interest. Unfortunately, because of the way digital books are priced for libraries, meeting increased demand has come at a cost that has become unsustainable.</p>
<p><b>Why are digital books so expensive? </b></p>
<p>As a consumer, when you buy an e-book or e-audiobook, it costs about the same or sometimes even less than the print book version. But for libraries, the e-book or e-audiobook version of a title actually costs up to three times or more than the print version.</p>
<p>This is because publishers use a licensing model for selling e-books to libraries. Each copy of a digital book title requires a purchase of a license. While there are many types of licenses, the most common license needs to be purchased and then re-purchased every year.</p>
<p><b>What do holds have to do with the cost of digital books? </b></p>
<p>This may seem surprising, but patron holds are the single biggest factor in rising costs. To maintain reasonable wait times, the Library buys additional licenses of a digital title when patrons place more holds on it. That means that when hundreds of patrons place holds on a single New York Times bestseller, the costs of “buying down the holds” can quickly become astronomical.</p>
<p>In 2023, 62% of the Library’s spending on digital books was used to purchase additional copies to fulfill holds placed on popular titles.</p>
<p><span id="more-84381"></span>As you can see in the chart below, Library costs for meeting increased patron interest in popular e-books have nearly tripled since 2015. Reducing the number of holds the Library allows can help us better manage these costs, which will allow us to continue providing a broad and diverse selection of e-books and e-audiobooks, and to meet patron demand all year.</p>

<p><b>Is this change being made due to the City’s budget challenges?</b></p>
<p>No, this change is part of routine service assessments and adjustments the Library makes to ensure we are aligning our services with our current budgetary and staffing resources. The Library has been monitoring rising costs of digital books for several years and has been assessing the best course of action to manage these increasing costs. The change to our maximum holds limit for digital books is being made now so that we can continue to maintain reasonable wait times as costs and popularity of these materials continue to rise.</p>
<p><b>That all makes sense. But I use my Libby holds list as my “to be read” wish list. What else can I do? </b></p>
<p>If you tend to place holds on digital books through the Library’s online catalog, we encourage you to check out the <a href="https://help.bibliocommons.com/020shelves/000my-shelves/">“Shelves” feature</a> in the online catalog, which allows you to tag books you want to read in the future. If you use OverDrive’s Libby app to place holds on and borrow digital books, you can use the “Tags” feature to easily create a wish list. Check the <a href="https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6087.htm#aanchor38">Libby Help section</a> for more information.</p>
<p><b>Do you have other suggestions for finding great digital books that are available without a wait? </b></p>
<p>Yes! You can check out hundreds of e-books and e-audiobooks right away, with no holds, through OverDrive’s Always Available collection. It includes a wide range of popular e-books and e-audiobooks, and the collection is always changing. Look for the <a href="https://spl.overdrive.com/library/avail">Always Available collection</a> in the e-book catalog or, in Libby, look for the Available Now section.</p>
<p><b>Further reading: </b>If you’re interested in learning more about the topic of digital book pricing and how that affects libraries, you can <a href="https://www.govtech.com/biz/data/behind-e-books-libraries-find-restrictions-and-high-costs">explore further at this GovTech article</a>: “Behind E-Books, Libraries Find Restrictions and High Costs.”</p>

The user would still be able to install apps using a ~/Applications folder and have settings in ~/Library. ~/Library is typically used automatically, while ~/Applications is something that needs to be created, but works just fine.  I use this at work to install some things I would otherwise not be able to install.

An app wasn't launching on their phone, they went to the Apple Store, the person figured out that they hadn't updated their apps in a long time, did that, made sure it worked, and turned on auto-updates (after asking if that would be good for them). Perfect, I didn't even know they had a problem until I heard the story about it being fixed.<p>I've had relatives go to other tech support places and usually it means they pay money for someone to upsell them on something else or tell them they need a new machine. Apple is fine supporting my parents who don't want a new iPhone. Yea, eventually it's out of support, but it's a long enough time.</p><p>I also love that the Apple ecosystem tends towards "you should be willing to pay money for something" rather than "let's see how we can scam money out of someone unwilling to part with their money." If you're techie, you know the difference between real stuff and fake stuff. When non-techies get a pop-up on their Windows laptop telling them that their anti-virus subscription is running out (that came pre-installed) and that they'll be vulnerable to all sorts of bad things if they don't pay $50, they get nervous and call me. Then I have to figure out (over the phone) how to uninstall the crap and get Microsoft Defender working.</p><p>Even Windows 11 is just becoming a pile of ads and other junk.</p><p>With streaming TV boxes, Roku ends up installing apps they don't know how to uninstall because if you press the play button while the TV is off, it installs whatever app they're promoting on the screen saver. Fire TV and Android TV are a mess of ads and it's hard to know what content you have access to and what you don't. I'm just so sick of relatives asking me "How did this app get on my Roku? How do I get it off?" and things like "How do I only see the shows I have access to? Why is it showing me Showtime when it tells me I have to pay when I click on it? I think dad might have subscribed to things because he didn't know what he was doing. How do I cancel that? No I don't know what he might have subscribed to."</p><p>Sure, you can say that Apple TV comes with the Apple TV app pre-installed, but it isn't constantly pushing things on you. Sure, Apple would like an iCloud subscription, but if my parents end up giving Apple $1/mo, I'm fine with that. The level of difference is simply astonishing. It's like having a store email you once "hey, we have new pants" compared to the stores that email you twice a day "HEY!!!! HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT NEW PANTS!!!!" You can say "they're both doing it", but there's a huge difference.</p><p>Apple isn't perfect, but I feel comfortable with non-techie people in my life having Apple products. They can get support when they need it at the Apple Store, Apple is happy with the money they've paid for the product, and I can put their technical needs out of my mind. They love it too. They get unlimited free access to helpful employees who fix their stuff faster than I can get to it. Yea, if you're techie you know how things work and what to look for and you can make decisions for yourself. When relatives buy non-Apple stuff, they're making a decision that I'm going to fix things for them.

Running well on old and cheap hardware is also a plus, I couldn't convince anyone to buy a new or even used iMac (and wouldn't want to do that anyway, macOS is far from bug free...).</p><p>That said, none of them have self-destructive tendencies and I don't expect to just give them a device and have them set it up themselves.

From Fedora 39, I switched to using the built-in remote desktop function (RDP) + an always-on Wireguard connection, which makes screen sharing so smooth when I occasionally need to help with non-OS related challenges. This can also be used for SSH access, or whatever.</p><p>I recently went with Fedora Silverblue for another relative, which makes everything stay up to date without them noticing. So far it has worked fine, but installing the printer driver was a bit different than usual – but not a problem.</p><p>EDIT: Prior experiences has been primarily with macOS, and it has been a lot of trouble adjusting it to their needs and preferences.

My only hope now is that a Jonathan Haidt and Tristan Harris arise from the ashes to protect the elderly without blaming them for software design mistakes arising over the last 3 decades that could have been avoided. Finance paved the way for abuse of the elderly. Sadly, big tech has picked up that torch and run with it.</span></p></div></td></tr>

Here is my experience. I tried with cheaper phones that we can just replace when they lose, drop it, or many other reasons.<p>Get them on iPhones, Macs, Apple TV, and iPads. They can be used ones or hand-me-downs, but that ecosystem works for them. Here is a setup for the in-laws.</p><p>An Apple TV drives as the "Apple Home" Setup while an iPad (the backup) is mounted near the TV. That room/area is the "talking to the kids area" where they just know how to respond or start a video call. The only other button they learned was to switch between their favorite local cable provider and the Apple TV. It did take a lot of repeated practice from "I can see on the iPad but not TV" to "seeing and talking on the big TV".</p><p>iPhones/Macs (instead of selling yours, give them your old one) are the easiest to set up and maintain. The contacts sync, and they have stopped complaining about getting back their phone contacts. The father-in-law once hand-wrote about a 5-paged A4 with about 200+ odd numbers and came to me to sync to the new phone. They are not losing their photos anymore and can spend hours browsing photos of their gigantic family members.</p><p>Tip: Set up your Apple TV screensaver with a specific Album and keep sharing photos there. Now, watch the grandparents, grand-everyone just sit in front of the screensaver and spend hours talking, laughing, arguing, crying, and sleeping off.

So, this used to happen a lot when the kids wanted to play with the grandparents phones. So, I explain nicely to everyone that the devices are out of bounds for everyone and no-one touches the devices any more. That solves that. However, on rare occasions, there are needs to enter the Apple password -- my wife have a few other cousins who helps out. For parents with no access to external help, I suggest printing out on a paper and keeping it safe (use a font-size large of a serif fonts). If your local language is not English, complex password but based off the local language are easier -- (in locale) my dear friend's NAME that died during WWII on this DATE, etc. ;-)<p>Update: For cultural context and to avoid confusion with others around the world who have separate living spaces, my in-laws lives in a pretty large sprawl of almost a colony on their own with their brothers, sisters, cousins, and the entire families. On Google Maps, I had actually named the central home of that locality (my in-laws) to a specific name based on their family name -- making it easy for deliveries by post (Amazon, Post Office, Air Cargo deliveries, etc). In that part of the world, addresses are not precise and still goes on word of mouth.

It was 100% the right move.  I haven't had to fix their computer in the past 7 years.  Bought refurbs to keep the price down but it was still a couple grand total for two units.  I got the cell enabled ones too so they work when they travel.  Totally worth it.<p>A couple years ago I finally got them to switch from their pre-paid flip phone to an iphone.  That's also gone extremely well.  They own a Thor RV which (no surprise) has a terrible OEM stereo.  Replaced that with a carplay capable one with a giant (but pretty low res) screen and that's made their RV travel GPS integration far less buggy than when using plain old bluetooth.</p><p>TBH moving them to iOS from windows was far less of a painful process than I expected and I'm pretty apple positive.  The fact that it just works and they really can't 'f it up makes a big difference.  Now they can download all sorts of shit games and I really don't have to worry about the system getting hosed.  If I considered how much I value my time and the frustration multiplier then it's an investment that has easily paid back in multiples.

Remove all the options they shouldn’t touch. Explore the accessibility options, set the text size and cursors big enough.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://gajus.com/blog/avoiding-visually-ambiguous-characters-in-ids">https://gajus.com/blog/avoiding-visually-ambiguous-characters-in-ids</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40127124">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post-body"><p>It is not uncommon that I need to write down or communicate IDs when interacting with systems, e.g. reporting a bug, entering a discount code, or tracking a package. It is frustrating when the experience is marred by an easy mistake to avoid - visually ambiguous characters.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-visually-ambiguous-characters"></h2>
<ul>
<li><code>O</code> / <code>0</code> - The letter <code>O</code> and the number <code>0</code> can look very similar, especially in fonts where the number zero isn’t slashed or dotted.</li>
<li><code>I</code> / <code>l</code> / <code>1</code> / <code>7</code> - The letter <code>I</code> (uppercase <code>i</code>), lowercase <code>l</code> (<code>L</code>), the number <code>1</code>, and the number <code>7</code> <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-1">1</a></sup> can be indistinguishable in many types of print and handwriting.</li>
<li><code>5</code> / <code>S</code> - In some fonts, the number <code>5</code> and the letter <code>S</code> can appear quite similar.</li>
<li><code>2</code> / <code>Z</code> - These can also be confused with each other, particularly in handwritten forms.</li>
<li><code>8</code> / <code>B</code> - These characters might be mixed up when poorly written or in certain stylized fonts.</li>
<li><code>6</code> / <code>G</code> - These characters can be confused in some fonts.</li>
<li><code>9</code> / <code>q</code> / <code>g</code> - These characters can be confused in some fonts.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-are-visually-ambiguous-characters-a-problem"></h2>
<p>They cause confusion and errors in data entry, especially when the characters are handwritten or when the font is not clear. For example, if a user is trying to enter a code that contains the letter 'O' and the number '0', they might not be able to tell which character is which. This leads to frustrating user experiences.</p>
<p>A few examples using different system fonts:</p>
<ul><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (ariel)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (helvetica)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (courier)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (times)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (verdana)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (georgia)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (tahoma)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (impact)</li><li><span>9qg6G8B2Z5SIl170O</span> (comic sans)</li></ul>
<p>Some pairs are visually ambiguous in all fonts (e.g. <code>I</code> and <code>l</code>), while others are much harder to distinguish in handwritten forms, e.g. try writing <code>9qg</code> in your own handwriting.</p>
<h2 id="when-it-matters"></h2>
<p>Any time that the ID might need to be communicated verbally or written down, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer support</li>
<li>Discount codes</li>
<li>Tracking codes</li>
<li>Error IDs</li>
<li>Product IDs</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="deciding-between-case-sensitivity"></h2>
<p>You may also consider whether your IDs should be case-sensitive or not. Is <code>abc</code> the same as <code>ABC</code>?</p>
<p>Assuming that you are going with case sensitivity, you have 53 characters to choose from (adjusted for visually ambiguous characters). On the other hand, if you decide to make your IDs case-insensitive, you have only 22 characters to choose from.</p>
<p>Assuming an ID length of 5 characters, you have the following number of possible IDs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Case-sensitive: 53^5 = 418,195,493</li>
<li>Case-insensitive: 22^5 = 5,153,632</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as the number of members in the set increases, the number of possible IDs increases exponentially.</p>
<ul>
<li>Case-sensitive: 53^8 = 62,259,690,411,360</li>
<li>Case-insensitive: 22^8 = 54,875,873,536</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the real question is whether what's preferable is a shorter ID with a higher chance of visual ambiguity or a longer ID with a lower chance of visual ambiguity.</p>
<h3 id="case-sensitivity-and-third-party-systems"></h3>
<p>As pointed out in a Hacker News comment <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-2">2</a></sup>, if you use both upper and lower case, you are likely to eventually be surprised by some third party system or protocol that is case insensitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I even found a commercial system which allowed users to choose IDs with case sensitivity (iD and id being distinct) but if you query it for one which does not exist they do case insensitive matching and return the wrong data.</p>
<p>When I reported this bug they said it was for convenience!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="visually-unambiguous-dictionary"></h2>
<p>As my preference is readability, this is the character set that I use for generating IDs in my projects:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="json" data-theme="default"><code data-language="json" data-theme="default"><span data-line=""><span>[</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"x"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"y"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"3"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  </span><span>"4"</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>]</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="further-considerations"></h2>
<h3 id="combinations"></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>rn</code> (looks like <code>m</code>) <sup><a id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#user-content-fn-3">3</a></sup></li>

</ul>
<p>Personally, I would be wary of excluding characters just because they look like other characters when combined. Avoiding these particular combinations might be a good idea at the ID generation level.</p>
<h3 id="phonetic-similarity"></h3>
<p>In some cases, you might also want to avoid characters that sound similar when spoken. For example, <code>b</code> and <code>p</code> can sound similar when spoken out loud. This can be especially important in situations where IDs are communicated verbally.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/22/ghaderi_v_amazon/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/22/ghaderi_v_amazon/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40127106">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A lawsuit is alleging Amazon was so desperate to keep up with the competition in generative AI it was willing to breach its own copyright rules.</p>
<p>The allegation emerges from a <a target="_blank" href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/04/22/ghaderi_v_amazon_et_al.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] accusing the tech and retail mega-corp of demoting, and then dismissing, a former high-flying AI scientist after it discovered she was pregnant.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed last week in a Los Angeles state court by Dr Viviane Ghaderi, an AI researcher who says she worked successfully in Amazon's Alexa and LLM teams, and achieved a string of promotions, but claims she was later suddenly demoted and fired following her return to work after giving birth. She is alleging discrimination, retaliation, harassment and wrongful termination, among other claims.</p>

    

<p>Montana MacLachlan, an Amazon spokesperson, said of the suit: "We do not tolerate discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in our workplace. We investigate any reports of such conduct and take appropriate action against anyone found to have violated our policies."</p>

        


        

<p>As well as alleging sexism and discrimination against her, Ghaderi also accuses the tech giant of singling her out because she complained when Amazon allegedly breached its own rules against copyright infringement when it came to AI research.</p>
<p>According to Ghaderi's account in the complaint, she returned to work after giving birth in January 2023, inheriting a large language model project. Part of her role was flagging violations of Amazon's internal copyright policies and escalating these concerns to the in-house legal team. In March 2023, the filing claims, her team director, Andrey Styskin, challenged Ghaderi to understand why Amazon was not meeting its goals on Alexa search quality.</p>

        

<p>The filing alleges she met with a representative from the legal department to explain her concerns and the tension they posed with the "direction she had received from upper management, which advised her to violate the direction from legal."</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Styskin rejected Ghaderi's concerns, allegedly telling her to ignore copyright policies to improve the results. Referring to rival AI companies, the filing alleges he said: "Everyone else is doing it."</p>
<p>The allegations come at a difficult time for developers of AI models in relation to copyright infringement in training data. A string of legal cases have been launched concerning the consumption and reproduction of copyrighted text by generative AI. Novelists Paul Tremblay, Christopher Golden, Richard Kadrey, and comedian Sarah Silverman <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/10/in_brief_ai/">accused OpenAI</a> of unlawfully scraping their work last year, while the New York Times is suing Microsoft and OpenAI, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/13/nyt_hacking_response/">claiming</a> the duo infringed on the newspaper's copyright by using its articles without permission.</p>

        

<p>A German-born doctor of electrical engineering, Ghaderi also made a series of allegations relating to her treatment by Amazon following the disclosure of her pregnancy.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, she joined the technology giant as a program manager in 2018 and received glowing appraisals. Although she left to join a startup in February 2021, Ghaderi was rehired by Amazon "based on her strong performance and relationships with colleagues."</p>
<p>Ghaderi was offered a new role with the opportunity to become an applied science manager. She rejoined as a engineering manager at the top of a salary band, leading a team of one scientist and two engineers. For the first five months of her return she received positive feedback from supervisors and direct reports, her filing claims.</p>
<p>In September 2022, Amazon put together a new science team looking at data quality and compliance in the Alexa organization. Ghaderi says in her complaint that she moved up a level of management to lead the team, and reported to the department director Daniel Marcu, on a higher grade than her previous manager.</p>
<p>On her first meeting with Marcu, she disclosed she was pregnant, information she had already shared with her previous manager. "Marcu, taken aback, responded by informing Ghaderi that she would be 'temporarily' transferred to report to a different employee, Mahesh Krishnakumar. Marcu admitted to Ghaderi that he was changing her reporting structure 'temporar[ily]' so he would not have to 'worry' about managing her team during her leave," the court documents allege.</p>
<p>Ghaderi claims Krishnakumar later pressured her into delaying the start of her maternity leave from the planned date of November 7. Agreeing to the request, she worked until November 15, 2022, "the day she was forced to undergo an emergency C-section," according to the filing.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, the launch of OpenAI's GPT-4 caused "panic" within Amazon, the complaint adds.</p>
<p>Ghaderi is also alleging a retaliation charge against Amazon "based on her complaints of violations of copyright law and policy" as well as on the basis of alleged violations of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act.</p>
<p>After she returned to work in January 2023, Ghaderi claims she was told by colleagues that Krishnakumar had not been present for most of her absence, and when he was there he contributed little, resulting in a backlog of work. While managing Ghaderi, the documents allege Krishnakumar made "numerous discriminatory and harassing comments" such as "Take it easy, I have young daughters, so I know it's hard to be a woman with a newborn," or "You should spend time with your daughter," or "You should just enjoy being a new mother."</p>
<p>Ghaderi made repeated requests to be reinstated to her promised career path, according to the complaint, which goes on to allege that Marcu denied this request and said she should continue reporting to Krishnakumar. After Styskin joined the organization as a director, Ghaderi's complaint claims, Marcu said the decision was now his and she was never reinstated.</p>
<p>She goes on to allege that in a performance review, Amazon did not consider evidence from before her maternity leave. While she met the "high bar" expected by the company she needed to improve on "earning trust" and "delivering results," the review said. When she asked Krishnakumar for evidence to support this claim, he could not provide any, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>In March 2023, she complained to HR about the review, and the failure to reinstate her in the role she had been promised. After a meeting with Styskin and Krishnakumar, she again complained to HR that the "work context/dynamic ha[d] completely shifted from just 4.5 months ago when I had been moved… to work under [Marcu] before my maternity leave."</p>
<p>Shortly after the HR meeting, the complaint alleges Styskin told the AI exec she would be stripped of her team and demoted. He then asked her how she felt about the decision. When she asked for clarification, he allegedly responded: "You know, feelings, or are you saying, 'Oh, I'm from Germany so I don't have feelings'?"</p>
<p>Ghaderi then made a formal complaint to HR, alleging her demotion related to discrimination and retaliation relating to her pregnancy. The filing alleges she also mentioned Styskin's comment about her not having feelings owing to her nationality. Although HR did find the latter remark had fallen below Amazon's standards of conduct, it did not uphold the two other complaints.</p>
<p>In May 2023, Ghaderi took more protected leave, to return in August 2023, after which she was placed on Amazon's informal "Focus" performance review plan and her role was diminished again. The complaint claims she was then given another negative performance appraisal and told the career path available to her prior to her maternity leave was no longer on the table.</p>

</ul>
<p>The filing continues that she subsequently requested to be moved to another team, but, allegedly, her line manager said because she was on the Focus plan she was ineligible for a transfer. After that, she was placed on the formal "Pivot" plan, which means leaving or complying with performance targets.</p>
<p>The complaint argues the plan was designed to ensure Ghaderi's failure.</p>

<p>The filing adds that after she requested guidance on the task she was told she "should be able to do this with no help."</p>
<p>Ghaderi complained again to HR about pregnancy discrimination and being given impossible performance tasks, after which she alleges she was fired.</p>
<p>Her lawyers have demanded a jury trial and named Amazon.com Services, Andrey Styskin, and Mahesh Krishnakumar as defendants. They also cite other unnamed defendants. The lawsuit includes seven causes including violation of employment law against sex discrimination, pregnancy leave law, harassment, protection against retaliation. It also includes failure to take steps to prevent discrimination and protect whistleblowers, as well as wrongful termination of employment.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Deep learning (DL) is becoming the cornerstone of numerous applications both in datacenters and at the edge. Specialized hardware is often necessary to meet the performance requirements of state-of-the-art DL models, but the rapid pace of change in DL models and the wide variety of systems integrating DL make it impossible to create custom computer chips for all but the largest markets. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) present a unique blend of reprogrammability and direct hardware execution that make them suitable for accelerating DL inference. They offer the ability to customize processing pipelines and memory hierarchies to achieve lower latency and higher energy efficiency compared to general-purpose CPUs and GPUs, at a fraction of the development time and cost of custom chips. Their diverse high-speed IOs also enable directly interfacing the FPGA to the network and/or a variety of external sensors, making them suitable for both datacenter and edge use cases. As DL has become an ever more important workload, FPGA architectures are evolving to enable higher DL performance. In this article, we survey both academic and industrial FPGA architecture enhancements for DL. First, we give a brief introduction on the basics of FPGA architecture and how its components lead to strengths and weaknesses for DL applications. Next, we discuss different styles of DL inference accelerators on FPGA, ranging from model-specific dataflow styles to software-programmable overlay styles. We survey DL-specific enhancements to traditional FPGA building blocks such as logic blocks, arithmetic circuitry, and on-chip memories, as well as new in-fabric DL-specialized blocks for accelerating tensor computations. Finally, we discuss hybrid devices that combine processors and coarse-grained accelerator blocks with FPGA-like interconnect and networks-on-chip, and highlight promising future research directions.

The two publishing houses made up 37 percent and 11 percent of the market share, according to the filing, and combined they would have condensed the Big Five publishing houses into the Big Four. But the government intervened and brought an antitrust case against Penguin to determine whether that would create a monopoly.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The judge ultimately ruled that the merger </span><em>would</em><span> create a monopoly and </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-obtains-permanent-injunction-blocking-penguin-random-house-s-proposed" rel="">blocked the $2.2 billion purchase</a><span>. But during the trial, the head of every major publishing house and literary agency got up on the stand to speak about the publishing industry and give numbers, giving us an eye-opening account of the industry from the inside. All of the transcripts from the trial were compiled into a book called </span><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/2268/9781948586559" rel="">The Trial</a></em><span>. It took me a year to read, but I’ve finally summarized my findings and pulled out all the compelling highlights.</span></p><p><span>I think I can sum up what I’ve learned like this: The Big Five publishing houses spend most of their money on book advances for big celebrities like Brittany Spears and franchise authors like James Patterson and this is the bulk of their business. They also sell a lot of Bibles, repeat best sellers like </span><em>Lord of the Rings,</em><span> and children’s books like </span><em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em><span>. These two market categories (celebrity books and repeat bestsellers from the backlist) make up the entirety of the publishing industry and even fund their vanity project: publishing all the rest of the books we think about when we think about book publishing (which make no money at all and typically sell less than 1,000 copies). </span></p><p>But let’s dig into everything they said in detail. </p><p><span>In my essay “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/creator-economy-for-fiction-authors" rel="">Writing books isn’t a good idea</a><span>” I wrote that, in 2020, only 268 titles sold more than 100,000 copies, and 96 percent of books sold less than 1,000 copies. That’s still the vibe. </span></p><blockquote><p>Q. Do you know approximately how many authors there are across the industry with 500,000 units or more during this four-year period?</p><p>A. My understanding is that it was about 50. </p><p>Q. 50 authors across the publishing industry who during this four-year period sold more than 500,000 units in a single year?</p><p>A. Yes. </p><p><span>— </span></p><span>, CEO, Penguin Random House US</span></blockquote><p>The DOJ’s lawyer collected data on 58,000 titles published in a year and discovered that 90 percent of them sold fewer than 2,000 copies and 50 percent sold less than a dozen copies. </p><p><span>In my essay “</span><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/publishing-industry-truth" rel="">No one will read your book</a><span>,” I said that publishing houses work more like venture capitalists. They invest small sums in lots of books in hopes that one of them breaks out and becomes a unicorn, making enough money to fund all the rest. </span></p><p>Turns out, they agree!</p><blockquote><p>Every year, in thousands of ideas and dreams, only a few make it to the top. So I call it the Silicon Valley of media. We are angel investors of our authors and their dreams, their stories. That’s how I call my editors and publishers: angels… It’s rather this idea of Silicon Valley, you see 35 percent are profitable; 50 on a contribution basis. So every book has that same likelihood of succeeding.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House</p></blockquote><p>Those unicorns happen every five to 10 years or so. </p><blockquote><p><span>We’re very hit driven. When a book is successful, it can be wildly successful. There are books that sell millions and millions of copies, and those are financial gushes for the publishers of that book, sometimes for years to come… A gusher is once in a decade or something. For instance, I don’t know if you know the </span><em>Twilight</em><span> series of books? Hachette published the </span><em>Twilight</em><span> series of books, and those made hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of time.</span></p><p><span>Right now the novels of Colleen Hoover are topping the bestseller lists in really, really huge numbers and the publishers of those books are making a lot of money. You probably remember </span><em>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</em><span>… Or the </span><em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em><span> series. So once every five years, ten years, those come along for the whole industry and become the industry driver that’s drawing people into bookstores because there is such a commotion about them.&nbsp;</span></p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><p>They spent a lot of the trial talking about books that made an advance of more than $250,000—they called these “anticipated top-sellers.” According to Nicholas Hill, a partner at Bates White Economic Consulting, 2 percent of all titles earn an advance over $250,000. </p><p>Publisher’s Marketplace says it’s even lower. </p><blockquote><p>Top-selling authors were defined as those receiving advances (i.e., guaranteed money) in excess of $250,000. Far fewer than 1 percent of authors receive advances over that mark; Publishers Marketplace, which tracks these things, recorded 233 such deals in all of 2022. </p><p><span>— </span></p><span>, </span><a href="https://shush.substack.com/p/a-sorry-end-to-publishings-biggest" rel="">Publisher at Sutherland House</a></blockquote><p>Hill says titles that earn advances over $250,000 account for 70 percent of advance spending by publishing houses. At Penguin Random House, it’s even more. The bulk of their advance spending goes to deals worth $1 million or more, and there are about 200 of those deals a year. Of the roughly $370 million they say PRH accounts for, $200 million of that goes to advance deals worth $1 million or more. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png" width="1288" height="748" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/be5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:748,&quot;width&quot;:1288,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:131766,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe5fb286-2193-431d-9a1b-1c473eb8ca9a_1288x748.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>This chart shows that as advances go up, more of them come from Penguin Random House which has the deepest pockets.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Most of those are deals with celebrities.

Walsch says James Patterson and John Grisham get advances in the “many millions.” Putnam makes most of its money from repeat authors like John Sandford, Clive Cussler, Tom Clancy, Lisa Scottoline, and others. </p><blockquote><p>Q.

And if that platform is there for the advertising, then the spend might be lower.</p><p>— Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, former Agent</p></blockquote><p>Macmillan agrees. </p><blockquote><p>Q. Would you agree that those type of authors, meaning the ones with the built-in audience, are also authors who would command a high advance if they went to a traditional publisher like Macmillan or PRH?&nbsp;</p><p>A.

Yes.</p><p>— Donald Weisberg, CEO, Macmillan Publishers</p></blockquote><p>They give some examples:</p><blockquote><p><em>The Butcher and the Wren</em><span>… this particular author has a big following, and with a single post on Instagram, she presold over 40,000 books.

They have their own publicists. They have their own social media people. They have their own newsletters. So they actually are able—we are able to offload a good amount of the work, not all the time, but that is actually a factor in why we sometimes pay these big advances, because the authors are actually capable of helping us a lot.</p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>For example:</p><blockquote><p><span>Q. Who is the best selling Simon &amp; Schuster author currently?&nbsp;</span><br><span>A. Right now it’s Colleen Hoover.&nbsp;</span><br><span>Q.

So publicity drove that, and that didn’t cost us. </p><p>— Jennifer Bergstrom, SVP, Gallery Books Group</p></blockquote><p>Just goes to show that the main thing an author gets from a publishing house is an advance!</p><blockquote><p>Every second book in America, ballpark, is being sold via e-commerce…Amazon.com has 50 million books available.

One of the many efforts that we pursue, correct.</p><p>Q. And Penguin Random House pays Amazon to improve its search results?&nbsp;</p><p>A.

Well, because books don’t sell a lot of copies, they don’t make a lot of money. According to Hill, 85 percent of the books with advances of $250,000 and up never earn out their advance. (Meaning the royalties earned never covered the cost of the advance.)</p><blockquote><p>Very, very frequently, the winning bid in our calculation is a money loser.</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette </p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png" width="1456" height="704" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:704,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:866804,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d27dd68-7158-4a63-af79-95dfbbb816e3_2138x1034.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>A chart from Penguin</figcaption></figure></div><p>Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House, says the top 4 percent of titles drive 60 percent of the profitability. That goes for the rest of them too:</p><blockquote><p>It would be just a couple of books in every hundred are driving that degree of profit… twoish books account for the lion’s share of profitability. </p><p>— Madeline Mcintosh, CEO, Penguin Random House US</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Around half the books we publish make a profit of some kind.</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>About half of the books we publish make money, and a much lower percentage of them earn back the advance we pay.</p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>Many publishers have realized that maybe those big advances aren’t worth it. </p><blockquote><p>We have a report that we colloquially call ‘The Ones That Got Away.’ And it’s a report on the books where we bid $500,000 or more as an advance and did not succeed in acquiring the book… this report stands as a kind of caution against the high risk of big advances because the lesson we take away again and again is: Thank goodness we stopped bidding when we did because even at the advance we offered, we would have lost money… Very frequently, the winning bid in our calculation is a money loser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><p>If new books typically don’t sell well, well that’s why publishing houses make their revenue from their backlist. </p><blockquote><p>I would actually expect a book that is selling 300,000 units in a year is probably going to sell at least 400,000 or 500,000 over its life once you get backlist in there too.</p><p>Our backlist brings in about a third of our annual revenues, so $300 million a year roughly, a little less.</p><p>— Michael Pietsch, CEO, Hachette</p></blockquote><p><span>The backlist includes all of the books that have ever come out. Brian Murray, CEO of HarperCollins, points out that their backlist includes bibles (an $80 million business), coloring books, dictionaries, encyclopedias, magic trick books, calendars, puzzles, and SAT study guides. It also includes perennial bestsellers like </span><em>Don Quijote</em><span>, Steven King’s </span><em>Carrie, </em><span>and Tolkien’s </span><em>Lord of the Rings</em><span>—these books continue to sell year after year. </span></p><p>Popular children’s books are cash cows selling huge amounts of copies year after year and generation after generation.</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes children’s books will be three generations, people have been buying them over and over again, and so that backlist catalog is really, really important to pay for the overhead of your publishing teams and then also to take the risks on the new books. So without a backlist I think it’s very hard to compete with these big books.</p><p>— Brian Murray, CEO, HarperCollins</p></blockquote><p><span>For instance, Penguin Random House owns Eric Carle’s </span><em>Very Hungry Caterpillar</em><span> intellectual property. The book has been on Publisher Weekly’s bestseller list </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/05/27/the-very-hungry-caterpillar-tops-amazon-bestseller-list-after-eric-carles-death---but-its-been-a-consistent-hit-for-decades/?sh=22dc74312260" rel="">every week for 19 years</a><span>. </span></p><blockquote><p>Children’s books comprised 27 percent of PRH’s sales in 2021. That’s about $725 million—so roughly double the size of Scholastic’s trade division, and more or less equal on its own to all of Macmillan or HBG. Christian books accounted for 2 percent.</p><p><span>—</span><em>The Trial</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Backlist titles like The Bible and </span><em>Very Hungry Caterpillar</em><span> and </span><em>Lord of the Rings</em><span> make up a disproportionately large percentage of the publishing industry. </span></p><blockquote><p>Q. Are you concerned that Amazon will favor Penguin Random House Simon &amp; Schuster in terms of promotion and distribution and discoverability?&nbsp;</p><p>A. Yes.</p><p>— Donald Weisberg, CEO, Macmillan Publishers</p></blockquote><p>With Amazon’s data, they could immediately beat out all the publishing houses if they wanted to. </p><blockquote><p><span>I think Amazon as a publisher of books is underestimated. They have about 50 editors… Obviously, given the number of people searching on Amazon for products, that gives them a huge advantage because when people go onto Amazon, they—if the book isn’t there for what they are searching for, they could create that book. That’s one theory I have. But even if that doesn’t happen, they know what people are buying and they have access to that data. Their bestseller list, in my view, is more important than </span><em>The New York Times</em><span> best seller list because it’s in realtime. It’s hourly. And I look at that Amazon best seller list regularly, every day.</span></p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>Wouldn’t it be great if you could pay $9.99 a month and read all of the books you want? Just like you get all the movies you want from Netflix? Or all the music you want from Spotify?</p><p>Technically, it does exist. Kindle Unlimited is the largest, followed by Scribd. Audible isn’t quite all-access, but then Spotify got into audiobooks and made them so. But none of these players have quite taken off the way Netflix or Spotify has.&nbsp;That’s for one reason: The Big Five publishing houses refuse to let their authors participate.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Q. No books are found on Kindle Unlimited? Because you think that’ll be had for the industry?”</p><p>A. We think it’s going to destroy the publishing industry.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House</p></blockquote><p>He’s right. No one would purchase a book again. </p><blockquote><p>We all know about Netflix, we all know about Spotify and other media categories, and we also know what it has done to some industries… The music industry has lost, in the digital transformation, approximately 50 percent of its overall revenue pool.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House</p></blockquote><p>There’s one reason. </p><blockquote><p>Around 20 to 25 percent of the readers, the heavy readers, account for 80 percent of the revenue pool of the industry of what consumers spend on books. It’s the really dedicated readers. If they got all-access, the revenue pool of the industry is going to be very small. Physical retail will be gone—see music—within two to three years. And we will be dependent on a few Silicon Valley or Swedish internet companies that will actually provide all-access.</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Publishing House</p></blockquote><p>The publishing industry would die, that’s for sure. But I’d be willing to bet writers would get their books read way more. </p><p>And I think it’s on its way. Spotify has already started publishing audiobooks, and my money is on Substack for eventually publishing written books!</p><p>If publishing houses make minimal investment in marketing their authors and focus largely on celebrity books and their backlist, authors who can’t snag a large advance might have better luck building their own audience and publishing elsewhere. </p><blockquote><p>I think really from the advent of online—really, once the internet became popular, you know, we heard the phrase disintermediation. And I don’t understand why that wouldn’t be a possible prospect for any best selling author, to just disintermediate, to go straight to the internet and sell directly if you have a following… Colleen Hoover has published with both Amazon and Simon &amp; Schuster. And her Amazon book was on the independent book sellers’ best seller list. So what that says to me is that a Rubicon has been crossed.</p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>The romance category has already gone independent. </p><blockquote><p>Many of those heavy readers of romance novels at that time switched to self-published stories. A very different price point. 99 cents, $1.99, away from what we call mass-market trade paperbacks… The mass-market trade paperback is the sort of small-format mass-market book, like it is a trade paperback, but a smaller format. It has been declining for the last 25 years. But we had a step change around ’14, ‘15, with this trend that so many consumers went away from mass-market books into electronic ebooks in particular and self-published books.”</p><p>— Markus Dohle, CEO, Penguin Random House</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>Gallery author </span></p><span> moved to self-publishing (though Todd began her career writing on Wattpad, and recently returned to set up an imprint at Wattpad Books).</span><p>— Jennifer Bergstrom, SVP, Gallery Books Group</p></blockquote><p>And of course, we have to talk about Kickstarter MVP Brandon Sanderson.</p><blockquote><p><span>There is a </span><em>New York Times</em><span> best selling author in the science fiction and fantasy category. His name is Brandon Sanderson. I believe he’s published by both Macmillan and Penguin Random House. He went onto Kickstarter and announced that he would be offering four of his novels to anybody who wanted them if they wanted to donate to Kickstarter. And he raised over $42 million…</span></p><p><span>I have subsequently become aware of </span><em>Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls</em><span>, which is a series of books. It’s now actually become a whole company. And these are stories to give young girls confidence. And it’s been very successful, and it’s actually resulted in an entire company.</span></p><p>— Jonathan Karp, CEO, Simon &amp; Schuster</p></blockquote><p>After the Judge denied the merger, Penguin went through a massive round of layoffs and Simon &amp; Schuster was sold to a private equity company instead.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Private equity tends to have one game plan: buy a company, load it with debt, wring out costs to improve its financials, sell at a profit. Dealing Simon &amp; Schuster to private equity, The New Republic warned at the time with some slight hyperbole of its own, would mean “absolute devastation and wholesale job loss.”</p><p><span>— </span></p></blockquote><p><span>The publishing houses may live to see another day, but I don’t think their model is long for this world. Unless you are a celebrity or franchise author, the publishing model won’t provide a whole lot more than a tiny advance and a dozen readers. If you </span><em>are</em><span> a celebrity, you’ll still have a much bigger reach on Instagram than you will with your book!</span></p><p>Personally, I could not be more grateful to skip the publishing houses altogether and write directly for my readers here, being supported by those who read this newsletter rather than by a publishing advance that won’t ultimately translate to people reading my work.</p><p>But I’d love to know your thoughts 👇🏻</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.elysian.press/p/no-one-buys-books/comments&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Leave a comment&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.elysian.press/p/no-one-buys-books/comments" rel=""><span>Leave a comment</span></a></p><p>Thank you for reading and being here,</p><p><em>P.S.
