<p>One of the treasures recovered from the first-century BC Antikythera ship­wreck, this statue is composed of bronze with inlaid stone eyes. It has been variously interpreted as representing Paris, Perseus, or a youthful Heracles. What­ever interpretation is correct, it is a stunning work of art.</p>



<p>Here is a detail from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_of_Livia">a wall painting</a> in Rome. This has undergone two thousand years of wear and tear, but it is still beautiful to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a general pattern to these observations. Ancient Greek and Roman art tends to look really good today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not a universal rule. The Greeks weren’t always the masters of naturalism that we know: early Archaic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouros">kouroi</a> now seem rather stilted and uneasy. As in all societies, cruder work was produced at the lower end of the market. Art in the peripheral provinces&nbsp;of the Roman Empire was often clearly a clumsy imitation of work at the center. Even so, modern viewers tend to be struck by the excellence of Greek and Roman art. The examples I have given here are far from exceptions. Explore the Naples Archa­eological Museum, the British Museum, the Louvre, or the Metropolitan Museum and you will see that they had tons of this stuff. Still more remarkable, in a way, is the <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/met-publications/pompeian-frescoes-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-bulletin-v-45-no-3-winter-1987-88">abundance of good work</a> discovered in Pompeii, a provincial town of perhaps 15,000 people.</p>



<p>Here is another Roman statue, this time depicting the Emperor Augustus. It is called the Augustus of the Prima Porta after the site where it was discovered. Something interesting about this statue is that traces of paint survive on its surface. This is because, like most though not all ancient statues, it was originally painted.</p>

<p>You were probably already aware of this. The coloring of ancient sculpture has become widely known in recent years as a result of several high profile projects purporting to reconstruct the original appearance of these works – most famously, Vinzenz Brinkmann’s travelling Gods in Color exhibition. This was not news to historians, who have been aware that ancient sculpture was colored (polychromatic) since the 1800s. But it took these striking reconstructions to gal­vanize public interest.</p>



<p>Here is Brinkmann’s well-known reconstruction of the Augustus of the Prima Porta.</p>

<p>What do you notice about this reconstruction? That’s right, it looks awful. In the eyes of modern viewers, at least, the addition of this matte, heavily saturated color has turned a really good work of art into a really bad one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look at this archer, from the pediment of the late archaic temple of Aphaia on Aegina.</p>

<p>I have not said anything novel here. Everybody knows these reconstructions look awful. The difficult and interesting question is why this is so.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The changing taste theory</strong></h3>



<p>The explanation usually given is that modern taste differs from that of the ancient Greeks and Romans. It follows that, if the reconstructions are accurate, their taste must be very alien to ours. The apparent hideousness of ancient colored sculpture strikes us partly because of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/the-myth-of-whiteness-in-classical-sculpture">what it seems to show about the profoundly changeable character of human taste</a>.</p>



<p>It is usually added that we are the victims, here, of a historical accident. Paints deteriorate much more easily than marble. So, when we rediscovered classical sculpture in the Renai­s­sance, we took the monochrome aesthetic to be intentional. As a result, we internalized a deep-seated attachment to an unblemished white image of Greek and Roman art. We became, to use<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Chromophobia-Focus-Contemporary-Issues-Batchelor/dp/1861890745"> David Bachelor’s</a> term, chromo­phobes. It is this accidental association between Greek and Roman art and pristine white marble, we are told, that accounts for the displeasure we feel when we see the statues restored to color.</p>



<p>At least two things about this expla­nation should strike us as odd. First, there actually exist some contemporary images of statues, showing how they appeared in the ancient world. The resemblance between the statues in these pictures and the modern reconstructions is slight. The statues depicted in the ancient artworks appear to be very delicately painted, often with large portions of the surface left white. A well-known example is the depiction of a statue of Mars at the House of Venus in Pompeii.</p>

<p>In other cases the colors are richer. Here too, however, the effect is far from ugly. I have given an example of this below a famous mosaic depicting a statue of a boxer, from the Villa San Marco in Stabiae. Note the subtlety of color recorded by the mosaic, in which the boxer is reddened and sunburned on his shoulders and upper chest, but not his pale upper thighs. There is nothing here to suggest that the statues de­picted would have struck a modern viewer as garish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there any sculpture depicted in ancient Greek and Roman visual art that resembles the modern reconstructions? To the best of my knowledge, the closest example is the red, blue and yellow visage from the Villa Poppaea at Oplontis.</p>

<p>In that case, the treatment really does resemble the approach favored in modern reconstructions. However, the face belongs not to a classical statue but to a theatrical mask, and is grotesque in form as well as in color. It is not strong evidence that a similar approach was taken with normal classical statuary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Depictions of people in paintings and mosaics also use color very differently to the modern reconstructions of polychrome ancient sculpture. Here are three examples, each of which show a sensitive naturalism that is, if anything, surprisingly close to modern taste. Again, these are not one-offs: countless further examples could be given.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Classical art evolved over the centuries, and some of it looks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Diver#/media/File:Tomb_of_the_Diver_-_unfolded_view.png">quite</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basilica_of_Sant%27Ambrogio#/media/File:Il_redentore_tra_i_ss._gervasio_e_protasio,_IV-VIII_secolo,_con_restauri_del_XVIII_secolo,_01.jpg">different</a> from these examples. But it is difficult or impossible to find an ancient picture from any period whose coloring resembles the Brinkmann reconstructions. Of course, we cannot be sure that the&nbsp;Romans colored their statues in the same way they colored their pictures. But it is surely suspicious that their use of color in pictures tends to be beautiful and intuitive to us.</p>



<p>Some indirect evidence is also provided by the uses of color in ancient interior design, as seen below. The intensity of red on the Farnesia walls is striking, but these cases rarely seem grotesque in the way that the sculptural reconstructions do, nor do they seem to manifest a radically foreign taste in color. In all these cases, ancient art is enjoyable despite having retained its original color.</p>

<p>Neither, it might be added, do we find it impossible to appreciate the painted statues of cultures beyond ancient Greece and Rome.<sup id="ref-2"></sup> It is true that polychrome sculpture often verges on an uncanny valley effect, but it seldom looks as bad to us as the classical re­con­structions. This is true not only of the polychrome sculpture from post-classic Europe, like that of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Spanish and German Baroque, but of polychrome sculpture from pre-classical and non-Western cultures, like dynastic Egypt or medieval Nepal. Many of these sculptures have an eerie quality. It is perhaps no accident that they were often used in reli­gious rituals, as were the sculptures of antiquity. But they seldom seem distractingly ugly.</p>

<p>We are thus asked to believe not only that the colored sculpture of Greek and Roman antiquity was distinctive among its art forms in seeming consistently ugly to us, but also that it is distinctive among the colored sculptural tradi­tions of the world in doing so. This seems&nbsp;unlikely to be true.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>The bad painting theory</strong></h3>



<p>We should be doubtful, then, of the idea that modern reconstructions of colored ancient statues seem ugly to us because we do not share Graeco-­Roman taste in color. Ancient de­pict­ions of statues, other ancient depict­ions of people, and other ancient uses of color, all suggest that their feeling for color was not so different to ours. It is also suspicious that other cultures have produced colored sculpture that we readily appreciate. Is there a better explanation of what is going on here?&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a single explanation for the fact that the reconstructions do not resemble the statues depicted in ancient artworks, the fact that their use of color is un­like that in ancient mosaics and frescoes, and the fact that modern viewers find them ugly. It is that the reconstructions are painted very badly. There is no reason to posit that ancient Europeans had tastes radically unlike ours to explain our dislike of the reconstructions. The Greeks and Romans would have disliked them too, because the reconstructed polychromy is no good.</p>



<p>Two objections might be raised to my proposal. They are, however, easily answered.</p>



<p>First, it might be thought that my explanation cannot be right because the experts who produce the reconstructions know that this is what the statues originally looked like. After all, it might be reasoned that their work is based on a scientific analysis of the paint residues left over from the original finish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This objection should not worry us. Nobody, to my knowledge, seriously claims that the methods used to produce the reconstructions guarantee a high degree of accuracy. And this should come as no surprise. The paints used in the reconstructions are chemically similar to the trace pigments found on parts of the surface of the originals. However, those pigments formed the underlayer of a finished work to which they bear a very conjectural relationship. Imagine a modern historian trying to reconstruct the Mona Lisa on the basis of a few residual pigments here and there on a largely featureless canvas.</p>



<p>How confident could we be that the result accurately reproduces the original?&nbsp;</p>



<p>This point is not actually disputed by supporters of the reconstructions. For example, Cecilie Brøns, who leads a project on ancient polychromy at the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen, praises the reconstructions <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/the-myth-of-whiteness-in-classical-sculpture">but notes that</a> ‘reconstructions can be difficult to explain to the public – that these are not exact copies, that we can never know exactly how they looked’.</p>



<p>Second, it might be urged that it makes no difference whether the reconstructions are accurate because there is simply no way to paint the statues, consistent with the pigments that have been left behind, that modern viewers will find beautiful.</p>



<p>But this just isn’t true. It is manifestly possible to paint a classical statue in a manner consistent with the evidence that will look incomparably more beautiful to the modern viewer than the typical reconstructions do. The triumphant examples above from Egypt and Nepal above prove this incontrovertibly.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Why make a bad reconstruction?</strong></h3>



<p>Why, then, are the reconstructions so ugly? One factor may be that the specialists who execute them lack the skill of classical artists, who had many years of training in a great tradition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another may be that they are hampered by conservation doctrines that forbid including any feature in a reconstruction for which there is no direct archaeological evidence. Since underlayers are generally the only element of which traces survive, such doctrines lead to all-underlayer reconstructions, with the overlayers that were obviously originally present excluded for lack of evidence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If that is the explanation, though, reconstruction specialists have been notably unsuccessful in alerting the public to the fact that colored classical sculpture bore no more resemblance to these reconstructions than the Mona Lisa would to a reconstruction that included only its underlayers. Much of the educated public believes that ancient sculpture looked something like these reconstructions, not that these reconstructions are a highly artificial exercise in reconstructing elements of ancient polychromy for which we have direct archaeological evidence.</p>

<p>One wonders if something else is going on here. The enormous public interest generated by garish reconstructions is surely because of and not in spite of their ugliness. It is hard to believe that this is entirely accidental. One possibility is that the reconstructors are engaged in a kind of trolling. In this interpretation, they know perfectly well that ancient sculptures did not look like the reconstructions, and probably included the subtle variation of color tones that ancient paintings did. But they fail to correct the belief that people naturally form given what is placed before them: that the proffered reconstruction of ancient sculpture is roughly what ancient sculpture actually looked like.</p>

<p>It is a further question whether such trolling would be deeply objectionable. Brinkmann has produced a massively successful exhibition, which has more than accomplished its aim of making the fact that ancient statues were painted more widely known. The reconstructions&nbsp;are often very funny and are not all as bad as the best-known examples.<sup id="ref-3"></sup> There is genuine intellectual value in the project and what could be seen as mean-spirited iconoclasm could equally be embraced as harmless fun.</p>

Encrypted apps are increasingly in the crosshairs of UK lawmakers, with several pieces of legislation targeting the technology.</p><p>Most notably, Apple was served with a technical capability notice under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) demanding it weaken the encryption protecting iCloud data. That legal standoff led the tech giant to disable its Advanced Data Protection <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/we-will-never-build-a-backdoor-apple-kills-its-iclouds-end-to-end-encryption-feature-in-the-uk" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/we-will-never-build-a-backdoor-apple-kills-its-iclouds-end-to-end-encryption-feature-in-the-uk">instead of creating a backdoor</a>.</p><p>The Online Safety Act is already well known for its controversial age verification requirements. However, its most contentious provisions have yet to be fully implemented, and experts fear these could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/the-online-safety-act-isnt-just-about-age-verification-end-to-end-encryption-is-also-at-risk" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/the-online-safety-act-isnt-just-about-age-verification-end-to-end-encryption-is-also-at-risk">undermine encryption</a> even further.</p><p>On Monday, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/to-repeal-or-not-repeal-uk-parliament-discusses-the-online-safety-act" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/to-repeal-or-not-repeal-uk-parliament-discusses-the-online-safety-act">Parliament debated the Act</a> following a petition calling for its repeal. Instead of rolling back the law, however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/uk-mps-target-vpns-in-latest-online-safety-act-debate" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/uk-mps-target-vpns-in-latest-online-safety-act-debate">MPs pushed for stricter enforcement</a>. During the discussion, lawmakers specifically called for a review of other encrypted tools, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn">best VPNs</a>.</p><p id="a39c9f70-9c09-4a78-84bb-a0f3644c03a8">The potential risks of the Act's tougher stance on encryption were only briefly mentioned during the discussion, suggesting a stark disconnect between MPs and security experts.</p><p>Olivier Crépin-Leblond, of the Internet Society, told TechRadar he was disappointed by the outcome of the debate. "When it came to Client Side Scanning (CSS), most felt this could be one of the 'easy technological fixes' that could help law enforcement greatly, especially when they showed their frustration at Facebook rolling end-to-end encryption," he said.</p><p>"It's clearly not understood that any such software could fall prey to hackers."</p><p>It is clear that for many lawmakers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/what-is-encryption" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/what-is-encryption">encryption</a> is viewed primarily as an obstacle to law enforcement. This stands in sharp contrast to the view of digital rights experts, who stress that the technology is vital for protecting privacy and security in an online landscape where cyberattacks are rising.</p><p>"The government signposts end-to-end encryption as a threat, but what they fail to consider is that breaking it would be a threat to our national security too," Jemimah Steinfeld, CEO of Index on Censorship, told TechRadar.</p><p>She also added that this ignores encryption's vital role for dissidents, journalists, and domestic abuse victims, "not to mention the general population who should be afforded basic privacy."</p><p>With the battle lines drawn, we can expect a challenging year ahead for services like Signal and WhatsApp. Both companies have previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/we-will-not-walk-back-signal-would-rather-leave-the-uk-and-sweden-than-remove-encryption-protections" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/we-will-not-walk-back-signal-would-rather-leave-the-uk-and-sweden-than-remove-encryption-protections">pledged to leave the UK market</a> rather than compromise their users' privacy and security.</p><hr id="8a971148-d155-4c6b-8674-991e17b84f0b"><p id="e3ea0db0-4dda-45c6-bde9-c0378b0a11b0"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJsWTJoeVlXUmhjaTVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-GB&amp;gl=GB&amp;ceid=GB%3Aen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><em><strong>Follow TechRadar on Google News</strong></em></a> and<em> </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=techradar.com" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><em><strong>add us as a preferred source</strong></em></a><em> to get our expert news, reviews, and opinion in your feeds.

The finding has been cited ever since. But here’s what actually happened: she never used a real IQ test. She made up her own test from SAT questions, had no comparison group, and when the Nobel laureates took it, they scored... average. Not genius-level. Just fine.

        <h3>WATER</h3>    
    
        <p>Iran is looking to relocate the nation’s capital because of severe water shortages that make Tehran unsustainable. Experts say the crisis was caused by years of ill-conceived dam projects and overpumping that destroyed a centuries-old system for tapping underground reserves.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>More than international sanctions, more than its stifling theocracy, more than recent bombardment by Israel and the U.S. — Iran’s greatest current existential crisis is what hydrologists are calling its rapidly approaching “water bankruptcy.”&nbsp;</p><p>It is a crisis that has a sad origin, they say: the destruction and abandonment of tens of thousands of ancient tunnels for sustainably tapping underground water, known as <i>qanats</i>, that were once the envy of the arid world. But calls for the Iranian government to restore <i>qanats</i> and recharge the underground water reserves that once sustained them are falling on deaf ears.</p><p>After a fifth year of extreme drought, Iran’s long-running water crisis reached unprecedented levels in November. The country’s president,&nbsp;Masoud Pezeshkian,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.algemeiner.com/2025/11/20/iran-no-choice-but-move-capital-water-crisis-deepens-says-president/">warned</a> that Iran had “no choice” but to move its capital away from arid Tehran, which now has a population of about 10 million, to wetter coastal regions — a project that would take decades and has a price estimated by analysts at potentially $100 billion.</p><p>While failed rains may be the immediate cause of the crisis, they say, the root cause is more than half a century of often foolhardy modern water engineering — extending back to before the country’s Islamic revolution of 1979, but accelerated by the Ayatollahs’ policies since. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“The government blames the current crisis on changing climate [but] the dramatic water security issues of Iran are rooted in decades of disintegrated planning and managerial myopia,” says Keveh Madani, a former deputy head of the country’s environment department and now director of the United Nations University’s Institute of Water, Environment and Health.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>To meet growing water shortages in the country’s burgeoning cities, “Iran was one of the top three dam-builders in the world” in the late 20th century, says Penelope Mitchell, a geographer at the University of Arizona’s Global Water Security Center. Dozens were built on rivers too small to sustain them. Rather than fixing shortages, the reservoirs have increased the loss of water due to evaporation from their large surface areas, she says, while lowering river flows downstream and drying up wetlands and underground water reserves.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, many of the reservoirs behind those dams are all but empty. Iran’s president made his call to relocate the capital after water levels in Tehran’s five reservoirs plunged to 12 percent of capacity last month.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Iran’s neighbors are exacerbating the crisis. In Afghanistan, the source of two rivers important to Iran’s water supplies (the Helmand and Harirud), the Taliban are on their own dam-building spree that is reducing cross-border flows. The Pashdan Dam, which went into operation in August, “means Afghanistan can control up to 80 percent of the average stream flow of the Harirud,” says Mitchell, threatening water supplies to much of eastern Iran, including Iran’s second largest city, Mashhad.</p><p>While surface waters suffer, the situation underground is even worse. In the past 40 years, Iranians have sunk more than a million wells fitted with powerful pumps. The aim has been to irrigate arid farmland to meet the country’s goal of food self-sufficiency in a hostile world of trade sanctions. But the result has been rampant overpumping of aquifers that once held copious amounts of water. &nbsp;</p><p>The majority of Iran’s precious underground water reserves have been pumped dry, says Madani. He <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214581822001082">estimates</a> a loss of more than 210 cubic kilometers [50 cubic miles] of stored water in the first two decades of this century.&nbsp;</p><p>Iran is far from alone in overpumping its precious national water stores. But a recent international <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06879-8">study</a> of 1,700 underground water reserves in 40 countries found that a staggering 32 of the world’s 50 most overpumped aquifers are in Iran. “The biggest alarm bells are in Iran’s West Qazvin Plain, Arsanjan Basin, Baladeh Basin, and Rashtkhar aquifers,” says coauthor Richard Taylor, geographer at University College London. In each, water tables are falling by up to 10 feet a year.</p>

  <p>Agriculture is the prime culprit, says Mitchell. In Iran, some 90 percent of the water abstracted from rivers and underground aquifers is taken for agriculture. But as ever more pumped wells are sunk, their returns are diminishing.</p><p>Analyzing the most recently publicly available figures, Roohollah Noori, a freshwater ecologist until recently at the University of Tehran, <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EF001547">found</a> that the number of wells and other abstraction points had almost doubled since 2000. But the amount of water successfully brought to the surface fell by 18 percent. In many places, formerly irrigated fields lie barren and abandoned.</p><p>As reservoirs empty and wells fail, the country’s hydrologists say Iran is on the verge of “water bankruptcy.” They forecast food shortages, a repetition of water protests that spread across the country in the summer of 2021, and even a water war with Afghanistan over its dam-building. And a long-discussed plan to move the capital from Tehran to the wetter south of the country is now “no longer optional” but a necessity, because of water shortages, says Iran’s president. No detailed plans have yet been drawn up, but the Makran region on the shores of the Gulf of Oman is seen as the most likely location for the project.&nbsp;</p>

  <blockquote>Hydrologists say about half of Iran’s qanat systems have been rendered waterless by poor maintenance or overpumping.</blockquote>

<div>
  <p>This is a tragic turnaround for an arid country with a proud tradition of sophisticated management of its meager water resources. Iran is the origin and cultural and engineering heartland of ancient water-collecting systems known as <i>qanats</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Qanats</i> are gently sloping tunnels dug into hillsides in riverless regions to tap underground water, allowing it to flow out into valleys using gravity alone. They have long sustained the country’s farmers, as well as being until recently the main source of water for cities such as Tehran, Yazd, and Isfahan. But today only one in seven fields are irrigated by the tunnels.</p><p>Iran has an estimated 70,000 of these structures, most of which are more than 2,500 years old. Their aggregate length has been put at more than 250,000 miles. The Gonabad <i>qanat</i> network, reputedly the world’s largest, extends for more than 20 miles beneath the Barakuh Mountains of northeast Iran. The tunnels are more than 3 feet high, reach a depth of a thousand feet, and are supplied by more than 400 vertical wells for maintenance.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike pumped wells, <i>qanats</i> are an inherently sustainable source of water.&nbsp;They can only take as much water as is replenished by the rain.&nbsp;Yet such has been their durability that they were often called “everlasting springs.”</p>

<p>This Persian technology spread far and wide from China to North Africa and Spain, which exported the idea to the Americas. Many <i>qanats</i> have fallen out of use, deprived of water by pumped wells. Some countries, such as Oman, are <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/oasis_at_risk_omans_ancient_water_channels_are_drying_up">reviving</a> them as the most viable water resources in many arid regions.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>But in their homeland, there is no such action. Iranian hydrologists estimate that in the past half century, around half of Iran’s <i>qanats</i> have been rendered waterless through poor maintenance or as pumped wells have lowered water tables within hillsides.&nbsp;Noori <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42411-2">found</a> that groundwater depletion began in the early 1950s and “coincided with the gradual replacement of Persian <i>qanats</i>… with deep wells”.</p><p>“History will never forgive us for what [deep wells] have done to our <i>qanats</i>,” <a href="https://irannewsupdate.com/news/general/irans-vanishing-qanats-a-crisis-of-water-heritage-and-policy/">says</a> Mohammad Barshan, director of the Qanats Center in Kerman.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Besides overpumping, a second reason why Iran’s underground water reserves are slipping away is that less water is seeping down from surface water bodies and soils to replenish them. Noori found a 35 percent decline in aquifer recharge since 2002.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
  <p>One reason is climate change. Droughts have combined with warmer temperatures that reduce winter snow cover, which is a major means of groundwater replenishment in the mountains. But Noori identifies “human intervention” as the main cause — especially dams and abstractions for irrigation that dry up rivers, natural lakes, and wetlands, whose seepage is another major source of recharge. &nbsp;</p><p>Lake Urmia in northwest Iran was once the Middle East’s largest lake, covering more than 2,300 square miles. But NASA satellite images taken in 2023 showed it had almost completely dried up. Similarly, the Hamoun wetland, straddling the Iran-Afghan border on the Helmand River, once covered some 1,500 square miles and was home to abundant wildlife, including a population of leopards. Now it is mostly lifeless salt flats. &nbsp;</p><p>The loss of such ecological jewels makes a mockery of Iran’s status as the host of the 1971 treaty to protect internationally important wetlands, named after Ramsar, the Iranian city where it was signed.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Another factor in the reduced recharge, says Noori, is the introduction of more modern irrigation methods aimed at getting more crops from less water. Farmers are being encouraged to line canals and irrigate crops more efficiently. But this greater “efficiency” has a perverse consequence: It results in less water seeping below ground to top up aquifers.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Hydrologists warn that much of the damage to aquifers is permanent. As they dry out, their water-holding pores collapse. As <i>qanats</i> dry up, they too cave in.&nbsp;</p><p>At the surface, this is causing an epidemic of subsidence.&nbsp;According to Iranian remote sensing expert Mahmud Haghshenas Haghighi, now at Leibniz University in Germany, subsidence <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk3039">affects</a> more than 3.5 percent of the country. Ancient cities once reliant on <i>qanats</i>, such as Isfahan and Yazd, are seeing buildings and infrastructure <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sanammahoozi/2025/04/19/iran-faces-widespread-land-subsidence-amid-escalating-water-emergency/">damaged</a> on a huge scale. Geologists call it a “silent earthquake.”&nbsp;</p><p>But, while surface structures can be repaired, the geological wreckage underground cannot. “Once significant subsidence and compression occurs, much of the… water storage capacity is permanently lost and cannot be restored, even if water levels later rise,” says Mitchell.</p>

  <p>What can be done to ward off Iran’s water bankruptcy? Many Iranian hydrologists believe there needs to be a massive switch of funding from dams and wells to repairing <i>qanats</i>, which Barshan says “remain the best solution for Iran’s ongoing water crisis,” and recharging the aquifers.&nbsp;</p><p>Aquifer recharge was long&nbsp;advocated&nbsp;by Iranian hydrologist Sayyed Ahang Kowsar, who died last year. Forty years ago, when a professor of natural resources at Shiraz University in southern Iran, he developed a successful pilot project that channeled occasional extreme mountain floods to recharge underground water beneath the Gareh-Bygone Plain.&nbsp;</p><p>Iran is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195925508001157">estimated</a> to lose at least a fifth of its rainfall to flash floods that flow uncollected into the ocean. Kowsar <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02973197">found</a> that as much as 80 percent of those floodwaters could be redirected into aquifers. Yet hydrologists say&nbsp;the idea of tapping this water has been almost entirely rebuffed by the government. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>Critics such as Kowsar’s son Nik, a water analyst now working in the U.S., <a href="https://nkowsar.substack.com/p/roots-in-the-soil-eyes-on-the-horizon?utm_medium=web">say</a> officials are closely aligned with politically well-connected engineers bent on constructing ever more big projects such as dams. Their latest is a complex and expensive scheme to desalinate seawater from the Persian Gulf and pump it through some 2,300 miles of pipelines to parched provinces. A <a href="https://english.almayadeen.net/news/politics/iran-launches-key-water-transfer-project-from-gulf-of-oman-t">link</a> to Isfahan opened this month. But, while the water is valuable for heavy industries such as steel, the high cost of desalination, pipes, and pumping makes it far too expensive for agriculture.</p><p>Something has to give. More dams make no sense when the rivers are already running dry. More pumped wells make no sense when there is no water left to tap. They just hasten water bankruptcy.</p>

<p>Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community.</p>

In the last century, economic growth has transformed our society from every conceivable angle. But one we don’t dwell on much is how it has transformed childhood.</p><p><span>In 1910, shortly before these children were interviewed, </span><a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_6_1910.html" rel="">16% of American children died before age 5 and 19% before age 18</a><span>. Just </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d21/tables/dt21_104.10.asp" rel="">13.5% of adults </a><span>had a high school diploma, and the median adult had about an </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp" rel="">eighth-grade education</a><span>. The </span><a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1910/volume-4/volume-4-p2.pdf" rel="">1910 Census found</a><span> 41% of 14- to 15-year-old boys gainfully occupied (that is, in the workforce), and 79% of boys and young men aged 16 to 20.</span></p><p>Naturally, these changes — in the odds that children survive to adulthood, in the age at which they first work, in how many of them complete high school — have profoundly shaped our conception of childhood.</p><p>As the nation grew wealthier and more children began to survive to adulthood, we became vastly more protective of them — and permitted them far fewer risks. It’s hard to invest (either emotionally or literally) in children when poverty, disease, and starvation haunt your days. And now that we are less desperately poor, we can afford to ask less of our children — no family need choose between sending their 14-year-old to the factories or surrendering their baby to an orphanage.</p><p><span>Today, legal protections for minors are more expansive than they ever have been. Cultural expectations have </span><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/youre-not-the-captain-of-the-parenting" rel="">shifted enormously</a><span>. Americans hit their children less than we used to. We spend more time playing with them. We spend, of course, far more money on them. We supervise them more.</span></p><p><span>“The very successes achieved in improving children’s lives led to an escalation in what came to be seen as the minimal standard for children’s well-being,” wrote Peter Stearns in his </span><a href="https://dokumen.pub/anxious-parents-a-history-of-modern-childrearing-in-america-9780814786987.html" rel="">history of American child-rearing</a><span>. “Levels of anxiety experienced by parents did not correlate with what might have been registered as historic progress in children’s quality of life.”</span></p><p>Obviously, “kids rarely die these days” is a massive change for the good, and I’m also not exactly here to defend children dropping out of middle school to tape labels on cigarettes for six cents per thousand (as one child featured in Todd’s article does).</p><p>But the same forces that worked to eliminate child labor and exploitation and gave parents more room and incentive to invest in their progeny have also worked to strip children of independence.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/how-getting-richer-made-teenagers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/how-getting-richer-made-teenagers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>This month, </span><em>The Argument</em><span> </span><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/have-democrats-lost-their-education" rel="">polled voters</a><span> about modern parenting. I found it striking how far our society has pushed back the age at which children are trusted with even the barest autonomy — or, from another angle, how many years we expect parents to dedicate all their time to closely supervising them. (The full crosstabs are available to paying subscribers at the bottom of </span><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/have-democrats-lost-their-education" rel="">this post</a><span>.)</span></p><p>We asked “At what age do you think it is appropriate for a child to stay home alone for an hour or two?” To my astonishment, 36% of respondents said that it was not appropriate until “between the  ages of 14 and 17.”</p><p>Are a third of you really refusing to leave your 13-year-olds home alone for a couple hours while you go to the grocery store? Or are those respondents the ones who don’t have children?</p><p>I asked my colleague Lakshya Jain to break the data down for me, and parents aren’t much different than nonparents here — 37% of parents and 35% of nonparents said it wasn’t appropriate until the child was aged 14 to 17.</p><p>Or take the responses to another question we asked: “When parents allow a 10-year-old child to play alone in a nearby park for three hours, should they be investigated by Child Protective Services for potential neglect?” Again, 36% of respondents said that they should — and since it only takes one person to make a CPS call, many of your neighbors thinking it’s wildly inappropriate for a child to play alone at the park could amount to an effective ban on doing so.</p><p>If you don’t have kids, it can be pretty hard to have a good mental picture of what capabilities a 10-year-old has and doesn’t have, so I expect some readers may be adrift in trying to estimate whether this survey result is reasonable or nuts. And 10-year-olds also vary enormously in their maturity and common sense. But I interact with lots of kids, so let me tell you: This is absolutely nuts.</p><p><span>Ten-year-olds are way past the age where you have to worry about them running into the road; I would trust the majority of 10-year-olds to play unsupervised for a few hours, and parents deciding whether to allow this have far more knowledge than anyone else of their specific child. Cellphones mean that it’s easy for a kid to contact their parents immediately if something comes up. When I was 10, I babysat for the neighbors, and I was a perfectly adequate babysitter; I think in most U.S. states today, that might be </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1347841/dl?" rel="">regarded as</a><span> </span><a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/calhoun-couple-arrested-for-child-cruelty-after-leaving-sons-home-alone-for-storage-run-gordon-county" rel="">child</a><span> </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/iowa/supreme-court/2024/22-1581.html" rel="">neglect</a><span>.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/how-getting-richer-made-teenagers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/how-getting-richer-made-teenagers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p><span>The role of CPS in accelerating this transition to a highly supervised, highly limited childhood is probably underrated. </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8325358/#:~:text=Fig.,living%20in%20major%20metropolitan%20areas." rel="">Around 35% of American families</a><span> have been investigated by CPS. In most of these cases, no maltreatment will be found — only about 1 in 8 families will ever have a finding of maltreatment. But obviously it is terrifying, as a parent, to be investigated, even if you are found to be doing fine; it will naturally heighten the anxiety experienced by parents and lead them to further restrict the activities of their children.</span></p><p>If you get CPS called on you for letting your 10-year-old play at the park across the street, you aren’t likely to do it again even if CPS drops the investigation.</p><p>But despite my trepidations, the very population most likely to have CPS called on them are the ones most likely to support state intervention. Fully 50% of Black voters in our poll agreed that allowing a 10-year-old to play unsupervised at a park for a few hours was grounds for a CPS call. Just 33% of white voters and 37% of Hispanic voters said the same.</p><p><span>This might reflect the relatively higher rates of risk faced by Black children who are more likely to be victims of crimes, but the </span><em>absolute </em><span>risk is small enough for all children that playing freely in the park clearly passes the cost-benefit sniff test — especially when you consider the alternative.</span></p><p>In about a century, we’ve gone from a world where many 14-year-olds are the breadwinners for their family — bad! — to a world where many of them aren’t even trusted to be in the house without a babysitter — also bad!</p><p>There has to be a middle ground, where we ensure that 14-year-olds don’t permanently foreclose opportunities for their future selves, ensure they all get a good education, and also don’t make them miserable by extending their adolescence a full decade during which they’re cut off from all the parts of the world that offer autonomy and meaning.</p><p>Many analyses of the consequences of our ethos of extended childhood focus on the indirect effects on the parents. They focus on how the increasing demands of parenthood mean that parents are much less happy, without any corresponding benefit to their children. Or they focus on declining birth rates. These are serious problems, but it’s worth not skipping over the direct impacts on teenagers themselves.</p><p><span>Teenagers are allowed to do less and less in the physical world, even as (thanks to technological advancement) they have more and more access to the digital world. I’m not going to recapitulate Jonathan Haidt here; I actually feel very confused about precisely the role that Instagram and TikTok play in the stress and unhappiness of the modern American adolescent. But I feel on much more solid ground saying that the effects of the digital world on our kids is worse when it is the </span><em>only </em><span>world they have access to.</span></p><p>When teenagers aren’t trusted to walk over to a friend’s house or play in the park, when they almost never have a part-time job where they can earn a paycheck and meet expectations that aren’t purely artificial, then I think it’s much harder for them to have a realistic, non-algorithm-driven worldview and concrete life goals they can work toward.</p><p><span>We don’t have good data on teen suicides in 1910 — and it has historically been common for suicides to be recorded as accidents, making it extremely hard to confidently compare across time periods. All the same, I think teen suicides are up. </span><a href="https://www.infoplease.com/us/health-statistics/death-rates-suicide-1950-2010" rel="">In 1950, there were 2.7 suicides per 100,000 15- to 19-year-olds. Today, there are 7.5 (though that’s down from a 1990s peak of 13.2).</a></p><p>No one could possibly examine what it was like to be a teenager a century ago and soberly call for a return to it. Things are better now.</p><p>Still, it would be a tragedy if the explosion of prosperity that freed our children from labor traps them under increasing supervision and diminished opportunities for meaningful choice and meaningful participation in society. Today’s child endangerment doesn’t come from dangerous machines, high mortality rates, or a lack of K-12 opportunities — it often comes from a lack of agency.</p><p>In the last 100 years, we gave our children better and safer childhoods. Now it’s time to give them the teen years they deserve.</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/youre-not-the-captain-of-the-parenting" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZMSv!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac482933-a4be-4039-9561-a4292b070188_5250x3500.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZMSv!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac482933-a4be-4039-9561-a4292b070188_5250x3500.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="You're not the captain of the parenting police" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/some-kids-are-just-dumb-is-not-good" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5YAp!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03a01c77-86d8-4f4b-989a-30d450582f01_5122x3415.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!5YAp!,w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03a01c77-86d8-4f4b-989a-30d450582f01_5122x3415.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="&quot;Some kids are just dumb&quot; is not good education policy" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div></div></article></div><div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div><div><h3>Ready for more?</h3></div></div></div>]]></description>

</p>

             <!--Detailed Description -->
        <br>
        <div>
            <p>GitHub had earlier announced <a href="https://pricetimeline.com/news/188">in a post we published</a> that it would increase the cost of self-hosted runners from $0.00 (free) to $0.002 per minute, starting March 1, 2026. This increase has been postponed, which means it will not apply until a new decision is made.</p>
<p>GitHub stated that it has canceled the price increase after reviewing developer feedback. It added that it will take time to listen to customers and partners. For now, GitHub Actions for self-hosted runners remain free.</p>
<p>The good news is that the 39% price reduction for hosted runners will continue as previously announced.</p>
<p><em>We will continue to monitor GitHub Actions price changes and update them on <a href="https://pricetimeline.com/data/price/github-actions">GitHub Actions Pricing history page</a>.</em></p>        </div><br>

					<h3>Reading Hieroglyphs</h3>				</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="45849c3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
				<p>The ancient Egyptians created a highly flexible hieroglyphic system of writing. Hieroglyphs could be arranged in both columns and rows and could be read from the left or from the right, depending on how they were written. This allowed the ancient Egyptians to effortlessly integrate their writing with art, blurring the boundary between art and script. In the example below, the god Amun, <em>imn</em>, is written each of the possible combinations.</p>

									<p>Although the task of reading hieroglyphs from the right direction may seem daunting at first, there is a simple trick that will allow you to easily identify the correct direction from which to begin:</p><p><em><strong>Look for a hieroglyph with a face and read toward it. <br></strong></em></p><p>When the figure is facing to the left, begin reading from the left. If they are facing right, begin from the right. When there are hieroglyphs are stacked on top of each other, the top sign should always be read before lower sign.&nbsp; Another feature of the Egyptian writing system that you might have noticed is “group writing.” Rather than placing hieroglyphs side-by-side, they were arranged in a way to reduce empty space: taller signs stand alone, while smaller signs are stacked on top of each other.</p>								</div>

					<h3>Transliteration and the Alphabet</h3>				</p>
				</div>
				<div data-id="bb472e4" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default">
									<p>Transliteration is the method of converting one script into another, also referred to as transcription. The hieroglyphs in the alphabet are called “uniliterals,” because they represent a single consonant. The ancient Egyptian language also contains biliterals and triliterals, which represent two and three consonants, respectively. The alphabet can be found in the chart below.</p><p>It will be helpful to memorize the alphabet not only because they occur often in texts, but also because Egyptologists arrange dictionaries in this order. So if you are unsure of the meaning of a word, but know how to transliterate it, knowing the alphabet will help you find the word faster than flipping frantically between the four different types of “H’s” to find the right one.</p><h4>The Alphabet</h4><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Hieroglyph</strong></td><td><strong>Transliteration</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓄿</h6></td><td><em>3</em></td><td><p>Vulture</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓇋</h6></td><td><p><em>i, j<br></em></p></td><td><p>Reed leaf</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓇋𓇋</h6></td><td><p><em>y</em></p></td><td><p>Double Reed Leaf</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓂝</h6></td><td><p><em>ʿ</em></p></td><td><p>Arm</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓅱 𓏲</h6></td><td><p><em>w</em></p></td><td><p>Quail chick, rope curl</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓃀</h6></td><td><p><em>b</em></p></td><td><p>Foot</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓊪</h6></td><td><p><em>p</em></p></td><td><p>Stool</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓆑</h6></td><td><p><em>f</em></p></td><td><p>Horned viper</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓅓　𓐝</h6></td><td><p><em>m</em></p></td><td><p>Owl</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓈖　𓋔</h6></td><td><p><em>n</em></p></td><td><p>Water, red crown</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓂋</h6></td><td><p><em>r</em></p></td><td><p>Mouth</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓉔</h6></td><td><p><em>h</em></p></td><td><p>House plan</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓎛</h6></td><td><p><em>ḥ</em></p></td><td><p>Rope</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓐍</h6></td><td><p><em>ḫ</em></p></td><td><p>Unknown</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓄡</h6></td><td><p><em>ẖ</em></p></td><td><p>Animal belly and tail</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓊃</h6></td><td><p><em>z</em></p></td><td><p>Door bolt</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓋴</h6></td><td><p><em>s</em></p></td><td><p>Folded cloth</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓈙</h6></td><td><p><em>š</em></p></td><td><p>Pool</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓈎</h6></td><td><p><em>q</em></p></td><td><p>Hill</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓎡</h6></td><td><p><em>k</em></p></td><td><p>Basket with handle</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓎼</h6></td><td><p><em>g</em></p></td><td><p>Stand for vessel</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓏏</h6></td><td><p><em>t</em></p></td><td><p>Bread loaf</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓍿</h6></td><td><p><em>ṯ</em></p></td><td><p>Tethering rope</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓂧</h6></td><td><p><em>d</em></p></td><td><p>Hand</p></td></tr><tr><td><h6>𓆓</h6></td><td><p><em>ḏ</em></p></td><td><p>Cobra</p></td></tr></tbody></table>								</div>

									<p>You might have noticed that there aren’t any vowels in the alphabet. They exist in the language, but the hieroglyphic script omitted them, which makes things difficult when it comes to pronunciation.</p><p>There’s a lot of current research into pronunciation (e.g. Allen’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Egyptian-Phonology-James-Allen-ebook/dp/B07XRZ9R2M/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=james+allen+egyptian&amp;qid=1617056239&amp;s=digital-text&amp;sr=1-1"><em>Ancient Egyptian Phonology</em></a>), but I was never particularly interested in it. If you are, then I suggest grabbing the book I listed, but it’s far beyond the scope of these lessons. For our purposes, I’ll simply describe the general conventions used in an introductory glyphs course.</p><p>Add an “e” in between the consonants.</p><p>Yup. That’s the basic approach when vocalizing transliterations. There’s some leeway when it comes to names and places (e.g. Amon vs Amun vs Amen), but in general, adding “e” in between consonants is just fine.</p>								</div>

									Hieroglyphs are visual representations of objects or ideas that were familiar to ancient Egyptians. The Egyptologist Alan Gardiner arranged all of the hieroglyphs into a <a href="https://newlook.egyptianhieroglyphs.net/gardiners-sign-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign list</a> which included twenty-six categories. There are a few different ways hieroglyphs are used.
</p><p>
When hieroglyphs are used to represent these real world things, they are called <strong>ideograms</strong><em>.</em> For example, the hieroglyph </p><n>𓁷𓏤</n> <p><em>(ḥr)</em> represents a face. When it is used as an <em>ideogram</em>, it carries the meaning of “face.” When it is not used as an <em>ideogram</em>, it is used for it’s phonetic value <em>ḥr.</em></p><p>
You might be wondering how you’d know whether a hieroglyph was being used as a ideogram or not.
</p><p>
<strong>Phonograms</strong> are hieroglyphs that represent a specific sound (phonetic value). Using phonograms, scribes could spell out words. For example, we could combine the hieroglyphs for mouth, </p><n>𓂋𓏤</n> <p><em>(r)</em>, and a water ripple, </p><n>𓈖</n> <p><em>(n)</em>, from the alphabet above, and create the word for name, </p><n>𓂋𓈖</n> <p><em>(rn)</em>. Independently, each hieroglyph represents a different idea, “mouth” and “water.” Together, they form an entirely new concept, “name.”
</p><p>
A <strong>determinative</strong> is a hieroglyph that does not have a phonetic value so it is not transliterated. They are placed at the end of words and provide a general meaning of the word. For example, we may not know what the word </p><n>𓊪𓏏𓊪𓏏𓂻</n> <p><em>(ptpt)</em> might mean, but the leg determinative </p><n>𓂻</n><p> gives us a rough idea: movement. The type of movement could be walking, running, stomping, dancing, or something else. In this case, the the word means “trampling.”								</p></div>

				<div data-id="8ab7fa2" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p>
									Represents an idea or concept. Vertical dash follows the glyph when used as an ideogram.
</p><p>
Example:
</p><n>𓁷𓏤</n> <p><em>(ḥr) </em>– face.
</p><n>𓂋𓏤</n> <p><em>(r) </em>– mouth.								</p></div>
				
				<div data-id="8f286dc" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p>
									Represents a vocal sound (phonetic value).
</p><p>
Example:
</p><n>𓁷</n><p> (<em>ḥr) </em>–  Preposition “on”
</p><n>𓂋</n> <p><em>(r)</em> – Preposition “to”								</p></div>
				
				<div data-id="d1f5ca2" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><p>
									Glyph at the end of some words that gives the general meaning of the word.

<p>
General meaning: movement.

Mr Thompson hopes that some members of Congress will sponsor the legislation.</p><p>He has also started a petition, which has so far generated over 50,000 signatures.

However, they still won't need to contact anyone they didn't chose to interview.</p><p>Deborah Hudson, an employment lawyer based in Toronto, says she's already been approached by companies "trying to get it right".

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Electronics biz Vizio may be required by a California court to provide source code for its SmartCast TV software, which is allegedly based on open source code licensed under the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1.</p>
<p>The legal complaint from the Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) seeks access to the SmartCast source code so that Vizio customers can make changes and improvements to the platform, something that ought to be possible for code distributed under the GPL. On Thursday, California Superior Court Judge Sandy Leal issued <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2025/dec/04/tentative-vizio-ruling-in-favor-of-sfc/" rel="nofollow">a tentative ruling</a> in advance of a hearing, indicating support for part of SFC's legal challenge.</p>
<p>The tentative ruling is not a final decision, but it signals the judge's inclination to grant the SFC's motion for summary adjudication, at least in part.&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>"The <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/static/docs/2025-12-04-sleal-tentative-rulings.pdf" rel="nofollow">tentative ruling</a> [PDF] grants SFC's motion on the issue that a direct contract was made between SFC and Vizio when SFC's systems administrator, Paul Visscher, requested the source code to a TV that SFC has purchased," the SFC said in a <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2025/dec/04/tentative-vizio-ruling-in-favor-of-sfc/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. "This contract obligated Vizio to provide SFC the complete and corresponding source code."&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>The SFC initially asked Vizio to publish its SmartCast source code back in August 2018, based on its claim that the software relies on various applications and libraries that are licensed under the GPLv2 and LGPLv2.1, including the Linux kernel, alsa-utils, GNU bash, GNU awk, bluez, BusyBox, and other components.</p>
<p>Vizio responded in 2019 but the code it provided was incomplete, according to the SFC, and didn't fulfill the company's obligations.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>After two more years of negotiation, the SFC <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/20/vizio_gpl_lawsuit/">sued Vizio</a> in October 2021, a relatively uncommon event in the FOSS world due to the cost and difficulty of enforcing open source licenses. SFC director of compliance Denver Gingerich told <em>The Register</em> that software developer Sebastian Steck's <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/10/german_router_maker_avm_lgpl/">open source licensing victory</a> in Germany against AVM in January appears to be the first time the LGPL has been successfully litigated.</p>

</ul>
<p>Karen Sandler, executive director of the SFC, told <em>The Register</em> in an email that the hearing went well, though Vizio's legal counsel "stridently disagreed" with the legal analysis in the tentative ruling.</p>
<p>"Judge Leal said she would take the matter 'under submission' which means she will think about it further," Sandler said. "After the Court went off the record, Leal's clerk specifically verified the Court reporter could provide an expedited transcript, so Leal will likely review the hearing transcript soon."</p>
<p>Sandler expects Leal will examine the filings again before issuing her opinion, which is likely to be issued in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Bradley Kühn, policy fellow at the SFC, <a href="https://fedi.copyleft.org/@bkuhn/115662504393710334" rel="nofollow">posted</a> about the hearing (in a personal capacity) in a Mastodon thread. His account expresses some skepticism about the validity of Vizio's legal arguments.</p>

        

<p>"Vizio is effectively saying if you're in a <a href="https://fedi.copyleft.org/tags/GPL" rel="nofollow">#GPL</a> lawsuit, you lose your right to even ask for source at all!!!" he <a href="https://fedi.copyleft.org/@bkuhn/115663111778938044" rel="nofollow">observed</a>.</p>
<p>Vizio did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

        <p>Einem Urteil des&nbsp;Landgerichts München zufolge darf das <a href="https://www.zeit.de/geld/2025-11/geld-sparen-amazon-online-shopping-temu-strategie" target="_blank">US-Unternehmen Amazon</a> in Deutschland nicht einseitig die Vertragsbedingungen seines Streamingdiensts Prime Video ändern und den Zuschauern Werbespots zeigen. Damit habe der Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen mit einer Klage gegen <span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization"><a href="https://www.zeit.de/thema/amazon">Amazon</a></span> Erfolg gehabt, teilte das Gericht mit. Amazon soll den Kunden nun ein "Berichtigungsschreiben" schicken.
</p>                        <p>Laut Urteil hatte Amazon Anfang 2024 die Prime-Video-Kunden per Mail informiert, dass ab Februar in begrenztem Umfang <span itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Thing"><a href="https://www.zeit.de/thema/werbung">Werbung</a></span> gesendet würde. Wer keine Werbung sehen wollte, sollte im Monat 2,99 Euro mehr zahlen. Die 33. Zivilkammer sieht in diesem Vorgehen einen Verstoß gegen den lauteren Wettbewerb.
</p>        <p>Das Urteil ist noch nicht rechtskräftig, Amazon behält sich eine Anfechtung der Entscheidung vor: "Wir werden das Urteil prüfen, um unsere nächsten Schritte zu bestimmen", sagte ein Sprecher.&nbsp;
</p>        <p>Die Richter werteten die Mail als irreführend. <a href="https://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2025-10/amazon-cloud-ausfall-digitale-infrastruktur-abhaengigkeit-internet" target="_blank">Amazon</a> spiegelte den Kunden laut Urteil vor, zu einer einseitigen Vertragsänderung berechtigt zu sein. Das Gericht kam zu dem Schluss, dass weder die Amazon-Nutzungsbedingungen noch das Gesetz eine solche einseitige Änderung erlauben. Bei Vertragsabschluss hätten sich die Kunden auf ein werbefreies Angebot eingestellt, heißt es in der Gerichtsmitteilung. Und weil Amazon ein werbefreies Programm zum "Vertragsgegenstand" gemacht habe, müsse sich das Unternehmen daran festhalten lassen.&nbsp;<br>
</p>        
            <h2>Amazon nicht einverstanden</h2>        <p>Amazon widersprach: "Obwohl wir die Entscheidung des Gerichts respektieren, sind wir mit den Schlussfolgerungen nicht einverstanden", sagte ein Unternehmenssprecher. "Wir haben unsere Kunden transparent, im Voraus und in Übereinstimmung mit geltendem Recht über das Update zu Werbung bei Prime Video informiert."
</p>            
        
    
    
        <p>Ramona Pop, Vorständin des Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverbands, sprach von einem sehr wichtigen Urteil: "Es zeigt, dass die zusätzliche Werbung bei Amazon Prime Video nicht ohne Mitwirkung der betroffenen Verbraucher:innen erfolgen durfte." Mitglieder hätten nach Ansicht der Verbraucherzentrale weiter Anspruch auf Prime ohne Werbung – "und zwar ohne Mehrkosten".

Manabi Reader became popular as an Japanese-focused alternative to services like LingQ in that it locally tracks and analyzes all the words and kanji you read and study. It shows you which words are new and which you're currently learning via flashcards, so you can easily find content that suits your level and see what flashcards to prioritize adding.</p><p>It also passively accumulates an on-device (and in your personal iCloud) corpus of example sentences from your reading.

This works with AnkiMobile on iOS and AnkiConnect on desktop.</p><p>You can use it like a web browser for the web, or subscribe to RSS feeds. It comes with a bunch of curated content by level. Recently I added EPUB support, pitch accents, and note-taking with todos.</p><p>I'm now almost done adding a manga mode via Mokuro, and Netflix/streaming video support via realtime captioning of audio streams.</p><p>To scale this with UGC/influencer market I need to make it more beginner friendly.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><ul><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2025-12/TikTok%20Access%20request%20complaint_EN_redacted.pdf"><span>Complaint against TikTok for incomplete answer of access request</span></a></li><li><a href="https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2025-12/TikTok%20Grindr%20Complaint_EN_redacted.pdf"><span>Complaint against TikTok, AppsFlyer and Grindr for data sharing</span></a></li></ul><p><span><strong>Unlawful tracking across apps.</strong> It’s no secret that TikTok is rather data hungry. After all, the popular video platform’s algorithm seems to know exactly what content users want to see. However, it’s not well known that TikTok also tracks you while using other apps. A user found out about this unlawful tracking practice through an access request – which showed that e.g. his usage of Grindr was sent to TikTok, likely via the Israeli tracking company AppsFlyer - which allows TikTok to draw conclusions about his sexual orientation and sex life. This is specially protected data under </span><a href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR"><span>Article 9 GDPR</span></a><span>, which can only be processed in exceptional cases. TikTok initially even withheld this information&nbsp;from the user, which violates </span><a href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR" target="_blank"><span>Article 15 GDPR</span></a><span>. Only after repeated inquiries, TikTok revealed that it knows which apps he used, what he did within these apps (for example adding a product to the shopping cart) - and that this data also included information about his usage of the gay dating app Grindr.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Kleanthi Sardeli, data protection lawyer at </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">noyb</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">: </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">“Like many of its US counterparts, TikTok increasingly collects data from other apps and sources. This allows the Chinese app to gain a full picture of people’s online activity. The fact that data from another app revealed this user’s sexual orientation and sex life is just one of the more extreme examples.”</span></em></p><p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Accomplices in unlawful data processing.</strong> TikTok was only able to receive this information with the help of the Israeli data company AppsFlyer and Grindr itself. AppsFlyer most likely functions as a kind of intermediary, which receives the sensitive data about the complainant from Grindr and then passed it on to TikTok. The problem: Neither AppsFlyer nor Grindr have a valid legal basis under Article 6(1) GDPR to share the complainant’s personal data with third parties such as TikTok. And they most certainly don’t have any valid reason to share his sensitive data under Article 9(1) GDPR. At no point in time did the complainant consent to the sharing of his data.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Insufficient reply to access request.</strong> Users should generally be informed about the recipients of personal data and even get a copy of said data. However, TikTok seems to structurally violate the users’ right to get such a copy. TikTok refers its users to a </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">“download tool”</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">, but later admitted that this tool only holds what it deems the most </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">“relevant”</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> data – and by far not all personal data. Even after repeated inquiries to add the missing information, TikTok didn’t provide information about which data is being processed and for what purpose.&nbsp; By doing so, TikTok clearly violates </span><a href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Article_12_GDPR"><span lang="EN-GB">Articles 12</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><a href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Article_15_GDPR"><span lang="EN-GB">15 GDPR</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, which require companies to provide the information in full and in an easily understandable format.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Lisa Steinfeld, data protection lawyer at </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">noyb</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">: </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">“TikTok directs its users to an inherently incomplete ‘download tool’. It’s fair to assume that thousands of users were sent to this scam tool, which structurally doesn’t comply with the legal requirements to provide a full copy of one’s own personal data.”</span></em></p><p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Complaints filed in Austria.</strong> </span><em><span lang="EN-GB">noyb</span></em><span lang="EN-GB"> has therefore filed two complaints with the Austrian data protection authority (DSB). The first complaint is against TikTok and revolves around the incomplete reply to the complainant’s access request. The second complaint is against TikTok, AppsFlyer and Grindr and deals with the undefined processing of off-TikTok data, the lack of a valid legal basis for the data sharing and processing and the violation of </span><a href="https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=Article_9_GDPR"><span lang="EN-GB">Article 9(1) GDPR</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">. We request TikTok to provide the complainant with the missing information and all three companies to stop the unlawful processing of his personal data. Last but not least, we suggest that the authority impose an “</span><em><span lang="EN-GB">effective, proportionate and dissuasive</span></em><span lang="EN-GB">” fine under Article 83 GDPR to prevent similar violations in the future.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>Or: How I learned that “I don’t use Next.js” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use Next.js</em></p>

<h2 id="825-am-the-email">8:25 AM: The Email</h2>

<p>I woke up to this beauty from Hetzner:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attached was evidence of network scanning from my server to some IP range in Thailand. Great. Nothing says “good
morning” like an abuse report and the threat of getting your infrastructure shut down in 4 hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Background: I run a Hetzner server with Coolify. It runs all my <em>stuff</em>, like my little corner of the internet:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://inventronix.club/connect">My IoT Side Project</a></li>
  <li>This Blog</li>
  <li>Analytics</li>
  <li>My dads site (he’s an electrician)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="830-am-oh-fuck">8:30 AM: Oh Fuck</h2>

<p>First thing I did was SSH in and check the load average:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>w
 08:25:17 up 55 days, 17:23,  5 <span>users</span>,  load average: 15.35, 15.44, 15.60
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>For context, my load average is normally around 0.5-1.0. <strong>Fifteen</strong> is “something is very wrong.”</p>

<p>I ran <code>ps aux</code> to see what was eating my CPU:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre>USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND

1001       35035  760  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    Dec14 31638:25 [javae] &lt;defunct&gt;
1001     3687838  586  0.0      0     0 ?        Z    Dec07 82103:58 [runnv] &lt;defunct&gt;

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>819% CPU usage.</strong> On a process called <code>javae</code> running from <code>/tmp/.XIN-unix/</code>. And multiple <code>xmrig</code> processes - that’s
literally cryptocurrency mining software (Monero, specifically).</p>

<p>I’d been mining cryptocurrency for someone since December 7th. For <strong>ten days</strong>. Brilliant.</p>

<h2 id="the-investigation">The Investigation</h2>

<p>My first thought was “I’m completely fucked.” Cryptominers on the host, running for over a week - time to nuke
everything from orbit and rebuild, right?</p>

<p>But then I noticed something interesting. All these processes were running as user <code>1001</code>. Not root. Not a system user.
UID 1001.</p>

<p>Let me check what’s actually running:</p>



<p>I’ve got about 20 containers running via Coolify (my self-hosted PaaS). Inventronix (my IoT platform), some monitoring
stuff, Grafana, a few experiments.</p>

<p>And <strong>Umami</strong> - a privacy-focused analytics tool I’d re-deployed 9 days ago to track traffic on my blog.</p>

<p>Wait. 9 days ago. The malware started December 7th. Same timeline.</p>

<p>Let me check which container has user 1001:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>docker ps <span>-q</span> | <span>while </span><span>read </span>container<span>;</span> <span>do
  </span><span>echo</span> <span>"=== </span><span>$container</span><span> ==="</span>
  docker <span>exec</span> <span>$container</span> <span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> /app/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/ 2&gt;/dev/null | <span>grep </span>xmrig
<span>done</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>Output:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>=== a42f72cb1bc5 ===
drwxr-xr-x    2 nextjs   nogroup       4096 Dec 17 05:11 xmrig-6.24.0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>There it is.</strong> Container <code>a42f72cb1bc5</code> - that’s my Umami analytics container. And it’s got a whole <code>xmrig-6.24.0</code>
directory sitting in what should be Next.js server internals.</p>

<p>The mining command in the process list confirmed it:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre>/app/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/xmrig-6.24.0/xmrig 
  --url auto.c3pool.org:443 
  --user 8Bt9BEG98SbBPNTp1svQtDQs7PMztqzGoNQHo58eaUYdf8apDkbzp8HbLJH89fMzzciFQ7fb4ZiqUbymDZR6S9asKHZR6wn 
  --pass WUZHRkYOHh1GW1RZWBxaWENRX0ZBWVtdSRxQWkBWHg== 
  --donate-level 0
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>Someone had exploited my analytics container and was mining Monero using my CPU. Nice.</p>

<h2 id="wait-i-dont-use-nextjs">Wait, I Don’t Use Next.js</h2>

<p>Here’s the kicker. A few days ago I saw
a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/comments/1pgiaj3/i_got_hacked_and_traced_how_much_money_hacker/">Reddit post</a> about a
critical Next.js/Puppeteer RCE vulnerability (
CVE-2025-66478). My immediate reaction was “lol who cares, I don’t run Next.js.”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Oh my sweet summer child.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except… Umami <strong>is built with Next.js</strong>. I did not know this, nor did I bother looking. Oops.</p>

<p>The vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) was in Next.js’s React Server Components deserialization. The “Flight” protocol that
RSC uses to serialize/deserialize data between client and server had an unsafe deserialization flaw. An attacker could
send a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload to any App Router endpoint, and when deserialized, it
would execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>

<p>No Puppeteer involved - just broken deserialization in the RSC protocol itself. The attack flow:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Attacker sends crafted HTTP request to Umami’s Next.js endpoint</li>
  <li>RSC deserializes the malicious payload</li>
  <li>RCE achieved via unsafe deserialization</li>
  <li>Download and install cryptominers</li>
  <li>Profit (for them)</li>
</ol>

<p>So much for “I don’t use Next.js.”</p>

<h2 id="the-panic-has-it-escaped-the-container">The Panic: Has It Escaped the Container?</h2>

<p>This is where I started to properly panic. Looking at that process list:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>1001      714822  819  3.6 2464788 2423424 ?     Sl   Dec16 9385:36 /tmp/.XIN-unix/javae
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>That path - <code>/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae</code> - looks like it’s on the <strong>host filesystem</strong>, not inside a container. If the malware
had escaped the container onto my actual server, I’d need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Assume everything is compromised</li>
  <li>Check for rootkits, backdoors, persistence mechanisms</li>
  <li>Probably rebuild from scratch</li>
  <li>Spend my entire day unfucking this</li>
</ol>

<p>I checked for persistence mechanisms:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>crontab <span>-l</span>
no crontab <span>for </span>root

<span>$ </span>systemctl list-unit-files | <span>grep </span>enabled
<span># ... all legitimate system services, nothing suspicious</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>No malicious cron jobs. No fake systemd services pretending to be <code>nginxs</code> or <code>apaches</code> (common trick to blend in).
That’s… good?</p>

<p>But I still needed to know: <strong>Did the malware actually escape the container or not?</strong></p>

<h2 id="the-moment-of-truth">The Moment of Truth</h2>

<p>Here’s the test. If <code>/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae</code> exists on my host, I’m fucked. If it doesn’t exist, then what I’m seeing is
just Docker’s default behavior of showing container processes in the host’s <code>ps</code> output, but they’re actually isolated.</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> /tmp/.XIN-unix/javae
<span>ls</span>: cannot access <span>'/tmp/.XIN-unix/javae'</span>: No such file or directory
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>IT NEVER ESCAPED.</strong></p>

<p>The malware was entirely contained within the Umami container. When you run <code>ps aux</code> on a Docker host, you see processes
from all containers because they share the same kernel. But those processes are in their own mount namespace - they
can’t see or touch the host filesystem.</p>

<p>Let me verify what user that container was actually running as:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span>docker inspect umami-bkc4kkss848cc4kw4gkw8s44 | <span>grep</span> <span>'"User"'</span>
<span>"User"</span>: <span>"nextjs"</span>,

<span>$ </span>docker inspect umami-bkc4kkss848cc4kw4gkw8s44 | <span>grep</span> <span>'"Privileged"'</span>
<span>"Privileged"</span>: <span>false</span>,

<span>$ </span>docker inspect umami-bkc4kkss848cc4kw4gkw8s44 | <span>grep</span> <span>-A</span> 30 <span>"Mounts"</span>
<span>"Mounts"</span>: <span>[]</span>,
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p><strong>This is why I’m not fucked:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Container ran as user <code>nextjs</code> (UID 1001), not root ✅</li>
  <li>Container was not privileged ✅</li>
  <li>Container had <strong>zero volume mounts</strong> ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>The malware could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run processes inside the container ✅</li>
  <li>Mine cryptocurrency ✅</li>
  <li>Scan networks (hence the Hetzner abuse report) ✅</li>
  <li>Consume 100% CPU ✅</li>
</ul>

<p>The malware could NOT:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access the host filesystem ❌</li>
  <li>Install cron jobs ❌</li>
  <li>Create systemd services ❌</li>
  <li>Persist across container restarts ❌</li>
  <li>Escape to other containers ❌</li>
  <li>Install rootkits ❌</li>
</ul>

<p>Container isolation actually worked. Nice.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-dockerfiles-vs-auto-generated-images">Why This Matters: Dockerfiles vs. Auto-Generated Images</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing that saved me. I write my own Dockerfiles for my applications. I don’t use auto-generation tools like
Nixpacks (which Coolify supports) that default to <code>USER root</code> in containers.</p>

<p>The Reddit post I’d seen earlier? That guy got completely owned because his container was running as root. The malware
could:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install cron jobs for persistence</li>
  <li>Create systemd services</li>
  <li>Write anywhere on the filesystem</li>
  <li>Survive reboots</li>
</ul>

<p>His fix required a full server rebuild because he couldn’t trust anything anymore. Mine required… deleting a
container.</p>

<p>What I did not do, was keep track of the tolling I was using and what tooling <em>that</em> was using. In fact, I installed
Umami from Coolify’s services screen. I didn’t even configure it.</p>

<p>Obviously none of this is Umami’s fault by the way. They released a fix for their free software like a week ago. I just
didn’t think to do anything about it.</p>

<h2 id="the-fix">The Fix</h2>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span># Stop and remove the compromised container</span>
<span>$ </span>docker stop umami-bkc4kkss848cc4kw4gkw8s44
<span>$ </span>docker <span>rm </span>umami-bkc4kkss848cc4kw4gkw8s44

<span># Check CPU usage</span>
<span>$ </span><span>uptime
 </span>08:45:17 up 55 days, 17:43,  1 user,  load average: 0.52, 1.24, 4.83
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>CPU back to normal. All those cryptomining processes? Gone. They only existed inside the container.</p>

<p>I also enabled UFW (which I should have done ages ago):</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
</pre></td><td><pre><span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ufw default deny incoming
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ufw default allow outgoing
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ufw allow ssh
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ufw allow 80/tcp
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ufw allow 443/tcp
<span>$ </span><span>sudo </span>ufw <span>enable</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>This blocks all inbound connections except SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS. No more exposed PostgreSQL ports, no more RabbitMQ
ports open to the internet.</p>

<p>I sent Hetzner a brief explanation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Investigation complete. The scanning originated from a compromised Umami analytics container (CVE-2025-66478 -
Next.js/Puppeteer RCE).</p>

  <p>The container ran as non-root user with no privileged access or host mounts, so the compromise was fully contained.
Container has been removed and firewall hardened.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They closed the ticket within an hour.</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>

<h3 id="1-i-dont-use-x-doesnt-mean-your-dependencies-dont-use-x">1. “I don’t use X” doesn’t mean your dependencies don’t use X</h3>

<p>I don’t write Next.js applications. But I run third-party tools that are built with Next.js. When CVE-2025-66478 was
disclosed, I thought “not my problem.” Wrong.</p>

<p>Know what your dependencies are actually built with. That “simple analytics tool” is a full web application with a
complex stack.</p>

<h3 id="2-container-isolation-works-when-configured-properly">2. Container isolation works (when configured properly)</h3>

<p>This could have been so much worse. If that container had been running as root, or had volume mounts to sensitive
directories, or had access to the Docker socket, I’d be writing a very different blog post about rebuilding my entire
infrastructure.</p>

<p>Instead, I deleted one container and moved on with my day.</p>

<p><strong>Write your own Dockerfiles.</strong> Understand what user your processes run as. Avoid <code>USER root</code> unless you have a very
good reason. Don’t mount volumes you don’t need. Don’t give containers <code>--privileged</code> access.</p>

<h3 id="3-the-sophistication-gap">3. The sophistication gap</h3>

<p>This malware wasn’t like those people who auto-poll for <code>/wpadmin</code> <em>every</em> time I make a DNS change. This was spicy.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disguised itself in legitimate-looking paths (<code>/app/node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/</code>)</li>
  <li>Used process names that blend in (<code>javae</code>, <code>runnv</code>)</li>
  <li>Attempted to establish persistence</li>
  <li>According to other reports, even had “killer scripts” to murder competing miners</li>
</ul>

<p>But it was still limited by container isolation. Good security practices beat sophisticated malware.</p>

<h3 id="4-defense-in-depth-matters">4. Defense in depth matters</h3>

<p>Even though the container isolation held, I still should have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Had a firewall enabled from day one (not “I’ll do it later”)</li>
  <li>Been running fail2ban to stop those SSH brute force attempts</li>
  <li>Had proper monitoring/alerting (I only noticed because of the Hetzner email)</li>
  <li>Updated Umami when the CVE was disclosed</li>
</ul>

<p>I got lucky. Container isolation saved me from my own laziness.</p>

<h2 id="what-im-doing-differently">What I’m Doing Differently</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No more Umami.</strong> I’m salty. The CVE was disclosed, they patched it, but I’m not running Next.js-based analytics
anymore. Considering GoatCounter (written in Go) or just parsing server logs with GoAccess.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Audit all third-party containers.</strong> Going through everything I run and checking:
    <ul>
      <li>What user does it run as?</li>
      <li>What volumes does it have?</li>
      <li>When was it last updated?</li>
      <li>Do I actually need it?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SSH hardening.</strong> Moving to key-based authentication only, disabling password auth, and setting up fail2ban.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Proper monitoring.</strong> Setting up alerts for CPU usage, load average, and suspicious network activity. I shouldn’t
find out about compromises from my hosting provider.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Regular security updates.</strong> No more “I’ll update it later.” If there’s a CVE, I patch or I remove the service.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-weird-silver-lining">The Weird Silver Lining</h2>

<p>This was actually a pretty good learning experience. I got to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Practice incident response on a real compromise</li>
  <li>Prove that container isolation actually works</li>
  <li>Learn about Docker namespaces, user mapping, and privilege boundaries</li>
  <li>Harden my infrastructure without the pressure of active data loss</li>
</ul>

<p>And I only lost about 2 hours of my morning before work. Could’ve been way worse.</p>

<p>Though I do wonder how much Monero I mined for that dickhead. Based on the CPU usage and duration… probably enough for
them to have a nice lunch. You’re welcome, mysterious attacker. Hope you enjoyed it.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Umami analytics (built with Next.js) had a Puppeteer RCE vulnerability</li>
  <li>Got exploited, installed cryptominers</li>
  <li>Mined Monero for 10 days at 1000%+ CPU</li>
  <li>Container isolation saved me because it ran as non-root with no mounts</li>
  <li>Fix: <code>docker rm umami</code> and enable firewall</li>
  <li>Lesson: Know what your dependencies are built with, and configure containers properly</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting with OBS Studio 32.0.0 a new renderer backend based on Apple's <strong>Metal</strong> graphics API is available for users to test as an experimental alternative to the existing OpenGL backend on macOS. This marks an important step in OBS Studio's development to adapt one of the modern APIs that deliberately broke with the past to unlock better performance and efficiency gains for end users, but also require fundamental changes to how an application interacts with a GPU.</p>

<p>These fundamental changes were necessary to achieve the goals of lower overhead, faster performance, and to better represent the way that modern GPUs actually work, particularly when the GPU is used for more than just 3D rendering. Yet other changes were also necessary due to the way Metal was specifically designed to fit into Apple's operating systems.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer amount of information around this topic, it made sense to split it into separate posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The first post (this one)</strong> will go into specific challenges and insights from writing the Metal backend for OBS Studio.</li>
<li>The second post will look at the history of 3D graphics APIs, their core differences, and how the design of the new generation creates challenges for existing renderers like the one in OBS Studio.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Metal backend is explicitly marked as <strong>"Experimental"</strong> in the application because it has some known quirks (for which no good solutions have been found yet, more about that below) but also because it has not yet been tested by a larger user audience. The OpenGL renderer is still <em>the default choice</em> offered to users and will be available for the foreseeable future, but we still would like to invite users to try out the Metal backend for themselves, and report any critical bugs they might encounter.</p>
<p>Better yet, if you happen to have prior experience working with Metal on Apple Silicon platforms (including iPhones), we'd be happy to hear feedback about specific aspects of the current implementation or even review pull-requests with improvements to it.</p>
<h2>Part 1.1: The Why Of Metal</h2>
<figure><img alt="Craig Federighi announcing Metal during WWDC 2014, jokingly making a 'fork' hand gesture." src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/4ef70e7e9e-1762495292/craig_federighi_metal_wwdc_2014.jpg"></figure>
<p>In June 2014 Apple announced (and - more importantly - also <em>released to developers</em>) the first version of Metal for iPhones with Apple's A7 SOC, extending its support to current Macs of the time in 2015. Thus Metal was not only available on what became later known as "Apple Silicon" GPUs, but also Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs, being the first "next generation" graphics API to support all mainstream GPUs of the time.</p>
<p>Metal combined many benefits to Apple specifically: The API was based on concepts and ideas that not only already found their way into AMD's "Mantle" API (which was announced in September 2013) but had also been discussed for and adopted to some degree in the existing graphics APIs (OpenGL and Direct3D) at the time. But as a new API written from scratch it had the chance to omit all the <em>legacy aspects of existing APIs</em> and fully lean into these new concepts. It was able to provide the performance gains unlocked by this different approach and as it was originally designed for iOS and macOS, an entirely new API implemented in <em>Objective-C and Swift</em> (the latter of which was also introduced in 2014).</p>
<figure><a href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1020791/Approaching-Zero-Driver-Overhead-in" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Opening slide of GDC 2014 presentation by NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel, about approaching zero driver overhead in OpenGL" src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/5894ade6c0-1762495292/gdc_2014_approaching_zero_driver_overhead.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>While OpenGL did (and still does) provide a well-established C-based API, it incorporates a binding model that is considered inelegant by many. Direct3D to this day uses a C++-based object-oriented API design (primarily via the COM binary interface), making it easier for developers to keep track of state and objects in their application code. Notably existing APIs in COM-based systems are not allowed to change, instead new variants have to be introduced, providing a decent amount of backwards-compatibility for applications originally written for older versions of Direct3D.</p>
<p>Metal takes Direct3D's object-oriented approach one step further by combining it with the more "verbal" API design common in Objective-C and Swift in an attempt to provide a <em>more intuitive and easier API</em> for app developers to use (and not just game developers) and to further motivate those to integrate more 3D and general GPU functionality into their apps. This lower barrier of entry was very much the point of earlier Metal versions, which combined the comparatively easier API with extensive graphics debugging capabilities built right into Xcode, providing developers with in-depth insights into every detail of their GPU processing (including built-in debugging of shader code) in the same IDE used for the rest of their application development.</p>
<h2>Part 1.2: Differences In API Design</h2>
<p>All modern APIs share the same concepts and approaches in their designs, which attempt to solve a major design issue of OpenGL and Direct3D:</p>
<ul>
<li>The old APIs took care of a lot of resource management and synchronization for the developer, "hiding" much of the actual complexity involved in preparing the GPU for workloads.</li>
<li>The old APIs presented the GPU as a big state machine (particularly OpenGL) where the developer can change bits and pieces between issuing draw calls.</li>
<li>Due to the possibility to change bits and pieces of a pipeline at will, the old APIs had to check if the current "state" of the API is valid before issuing any work to the GPU, adding considerable overhead to the API "driver".</li>
</ul>
<figure><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/611" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Slide from WWDC 2019 presentation about moving from OpenGL to Metal - example of validation requirements of typical OpenGL state approach" src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/e13d2d364b-1762495292/wwdc_2018_opengl_state.jpg"></a></figure>
<ul>
<li>The new APIs removed most of that and now require developers to manage their resources and synchronization themselves, only providing methods to communicate their intent to the API and thus the GPU.</li>
<li>The new APIs present the GPU as a highly parallelized processing unit that can be issued a list of commands that will be added to a queue and are then picked up by the GPU, "drawing" just being one of many operations.</li>
<li>To avoid having to re-validate the pipeline state before each draw call, pipelines have become immutable objects, whose validity is checked once during their creation, removing the overhead from draw commands using the pipeline, leaving some overhead whenever the pipelines themselves are switched.</li>
</ul>
<figure><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/611" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Slide from WWDC 2019 presentation about moving from OpenGL to Metal - example of Metal variant of the same OpenGL state approach" src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/76531a7abf-1762495292/wwdc_2018_metal_state.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Of course there are many other differences (large and small) but those are the ones that had the most impact on the attempt to write a "next generation" graphics API backend for OBS Studio. The current renderer is obviously built around the way the old APIs work (particularly Direct3D) and thus makes certain assumptions about the state the APIs will be in at any given point in time. The issue is that those assumptions are not correct as soon as any of those new APIs are used and a lot of the work that the APIs used to do for OBS Studio now <em>has to be taken care of by the application itself</em>.</p>
<p>So a decision had to be made: Either the core renderer can be updated or even rewritten to take care of the responsibilities expected by the modern APIs, adapting more modern "indirect drawing" techniques in Direct3D and OpenGL to make them more compatible with that approach (making <em>those</em> renderers potentially more performant as well), or put this additional work entirely into the backend for one of the new APIs, leaving the core renderer as-is. At least for the Metal backend, the second path was chosen.</p>
<h2>Part 1.3: The Expectations Of OBS Studio's Renderer</h2>
<p>Before the new release, OBS Studio shipped with two graphics APIs: <strong>Direct3D</strong> on Windows and <strong>OpenGL</strong> on Linux and macOS. This is achieved by having a core rendering subsystem that is (for the most part) API-independent and requires an API-specific backend to be loaded at runtime. This backend then implements a generic set of render commands issued by the core renderer and translates those into the actual commands and operations required by its API. That said, the core renderer has <em>some quirks</em> that become apparent once one tries to add support for an API that works <em>slightly</em> different than it might expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>As OBS Studio's shader files are effectively written in an older dialect of Microsoft's <strong>High Level Shader Language (HLSL)</strong>, every shader needs to be analyzed and translated into a valid variant for the modern API at runtime.</li>
<li>Shaders are expected to use the <strong>same data structure as input and output type</strong>, as well as support <strong>global variables</strong>.</li>
<li>The application expects all operations made by the graphics API to be strictly sequential, and to always <strong>execute</strong> operations involving the same resources strictly <strong>in order</strong> of submission to the API.</li>
<li>OBS Studio's texture operations (creating textures from data loaded by the application, updating textures, reading from textures, and more) are directly modelled after Direct3D's API design. Any other API needs to work around this expectation and do housekeeping "behind the scenes" to meet it.</li>
<li>OBS Studio also expects to be able to <strong>render previews</strong> (such as the program view, the main preview, the multi-view, and others) <strong>directly at its own pace</strong> (and framerate), expecting every platform to effectively behave like Windows and provide "swapchains" with the "discard model" used by DXGI, and thus is not decoupled from the render loop for the video output.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="Flowchart presenting the logical relationship between effects files and their shaders." src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/1257eb3f4d-1762495292/obs_shader_overview.png"></figure>
<p>Most of these issues either fall into the realm of shaders or the API design itself, all of which had to be overcome by the Metal backend.</p>
<h3>Part 1.3.1: Transpiling Shaders</h3>
<p>OBS Studio makes extensive use of <em>shader programs</em> that run on the GPU to do efficient image processing. Both <code>libobs</code> (OBS Studio's main library that includes the core renderer) as well as plugins like the first-party <code>obs-filters</code> plugin provide their own "effect" files, which are implemented using the HLSL dialect mentioned above.</p>
<p>These effects files contain "techniques", each potentially made of up of a number of render passes (although all current OBS Studio effect files use a single pass) that provide a vertex and fragment shader pair. The vertex shader is the little program a GPU runs for every vertex (a "point" of a triangle) to calculate its actual position in a scene relative to a camera looking at it. The fragment shader (also called "pixel shader" in Direct3D) calculates the actual color value for each fragment (a visible pixel in the output image).</p>
<figure><img alt="Flowchart presenting the steps required to generate a Metal shader string from an OBS effects file." src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/53989c4ccf-1762495292/obs_shader_transpile.png"></figure>
<p>To make these files work with OpenGL and Direct3D, they need to be converted into bespoke shader source code for each "technique" first, which OBS Studio achieves through multiple steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each effect file is parsed in its entirety and converted <strong>into a data structure</strong> representing each "part" of the effect file:<ul>
<li>The "<em>uniforms</em>", that is data (or a data structure) that is updated by application code at every rendered frame.</li>
<li>The "<em>vertex</em>" or "<em>fragment</em>" data (usually a data struct) that is kept in GPU memory.</li>
<li><em>Texture descriptions</em> (textures can be 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional) and <em>sampler descriptions</em> (samplers describe how a color value is read from a texture for use in a shader).</li>
<li>The <em>shader functions</em>, including their return type and argument types.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Additionally each technique (and pass(es) within) are parsed into a <strong>nested data structure</strong>:<ul>
<li>OBS Studio will then iterate over every technique and its passes to pick up the names of the vertex and fragment shader functions mentioned in each.</li>
<li>The uniforms, shader data, as well as the texture and sampler descriptions, are shared among each technique within the same file. The created data structures are used to <em>re-create the (partial) HLSL source code</em> that was parsed originally.</li>
<li>The shader functions and their content are then copied and a "main" function is generated (as the entry-point for the shader) calling the actual shader function. The generated <em>final HLSL string</em> is kept as the shader representation of each "technique".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each technique is sent in its HLSL form to each graphics API and is then <strong>transpiled into its API-specific form</strong>:<ul>
<li>For Direct3D this means replacing text tokens with their more current variants.</li>
<li>For GLSL this means parsing the HLSL string back into structured data <em>again</em>, before iterating over this data and composing a <em>GLSL shader string</em> from it. As shader function code is not analyzed, it needs to be parsed <em>word-for-word</em> and translated into GLSL-specific variants if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adapting this process for Metal led to a few challenges, born out of the stricter shader language used by the API:</p>
<ul>
<li>MSL is <strong>stricter</strong> around types and semantics:<ul>
<li>Direct3D uses "semantics" to mark parts of shader data structs and give them meaning, like <code>TEXCOORD0</code>, <code>COLOR0</code>, or <code>SV_VertexID</code>, while OpenGL uses global variables that shader code instead reads from or writes into.</li>
<li>Metal uses a <em>similar semantics-based model as Direct3D</em> via attributes, but their use is more strict. Some attributes are allowed for input data, but not for output data.</li>
<li>Thus the same struct definition <em>cannot</em> be used as input and output type definition, instead the single struct type used by HLSL <strong>needs to be split into two separate structs</strong> for MSL.</li>
<li>Every function's content then needs to be scanned for <em>any</em> use of the struct type and needs to be replaced with the appropriate input or output variant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MSL has <strong>no support for global variables</strong>:<ul>
<li>This means that "<em>uniforms</em>" as used by Direct3D (and set up by OBS Studio's renderer) cannot be used by Metal - uniform data needs to be provided <strong>as a buffer of data in GPU memory</strong>.</li>
<li>This buffer of data can be referenced as an input parameter to a shader function, thus any use of the global variable (used by HLSL and GLSL) needs to be replaced with a use of the function argument.</li>
<li>However any other function called by the "main" shader function also accessing a global variable needs this local variable passed explicitly to it, thus - once again - <em>every function's code needs to be parsed and analyzed</em>.</li>
<li>Any time a function uses a global, it needs to have a new function argument added to its signature to accept the "global" data as an explicit function parameter.</li>
<li>Any time a function <em>calls</em> a function that uses a global, it <em>also</em> needs to have its signature changed to accept the data explicitly and also change the call signature to pass the data along.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And these are just two examples of major differences in the shader language that require the transpiler to <strong>almost rewrite every effect file</strong> used by <code>libobs</code>.</p>
<p>Here's a trivial example, OBS Studio's most basic vertex shader that simply multiplies each vertex position with a matrix to calculate the actual coordinates in "clip space" (coordinates that describe the position as a percentage of the width and height of the camera's view):</p>
<pre><code>uniform float4x4 ViewProj;

struct VertInOut {
    float4 pos : POSITION;
    float2 uv : TEXCOORD0;
};

VertInOut VSDefault(VertInOut vert_in)
{
    VertInOut vert_out;
    vert_out.pos = mul(float4(vert_in.pos.xyz, 1.0), ViewProj);
    vert_out.uv  = vert_in.uv;
    return vert_out;
}

VertInOut main(VertInOut vert_in)
{
    return VSDefault(vert_in);
}</code></pre>
<p>In this shader the view projection matrix is provided as a global variable called <code>ViewProj</code> and it's used by the <code>VSDefault</code> shader function. The Metal Shader variant needs to be a bit more explicit about the flow of data:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;metal_stdlib&gt;
using namespace metal;

typedef struct {
    float4x4 ViewProj;
} UniformData;

typedef struct {
    float4 pos [[attribute(0)]];
    float2 uv [[attribute(1)]];
} VertInOut_In;

typedef struct {
    float4 pos [[position]];
    float2 uv;
} VertInOut_Out;

VertInOut_Out VSDefault(VertInOut_In vert_in, constant UniformData &amp;uniforms) {
    VertInOut_Out vert_out;
    vert_out.pos = (float4(vert_in.pos.xyz, 1.0)) * (uniforms.ViewProj);
    vert_out.uv  = vert_in.uv;
    return vert_out;
}

[[vertex]] VertInOut_Out _main(VertInOut_In vert_in [[stage_in]], constant UniformData &amp;uniforms [[buffer(30)]]) {
    return VSDefault(vert_in, uniforms);
}</code></pre>
<p>As explained above, the single <code>VertInOut</code> struct had to be split into <em>two separate variants for input and output</em>, as the <code>attribute(n)</code> mapping is only valid for <em>input</em> data. It uses a pattern more common in modern APIs where memory is typically organized in <em>larger heaps</em> into which all other data (buffers, textures, etc.) is placed and referenced. In this case the <code>stage_in</code> decoration allows the developer to access vertex or fragment data for which a vertex descriptor had been set up and is used for convenience. Otherwise the variable would just represent a buffer of GPU memory.</p>
<p>To tell Metal which part of the <em>output</em> structure contains the calculated vertex positions, the corresponding field has to be decorated with <code>[[position]]</code> or return a <code>float4</code> explicitly. Every vertex shader <strong>has</strong> to do one or the other, as it would otherwise fail shader compilation.</p>
<p>The <code>uniform</code> global used by HLSL is transformed into a <em>buffer variable</em>: The uniform data is uploaded into the buffer in slot 30 and referenced by the <code>[[buffer(30)]]</code> decorator and uses the ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) to make it a C++ reference using the <code>constant</code> address space attribute, which marks this reference to be read-only. The <code>uniforms</code> reference is also passed into the <code>VSDefault</code> function, as the transpiler detected that the function accesses <code>ViewProj</code> within its function body, and thus adds it as an argument to the function signature and converts the reference of <code>ViewProj</code> into the correct form <code>uniforms.ViewProj</code>.</p>
<p>Similar work has to be done for all those cases where GLSL or HLSL will opportunistically accept data with the "wrong" types and alias or convert them into the correct one. Metal does not allow this, the developer <em>has</em> to put any such conversion into code explicitly and also requires any function call to match the function signature. Here is one such example:</p>
<pre><code>float PS_Y(FragPos frag_in)
{
    float3 rgb = image.Load(int3(frag_in.pos.xy, 0)).rgb;
    float y = dot(color_vec0.xyz, rgb) + color_vec0.w;
    return y;
}</code></pre>
<p>In this example the HLSL shader uses the <code>Load</code> function to load color values from a texture and passes in a vector of 3 signed integer values. A valid Metal Shader variant would look like this:</p>
<pre><code>float PS_Y(FragPos frag_in, constant UniformData &amp;uniforms, texture2d&lt;float&gt; image) {
    float3 rgb = image.read(uint2(int2(frag_in.pos.xy)), uint( int( 0))).rgb;
    float y = dot(uniforms.color_vec0.xyz, rgb) + uniforms.color_vec0.w;
    return y;
}</code></pre>
<p>The signature of the corresponding <code>read</code> function in MSL requires a vector of 2 unsigned integer values and a single unsigned integer. Thus the transpiler needs to <strong>detect any (known) invocation of a function that uses type aliasing</strong> or other kinds of type punning and explicitly convert the provided function arguments into the types required by the MSL shader function, in this case converting a single <code>int3</code> into a pair of <code>uint2</code> and <code>uint</code> and ensuring that the data passed into the <code>uint</code> constructor is actually of a specific type that <em>can</em> be converted.</p>
<p>These and many other changes are necessary because MSL is effectively C++14 code and thus requires the same adherence to type safety and function signatures as any other application code written in C++. This allows <strong>sharing header files of data type and structure definitions between application and shader code</strong>, but also requires shader code to be more correct than it had to be for HLSL or GLSL in the past. And in the case of OBS Studio, the transpiler has to partially "rewrite" the HLSL shader code into more compliant MSL code at runtime.</p>
<h3>Part 1.3.2: Pretending To Be Direct3D</h3>
<p>The next hurdle was to simulate the behavior of Direct3D inside the Metal API implementation. As it was deemed infeasible to rewrite the core renderer itself, it must be "kept in the dark" about what actually happens behind the scenes.</p>
<p>One of the main jobs OBS Studio has to do for every video frame is convert images (or "frames") provided by the CPU into textures on the GPU, and - depending on the video encoder used - convert the final output texture back into a frame in CPU memory that can be sent to the encoder. In Direct3D this involves the "mapping" and "unmapping" of a texture:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a texture is "mapped" it is made available for the application code in CPU memory.</li>
<li>When the texture is mapped for writing, Direct3D will provide a pointer to some CPU memory that it has either allocated directly or had been "lying around" from an earlier map operation. OBS Studio can then copy its frame data into the location.</li>
<li>When the texture is mapped for reading, Direct3D will provide a pointer to CPU memory that contains a copy of the texture data from GPU memory. OBS Studio can copy this data into its own "cache" of frames.</li>
<li>When OBS Studio is done with either operation, it has to "unmap" the texture. The provided pointer is then invalidated and any data pointed to it can and will be changed randomly.</li>
</ul>
<p>By itself a naïve implementation of this operation can have severe consequences: When a texture is mapped for writing, any pending GPU operation (e.g., a shader's sampler reading color data from it) might be blocked from being executed as the texture is still being written to. Likewise when a texture is mapped for reading, any pending CPU operation (e.g., copying the frame data into a cache for the video encoder) might have to wait for any GPU operation that currently uses that texture.</p>
<p>As part of its resource tracking behind the scenes, Direct3D 11 <strong>keeps track of texture access operations</strong> and will try to keep any such interruptions to a minimum, which leads specifically to the kind of overhead the modern APIs try to avoid:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a texture is mapped for writing, Direct3D will keep track of the mapping request and provide a pointer to get the data copied into, even while the texture is in use, and schedule a synchronization of the texture data.</li>
<li>Once the texture is <em>unmapped</em>, Direct3D will upload the data to GPU memory and once this has taken place, schedule an update of the texture with the new image data.</li>
<li>If any consecutive draw call that uses the same texture was issued by the application code <em>after</em> the unmapping, Direct3D will implicitly ensure that all pending GPU commands are scheduled and thus the texture update will take place before any consecutive GPU command might access the same texture.</li>
<li>When a texture is mapped for reading, Direct3D will also ensure that all pending GPU commands writing to that texture are executed first to ensure that the copy it will provide will represent the result of any draw commands issued by the application before that.</li>
<li>These are just examples of what <em>might</em> happen, as the specifics are highly dependent on the current state of the pipelines, the internal caches of the API's "driver" and other heuristics.</li>
</ul>
<figure><img alt="Two flowcharts presenting the differences between Direct3D and Metal when updating a texture with new image data." src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/158d06d766-1762495292/obs_texture_update_direct3d_vs_metal.png"></figure>
<p>OBS Studio's entire render pipeline is designed around the characteristics of the <code>map</code> and <code>unmap</code> commands in Direct3D 11 and expect any other graphics API to behave in a similar way. Metal (as other modern APIs) <strong>does not do all of this work</strong> (Metal 3 will indeed still do hazard tracking of resources, but developers can opt-out of this behavior, and Metal 4 removed it entirely) and thus the API-specific backend has to simulate the behavior of Direct3D 11 in its own implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a texture is mapped for writing, a GPU buffer is opportunistically <em>set up to hold the image data</em>.</li>
<li>As the Metal backend is only supported on Apple Silicon devices, GPU and CPU share the same memory. This means that a pointer to the buffer's memory can be <em>directly shared with the renderer</em>,</li>
<li>When the texture is "unmapped", a simple block transfer (or blit) operation is scheduled on the GPU to copy the contents of the GPU buffer into the GPU texture. The unmap operation will "wait" until the blit operation has been scheduled on the GPU to prohibit the renderer from issuing any new render commands which would potentially run in parallel.</li>
<li>When a texture is mapped for reading, the same pointer to the GPU buffer is shared with application code. As the buffers are never used by any render command directly, <em>no hazard tracking is necessary</em>. An "unmapping" thus does nothing.</li>
<li>"Staging" a texture for reading thus only requires scheduling a blit from the source texture into its associated staging buffer (as buffers and textures are effectively the same thing and differ only by their API). To ensure that no further render commands are issued by the application, the copy operation is made to wait until it is completed by the GPU, but also has to ensure that if the source texture has any pending render commands, that those are scheduled to be run on the GPU explicitly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The same applies to other operations closely following Direct3D's design: To ensure that the Metal backend reacts in a way that meets the way OBS Studio's renderer expects, it had the <strong>"hidden" functionality of Direct3D implemented explicitly</strong>, particularly the tracking of texture use by prior render commands before any staging takes place.</p>
<h2>Part 1.4: But Wait, There's More (Issues)</h2>
<p>One major reason why the backend is considered "experimental" is due to the way its preview rendering had to be implemented for now. To understand the core reason for those issues, it is important to first understand how OBS Studio expects preview rendering to work, which closely shaped by the way <strong>DXGI (DirectX Graphics Infrastructure)</strong> allows applications to present 3D content on Windows. DXGI swapchains hold a number of buffers with image data created by the application, one of which the application can ask to be <em>"presented" by the operating system</em>.</p>
<p>To avoid an application potentially generating too many frames than can be presented (and thus potentially blocking the application), DXGI swapchains can be set to have a "<em>discard</em>" mode and a <em>synchronization interval of <code>0</code></em>, which effectively allows an application to force the presentation of a back buffer immediately (without waiting for the operating system's own screen refresh interval) and because the contents of the buffer are discarded, it becomes available to be overwritten by the application with the the next frame's data.</p>
<figure><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Microsoft info graphic presenting differences between blt mode and flip mode presentation in DXGI" src="https://obsproject.com/media/pages/blog/obs-studio-gets-a-new-renderer/d71332d150-1762495292/dxgi_swap_chain.png"></a></figure>
<p>Unfortunately this is the <strong>opposite</strong> of how Metal (or more precisely Metal Layers) allows one to render 3D contents into application windows: With the introduction of <em>ProMotion on iPhones and Macbooks</em>, macOS controls the effective frame rates used by devices to provide fluid motion during interaction, but potentially throttle the desktop rendering to single digit framerates when no interaction or updates happen. This allows iOS and macOS to <strong>limit the operating system framerate</strong> (and the framerate of all applications within it) when the device is set to "low power" mode and is thus not designed to be "overruled" by an application (as it would allow such an application to violate the "low power" decision made by the user).</p>
<p>Thus applications cannot just render frames to be presented by the OS at their own pace, instead they <strong>have to ask for a surface to render to</strong> and the number of surfaces an application can be provided with is <strong>limited</strong>. This means that if OBS Studio is running at twice the frame rate of the operating system, it would <em>exhaust its allowance of surfaces to render into</em>. And because OBS Studio renders previews as part of its single render loop, any delay introduced by a preview render operation also stalls or delays the generation of new frames for video encoders.</p>
<p>The solution (at least for this first experimental release) was for OBS Studio to always render into a texture that "pretends" to be the window surface to allow the renderer to finish all its work in its required frame time. Then a different thread (running globally for the entire app with a fixed screen refresh interval) will pick up this texture, request a window surface to render into, and then schedule a block transfer (blit) to copy the contents into the surface. This also requires explicit synchronization of the textures' use on the GPU to ensure that the "pretender" texture is fully rendered to by OBS before the copy to the surface is executed.</p>
<p><strong>In a nutshell:</strong> Whenever the operating system compositor requires a refresh, a <em>separate thread</em> will wait for OBS Studio to render a new frame of the associated preview texture and only once that has happened, the texture data is copied into the surface provided by the compositor. But as the preview rendering is now decoupled from the main render loop, framerate inconsistencies are inevitable. The kernel-level timer provided by the operating system will not align with OBS Studio's render loop (which requires the render thread to be woken up when it's calculated "time for the next frame" has been reached) and thus either a new frame might have been rendered in time or an old frame could not be copied in time.</p>
<p>Starting with macOS 14, the approach suggested by Apple would require OBS Studio to <strong>decouple these intervals even further</strong>, as every window (and thus potentially every preview) will have its own independent timer at which the application will receive a call from the operating system with a surface ready to be rendered into, which would bring a whole new set of potential challenges as it's even further removed from how OBS Studio expects to be able to render previews in the application.</p>
<h2>Part 1.5: The Hidden Costs Of Modern Graphics APIs</h2>
<p>The complexity of the endeavor was high and took <em>several months of research</em>, trial and error, bugfixing, multiple redesigns of specific aspects, and many long weekends. During the course of development it also became clear why some applications that simply switched from OpenGL to Vulkan or Direct3D 11 to Direct3D 12 might have potentially faced <em>worse</em> performance than before, seemingly <em>contradicting those API's promise</em> of improved performance.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is that a lot of the work that had been taken care of the by API's drivers are <strong>now application responsibilities</strong> and thus need to be taken care of by developers themselves. This however requires a more intimate understanding of "how the GPU works" and familiarization with those parts of Direct3D or OpenGL that were purposefully hidden from developers up to this point. And it also requires a more in-depth understanding of how the render commands interact with each other, what their dependencies are, and similarly how to encode and communicate these dependencies to the GPU to ensure that render commands are executed in the right order.</p>
<p>In the case of the Metal backend, this means that a certain amount of overhead that was removed from the API itself had to be <em>reintroduced into the backend again</em>, as even though it would be in a far better position for adoption, the core renderer was not available for a rewrite. Nevertheless even with this overhead, the Metal backend provides multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Release configuration and even in its non-optimized current form, it performs <em>as well or even better</em> as the OpenGL renderer.</li>
<li>In Debug configuration it provides <em>an amazing set of capabilities to analyze render passes</em> in all their detail, including shader debugging, texture lookups, and so much more.</li>
<li>As it's written in Swift, it uses a <em>safer programming language</em> than the OpenGL renderer, one that is at the same time easier and less time consuming to work with.</li>
<li>Because preview rendering is effectively handled separately from the main render loop, <strong>the Metal renderer enables EDR previews on macOS</strong> for high-bitrate video setups.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as maintenance of the macOS version of OBS Studio is concerned, the Metal backend brings considerable benefits as Xcode can now provide insights that haven't been available to developers since the deprecation of OpenGL on all Apple platforms in 2018. But it is due to these complexities that the project would like to extend an invitation to all developers (and users that might be so inclined) to <strong>provide feedback and suggestions for changes to improve the design and implementation</strong> of the Metal backend to first move it out of the "experimental" stage and later make it the default graphics backend on macOS.</p>      </div></div>]]></description>

  <p><strong>This post was inspired by a question that another Substack blogger received earlier this month.</strong> I felt that his answer started off on the right track, then veered off course. So I decided to write my own response.</p><p>To start, here’s the question that inspired this post:</p><blockquote><p>Can you explain why it makes economic sense for landlords in high-priced metros to keep commercial real estate empty for years at a time? … I understand there's a lot of social pressure on landlords to keep rents high or face the wrath of their neighbors, but how can that pressure still work after ten years of losses?</p></blockquote><p>The short answer is both simple and surprising: In many cases, lowering the rent on a building will&nbsp;<strong>force the bank to foreclose on it</strong>.</p><p>Foreclosure is very bad for both the bank and the operator, so both parties would rather “extend and pretend,” leaving the building vacant while they wait and hope for the market to change.</p><p>This seems absurd. Surely everyone would be better off if they just lowered the rent and got some use out of the building — getting&nbsp;<em>some</em>&nbsp;rent must be better than getting&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;rent, right?</p><p>Intuition fails because normal people think of a building as a building, when in the majority of cases, a building is <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2024/3/27/unpacking-the-question-can-housing-be-an-investment-and-affordable">not a building but a&nbsp;<em>financial product</em></a>. Behavior that makes no sense for a building can make perfect sense for a financial product.</p><p>To understand this, I’ll offer a simplified explanation of commercial real estate, and the “extend and pretend” dilemma.</p><h2>Commercial Loans Aren’t Like Residential Mortgages</h2><p>The first reason our intuition fails us is that very few normal people buy and sell building-sized financial products — or financial product-sized buildings. But most of us will buy or sell a home, or know people who have. This gives us some intuitions about how “property” works:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The value is mostly determined by the market — roughly, whatever someone else would be willing to pay for it.</p></li><li><p>Home mortgages are mostly based on the&nbsp;<em>purchaser’s</em>&nbsp;ability to pay.</p></li><li><p>Thanks to extensive federal government programs, most <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2024/4/22/multidecade-mortgages-are-dumb-and-here-is-why">residential mortgages are long-term</a> amortized, meaning they’re designed to be fully paid off by regular payments over time.</p></li></ul><p>These ideas lead us astray because&nbsp;<em>none of this</em>&nbsp;applies to the commercial, or “income-producing” market. For commercial property:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The value is determined by the income the building will produce.</p></li><li><p>The loan is based on&nbsp;<em>the building’s</em>&nbsp;ability to pay.</p></li><li><p>Loans are typically short-term balloon notes, meaning they are&nbsp;<em>not </em>designed to be fully paid off by regular payments over time.</p></li></ul><p>Let’s walk through a toy example to explain how these three factors can lead to an “extend and pretend” situation.</p><h2>What Is a Building Worth?</h2><p>The story starts with a building operator and a bank deciding what a building is worth. To figure this out, the operator is going to make a financial model that projects <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2022/5/23/wealth-and-buildings">the&nbsp;<em>income</em>&nbsp;that a building will generate</a>.</p><p>First, the operator forecasts that the net rent (after expenses) will be $1 million per year.</p><p>Second, the operator assumes a Capitalization Rate (or “cap rate”) for the building. In plain English, the cap rate is the percentage of the building's total value that it will generate in income each year. So, if we say the cap rate is 5%, that means the building will generate 5% of its total value as income each year.</p><p>The operator forecasts the building will generate $1 million a year in net rent. If that’s 5% of the building's value, then its total value is $20 million ($1M / 0.05 = $20M).</p><p>If that’s confusing, another way to think of the cap rate is the “payback time” for the investment — 100 / cap rate (as an integer) = payback time: 100 / 5 = 20 year payback.</p><p>You may wonder how the cap rate is determined. The simple answer is the owner and the bank negotiate and agree on a number.</p><p>The important thing to understand here is that the actual building is not an important part of the value calculation. We’re not really looking at the replacement cost, the unique design, the amenities, the location, etc. Those things influence the assumptions about the gross rent we can get or the cost of operating the building (higher cost means less net rent), but at the end of the day it isn’t&nbsp;<em>the building</em>&nbsp;that has value, it’s the&nbsp;<em>income stream.</em></p><h2>Terms of the Loan</h2><p>We’ve decided that our income stream (aka building) is worth $20 million. Now let’s make a loan.</p><p>Banks are highly regulated, so they can’t just loan whatever they want. The government insists that banks keep high margins of safety in their portfolio, and commercial loans are risky, so the terms they can offer are designed to limit risk.</p><p>First, the <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/11/27/the-paradox-of-persistent-vacancies-and-high-prices">loan term will be shorter</a> than a residential mortgage, anywhere from 5-20 years, with most in the 5-10 year range. Second, the bank must keep a strict loan-to-value (LTV) ratio — so they won’t lend more than 80% of the value of the building (and often less than that).</p><p>For this example, let’s assume the bank offers an 80% LTV loan, with a 5-year term, interest-only at 4%.</p><p>That means the building operator has to pay $4 million, and gets $16 million from the bank, to buy the building for $20 million. They then have to pay $640k in interest every year, and in five years they have to either pay off the $16 million balance or refinance it. (The plan will be to refinance.)</p><p>The operator buys the building and gets to work filling it with tenants.</p><h2>The Rent Is Too Damn High</h2><p>Now suppose that three years into this project it turns out the building operator was wrong, there isn't enough demand at the building's high rent, so the building is 50% vacant.</p><p>Half empty, the building is only generating $500k per year in net income instead of $1 million.</p><p>The owner is paying $640k in interest, therefore losing $140k per year operating the building. That sucks, surely he should <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2023/4/26/upzoning-might-not-lower-housing-costs-do-it-anyway">lower the rent</a>, right?</p><p>Let’s imagine the owner lowers the rent by 30% to fill the building.</p><p>Now the net rent is $700k. The owner is still paying $640k on the loan, therefore earning $60k per year. So everyone is better off, right?</p><p><strong>Wrong!</strong></p><p>Remember, the building isn’t a building, it’s an&nbsp;<em>income stream.</em>&nbsp;Before, the operator and the bank had a model that said the operator would be able to make $1 million per year. Now,&nbsp;<em>reality has proven</em>&nbsp;the operator can only make $700k per year.</p><p><strong>700k per year&nbsp;<em>is not worth $20 million.</em></strong>&nbsp;Given our agreed-upon cap rate of 5%, this proven $700k per year income stream is only worth $14 million ($700K/0.05 =$14M).</p><h2>An Upside-Down Building</h2><p>In this scenario, the building has proven to only be worth $14 million, but the operator owes $16 million to the bank, so he is now $2 million underwater on the loan. In two more years, he’ll have to pay off the full $16 million, and he doesn’t have that much cash, so he’ll need to refinance.</p><p>Since the building (income stream) is worth $14 million and the bank can only lend 80% LTV, the maximum new loan will be $11.2 million, meaning the owner has to put another $4.8 million cash in to keep the building ($16M - $11.2M = $4.8M).</p><p>The hard truth at this point is that the operator overpaid, and the most logical thing to do would be to walk away from the building and lose the $4 million he invested. And that&nbsp;<em>really sucks</em>&nbsp;for the operator.</p><p>It also&nbsp;<em>really sucks</em>&nbsp;for the bank, because the bank now has an asset (the loan) they paid $16 million for and can only sell for $14 million, so the bank is also taking a $2 million loss in this scenario.</p><p>The thing is, both the operator and <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/12/7/for-small-developers-strong-towns-need-strong-banking">the bank can do this math</a> too, so they know this is coming and want to avoid it.</p><h2>Extend and Pretend</h2><p>When year five rolls around and the loan on the building comes due, both the original bank and the owner would like to avoid losing a combined $6 million. And so long as the operator can afford to keep losing $140k per year on the building… they can!</p><p>What they need to do is stick to the original model.&nbsp;<strong>Don’t lower the rent.</strong>&nbsp;Just claim that there was a blip in the market, nobody could have seen that coming, it’s all going to be fine.</p><p>The bank can offer to extend the operator's loan on the original terms, based on the original model, and give the income stream more time to materialize.</p><p>The only sticking point here is that the building operator is still losing $140k per year. But remember that, if he gives up, he loses the $4 million he’s already put into the building. Even if he ended up paying $140k per year for 10 years before things turned around, losing $1.4 million is still better than losing $4 million.</p><p>So both the operator and the bank have <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2017/11/27/the-paradox-of-persistent-vacancies-and-high-prices-dgp33">a lot of incentive to extend and pretend</a>, rather than lower the rent and face the consequences of having overpaid for the building.</p><h2>This Sucks, What Could We Do About It?</h2><p>A reader asked if I could add “some thought about an alternative to the status quo, because the situation we have is CLEARLY suboptimal.”</p><p>Honestly, I don’t think there’s a simple fix here. Financialization means we have way more capital available to <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/6/5/whats-up-with-all-those-empty-commercial-storefronts-in-new-mixed-use-developments">build much bigger</a> and nicer buildings than we did in the past. But it turns buildings into financial products. It’s not obvious to me that we could stop that without also killing the supply of capital to build and buy large buildings. I can’t guess how that would play out, so I also can’t say if it would be worth it.</p><p>The obvious thing cities could try is to put more pressure on building operators to fill their spaces, but the building operators are already under a ton of pressure — they’re losing a bunch of money! So, cities could do something like put a <a href="https://archive.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/8/30/why-is-that-house-or-storefrontvacant">vacant storefront tax</a> and… make them lose even more money? If that “worked,” the mechanism would be to force a lot of commercial property to default, which could put a lot of new space on the market at lower prices, which should lower the commercial rent. But it would also hurt the banks a lot, which has a history of leading to bad consequences and subsequent bailouts.</p><p>I’ll give this some more thought, but if any actual commercial real estate professionals have ideas, I’d love to hear from you in the comments!<br></p><p><strong>Check out the </strong><a href="https://postsuburban.substack.com/p/why-do-commercial-spaces-sit-vacant" target="_blank"><strong>original post</strong></a><strong> for a brief Q&amp;A on this topic.

<p>Adult video platform PornHub is being extorted by the ShinyHunters extortion gang after the search and watch history of its Premium members was reportedly stolen in a recent Mixpanel data breach.</p>


<p>Last week, PornHub disclosed that it was impacted by a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/openai-discloses-api-customer-data-breach-via-mixpanel-vendor-hack/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recent breach at analytics vendor Mixpanel</a>. Mixpanel suffered a breach on November 8th, 2025, after an SMS phishing (smishing) attack enabled threat actors to compromise its systems.</p>


<p>"A recent cybersecurity incident involving Mixpanel, a third-party data analytics provider, has impacted some Pornhub Premium users," reads a <a href="https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/47334442459283-Important-Message-From-Pornhub" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PornHub security notice</a> posted on Friday.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/mgo/72/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/webinar-images/Action1-970x250-watch-now.jpg" alt="Wiz"></a>
</p>


<p>"Specifically, this situation affects only select Premium users. It is important to note this was not a breach of Pornhub Premium's systems. Passwords, payment details, and financial information remain secure and were not exposed."</p>


<p>PornHub says it has not worked with Mixpanel since 2021, indicating the stolen records are historical analytics data from 2021 or earlier.</p>


<p>Mixpanel <a href="https://mixpanel.com/blog/sms-security-incident/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">says the breach affected</a>&nbsp;a "limited number" of customers, with OpenAI and CoinTracker previously disclosing they were affected.</p>


<p>This is the first time it has been publicly confirmed that ShinyHunters was behind the Mixpanel breach.</p>


<p>When contacting PornHub, the company did not provide additional comment to BleepingComputer beyond the security notice.</p>


<p>After publishing our story, Mixpanel told BleepingComputer that it does not believe this data originated from the recent November breach.</p>


<p>"Mixpanel is aware of reports that Pornhub has been extorted with data that that was allegedly stolen from us," Mixpanel told BleepingComputer.</p>


<p>"We can find no indication that this data was stolen from Mixpanel during our November 2025 security Incident or otherwise."</p>


<p>"The data was last accessed by a legitimate employee account at Pornhub’s parent company in 2023. If this data is in the hands of an unauthorized party, we do not believe that is the result of a security incident at Mixpanel."</p>


<h2>PornHub search and watch history exposed</h2>

<p>Today, BleepingComputer learned that ShinyHunters began extorting Mixpanel customers last week, sending emails that began with "We are ShinyHunters" and warned that their stolen data would be published if a ransom was not paid.</p>


<p>In an extortion demand sent to PornHub, ShinyHunters claims it stole 94GB of data containing over 200 million records of personal information in the Mixpanel breach.</p>


<p>ShinyHunters later confirmed to BleepingComputer that they were behind the extortion emails, claiming the data consists of 201,211,943 records of historical search, watch, and download activity for the platform's Premium members.</p>


<p>A small sample of data shared with BleepingComputer shows that the analytic events sent to Mixpanel contain a large amount of sensitive information that a member would not likely want publicly disclosed.</p>


<p>This data includes a PornHub Premium member's email address, activity type, location, video URL, video name, keywords associated with the video, and the time the event occurred.</p>


<p>Activity types seen by BleepingComputer include whether the PornHub subscriber watched or downloaded a video or viewed a channel. However, ShinyHunters also said the events include search histories.</p>


<p>The ShinyHunters extortion group has been behind a string&nbsp;of data breaches this year by compromising various Salesforce integration&nbsp;companies to gain access to Salesforce instances and steal company data.</p>


<p>The threat group is linked to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-silently-fixes-zero-day-exploit-leaked-by-shinyhunters/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the exploitation of the Oracle E-Business Suite zero-day</a> (CVE-2025-61884), as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-claims-15-billion-salesforce-records-stolen-in-drift-hacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">to Salesforce/Drift attacks</a> that impacted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/shinyhunters-starts-leaking-data-stolen-in-salesforce-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">large number of organizations</a> earlier this year.</p>


<p>More recently ShinyHunters <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/salesforce-investigates-customer-data-theft-via-gainsight-breach/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">conducted a breach at GainSight</a> that allowed the threat actors to steal further Salesforce data from organizations.</p>


<p>With it now confirmed that ShinyHunters is also behind the Mixpanel breach, the threat actors are responsible for some of the most significant data breaches in 2025, impacting hundreds of companies.</p>


<p>ShinyHunters is also creating a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/meet-shinysp1d3r-new-ransomware-as-a-service-created-by-shinyhunters/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">new ransomware-as-a-service called ShinySpid3r,</a> which will serve as a platform for them and threat actors associated with Scattered Spider to conduct ransomware attacks.</p>

<h2 id="introduction"><span>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>The reliability and robustness of SQLite is achieved in part
by thorough and careful testing.</p>

<p>As of <a href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_42_0.html">version 3.42.0</a> (2023-05-16),
the SQLite library consists of approximately
155.8 KSLOC of C code.
(KSLOC means thousands of "Source Lines Of Code" or, in other words,
lines of code excluding blank lines and comments.)
By comparison, the project has
590 times as much
test code and test scripts -
92053.1 KSLOC.</p>

<h2 id="test_harnesses"><span>2. </span>Test Harnesses</h2>

<p>There are four independent test harnesses used for testing the
core SQLite library.
Each test harness is designed, maintained, and managed separately
from the others.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
<a name="tcl"></a>

The <b>TCL Tests</b> are the original tests for SQLite.
They are contained in the same source tree as the
SQLite core and like the SQLite core are in the public domain.  The
TCL tests are the primary tests used during development.
The TCL tests are written using the
<a href="http://www.tcl-lang.org/">TCL scripting language</a>.
The TCL test harness itself consists of 27.2 KSLOC
of C code used to create the TCL interface.  The test scripts are contained
in 1390 files totaling
23.2MB in size.  There are
51445 distinct test cases, but many of the test
cases are parameterized and run multiple times (with different parameters)
so that on a full test run millions of
separate tests are performed.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>
The <b><a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3</a></b> test harness is a set of proprietary tests, written in
C that provide 100% branch test coverage
(and <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#mcdc">100% MC/DC test coverage</a>) to
the core SQLite library.  The TH3 tests are designed to run
on embedded and specialized platforms that would not easily support
TCL or other workstation services.  TH3 tests use only the published
SQLite interfaces. TH3 consists of about
76.9 MB or 1055.4 KSLOC
of C code implementing 50362 distinct test cases.
TH3 tests are heavily parameterized, though, so a full-coverage test runs
about 2.4 million different test
instances.
The cases that provide 100% branch test coverage constitute
a subset of the total TH3 test suite.  A soak test
prior to release does about
248.5 million tests.
Additional information on TH3 is <a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">available separately</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>
<a name="slt"></a>

The <a href="https://sqlite.org/sqllogictest"><b>SQL Logic Test</b></a>
or SLT test harness is used to run huge numbers
of SQL statements against both SQLite and several other SQL database engines
and verify that they all get the same answers.  SLT currently compares
SQLite against PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle 10g.
SLT runs 7.2 million queries comprising
1.12GB of test data.
</p></li>

<li><p>
The <a href="#dbsqlfuzz"><b>dbsqlfuzz</b></a> engine is a
proprietary fuzz tester.  Other <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#fuzztesting">fuzzers for SQLite</a>
mutate either the SQL inputs or the database file.  Dbsqlfuzz mutates
both the SQL and the database file at the same time, and is thus able
to reach new error states.  Dbsqlfuzz is built using the
<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a> framework of LLVM
with a custom mutator.  There are
336 seed files. The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer
runs about one billion test mutations per day.
Dbsqlfuzz helps ensure
that SQLite is robust against attack via malicious SQL or database
inputs.
</p></li></ol>

<p>In addition to the four main test harnesses, there are many other
small programs that implement specialized tests.  Here are a few
examples:
</p><ol>
<li value="5">The "speedtest1.c" program
estimates the performance of SQLite under a typical workload.
</li><li>The "mptester.c" program is a stress test for multiple processes
concurrently reading and writing a single database.
</li><li>The "threadtest3.c" program is a stress test for multiple threads using
SQLite simultaneously.
</li><li>The "fuzzershell.c" program is used to
run some <a href="#fuzztesting">fuzz tests</a>.
</li><li>The "jfuzz" program is a libfuzzer-based fuzzer for
<a href="https://sqlite.org/json1.html#jsonbx">JSONB</a> inputs to the <a href="https://sqlite.org/json1.html">JSON SQL functions</a>.
</li></ol>


<p>All of the tests above must run successfully, on multiple platforms
and under multiple compile-time configurations,
before each release of SQLite.</p>

<p>Prior to each check-in to the SQLite source tree, developers
typically run a subset (called "veryquick") of the Tcl tests
consisting of about
304.7 thousand test cases.
The veryquick tests include most tests other than the anomaly, fuzz, and
soak tests.  The idea behind the veryquick tests are that they are
sufficient to catch most errors, but also run in only a few minutes
instead of a few hours.</p>

<h2 id="anomaly_testing"><span>3. </span>Anomaly Testing</h2>

<p>Anomaly tests are tests designed to verify the correct behavior
of SQLite when something goes wrong.  It is (relatively) easy to build
an SQL database engine that behaves correctly on well-formed inputs
on a fully functional computer.  It is more difficult to build a system
that responds sanely to invalid inputs and continues to function following
system malfunctions.  The anomaly tests are designed to verify the latter
behavior.</p>

<h2 id="out_of_memory_testing"><span>3.1. </span>Out-Of-Memory Testing</h2>

<p>SQLite, like all SQL database engines, makes extensive use of
malloc()  (See the separate report on
<a href="https://sqlite.org/malloc.html">dynamic memory allocation in SQLite</a> for
additional detail.)
On servers and workstations, malloc() never fails in practice and so correct
handling of out-of-memory (OOM) errors is not particularly important.
But on embedded devices, OOM errors are frighteningly common and since
SQLite is frequently used on embedded devices, it is important that
SQLite be able to gracefully handle OOM errors.</p>

<p>OOM testing is accomplished by simulating OOM errors.
SQLite allows an application to substitute an alternative malloc()
implementation using the <a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/config.html">sqlite3_config</a>(<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/c_config_covering_index_scan.html#sqliteconfigmalloc">SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC</a>,...)
interface.  The TCL and TH3 test harnesses are both capable of
inserting a modified version of malloc() that can be rigged to fail
after a certain number of allocations.  These instrumented mallocs
can be set to fail only once and then start working again, or to
continue failing after the first failure.  OOM tests are done in a
loop.  On the first iteration of the loop, the instrumented malloc
is rigged to fail on the first allocation.  Then some SQLite operation
is carried out and checks are done to make sure SQLite handled the
OOM error correctly.  Then the time-to-failure counter
on the instrumented malloc is increased by one and the test is
repeated.  The loop continues until the entire operation runs to
completion without ever encountering a simulated OOM failure.
Tests like this are run twice, once with the instrumented malloc
set to fail only once, and again with the instrumented malloc set
to fail continuously after the first failure.</p>

<h2 id="i_o_error_testing"><span>3.2. </span>I/O Error Testing</h2>

<p>I/O error testing seeks to verify that SQLite responds sanely
to failed I/O operations.  I/O errors might result from a full disk drive,
malfunctioning disk hardware, network outages when using a network
file system, system configuration or permission changes that occur in the
middle of an SQL operation, or other hardware or operating system
malfunctions.  Whatever the cause, it is important that SQLite be able
to respond correctly to these errors and I/O error testing seeks to
verify that it does.</p>

<p>I/O error testing is similar in concept to OOM testing; I/O errors
are simulated and checks are made to verify that SQLite responds
correctly to the simulated errors.  I/O errors are simulated in both
the TCL and TH3 test harnesses by inserting a new
<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/vfs.html">Virtual File System object</a> that is specially rigged
to simulate an I/O error after a set number of I/O operations.
As with OOM error testing, the I/O error simulators can be set to
fail just once, or to fail continuously after the first failure.
Tests are run in a loop, slowly increasing the point of failure until
the test case runs to completion without error.  The loop is run twice,
once with the I/O error simulator set to simulate only a single failure
and a second time with it set to fail all I/O operations after the first
failure.</p>

<p>In I/O error tests, after the I/O error simulation failure mechanism
is disabled, the database is examined using
<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check">PRAGMA integrity_check</a> to make sure that the I/O error has not
introduced database corruption.</p>

<h2 id="crash_testing"><span>3.3. </span>Crash Testing</h2>

<p>Crash testing seeks to demonstrate that an SQLite database will not
go corrupt if the application or operating system crashes or if there
is a power failure in the middle of a database update.  A separate
white-paper titled
<a href="https://sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html">Atomic Commit in SQLite</a> describes the
defensive measures SQLite takes to prevent database corruption following
a crash.  Crash tests strive to verify that those defensive measures
are working correctly.</p>

<p>It is impractical to do crash testing using real power failures, of
course, and so crash testing is done in simulation.  An alternative
<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/vfs.html">Virtual File System</a> is inserted that allows the test
harness to simulate the state of the database file following a crash.</p>

<p>In the TCL test harness, the crash simulation is done in a separate
process.  The main testing process spawns a child process which runs
some SQLite operation and randomly crashes somewhere in the middle of
a write operation.  A special <a href="https://sqlite.org/vfs.html">VFS</a> randomly reorders and corrupts
the unsynchronized
write operations to simulate the effect of buffered filesystems.  After
the child dies, the original test process opens and reads the test
database and verifies that the changes attempted by the child either
completed successfully or else were completely rolled back.  The
<a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check">integrity_check</a> <a href="https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#syntax">PRAGMA</a> is used to make sure no database corruption
occurs.</p>

<p>The TH3 test harness needs to run on embedded systems that do not
necessarily have the ability to spawn child processes, so it uses
an in-memory <a href="https://sqlite.org/vfs.html">VFS</a> to simulate crashes.  The in-memory <a href="https://sqlite.org/vfs.html">VFS</a> can be rigged
to make a snapshot of the entire filesystem after a set number of I/O
operations.  Crash tests run in a loop.  On each iteration of the loop,
the point at which a snapshot is made is advanced until the SQLite
operations being tested run to completion without ever hitting a
snapshot.  Within the loop, after the SQLite operation under test has
completed, the filesystem is reverted to the snapshot and random file
damage is introduced that is characteristic of the kinds of damage
one expects to see following a power loss.  Then the database is opened
and checks are made to ensure that it is well-formed and that the
transaction either ran to completion or was completely rolled back.
The interior of the loop is repeated multiple times for each
snapshot with different random damage each time.</p>

<h2 id="compound_failure_tests"><span>3.4. </span>Compound failure tests</h2>

<p>The test suites for SQLite also explore the result of stacking
multiple failures.  For example, tests are run to ensure correct behavior
when an I/O error or OOM fault occurs while trying to recover from a
prior crash.

<a name="fuzztesting"></a>

</p><h2 id="fuzz_testing"><span>4. </span>Fuzz Testing</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">Fuzz testing</a>
seeks to establish that SQLite responds correctly to invalid, out-of-range,
or malformed inputs.</p>

<h2 id="sql_fuzz"><span>4.1. </span>SQL Fuzz</h2>

<p>SQL fuzz testing consists of creating syntactically correct yet
wildly nonsensical SQL statements and feeding them to SQLite to see
what it will do with them.  Usually some kind of error is returned
(such as "no such table").  Sometimes, purely by chance, the SQL
statement also happens to be semantically correct.  In that case, the
resulting prepared statement is run to make sure it gives a reasonable
result.</p>

<h3 id="sql_fuzz_using_the_american_fuzzy_lop_fuzzer"><span>4.1.1. </span>SQL Fuzz Using The American Fuzzy Lop Fuzzer</h3>

<p>The concept of fuzz testing has been around for decades, but fuzz
testing was not an effective way to find bugs until 2014 when
Michal Zalewski invented the first practical profile-guided fuzzer,
<a href="http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/">American Fuzzy Lop</a> or "AFL".
Unlike prior fuzzers that blindly generate random inputs, AFL
instruments the program being tested (by modifying the assembly-language
output from the C compiler) and uses that instrumentation to detect when
an input causes the program to do something different - to follow
a new control path or loop a different number of times.  Inputs that provoke
new behavior are retained and further mutated.  In this way, AFL is able
to "discover" new behaviors of the program under test, including behaviors
that were never envisioned by the designers.

</p><p>AFL proved adept at finding arcane bugs in SQLite.
Most of the findings have been assert() statements where the conditional
was false under obscure circumstances.  But AFL has also found
a fair number of crash bugs in SQLite, and even a few cases where SQLite
computed incorrect results.

</p><p>Because of its past success, AFL became a standard part of the testing
strategy for SQLite beginning with <a href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_8_10.html">version 3.8.10</a> (2015-05-07) until
it was superseded by better fuzzers in <a href="https://sqlite.org/releaselog/3_29_0.html">version 3.29.0</a> (2019-07-10).

<a name="ossfuzz"></a>

</p><h3 id="google_oss_fuzz"><span>4.1.2. </span>Google OSS Fuzz</h3>

<p>Beginning in 2016, a team of engineers at Google started the
<a href="https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz">OSS Fuzz</a> project.
OSS Fuzz uses a AFL-style guided fuzzer running on Google's infrastructure.
The Fuzzer automatically downloads the latest check-ins for participating
projects, fuzzes them, and sends email to the developers reporting any
problems.  When a fix is checked in, the fuzzer automatically detects this
and emails a confirmation to the developers.

</p><p>SQLite is one of many open-source projects that OSS Fuzz tests. The
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/file/test/ossfuzz.c">test/ossfuzz.c</a> source file
in the SQLite repository is SQLite's interface to OSS fuzz.

</p><p>OSS Fuzz no longer finds historical bugs in SQLite.  But it is still
running and does occasionally find issues in new development check-ins.
Examples:
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=ci&amp;c=c422afb507dc8757">[1]</a>
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=ci&amp;c=0a2eb949f8a759e5">[2]</a>
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=ci&amp;c=62f2235adf796c72">[3]</a>.

<a name="dbsqlfuzz"></a>

</p><h3 id="the_dbsqlfuzz_and_jfuzz_fuzzers"><span>4.1.3. </span>The dbsqlfuzz and jfuzz fuzzers</h3>

<p>Beginning in late 2018, SQLite has been fuzzed using a proprietary
fuzzer called "dbsqlfuzz".  Dbsqlfuzz is built using the
<a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a> framework of LLVM.

</p><p>The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer mutates both the SQL input and the database file
at the same time.  Dbsqlfuzz uses a custom
<a href="https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md">Structure-Aware Mutator</a>
on a specialized input file that defines both an input database and SQL
text to be run against that database. Because it mutates both the input
database and the input SQL at the same time, dbsqlfuzz has been able to
find some obscure faults in SQLite that were missed by prior fuzzers that
mutated only SQL inputs or only the database file.
The SQLite developers keep dbsqlfuzz running against trunk in about
16 cores at all times.  Each instance of dbsqlfuzz program is able to
evalutes about 400 test cases per second, meaning that about 500 million
cases are checked every day.</p>

<p>The dbsqlfuzz fuzzer has been very successful at hardening the
SQLite code base against malicious attack.  Since dbsqlfuzz has been
added to the SQLite internal test suite, bug reports from external
fuzzers such as OSSFuzz have all but stopped.

</p><p>Note that dbsqlfuzz is <i>not</i> the Protobuf-based structure-aware
fuzzer for SQLite that is used by Chromium and described in the
<a href="https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/docs/structure-aware-fuzzing.md#user-content-example-sqlite">Structure-Aware Mutator article</a>.
There is no connection between these two fuzzers, other than the fact that they
are both based on <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a>
The Protobuf fuzzer for SQLite is written and maintained by the Chromium
team at Google, whereas dbsqlfuzz is written and maintained by the original
SQLite developers.  Having multiple independently-developed fuzzers for SQLite
is good, as it means that obscure issues are more likely to be uncovered.

</p><p>Near the end of January 2024, a second libFuzzer-based tool called
"jfuzz" came into use.  Jfuzz generates corrupt <a href="https://sqlite.org/json1.html#jsonbx">JSONB</a> blobs and feeds
them into the <a href="https://sqlite.org/json1.html">JSON SQL functions</a> to verify that the JSON functions
are able to safely and efficiently deal with corrupt binary inputs.


<a name="3pfuzz"></a>

</p><h3 id="other_third_party_fuzzers"><span>4.1.4. </span>Other third-party fuzzers</h3>

<p>SQLite seems to be a popular target for third-parties to fuzz.
The developers hear about many attempts to fuzz SQLite
and they do occasionally get bug reports found by independent
fuzzers.  All such reports are promptly fixed, so the product is
improved and that the entire SQLite user community benefits.
This mechanism of having many independent testers is similar to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law">Linus's law</a>:
"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".

</p><p>One fuzzing researcher of particular note is
<a href="https://www.manuelrigger.at/">Manuel Rigger</a>.
Most fuzzers only look for assertion faults, crashes, undefined behavior (UB),
or other easily detected anomalies.  Dr. Rigger's fuzzers, on the other hand,
are able to find cases where SQLite computes an incorrect answer.
Rigger has found
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?y=t&amp;u=mrigger&amp;n=all">many such cases</a>.
Most of these finds are obscure corner cases involving type
conversions and affinity transformations, and a good number of the finds
are against unreleased features.  Nevertheless, his finds are still important
as they are real bugs,
and the SQLite developers are grateful to be able to identify and fix
the underlying problems.

<a name="fuzzcheck"></a>

</p><h3 id="the_fuzzcheck_test_harness"><span>4.1.5. </span>The fuzzcheck test harness</h3>

<p>Historical test cases from <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#aflfuzz">AFL</a>, <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#ossfuzz">OSS Fuzz</a>, and <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#dbsqlfuzz">dbsqlfuzz</a> are
collected in a set of database files in the main SQLite source tree
and then rerun by the "fuzzcheck" utility program whenever one runs
"make test".  Fuzzcheck only runs a few thousand "interesting" cases
out of the billions of cases that the various fuzzers have
examined over the years.  "Interesting" cases are cases that exhibit
previously unseen behavior.  Actual bugs found by fuzzers are always
included among the interesting test cases, but most of the cases run
by fuzzcheck were never actual bugs.

<a name="tension"></a>

</p><h3 id="tension_between_fuzz_testing_and_100_mc_dc_testing"><span>4.1.6. </span>Tension Between Fuzz Testing And 100% MC/DC Testing</h3>

<p>Fuzz testing and <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#mcdc">100% MC/DC testing</a> are in tension with
one another.
That is to say, code tested to 100% MC/DC will tend to be
more vulnerable to problems found by fuzzing and code that performs
well during fuzz testing will tend to have (much) less than
100% MC/DC.
This is because MC/DC testing discourages <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#defcode">defensive code</a> with
unreachable branches, but without defensive code, a fuzzer is
more likely to find a path that causes problems.  MC/DC testing
seems to work well for building code that is robust during
normal use, whereas fuzz testing is good for building code that is
robust against malicious attack.

</p><p>Of course, users would prefer code that is both robust in normal
use and resistant to malicious attack.  The SQLite developers are
dedicated to providing that.  The purpose of this section is merely
to point out that doing both at the same time is difficult.

</p><p>For much of its history SQLite has been focused on 100% MC/DC testing.
Resistance to fuzzing attacks only became a concern with the introduction
of AFL in 2014.  For a while there, fuzzers were finding many problems
in SQLite.  In more recent years, the testing strategy of SQLite has
evolved to place more emphasis on fuzz testing.  We still maintain
100% MC/DC of the core SQLite code, but most testing CPU cycles are
now devoted to fuzzing.

</p><p>While fuzz testing and 100% MC/DC testing are in tension, they
are not completely at cross-purposes.  The fact that the SQlite test
suite does test to 100% MC/DC means that when fuzzers do find problems,
those problems can be fixed quickly and with little risk of introducing
new errors.

</p><h2 id="malformed_database_files"><span>4.2. </span>Malformed Database Files</h2>

<p>There are numerous test cases that verify that SQLite is able to
deal with malformed database files.
These tests first build a well-formed database file, then add
corruption by changing one or more bytes in the file by some means
other than SQLite.  Then SQLite is used to read the database.
In some cases, the bytes changes are in the middle of data.
This causes the content of the database to change while keeping the
database well-formed.
In other cases, unused bytes of the file are modified, which has
no effect on the integrity of the database.
The interesting cases are when bytes of the file that
define database structure get changed.  The malformed database tests
verify that SQLite finds the file format errors and reports them
using the <a href="https://sqlite.org/rescode.html#corrupt">SQLITE_CORRUPT</a> return code without overflowing
buffers, dereferencing NULL pointers, or performing other
unwholesome actions.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#dbsqlfuzz">dbsqlfuzz</a> fuzzer also does an excellent job of verifying
that SQLite responds sanely to malformed database files.</p>

<h2 id="boundary_value_tests"><span>4.3. </span>Boundary Value Tests</h2>

<p>SQLite defines certain <a href="https://sqlite.org/limits.html">limits</a> on its operation, such as the
maximum number of columns in a table, the maximum length of an
SQL statement, or the maximum value of an integer.  The TCL and TH3 test
suites both contains numerous tests that push SQLite right to the edge
of its defined limits and verify that it performs correctly for
all allowed values.  Additional tests go beyond the defined limits
and verify that SQLite correctly returns errors.  The source code
contains <a href="https://sqlite.org/testing.html#testcase">testcase macros</a> to verify that both sides of each boundary
have been tested.</p>

<h2 id="regression_testing"><span>5. </span>Regression Testing</h2>

<p>Whenever a bug is reported against SQLite, that bug is not considered
fixed until new test cases that would exhibit the bug have been added
to either the TCL or TH3 test suites.
Over the years,
this has resulted in thousands and thousands of new tests.
These regression tests ensure that bugs that have
been fixed in the past are not reintroduced into future versions of
SQLite.</p>

<h2 id="automatic_resource_leak_detection"><span>6. </span>Automatic Resource Leak Detection</h2>

<p>Resource leak occurs when system resources
are allocated and never freed.  The most troublesome resource leaks
in many applications are memory leaks - when memory is allocated using
malloc() but never released using free().  But other kinds of resources
can also be leaked:  file descriptors, threads, mutexes, etc.</p>

<p>Both the TCL and TH3 test harnesses automatically track system
resources and report resource leaks on <u>every</u> test run.
No special configuration or setup is required.   The test harnesses
are especially vigilant with regard to memory leaks.  If a change
causes a memory leak, the test harnesses will recognize this
quickly.  SQLite is designed to never leak memory, even after
an exception such as an OOM error or disk I/O error.  The test
harnesses are zealous to enforce this.</p>

<h2 id="test_coverage"><span>7. </span>Test Coverage</h2>

<p>The SQLite core, including the unix <a href="https://sqlite.org/vfs.html">VFS</a>,
has 100% branch test coverage under <a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3</a> in
its default configuration as measured by
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">gcov</a>.
Extensions such as FTS3 and RTree are excluded from this
analysis.</p>

<h2 id="statement_versus_branch_coverage"><span>7.1. </span>Statement versus branch coverage</h2>

<p>There are many ways to measure test coverage.  The most popular
metric is "statement coverage".  When you hear someone say that their
program as "XX% test coverage" without further explanation, they usually
mean statement coverage.  Statement coverage measures what percentage
of lines of code are executed at least once by the test suite.</p>

<p>Branch coverage is more rigorous than statement coverage.  Branch
coverage measures the number of machine-code branch instructions that
are evaluated at least once on both directions.</p>

<p>To illustrate the difference between statement coverage and
branch coverage, consider the following hypothetical
line of C code:</p>

<div><pre>if( a&gt;b &amp;&amp; c!=25 ){ d++; }
</pre></div>

<p>Such a line of C code might generate a dozen separate machine code
instructions.  If any one of those instructions is ever evaluated, then
we say that the statement has been tested.  So, for example, it might
be the case that the conditional expression is
always false and the "d" variable is
never incremented.  Even so, statement coverage counts this line of
code as having been tested.</p>

<p>Branch coverage is more strict.  With branch coverage, each test and
each subblock within the statement is considered separately.  In order
to achieve 100% branch coverage in the example above, there must be at
least three test cases:</p>

<ul>
<li> a&lt;=b
</li><li> a&gt;b &amp;&amp; c==25
</li><li> a&gt;b &amp;&amp; c!=25
</li></ul>

<p>Any one of the above test cases would provide 100% statement coverage
but all three are required for 100% branch coverage.  Generally speaking,
100% branch coverage implies 100% statement coverage, but the converse is
not true.  To reemphasize, the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html">TH3</a> test harness for SQLite provides the stronger form of
test coverage - 100% branch test coverage.</p>

<h2 id="coverage_testing_of_defensive_code"><span>7.2. </span>Coverage testing of defensive code</h2>

<p>A well-written C program will typically contain some defensive
conditionals which in practice are always true or always false.
This leads to a
programming dilemma:  Does one remove defensive code in order to obtain
100% branch coverage?</p>

<p>In SQLite, the answer to the previous question is "no".
For testing purposes, the SQLite source code defines
macros called ALWAYS() and NEVER().   The ALWAYS() macro
surrounds conditions
which are expected to always evaluate as true and NEVER() surrounds
conditions that are always evaluated to false.  These macros serve as
comments to indicate that the conditions are defensive code.
In release builds, these macros are pass-throughs:</p>

<div><pre>#define ALWAYS(X)  (X)
#define NEVER(X)   (X)
</pre></div>

<p>During most testing, however, these macros will throw an assertion
fault if their argument does not have the expected truth value.  This
alerts the developers quickly to incorrect design assumptions.

</p><div><pre>#define ALWAYS(X)  ((X)?1:assert(0),0)
#define NEVER(X)   ((X)?assert(0),1:0)
</pre></div>

<p>When measuring test coverage, these macros are defined to be constant
truth values so that they do not generate assembly language branch
instructions, and hence do not come into play when calculating the
branch coverage:</p>

<div><pre>#define ALWAYS(X)  (1)
#define NEVER(X)   (0)
</pre></div>

<p>The test suite is designed to be run three times, once for each of
the ALWAYS() and NEVER() definitions shown above.  All three test runs
should yield exactly the same result.  There is a run-time test using
the <a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/test_control.html">sqlite3_test_control</a>(<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/c_testctrl_always.html">SQLITE_TESTCTRL_ALWAYS</a>, ...) interface that
can be used to verify that the macros are correctly set to the first
form (the pass-through form) for deployment.</p>

<h2 id="forcing_coverage_of_boundary_values_and_boolean_vector_tests"><span>7.3. </span>Forcing coverage of boundary values and boolean vector tests</h2>

<p>Another macro used in conjunction with test coverage measurement is
the <tt>testcase()</tt> macro.  The argument is a condition for which
we want test cases that evaluate to both true and false.
In non-coverage builds (that is to say, in release builds) the
<tt>testcase()</tt> macro is a no-op:</p>



<p>But in a coverage measuring build, the <tt>testcase()</tt> macro
generates code that evaluates the conditional expression in its argument.
Then during analysis, a check
is made to ensure tests exist that evaluate the conditional to both true
and false.  <tt>Testcase()</tt> macros are used, for example, to help verify
that boundary values are tested.  For example:</p>

<div><pre>testcase( a==b );
testcase( a==b+1 );
if( a&gt;b &amp;&amp; c!=25 ){ d++; }
</pre></div>

<p>Testcase macros are also used when two or more cases of a switch
statement go to the same block of code, to make sure that the code was
reached for all cases:</p>

<div><pre>switch( op ){
  case OP_Add:
  case OP_Subtract: {
    testcase( op==OP_Add );
    testcase( op==OP_Subtract );
    /* ... */
    break;
  }
  /* ... */
}
</pre></div>

<p>For bitmask tests, <tt>testcase()</tt> macros are used to verify that every
bit of the bitmask affects the outcome.  For example, in the following block
of code, the condition is true if the mask contains either of two bits
indicating either a MAIN_DB or a TEMP_DB is being opened.
The <tt>testcase()</tt>
macros that precede the if statement verify that both cases are tested:</p>

<div><pre>testcase( mask &amp; SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB );
testcase( mask &amp; SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB );
if( (mask &amp; (SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB|SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB))!=0 ){ ... }
</pre></div>

<p>The SQLite source code contains 1184
uses of the <tt>testcase()</tt> macro.</p>

<h2 id="branch_coverage_versus_mc_dc"><span>7.4. </span>Branch coverage versus MC/DC</h2>

<p>Two methods of measuring test coverage were described above:
"statement" and "branch" coverage.  There are many other test coverage
metrics besides these two.  Another popular metric is "Modified
Condition/Decision Coverage" or MC/DC.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Condition/Decision_Coverage">Wikipedia</a>
defines MC/DC as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li> Each decision tries every possible outcome.
</li><li> Each condition in a decision takes on every possible outcome.
</li><li> Each entry and exit point is invoked.
</li><li> Each condition in a decision is shown to independently
     affect the outcome of the decision.
</li></ul>

<p>In the C programming language
where <b><tt>&amp;&amp;</tt></b> and <b><tt>||</tt></b>
are "short-circuit" operators, MC/DC and branch coverage are very nearly
the same thing.  The primary difference is in boolean vector tests.
One can test for any of several bits in bit-vector and still obtain
100% branch test coverage even though the second element of MC/DC - the
requirement that each condition in a decision take on every possible outcome -
might not be satisfied.</p>

<p>SQLite uses <tt>testcase()</tt> macros as described in the previous
subsection to make sure that every condition in a bit-vector decision takes
on every possible outcome.  In this way, SQLite also achieves 100% MC/DC
in addition to 100% branch coverage.</p>

<h2 id="measuring_branch_coverage"><span>7.5. </span>Measuring branch coverage</h2>

<p>Branch coverage in SQLite is currently measured
using <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html">gcov</a> with the "-b"
option.  First the test program is compiled using options
"-g -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage" and then the test program is run.
Then "gcov -b" is run to generate a coverage report.
The coverage report is verbose and inconvenient to read,
so the gcov-generated report is processed using
some simple scripts to put it into a more human-friendly format.
This entire process is automated using scripts, of course.

</p><p>Note that running SQLite with gcov is not a test of SQLite —
it is a test of the test suite.  The gcov run does not test SQLite because
the -fprofile-args and -ftest-coverage options cause the compiler to
generate different code.
The gcov run merely verifies that the test suite provides 100% branch test
coverage.  The gcov run is a test of the test - a meta-test.

</p><p>After gcov has been run to verify 100% branch test coverage,
then the test program is recompiled using delivery compiler options
(without the special -fprofile-arcs and -ftest-coverage options)
and the test program is rerun.
This second run is the actual test of SQLite.

</p><p>It is important to verify that the gcov test run
and the second real test run both give the same output.  Any
differences in output indicate either the use of undefined or
indeterminate behavior in the SQLite code (and hence a bug),
or a bug in the compiler.
Note that SQLite has, over the previous decade, encountered bugs
in each of GCC, Clang, and MSVC.  Compiler bugs, while rare, do happen,
which is why it is so important to test the code in an as-delivered
configuration.

<a name="mutationtests"></a>

</p><h2 id="mutation_testing"><span>7.6. </span>Mutation testing</h2>

<p>Using gcov (or similar) to show that every branch instruction is taken
at least once in both directions is a good measure of test suite quality.
But even better is showing that every branch instruction makes
a difference in the output.  In other words, we want to show
not only that every branch instruction both jumps and falls through but also
that every branch is doing useful work and that the test suite is able
to detect and verify that work.  When a branch is found that does not
make a difference in the output, that suggests that code associated with
the branch can be removed (reducing the size of the library and perhaps
making it run faster) or that the test suite is inadequately testing the
feature that the branch implements.

</p><p>SQLite strives to verify that every branch instruction makes a difference
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing">mutation testing</a>.
<a href="https://sqlite.org/th3.html#muttest">A script</a>
first compiles the SQLite source code into assembly language
(using, for example, the -S option to gcc).  Then the script steps through
the generated assembly language and, one by one, changes each branch
instruction into either an unconditional jump or a no-op, compiles the
result, and verifies that the test suite catches the mutation.

</p><p>
Unfortunately, SQLite contains many branch instructions that
help the code run faster without changing the output.
Such branches generate false-positives during mutation testing.
As an example, consider the following
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/artifact/55b5fb474?ln=55-62">hash function</a>
used to accelerate table-name lookup:

</p><div><pre>55  static unsigned int strHash(const char *z){
56    unsigned int h = 0;
57    unsigned char c;
58    while( (c = (unsigned char)*z++)!=0 ){     /*OPTIMIZATION-IF-TRUE*/
59      h = (h&lt;&lt;3) ^ h ^ sqlite3UpperToLower[c];
60    }
61    return h;
62  }
</pre></div>

<p>
If the branch instruction that implements the "c!=0" test on line 58
is changed into a no-op, then the while-loop will loop forever and the
test suite will fail with a time-out.  But if that branch is changed
into an unconditional jump, then the hash function will always return 0.
The problem is that 0 is a valid hash.  A hash function that always
returns 0 still works in the sense that SQLite still always gets the correct
answer.  The table-name hash table degenerates into a linked-list
and so the table-name lookups that occur while parsing SQL statements
might be a little slower, but the end result will be the same.

</p><p>
To work around this problem, comments of the form
"<code>/*OPTIMIZATION-IF-TRUE*/</code>" and
"<code>/*OPTIMIZATION-IF-FALSE*/</code>" are inserted into the SQLite
source code to tell the mutation testing script to ignore some branch
instructions.

<a name="thoughts1"></a>

</p><h2 id="experience_with_full_test_coverage"><span>7.7. </span>Experience with full test coverage</h2>

<p>The developers of SQLite have found that full coverage testing is an
extremely effective method for locating and preventing bugs.
Because every single branch
instruction in SQLite core code is covered by test cases, the developers
can be confident that changes made in one part of the code
do not have unintended consequences in other parts of the code.
The many new features and performance improvements that have been
added to SQLite in recent years would not have been possible without
the availability of full-coverage testing.</p>

<p>Maintaining 100% MC/DC is laborious and time-consuming.
The level of effort needed to maintain full-coverage testing
is probably not cost effective for a typical application.
However, we think that full-coverage testing is justified for a
<a href="https://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">very widely deployed</a> infrastructure library
like SQLite, and especially for a database library which by its very
nature "remembers" past mistakes.


<a name="dynamicanalysis"></a>

</p><h2 id="dynamic_analysis"><span>8. </span>Dynamic Analysis</h2>

<p>Dynamic analysis refers to internal and external checks on the
SQLite code which are performed while the code is live and running.
Dynamic analysis has proven to be a great help in maintaining the
quality of SQLite.</p>

<h2 id="assert"><span>8.1. </span>Assert</h2>

<p>The SQLite core contains 6754 <tt>assert()</tt>
statements that verify function preconditions and postconditions and
loop invariants.  Assert() is a macro which is a standard part of
ANSI-C.  The argument is a boolean value that is assumed to always be
true.  If the assertion is false, the program prints an error message
and halts.</p>

<p>Assert() macros are disabled by compiling with the NDEBUG macro defined.
In most systems, asserts are enabled by default.  But in SQLite, the
asserts are so numerous and are in such performance critical places, that
the database engine runs about three times slower when asserts are enabled.
Hence, the default (production) build of SQLite disables asserts.
Assert statements are only enabled when SQLite is compiled with the
SQLITE_DEBUG preprocessor macro defined.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://sqlite.org/assert.html">Use Of assert in SQLite</a> document
for additional information about how SQLite uses assert().</p>

<h2 id="valgrind"><span>8.2. </span>Valgrind</h2>

<p><a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> is perhaps the most amazing
and useful developer tool in the world.  Valgrind is a simulator - it simulates
an x86 running a Linux binary.  (Ports of Valgrind for platforms other
than Linux are in development, but as of this writing, Valgrind only
works reliably on Linux, which in the opinion of the SQLite developers
means that Linux should be the preferred platform for all software development.)
As Valgrind runs a Linux binary, it looks for all kinds of interesting
errors such as array overruns, reading from uninitialized memory,
stack overflows, memory leaks, and so forth.  Valgrind finds problems
that can easily slip through all of the other tests run against SQLite.
And, when Valgrind does find an error, it can dump the developer directly
into a symbolic debugger at the exact point where the error occurs, to
facilitate a quick fix.</p>

<p>Because it is a simulator, running a binary in Valgrind is slower than
running it on native hardware.  (To a first approximation, an application
running in Valgrind on a workstation will perform about the same as it
would running natively on a smartphone.)  So it is impractical to run the full
SQLite test suite through Valgrind.  However, the veryquick tests and
the coverage of the TH3 tests are run through Valgrind prior to every
release.</p>

<h2 id="memsys2"><span>8.3. </span>Memsys2</h2>

<p>SQLite contains a pluggable
<a href="https://sqlite.org/malloc.html">memory allocation subsystem</a>.
The default implementation uses system malloc() and free().
However, if SQLite is compiled with <a href="https://sqlite.org/compile.html#memdebug">SQLITE_MEMDEBUG</a>, an alternative
memory allocation wrapper (<a href="https://sqlite.org/malloc.html#memdebug">memsys2</a>)
is inserted that looks for memory allocation
errors at run-time.  The memsys2 wrapper checks for memory leaks, of
course, but also looks for buffer overruns, uses of uninitialized memory,
and attempts to use memory after it has been freed.  These same checks
are also done by valgrind (and, indeed, Valgrind does them better)
but memsys2 has the advantage of being much faster than Valgrind, which
means the checks can be done more often and for longer tests.</p>

<h2 id="mutex_asserts"><span>8.4. </span>Mutex Asserts</h2>

<p>SQLite contains a pluggable mutex subsystem.  Depending on
compile-time options, the default mutex system contains interfaces
<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/mutex_held.html">sqlite3_mutex_held()</a> and <a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/mutex_held.html">sqlite3_mutex_notheld()</a> that detect
whether or not a particular mutex is held by the calling thread.
These two interfaces are used extensively within assert() statements
in SQLite to verify mutexes are held and released at all the right
moments, in order to double-check that SQLite does work correctly
in multi-threaded applications.</p>

<h2 id="journal_tests"><span>8.5. </span>Journal Tests</h2>

<p>One of the things that SQLite does to ensure that transactions
are atomic across system crashes and power failures is to write
all changes into the rollback journal file prior to changing the
database.  The TCL test harness contains an alternative
<a href="https://sqlite.org/vfs.html">OS backend</a> implementation that helps to
verify this is occurring correctly.  The "journal-test VFS" monitors
all disk I/O traffic between the database file and rollback journal,
checking to make sure that nothing is written into the database
file which has not first been written and synced to the rollback journal.
If any discrepancies are found, an assertion fault is raised.</p>

<p>The journal tests are an additional double-check over and above
the crash tests to make sure that SQLite transactions will be atomic
across system crashes and power failures.</p>

<h2 id="undefined_behavior_checks"><span>8.6. </span>Undefined Behavior Checks</h2>

<p>In the C programming language, it is very easy to write code that
has "undefined" or "implementation defined" behavior.
That means that the code might work during development, but then give
a different answer on a different system, or when recompiled using different
compiler options.
Examples of undefined and implementation-defined behavior in
ANSI C include:
</p><ul>
<li>Signed integer overflow.  (Signed integer overflow does <u>not</u>
necessarily wrap around, as most people expect.)
</li><li>Shifting an N-bit integer by more than N bits.
</li><li>Shifting by a negative amount.
</li><li>Shifting a negative number.
</li><li>Using the memcpy() function on overlapping buffers.
</li><li>The order of evaluation of function arguments.
</li><li>Whether or not "char" variables are signed or unsigned.
</li><li>And so forth....
</li></ul>

<p>Since undefined and implementation-defined behavior is non-portable
and can easily lead to incorrect answers, SQLite works very hard to avoid it.
For example,
when adding two integer column values together as part of an SQL statement,
SQLite does not simply add them together using the C-language "+" operator.
Instead, it first checks to make sure the
addition will not overflow, and if it will, it does the addition using
floating point instead.

</p><p>To help ensure that SQLite does not make use of undefined or
implementation defined behavior, the test suites are rerun using
instrumented builds that try to detect undefined behavior.  For example,
test suites are run using the "-ftrapv" option of GCC.  And they
are run again using the "-fsanitize=undefined" option on Clang.  And
again using the "/RTC1" option in MSVC.  Then the test suites are rerun
using options like "-funsigned-char" and "-fsigned-char" to make sure
that implementation differences do not matter either.  Tests are then repeated
on 32-bit and 64-bit systems and on big-endian and little-endian systems,
using a variety of CPU architectures.
Furthermore, the test suites are augmented with many test cases that are
deliberately designed to provoke undefined behavior.  For example:
"<b>SELECT -1*(-9223372036854775808);</b>".

<a name="disopttest"></a>

</p><h2 id="disabled_optimization_tests"><span>9. </span>Disabled Optimization Tests</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/test_control.html">sqlite3_test_control</a>(<a href="https://sqlite.org/c3ref/c_testctrl_always.html">SQLITE_TESTCTRL_OPTIMIZATIONS</a>, ...) interface
allows selected SQL statement optimizations to be disabled at run-time.
SQLite should always generate exactly the same answer with optimizations
enabled and with optimizations disabled; the answer simply arrives quicker
with the optimizations turned on.  So in a production environment, one always
leaves the optimizations turned on (the default setting).</p>

<p>One verification technique used on SQLite is to run an entire test suite
twice, once with optimizations left on and a second time with optimizations
turned off, and verify that the same output is obtained both times.  This
shows that the optimizations do not introduce errors.</p>

<p>Not all test cases can be handled this way.  Some test cases check
to verify that the optimizations really are reducing the amount of
computation by counting the number of disk accesses, sort operations,
full-scan steps, or other processing steps that occur during queries.
Those test cases will appear to fail when optimizations are disabled.
But the majority of test cases simply check that the correct answer
was obtained, and all of those cases can be run successfully with and
without the optimizations, in order to show that the optimizations do not
cause malfunctions.</p>


<h2 id="checklists"><span>10. </span>Checklists</h2>

<p>The SQLite developers use an on-line checklist to coordinate testing
activity and to verify that all tests pass prior to each SQLite release.
<a href="https://sqlite.org/checklists/index.html">Past checklists</a>
are retained for historical reference.
(The checklists are read-only for anonymous internet viewers, but
developers can log in and update checklist items in their web
browsers.)
The use of checklists for SQLite testing and other development activities
is inspired by <i>
<a href="http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">The Checklist Manifesto</a>
</i>.</p>

<p>The latest checklists contain approximately 200 items that are
individually verified for each release.  Some checklist items only take
a few seconds to verify and mark off.  Others involve test suites
that run for many hours.</p>

<p>The release checklist is not automated: developers run each item on
the checklist manually.  We find that it is important to keep a human in
the loop.  Sometimes problems are found while running a checklist item
even though the test itself passed.  It is important to have a human
reviewing the test output at the highest level, and constantly asking
"Is this really right?"</p>

<p>The release checklist is continuously evolving.  As new problems or
potential problems are discovered, new checklist items are added to
make sure those problems do not appear in subsequent releases.  The
release checklist has proven to be an invaluable tool in helping to
ensure that nothing is overlooked during the release process.</p>


<h2 id="static_analysis"><span>11. </span>Static Analysis</h2>

<p>Static analysis means analyzing source code at compile-time to
check for correctness.  Static analysis includes compiler
warning messages and more in-depth analysis engines such as the
<a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">Clang Static Analyzer</a>.
SQLite compiles without warnings on GCC and Clang using
the -Wall and -Wextra flags on Linux and Mac and on MSVC on Windows.
No valid warnings are generated by the Clang Static Analyzer tool "scan-build"
either (though recent versions of clang seem to generate many false-positives.)
Nevertheless, some warnings might be generated by other
static analyzers.  Users are encouraged not to stress over these
warnings and to instead take solace in the intense testing of SQLite
described above.
</p>

<p>Static analysis has not been helpful in finding
bugs in SQLite.  Static analysis has found a few bugs in SQLite, but
those are the exceptions.  More bugs have been
introduced into SQLite while trying to get it to compile without
warnings than have been found by static analysis.</p>

<h2 id="summary"><span>12. </span>Summary</h2>

<p>SQLite is open source.  This gives many people the idea that
it is not well tested as commercial software and is perhaps unreliable.
But that impression is false.
SQLite has exhibited very high reliability in the field and
a very low defect rate, especially considering how rapidly it is evolving.
The quality of SQLite is achieved in part by careful code design and
implementation.  But extensive testing also plays a vital role in
maintaining and improving the quality of SQLite.  This document has
summarized the testing procedures that every release of SQLite undergoes
with the hope of inspiring confidence that SQLite is
suitable for use in mission-critical applications.</p>

The first CVE vulnerability has been assigned to a piece of the Linux kernel's Rust code.
</p><p>
Greg Kroah-Hartman <a href="https://social.kernel.org/notice/B1JLrtkxEBazCPQHDM">announced</a> that the first CVE has been assigned to a piece of Rust code within the mainline Linux kernel.
</p><p>
This first CVE for Rust code in the Linux kernel pertains to <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Rust-Binder-For-Linux-6.18">the Android Binder rewrite in Rust</a>. There is a race condition that can occur due to some noted unsafe Rust code. That code can lead to memory corruption of the previous/next pointers and in turn cause a crash.
</p><p>
This CVE for the possible system crash is for Linux 6.18 and newer since the introduction of the Rust Binder driver. At least though it's just a possible system crash and not any more serious system compromise with remote code execution or other more severe issues.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Containers are the universal path to production for most developers, and Docker has always been the steward of the ecosystem. Docker Hub has over 20 billion monthly pulls, with nearly 90% of organizations now relying on containers in their software delivery workflows. That gives us a responsibility: to help secure the software supply chain for the world.</p>



<p>Why? Supply-chain attacks are exploding. In 2025, they caused more than $60 billion in damage, tripling from 2021. No one is safe. Every language, every ecosystem, every build and distribution step is a target.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this reason, we launched Docker Hardened Images (DHI), a secure, minimal, production-ready set of images, in May 2025, and since then have hardened over 1,000 images and helm charts in our catalog. Today, we are establishing a new industry standard by making DHI freely available and open source to everyone who builds software. All 26 Million+ developers in the container ecosystem. DHI is fully open and free to use, share, and build on with no licensing surprises, backed by an Apache 2.0 license. DHI now gives the world a secure, minimal, production-ready foundation from the very first pull.</p>



<p>If it sounds too good to be true, here’s the bottom line up front: every developer and every application can (and should!) use DHI without restrictions. When you need continuous security patching, applied in under 7 days, images for regulated industries (e.g., FIPS, FedRAMP), you want to build customized images on our secure build infrastructure, or you need security patches beyond end-of-life, DHI has commercial offerings. Simple.</p>



<p>Since the introduction of DHI, enterprises like Adobe and Qualcomm have bet on Docker for securing their entire enterprise to achieve the most stringent levels of compliance, while startups like Attentive and Octopus Deploy have accelerated their ability to get compliance and sell to larger businesses.</p>



<p>Now everyone and every application can build securely from the first <span><code>docker build</code></span>. Unlike other opaque or proprietary hardened images, DHI is compatible with Alpine and Debian, trusted and familiar open source foundations teams already know and can adopt with minimal change. And while some vendors suppress CVEs in their feed to maintain a green scanner, Docker is <em>always </em>transparent, even when we’re still working on patches, because we fundamentally believe you should always know what your security posture is. The result: dramatically reduced CVEs (guaranteed near zero in DHI Enterprise), images up to 95 percent smaller, and secure defaults without ever compromising transparency or trust.</p>



<p>There’s more. We’ve already built Hardened Helm Charts to leverage DHI images in Kubernetes environments; those are open source too. And today, we’re expanding that foundation with Hardened MCP Servers. We’re bringing DHI’s security principles to the MCP interface layer, the backbone of every agentic app. And starting now, you can run hardened versions of the MCP servers developers rely on most: Mongo, Grafana, GitHub, and more. And this is just the beginning. In the coming months, we will extend this hardened foundation across the entire software stack with hardened libraries, hardened system packages, and other secure components everyone depends on. The goal is simple: be able to secure your application from <code><span>main()</span></code> down.&nbsp;</p>







<h2><br><strong>The philosophy of Docker Hardened Images</strong></h2>



<p>Base images define your application’s security from the very first layer, so it’s critical to know exactly what goes into them. Here’s how we approach it.</p>



<p>First: total transparency in every part of our minimal, opinionated, secure images.</p>



<p>DHI uses a distroless runtime to shrink the attack surface while keeping the tools developers rely on. But security is more than minimalism; it requires full transparency. Too many vendors blur the truth with proprietary CVE scoring, downgraded vulnerabilities, or vague promises about reaching SLSA Build Level 3.</p>



<p>DHI takes a different path. Every image includes a complete and verifiable SBOM. Every build provides SLSA Build Level 3 provenance. Every vulnerability is assessed using transparent public CVE data; we won’t hide vulnerabilities when we haven’t fixed them. Every image comes with proof of authenticity. The result: a secure foundation you can trust, built with clarity, verified with evidence, and delivered without compromise.</p>



<p>Second: Migrating to secure images takes real work, and no one should pretend otherwise. But as you’d expect from Docker, we’ve focused on making the DX incredibly easy to use. As we mentioned before, DHI is built on the open source foundations the world already trusts, Debian and Alpine, so teams can adopt it with minimal friction.&nbsp; We’re reducing that friction even more: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/dhi/migration/migrate-with-ai/" id="dkr_dockers-ai-assistant-84109" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Docker’s AI assistant</a> can scan your existing containers and recommend or even apply equivalent hardened images; the feature is experimental as this is day one, but we’ll quickly GA it as we learn from real world migrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly: we think about the most aggressive SLAs and longest support times and make certain that every piece of DHI can support that when you need it.</p>



<p>DHI Enterprise, the commercial offering of DHI, includes a 7-day commitment for critical CVE remediation, with a roadmap toward one day or less. For regulated industries and mission-critical systems, this level of trust is mandatory. Achieving it is hard. It demands deep test automation and the ability to maintain patches that diverge from upstream until they are accepted. That is why most organizations cannot do this on their own. In addition, DHI Enterprise allows organizations to easily customize DHI images, leveraging Docker’s build infrastructure which takes care of the full image lifecycle management for you, ensuring that build provenance and compliance is maintained. For example, typically organizations need to add certificates and keys, system packages, scripts, and so on. DHI’s build service makes this trivial.</p>



<p>Because our patching SLAs and our build service carry real operational cost, DHI has historically been one commercial offering. But our vision has always been broader. This level of security should be available to everyone, and the timing matters. Now that the evidence, infrastructure, and industry partnerships are in place, we are delivering on that vision. That is why today we are making Docker Hardened Images free and open source.</p>



<p>This move carries the same spirit that defined Docker Official Images over a decade ago. We made them free, kept them free, and backed them with clear docs, best practices, and consistent maintenance. That foundation became the starting point for millions of developers and partners.</p>



<p>Now we’re doing it again. DHI being free is powered by a rapidly growing ecosystem of partners, from Google, MongoDB, and the CNCF delivering hardened images to security platforms like Snyk and JFrog Xray integrating DHI directly into their scanners. Together, we are building a unified, end-to-end supply chain that raises the security bar for the entire industry.<strong><br></strong></p>

        <h4>“Docker’s move to make its hardened images freely available under Apache 2.0 underscores its strong commitment to the open source ecosystem. Many CNCF projects can already be found in the DHI catalog, and giving the broader community access to secure, well-maintained building blocks helps us strengthen the software supply chain together. It’s exciting to see Docker continue to invest in open collaboration and secure container infrastructure.”</h4>

<h2><strong>A Secure Path for Every Team and Business</strong></h2>



<p>Everyone now has a secure foundation to start from with DHI. But businesses of all shapes and sizes often need more. Compliance requirements and risk tolerance may demand CVE patches ahead of upstream the moment the source becomes available. Companies operating in enterprise or government sectors must meet strict standards such as FIPS or STIG. And because production can never stop, many organizations need security patching to continue even after upstream support ends.</p>



<p>That is why we now offer three DHI options, each built for a different security reality.</p>



<p><strong>Docker Hardened Images: </strong>Free for Everyone. DHI is the foundation modern software deserves: minimal hardened images, easy migration, full transparency, and an open ecosystem built on Alpine and Debian.</p>



<p><strong>Docker Hardened Images (DHI) Enterprise: </strong>DHI Enterprise delivers the guarantees that organizations, governments, and institutions with strict security or regulatory demands rely on. FIPS-enabled and STIG-ready images. Compliance with CIS benchmarks. SLA-backed remediations they can trust for critical CVEs in under 7 days. And those SLAs keep getting shorter as we push toward one-day (or less) critical fixes.</p>



<p>For teams that need more control, DHI Enterprise delivers. Change your images. Configure runtimes. Install tools like curl. Add certificates. DHI Enterprise gives you unlimited customization, full catalog access, and the ability to shape your images on your terms while staying secure.</p>



<p><strong>DHI Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS):</strong> ELS is a paid add-on to DHI Enterprise, built to solve one of software’s hardest problems. When upstream support ends, patches stop but vulnerabilities don’t. Scanners light up, auditors demand answers, and compliance frameworks expect verified fixes. ELS ends that cycle with up to five additional years of security coverage, continuous CVE patches, updated SBOMs and provenance, and ongoing signing and auditability for compliance.</p>



<p>You can learn more about these options <a href="https://www.docker.com/products/hardened-images/" id="dkr_here-84109">here</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>Authors’ Notes</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>Christian Dupuis</strong></h3>



<p>Today’s announcement marks a watershed moment for our industry. Docker is fundamentally changing how applications are built-secure by default for every developer, every organization, and every open-source project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This moment fills me with pride as it represents the culmination of years of work: from the early days at Atomist building an event-driven SBOM and vulnerability management system, the foundation that still underpins Docker Scout today, to unveiling DHI earlier this year, and now making it freely available to all. I am deeply grateful to my incredible colleagues and friends at Docker who made this vision a reality, and to our partners and customers who believed in us from day one and shaped this journey with their guidance and feedback.</p>



<p>Yet while this is an important milestone, it remains just that, a milestone. We are far from done, with many more innovations on the horizon. In fact, we are already working on what comes next.</p>



<p>Security is a team sport, and today Docker opened the field to everyone. Let’s play.</p>



<h3><strong>Michael Donovan</strong></h3>



<p>I joined Docker to positively impact as many developers as possible. This launch gives every developer the right to secure their applications without adding toil to their workload. It represents a monumental shift in the container ecosystem and the digital experiences we use every day.</p>



<p>I’m extremely proud of the product we’ve built and the customers we serve every day. I’ve had the time of my life building this with our stellar team and I’m more excited than ever for what’s to come next.</p>

So they're actually most able to get the most out of them.”</em></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Fresh grads have grown up with new technology, so they can adapt quickly. Many of them learn AI-powered tools while studying or during internships. They tend to explore new features, find quick methods to write code, and figure out how to get the best results from AI agents.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com#sentiment-and-usage-ai-sel-prof-exp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey</a>, 55.5% of early-career developers reported using AI tools daily in their development process, higher than for the experienced folks.</p><p>This comfort with new tools allows them to work more efficiently. In contrast, senior developers have established workflows and may take more time to adopt. <a href="https://www.peoplemanagement.co.uk/article/1930418/half-gen-z-help-senior-colleagues-upskill-ai-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Recent research</a> shows that over half of Gen Z employees are actually helping senior colleagues upskill in AI.</p><h3><strong>2) Junior Developers Shouldn’t Be The Default Cost-Saving Move</strong></h3><p><strong>Second, junior staff are usually the least expensive employees.</strong></p><blockquote><em>“Number two, they're usually the least expensive because they're right out of college, and they generally make less. So if you're thinking about cost optimization, they're not the only people you would want to optimize around.”</em></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Junior employees usually get much less in salary and benefits, so removing them does not deliver huge savings. If a company is trying to save money, it doesn’t make that much financial sense.&nbsp;</p><p>So, when companies talk about increasing profit margins, junior employees should not be the default or only target. True optimization, Real cost-cutting means looking at the whole company because there are plenty of other places where expenses can be trimmed.</p><p>In fact, 30% of companies that laid off workers expecting savings <a href="https://myabcm.com/layoffs-the-cost-cutting-measure-that-could-sink-your-company" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ended up increasing expenses</a>, and many had to rehire later.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3) Removing Juniors Breaks the Talent Pipeline</strong></h3><p><strong>Third, companies need fresh talent.</strong></p><blockquote><em>“Three, at some point, that whole thing explodes on itself. If you have no talent pipeline that you're building and no junior people that you're mentoring and bringing up through the company, we often find that that's where we get some of the best ideas.”</em></blockquote><p>‍</p><p>Think of a company like a sports team. If you only keep veteran players and never recruit rookies, what happens when those veterans retire? You are left with no one who knows how to play the game.</p><p>Also, hiring people straight out of college brings new ways of thinking into the workplace. They have fresh ideas shaped by the latest trends, motivation to innovate.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, they form the foundation of a company’s future workforce. If a company decides to stop hiring junior employees altogether, it cuts off its own talent pipeline. Over time, that leads to fewer leaders to promote from within.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/talent/overcoming-the-tech-talent-shortage-amid-transformation.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deloitte report</a> also notes that the tech workforce is expected to grow at roughly twice the rate of the overall U.S. workforce, highlighting the demand for tech talent. Without a strong pipeline of junior developers coming in, companies might face a tech talent shortage.&nbsp;</p><p>When there are not enough junior hires being trained today, teams struggle to fill roles tomorrow, especially as projects scale.</p><h2><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2><p>This isn’t just corporate talk. As the leader of one of the world’s largest cloud computing platforms, serving everyone from Netflix to the U.S. intelligence agencies, Garman has a front-row seat to how companies are actually using AI.&nbsp;</p><p>And what he is seeing makes him worried that short-term thinking could damage businesses for years to come. Garman’s point is grounded in long-term strategy. A company that relies solely on AI to handle tasks without training new talent could find itself short of people.</p><p>Still, Garman admits the next few years will be bumpy. “Y<em>our job is going to change</em>,” he said. He believes AI will make companies more productive as well as the employees.&nbsp;</p><p>When technology makes something easier, people want more of it. AI enables the creation of software faster, allowing companies to develop more products, enter new markets, and serve more customers.</p><p>Developers will be responsible for more than just writing code, with faster adaptation to new technologies becoming essential. But he has a hopeful message in the end.</p><p>That’s why Geoffrey Hinton has advised that <a href="https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/ai-godfather-geoffrey-hinton-mid-level-coding-jobs">Computer Science degrees remain essential</a>. This directly supports Matt Garman’s point. Fresh talent with a strong understanding of core fundamentals becomes crucial for filling these higher-value roles of the future.</p><p>“<strong><em>I’m very confident in the medium to longer term that AI will definitely create more jobs than it removes at first,</em></strong>” Garman said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p id="313b7cb0-b065-46f1-aec5-90dc12fb1d13">There's no such thing as bad publicity, they say. Mozilla must be clinging to that aphorism for dear life right now, what with the internet meltdown that met its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/" target="_blank" data-url="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">announcement that Firefox is to become an AI browser</a> over the next three years.</p><p>Mozilla's new CEO, Anthony Enzor-DeMeo, is putting AI up front and centre. "Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions," he says.</p><p id="313b7cb0-b065-46f1-aec5-90dc12fb1d13-2">In mitigation, Enzor-DeMeo also says that the AI element in Firefox will be optional. "First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off," Enzor-DeMeo explains.</p><p>While Mozilla says that the transition to AI will be a three-year process, it's also clear that they don't plan to hang about. "We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths," Enzor-DeMeo goes on.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="702d6e5c-510b-43b3-913f-fb8a1b06828d"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">
