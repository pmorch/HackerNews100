    <div>
    <p>The Seattle City Council passed legislation Tuesday that would protect gig workers from being suddenly kicked off apps like Instacart or DoorDash.</p><p>It’s the first gig worker protection measure of its kind in the entire country.</p>
  </div>



    <div>
    <p>“This will help prevent homelessness, fight displacement, and allow families to meet their basic needs,” said Councilmember Lisa Herbold, who sponsored the bill.</p>
<p>According to Herbold, gig workers are being unfairly terminated, or "deactivated," as the companies call it. Workers told the council of being kicked off an app for refusing too many orders, for example, or for delays that are beyond their control.</p>
<p>“They actually open up the app to begin the work and they're not able to access it without receiving any advanced notice, much less an opportunity to dispute it,” Herbold told KUOW. "Often, there's an algorithm that makes the decision so it's not even a real person who's making the decision to deactivate the worker."</p>
<p>The ordinance sets a higher bar for when companies can “deactivate” workers. Not taking enough orders is not considered an acceptable reason. The law also requires the companies to give 14 days notice of termination.</p>
<p>The move is part of a broader effort to protect non-unionized gig workers by labor advocates including the group Working Washington and their allies on the Seattle City Council. Other recent Seattle laws raised the minimum wage for app-based workers and provided sick time and benefits.</p>

  </div>



  





    <div>
    <p>“We need to really make sure that we're passing good labor protections for people who aren't legally considered employees but they're doing important work in our communities,” Herbold said.</p><p>After pushback from the app companies, the original draft of the bill was revised to include exceptions for "egregious behavior" that could, for example, pose a danger to customers. In those cases, workers can still be deactivated quickly.</p><p>In the end, the measure passed the council 6-2, with council members Sara Nelson and Alex Pedersen voting against it. Both said one reason for their no vote is that the ordinance includes workers for “marketplace network company apps,” such as Rover and TaskRabbit, where gig workers set their own rates and contract directly with people in their homes. Other gig-worker laws that passed recently in the city excluded those workers, but this one did not, Nelson said.</p><p>The measure goes next to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Technology news outlet <em>CNET</em> has deleted thousands of older articles from its site, telling staff the deletions will improve its Google Search ranking, according to an internal memo. The news was <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cnet-deletes-thousands-old-articles-google-search-seo-1850721475">first reported by <em>Gizmodo</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>Gizmodo</em> reports that, since July, thousands of articles have been removed from <em>CNET. </em>In the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23903730-faq-on-cnet-content-pruning-aug-2023">memo</a>, <em>CNET </em>says that so-called content pruning “sends a signal to Google that says CNET is fresh, relevant and worthy of being placed higher than our competitors in search results.” Stories slated to be “deprecated” are archived using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, and authors are alerted at least 10 days in advance, according to the memo.</p><p>“Removing content from the site is not a decision we take lightly. Our teams analyze many data points to determine whether there are pages on CNET that are not currently serving a meaningful audience. These metrics include page views, backlink profiles and the amount of time that has passed since the last update,” the memo reads.</p><p>A comparison between Wayback Machine archives from 2021 and <em>CNET</em>’s own on-site article counter shows that hundreds — and in some cases, thousands — of stories have disappeared from each year stretching back to the mid-1990s. Data for 2022 and 2023 wasn’t available. Red Ventures, a private equity-backed marketing firm that owns <em>CNET,</em> didn’t immediately respond to questions about the exact number of stories that have been removed.</p><p>Red Ventures has applied a ruthless SEO strategy to its slate of outlets, which also includes The Points Guy, Healthline<em>, </em>and Bankrate<em>. </em>In January, <em>Futurism </em>reported that <em>CNET</em> had been quietly using artificial intelligence tools to produce articles — part of an expansive <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562966/cnet-ai-written-stories-red-ventures-seo-marketing">AI-driven SEO maneuver</a> in which generative AI tools were used to create content that could carry affiliate ads. In the wake of that revelation and resulting errors on AI-generated stories, Red Ventures temporarily paused the content and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23750761/cnet-ai-generated-stories-policy-update">overhauled its AI policy</a>. <em>CNET </em>staff <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23723959/cnet-union-red-ventures-tech-editorial-independence-ai-writing">unionized</a> in May, citing the need for more control over how generative AI tools are used and how the site monetizes its work. <em>(Disclosure:&nbsp;The Verge’s&nbsp;editorial staff is also unionized with the&nbsp;Writers Guild&nbsp;of America, East.)</em></p><p>Red Ventures and <em>CNET </em>justify the content pruning by pointing to Google Search’s ranking algorithm, saying the process will “improve SEO rankings and drive more meaningful user engagement.” As <em>Gizmodo </em>points out, removing a chunk of your archives is not inherently a good SEO strategy — Google has <a href="https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1689018769782476800">said</a> its guidance doesn’t encourage the practice, though SEO experts told <em>Gizmodo </em>that it can be beneficial for sites if done carefully. </p><p>Red Ventures appears to be undeterred. According to the memo, <em>CNET</em> will be subject to regular “content pruning” going forward, at least once a year.</p></div></div>]]></description>

				<p>Now that Java 21 is features complete (Rampdown Phase Two at the day of writing), it’s time to walk through all the functionalities that bring to us, developers, this new version.</p>
<p>This article is part of a series on <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/tag/whatsnew/">what’s new on the last versions of Java</a>, for those who wants to read the others, here are the links: <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-20-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 20</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-19-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 19</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-18-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 18</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-17-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 17</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-16-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 16</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-15-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 15</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-14-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 14</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-13-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 13</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-12-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 12</a>, <a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-11-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 11</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/java-10-quoi-de-neuf/">Java 10,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.loicmathieu.fr/wordpress/informatique/les-nouveautes-de-java-9-pour-les-developeurs/">Java 9</a>.</p>
<p>Java 21 is the new Long Term Support (LTS) version , which means it will be supported for two years. Given the number of JEPs (Java Enhancement Proposals) it contains – no fewer than 15 – it’s clear that this is a version rich in new features. But perhaps the most important (not to say exciting) one is the finalization of virtual threads! Virtual threads are lightweight threads with low creation and scheduling costs, making it easier to write concurrent applications. We’ll have to wait for the ecosystem to support them, but virtual threads will make Java relevant for highly concurrent applications in memory-constrained environments.</p>
<h2>JEP 430 – String Templates (Preview)</h2>
<p>Many languages support string interpolation. String interpolation is a string literal containing expressions as well as text literals.</p>
<p>For example, in Kotlin, <code>"$x plus $y equals ${x + y}"</code> is a string containing the expressions <code>$x</code>, <code>$y</code>, and <code>${x + y}</code>, which will be replaced by their textual values. These values are said to be interpolated within the character string. This interpolation is carried out from the variables and enables operations between variables (in this case, an addition).</p>
<p>The problem with interpolation is that it’s dangerous as a global feature, because it doesn’t allow for validation or sanitization when constructing the final string. This exposes it, for example, to SQL or JavaScript injections.</p>
<p>In Java, String Templates offer string interpolation with validation and sanitization via a template processor.</p>
<p>A template processor takes a template, then interpolates the template to an object of a specific type; so from a template, you can interpolate a <code>String</code>, or a <code>PreparedStatement</code>, or a <code>JSONObject</code>, … As it is possible to have several processors, each can implement a validation step if required.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how to use the String Template <code>STR</code>, which has no specific validation and can be used to replace string concatenation:</p>
<pre>String firstName = "Loïc";
String lastName  = "Mathieu";
String helloWorld  = STR."Hello \{firstName} \{lastName}";
</pre>
<p>In Java, expressions are defined by <code>\{expression}</code>, and calling a template processor is done via its name, in this case FMT, which is a constant of the <code>StringTemplate</code> interface that will have been previously imported via a static import.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of discussion around the choice of the expression format. Due to the existence of many libraries using $, # or {} as expression delimiters, the choice was for a format that is not valid outside String Templates: <code>String s = "Hello \{firstName} \{lastName}"</code> does not compile. This distinguishes String Templates from simple Strings.</p>
<p>The standard library includes three template processors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>RAW</code>: processor that does not interpolate character strings, enables low-level manipulations.</li>
<li><code>STR</code>: processor that interpolates a character string to another character string via simple concatenation.</li>
<li><code>FMT</code>: processor that interpolates a character string to another character string, allowing expressions to be formatted via a <a title="Formatter API doc" href="https://download.java.net/java/early_access/jdk21/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Formatter.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formatter</a>, for example <code>FMT."%05d\{x} + %05d\{y} = %05d\{x + y}";</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can create your own processors by implementing the <code>StringTemplate.Processor</code> interface.</p>

<h2>JEP 431 – Sequenced Collections</h2>
<p>Java’s Collection API has seen an addition in Java 21 of a magnitude not seen for many, many releases!</p>
<p>Java collections don’t have a type representing an ordered sequence of elements, Java 21 fills this gap by introducing the <code>SequencedCollection</code>, <code>SequencedSet</code> and <code>SequencedMap</code> interfaces. These interfaces provide methods for adding, modifying or deleting elements at the beginning or end of the collection, as well as for iterating over a collection in reverse order.</p>
<p>Here’s the <code>SequencedCollection</code> interface:</p>
<pre>interface SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt; {
    SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; reversed();
    void addFirst(E);
    void addLast(E);
    E getFirst();
    E getLast();
    E removeFirst();
    E removeLast();
}
</pre>
<p>The <code>reversed()</code> method will return a view of the collection in reversed order; a modification to the original collection will impact the reversed view.</p>
<p><code>SequencedSet</code> is a set that is also a <code>SequencedCollection</code>, here is its interface:</p>
<pre>interface SequencedSet&lt;E&gt; extends Set&lt;E&gt;, SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; {
    SequencedSet&lt;E&gt; reversed();
}
</pre>
<p><code>SequencedMap</code> is a map whose entries are ordered, here is its interface:</p>
<pre>interface SequencedMap&lt;K,V&gt; extends Map&lt;K,V&gt; {
    SequencedMap&lt;K,V&gt; reversed();
    SequencedSet&lt;K&gt; sequencedKeySet();
    SequencedCollection&lt;V&gt; sequencedValues();
    SequencedSet&lt;Entry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt; sequencedEntrySet();
    V putFirst(K, V);
    V putLast(K, V);
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; firstEntry();
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; lastEntry();
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; pollFirstEntry();
    Entry&lt;K,V&gt; pollLastEntry();
}
</pre>
<p>These new interfaces have been integrated into the existing Collection API class hierarchy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/cr.openjdk.org/~smarks/collections/SequencedCollectionDiagram20220216.png?resize=640%2C356&amp;ssl=1" alt="Java Collection API hierarchy" width="640" height="356" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Note that some of the most widely used implementations of the Collection API: <code>ArrayList</code>, <code>LinkedList</code>, <code>LinkedHashMap</code> and <code>LinkedHashSet</code> are now sequential collections.</p>

<h2>JEP 443 – Unnamed Patterns and Variables Preview)</h2>
<p>This new feature of the Java language allows you to use <code>_</code> as an unnamed pattern or variable. The aim is to use <code>_</code> to denote a pattern or variable that is useless, the compiler will then make sure that the variable is really unused because it has no name.</p>
<p>Within Java’s pattern matching, <code>_</code> can be used as an unnamed pattern, for example in an instanceof: <code>instanceof Point(_, int y)</code>; or as an unnamed pattern variable, for example in an instanceof: <code>instanceof Point(int _, int y)</code> or in a switch: <code>case Box(GreenBall _)</code>.</p>
<p><code>_</code> can also be used to denote an unnamed variable that can neither be read nor written; as it has no name, several unnamed variables can be used in the same scope.</p>
<p>You can use an unnamed variable:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a local variable inside a statement,</li>
<li>As a resource inside a try-with-resource,</li>
<li>In a for loop header (basic or enhanced),</li>
<li>As an exception in the parameter of a catch block,</li>
<li>As a parameter of a lambda expression.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few examples from JEP 443:</p>
<pre>// enhanced for loop
int acc = 0;
for (Order _ : orders) {
    if (acc &lt; LIMIT) { 
        ... acc++ ...
    }
}

// block statement 
Queue&lt;Integer&gt; q = ... // x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...
while (q.size() &gt;= 3) {

   var y = q.remove();
   var _ = q.remove();
   ... new Point(x, y) ...

// catch block
String s = ...

    int i = Integer.parseInt(s);
    ... i ...

try (var _ = ScopedContext.acquire()) {
    ... no use of acquired resource ...
}

// lamdba parameter
stream.collect(Collectors.toMap(String::toUpperCase, _ -&gt; "NODATA"))
</pre>
<p>This feature, although it may seem small, is in fact a much-awaited feature that can greatly improve code readability and avoid possible bugs by clearly denoting that a variable should not be used. We can only regret that, for the moment, it is not possible to use <code>_</code> as a parameter of an overloaded method.</p>

<h2>JEP 445: Unnamed Classes and Instance Main Methods (Preview)</h2>
<p>The aim of this new feature is to make Java easier to learn and simpler to use for simple cases, such as writing a simple main method.</p>
<p>Let’s take a “Hello World” in Java as an example:</p>
<pre>public class HelloWorld { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>To write “Hello World” in the console, you need to know the principles of class, method, visibility and the static modifier, as well as the very specific signature of the main method in Java: the method that will be executed as the program’s entry point.</p>
<p>First change: enable a non-static (instance method), non-public main method with no parameters:</p>
<pre>class HelloWorld { 
    void main() { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
</pre>
<p>Second change: the introduction of unnamed classes:</p>
<pre>void main() {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
</pre>
<p>An unnamed class is a class in a .class file that has no class declaration and cannot be called by another class, but can contain methods and fields. It is contained in an unnamed package.</p>
<p>These two new features, although targeted at developers learning Java, can greatly facilitate the writing of small programs in Java by reducing the ceremony around writing the entry point of a Java program.</p>
<p>Discussions around this feature also covered the case of <code>System.out.println()</code> (as well as reading from the console) and possible simplifications. It’s possible that a future version of Java will include simplifications in this area.</p>
<p>More information in the <a title="JEP 445" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 445</a>.</p>
<h2>Features coming out of preview</h2>
<p>The following features comes out of preview (or incubator module) are now standard features:</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="JEP 440" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 440</a> – Record Patterns: enhance Java’s pattern matching with record patterns, which deconstruct a record into its attributes.</li>
<li><a title="JEP 441" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/441" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 441</a> – Pattern Matching for switch: allows you to make a switch on the type of a variable (including enum, record and array), and extract a local variable of the corresponding type.</li>
<li><a title="JEP 444" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 444</a> – Virtual Threads: sometimes also called green threads or lightweight threads; these are lightweight threads, with low creation and scheduling costs, which make it easier to write concurrent applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on these, please refer to my previous articles.</p>
<h2>Features that remain in preview</h2>
<p>The following features remain in preview (or in the incubator module).</p>
<ul>
<li><a title="JEP 442" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 442</a> – Foreign Function &amp; Memory API (Third Preview): improvements following feedback from the preview. Native memory segments are now managed via a new <code>Arena</code> API.</li>
<li><a title="JEP-448" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/448" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP-448</a> – Vector API: sixth incubation of this feature. This new version includes bugfixes and performance improvements.</li>
<li><a title="JEP 446" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/446" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 446</a> – Scoped Values (Preview): previously in incubation, enable the sharing of immutable data within and between threads.</li>
<li><a title="JEP 453" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 453</a> – Structured Concurrency (Preview): previously in incubation, a new API to simplify the writing of multi-threaded code by allowing multiple concurrent tasks to be treated as a single processing unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>For details on these, please refer to my previous articles.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>Various additions to the JDK:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Character.isEmoji()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiPresentation()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiModifier()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiModifierBase()</code>, <code>Character.isEmojiComponent()</code>, <code>Character.isExtendedPictographic()</code>.</li>
<li><code>Math.clamp()</code> and <code>StrictMath.clamp()</code>: clamp a value between two bounds min and max.</li>
<li><code>StringBuilder.repeat()</code>: joint a character or string a certain number of times.</li>
<li><code>HttpCLient</code> now implements <code>AucoCloseable</code> and can therefore be used more easily in a try-with-resources block.</li>
<li><code>Locale.availableLocales()</code>: returns the list of installed locales.</li>
<li><code>Collections.shuffle(List, RandomGenerator)</code>: performs random permutations of the elements of a list with a <code>RandomGenerator</code>.</li>
<li><code>String.splitWithDelimiters()</code> and <code>Pattern.splitWithDelimiters()</code>: splits a string including delimiters.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the new JDK 21 APIs can be found in <a title="The Java Version Almanac – New APIs in Java 21" href="https://javaalmanac.io/jdk/21/apidiff/20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Java Version Almanac – New APIs in Java 21</a>.</p>
<h2>Internal changes, performance, and security</h2>
<p>The ZGC Garbage Collector becomes generational, so it can separate the heap into several zones according to the age of the objects. To enable this feature set the command line option <code>-XX:+ZGenerational</code>. This Garbage Collector was created to support very large heaps (several terrabytes) with very low pauses (on the order of milliseconds). The addition of a generational heap enables it to support different workloads while consuming fewer resources. More information in the <a title="JEP 439" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/439" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 439</a>.</p>
<p>On the security front, Java now supports Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), an encryption technique for securing symmetric keys using public-key cryptography. More information in the <a title="JEP 452" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 452</a>.</p>
<p>The Windows 32-bit port for x86 CPUs has been deprecated for removal in a future release. Windows 10, the last version of Windows supporting 32-bit architectures, will reach end-of-life in October 2025. Depreciating and then removing the Windows 32-bit port will simplify the Open JDK build and reduce its maintenance cost. More information in the <a title="JEP 449" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 449</a>.</p>
<p>Dynamic Java agent loading is now deprecated for removal. If used, it will display a WARNING in the JVM log. Java agent loading at application startup remains supported, it is only dynamic loading after application startup that is deprecated. The aim is to improve the integrity of the JVM, as an agent can modify the code of an application, loading it after JVM startup is a security risk. More information in the <a title="JEP 451" href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JEP 451</a>.</p>
<p>On the performance side, Per Minborg has made improvements in the conversion between primitives (long to int, for example) via the use of <code>VarHandle</code> in place of existing binary calculations. As these conversion operations are widely used within Java serialization, this one takes advantage of them and sees a performance improvement of almost 5%. Other JDK APIs and many libraries also use these conversions and will see their performance improve. More information in Per Minborg’s article: <a href="https://minborgsjavapot.blogspot.com/2023/01/java-21-performance-improvements.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Java 21: Performance Improvements Revealed</a>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the high number of features included in Java 21, we can expect Java 22 to be a stabilization release. I hope that some features will be out of preview in Java 22 (which should be the case for the Foreign Function &amp; Memory API), particularly Scoped Values and Structured Concurrency, which complement Virtual Threads by making it easier to write concurrent applications.</p>
<p>To find all the changes in Java 21, refer to the <a title="release notes" href="https://jdk.java.net/21/release-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release notes</a>.</p>

        <p dir="auto">Over the years, I have received many proposals to monetize this extension so I think I'll just start posting them here for fun (but not for profit). The main reason I continue to maintain this extension is because I can hardly trust others to not fall for one of these offers. I'm fortunate to have a job that pays well enough to allow me to keep my moral compass and ignore all of these propositions. I realize that not everyone has the same financial security so hopefully this thread would shed some light on what kind of pressure is put on extension developers.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">09/28/2015</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Hope this message finds you well.</p>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em> and I’m a Strategic Partnerships Manager at <em>redacted</em> - monetization platform for browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you since I came across the extension 'Hover Zoom+' at Chrome Store; I consider your product can help you bring profit by means of collaborating together.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to suggest a potential partnership between our companies that will significantly increase your revenues.</p>
<p dir="auto">Are you interested in discussing our offer in more details?</p>
<p dir="auto">Hope for positive feedback and ongoing cooperation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Please forgive my persistence, I’m following up to an email I sent to you last week in regards to your Chrome browser extension.  I am still interested in speaking with you about monetizing your anonymous user data.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple things I want to insure you know.</p>
<p dir="auto">Monetizing anonymous user data is happening on almost every website we visit - you may be leaving alot of money on the table by not monetizing your anonymous user data.  Try dowloading Ghostry to see for yourself.<br>
Affiliate commissions may pay you as much as 20% but is not always scaleable.<br>
Chrome will deactive extenions that violate their ‘single purpose’ policy by working with ad injection companies - <em>redacted</em> does not, will not inject ads, but uses anonymous user data to provide more relevant advertising through NAI and IAB approved ad delivery networks.<br>
Top advertisers across all verticals are very interested in targeting high quality intent data derived from browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">Again, if your data is strong, it has the potential to produce a significant new revenue stream for you and your business.  Here is a link to our self-serve Developer Dashboard: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I’d be happy to provide additional information should you have any questions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em>, I’m a co-founder and CEO of <em>redacted</em> – a Market intelligence service for ecommerce. (like similarweb, only for ecommerce).</p>
<p dir="auto">We are revolutionizing the way ecommerce data is being generated and consumed</p>
<p dir="auto">We are building a user panel of several of millions of users worldwide and are looking for top quality partners with substantial user base to enhance our panel.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are working in a very similar manner to <em>redacted</em>, providing you with an easy to integrate SDK to collect anonymous data.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are already working with <em>redacted</em>’s SDK the integration should take no more than a couple of minutes.<br>
There is no collision with any other monetization tool you might be working with today.<br>
Our SDK holds no monetization or any other form of user interaction and it does not interfere with the user experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is also important to state that we collect no personal data and only store information relevant for online shopping trends.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can help you monetize your extension in a simple and non-intrusive manner.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to discuss potential integration with you and see how we can work together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Will you be available today/tomorrow for a short call to explain things?</p>

<h3 dir="auto">05/11/2016</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I’m sure you get business proposals all the time, so I’ll get straight to the point. I hope what I’m proposing is a little different and might actually interest you. I like Hover Zoom+ as a great alternative to it’s bigger brother Hover Zoom that lost its glamour over the last couple of months.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're conducting a DNS error research and we’re interested in small amounts of anonymous data that you might be able to provide via your Chrome extension. Our research has been going on for years and Google has never had the slightest problem with it.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compatible with Google’s strict policies</li>
<li>No personal user data</li>
<li>No ads, no malware</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The data we’re interested in are basically just DNS errors:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>NXD – Non Existent Domain - the domain that a user entered that resulted in a DNS error.</li>
<li>A time stamp – when it happened.</li>
<li>GEO – where it happened (USA, UK, RU etc.).</li>
<li>A unique randomly generated user ID (can be hashed, not traceable back to the user). Please, don’t confuse this with the user IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">And that’s all. You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. There’s a lot of different ways we can do this. We pay on a monthly basis. The payments depend on user GEOs, but it would be in thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is this worth at least a brief discussion? Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A while back I reached out to you regarding a DNS error research our company conducts. Hover Zoom+ would be an ideal medium for our research. In return, this could become a solid new revenue stream for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our method has been going on for years and we’ve never had the slightest problem with Google. We pay regularly on a monthly basis. For you it would be in tens of thousands of dollars per year - the amount depends on your users base and data quality.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you’re concerned about including third party scripts, there’s still a lot of ways we can make this work.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please let me know if this is worth a brief discussion to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">05/26/2016</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I'm interested in your chrome extension Hover Zoom+.</p>
<p dir="auto">I want to buy it with the transfer of your google account or without it which means the transfer of the chrome extension in my account.<br>
I propose the price 14 500 $.<br>
We can bargain if your users are active.</p>

<p dir="auto">I'm <em>redacted</em>, regional manager of <em>redacted</em> advertisement network.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>redacted</em> is PopUnder ad network operating since 2015.  We are currently offering your extension/plugin a private deal with advanced payments for CPM / impressions, and we are ready to discuss the prices so that our offer could be more profitable for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">PopUnder is different from PopUp and other types of online ads. PopUnder opens in a new tab/window in one click. The ad appears as a separate tab or window behind the main browser window (that is why it’s called PopUnder) and doesn’t have a negative impact on the user’s perception of the website and user experience. PopUnder doesn’t distract the user from your website. All technical settings (number of clicks, time etc) are open to discussion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to see how PopUnder operates you can try our demo: <em>redacted</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Advertisements correspond with your target audience so that you monetize your site to the fullest extent. You will decide how often PopUnder ads  will appear. The ads can be moderated and you can disable or remove any kind of advertisement you dislike.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our ads are currently running on: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Our platform comprises 3000+ advertisers.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main ad categories are e-commerce (online shopping), software, gaming.</p>

Our partners have gained access to a new and simple revenue stream without interfering with your user experience or gathering PII.

</blockquote>
<h3 dir="auto">4/30/2018</h3>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you regarding your browser extension (I love the simplicity of it :) ). I think there is an opportunity for a cooperation between us.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve developed <em>redacted</em> – an extension that lets users support highly effective, research-backed charities while shopping online (with no extra costs). It’s somewhat similar to Amazon Smile program. It works with 1000+ shops including eBay, Microsoft, Etsy, Barnes&amp;Noble, Aliexpress. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative one child gets a year supply of medicine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Would you be interested in placing a recommendation for <em>redacted</em> after user installs your extension? I could pay $1 per new user that comes from your page.</p>
<p dir="auto">That way you can unintrusively monetize your software and help raise money for great causes at the same time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let me know what you think.</p>

<p dir="auto">Short story.<br>
I'm tired of offline business, and exploring new ways of money making on internet.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today I stop my views at the browser extension as the most profitable and undiscovered niches, unfortunately it requires product with audience to start.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm not a developer but have an extremely wish to check what it is. Basically I found already team who provides monetization solution for ext, and now I'm looking to buy one.</p>
<p dir="auto">I thought perhaps you got mind to sell yours. Let me know what you think.</p>

    <h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>MLC-LLM makes it possible to compile LLMs and deploy them on AMD GPUs using <strong>ROCm</strong> with competitive performance. More specifically, AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX gives <strong>80%</strong> of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 4090 and <strong>94%</strong> of the speed of NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 3090Ti for Llama2-7B/13B. Besides ROCm, our Vulkan support allows us to generalize LLM deployment to other AMD devices, for example, a SteamDeck with an AMD APU.</p>

<p>

</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>There have been many LLM inference solutions since the bloom of open-source LLMs.
Most of the performant inference solutions are based on CUDA and optimized for NVIDIA GPUs.
In the meantime, with the high demand for compute availability, it is useful to bring
support to a broader class of hardware accelerators. AMD is one potential candidate.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-on-the-hardware-and-software">Discussion on the Hardware and Software</h3>

<p>From the spec comparison, we can see that AMD’s RX 7900 XTX is a good match for NVIDIA’s RTX 4090 and RTX 3090 Ti.</p>
<ul>
  <li>All have 24GB memory, which means they can fit models of the same size.</li>
  <li>All have similar memory bandwidth.</li>
  <li>4090 has 2x more FP16 performance than 7900 XTX, while 3090 Ti has 1.3x more FP16 performance than 7900 XTX.
Lantency sensitive LLM inference is mostly memory bound, so the FP16 performance is not a bottleneck here.</li>
  <li>RX 7900 XTX is 40% cheaper than RTX 4090.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is harder to compare the price of 3090Ti as that was a previous generation. We put it here as a reference point to provide more information.
At a high-level, we can find that AMD 7900 XTX is comparable to RTX 3090 Ti from the hardware spec perspective.</p>

<p>Hardware is not necessarily the reason why AMD lagged in the past.
The main gaps were due to a lack of software support and optimizations for the relevant models.
There are two factors in the ecosystem that starts to bring changes to the picture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AMD is trying to catch up with investments in the ROCm stack.</li>
  <li>Emerging technologies like machine learning compilation helps to reduce overall cost of
more universal software support across backends.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this post, we are taking a deep look at how well AMD GPUs can do compared to a performant CUDA solution on NVIDIA GPUs as of now.</p>

<h2 id="machine-learning-compilation-for-rocm">Machine Learning Compilation for ROCm</h2>

<p><strong>What is machine learning compilation (MLC).</strong> Machine learning compilation is an emerging technology that compiles and automates the optimization of machine learning workloads.
Instead of crafting specific kernels for each individual backend like ROCm or CUDA, an MLC solution automatically generate code for different backends.
Here we leverage MLC-LLM, an ML compilation-based solution that offers <strong>high-performance universal deployment</strong> for LLMs.
MLC-LLM builds on top of Apache TVM Unity, a machine-learning compilation stack that offers productive Python-first development and universal deployment.
MLC-LLM brings state-of-the-art performance for a wide variety of backends, including CUDA, Metal, ROCm, Vulkan, and OpenCL, spanning both server-class GPUs to mobile (iPhone and Android). At a high level, the framework lets the user take open language models and compiles it with Python-based workflow, including APIs to transform computational graphs, optimize the layout and scheduling of GPU kernels, and deploys it natively on platforms of interest.</p>

<!-- MLC-LLM leverages machine learning compilation, an emerging technology that compiles and automates
optimization of machine learning programs. Specifically, we build a solution on Apache TVM unity, a deep-learning compiler that utilizes a unified IR to represent the DL model at both graph and operator levels throughout the compilation stages. It allows *customizable model construction, composable model transformation, and transferable kernel optimization* for ML engineers to effectively customize and reuse ML compilation pipelines, reducing the effort of repeatedly implementing the same mechanism for different models or backends. TVM Unity also implements universal deployment runtime that enables developers to deploy the solution to the programming language and platform of their choice.

What makes TVM Unity different and even more productive is the Python-first development flow, where we can

* Inspect and modify the computational graph in Python
* Compose IR transformations in Python
* Inspect and write self-defined operators in Python, and compile them with other pre-defined operators composable in the same computational graph
* Write the kernel optimization generically in Python and the compiler generates shader language codes for different backends accordingly, which allows us to transfer the kernel optimization techniques across backends

We are leveraging the Python-first development, and universal deployment solution to quickly enable high-performance AMD GPU
support less than one human week's effort. -->

</p>

<p><strong>MLC for AMD GPUs and APUs.</strong> There are several possible ways to support AMD GPU: ROCm, OpenCL, Vulkan, and WebGPU. ROCm stack is what AMD recently push for and has a lot of the corresponding
building blocks similar to the CUDA stack. Vulkan is the latest graphics standard and offers the widest range of support across GPU devices. WebGPU is the latest web standard that allows the computation to run on web browsers. While there are so many possible ways, few ML software solutions that build for solutions other than CUDA, largely due to the engineering cost to replicate a stack for a new hardware or GPU
programming model. We support automatic code generation without having to recraft GPU kernels for each and bring support to all these ways.
This being said, the performance still depends on how good the low-level GPU runtimes are and their availability in each platform.
We pick ROCm for Radeon 7900 XTX and Vulkan for Steamdeck’s APU.
We find that ROCm stack works out of the box. Thanks to the productive Python-based development pipeline in TVM unity,
we spent a few more hours to further bring an optimized version. We made the following things to bring ROCm support:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reuse the whole MLC pipeline for existing targets (such as CUDA and Metal), including memory planning, operator fusion, etc.</li>
  <li>Reuse a generic GPU kernel optimization space written in TVM TensorIR and re-target it to AMD GPUs.</li>
  <li>Reuse TVM’s ROCm code generation flow that generates low-level ROCm kernels through LLVM.</li>
  <li>Finally, export generated code as a shared or static library that can be invoked by CLI, Python and REST APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="benchmark-with-mlc-python-package">Benchmark with MLC Python Package</h2>

<p>We benchmarked the Llama 2 7B and 13B with 4-bit quantization. And we measure the decoding performance by setting a single prompt token and generating 512 tokens.
All the results are measured for single batch inference.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://blog.mlc.ai/img/amd/perf.png" width="90%">
</p>

<!-- |             | AMD Radeon™ RX 7900 XTX | NVIDIA ® GeForce RTX™ 4090 | NVIDIA ® GeForce RTX™ 3090 Ti |
|:-----------:|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|  Llama 2 7B |       130.9 toks/s      |        159.4 toks/s        |          138.5 toks/s         |
| Llama 2 13B |       74.7 toks/s       |         90.7 toks/s        |          80.3 toks/s          | -->

<p>For single batch inference performance, it can reach 80% of the speed of NVIDIA 4090 with the release of ROCm 5.6.</p>

<p><strong>Note on the comparison</strong>: How strong is our CUDA baseline? It is the state-of-the-art for this task to the best of our knowledge.
  We believe there is still room for improvements, e.g. through better attention optimizations.
  As soon as those optimizations land in MLC, we anticipate both AMD and NVIDIA numbers improved.
  If such optimizations are only implemented on NVIDIA side, it brings the gap up from 20% to 30%.
  And therefore, we recommend putting 10% error bar when looking at the numbers here</p>

<h3 id="try-it-out-yourself">Try it out yourself</h3>

<p>We provide prebuilt wheels and instructions to reproduce our results on your own devices. To run those benchmarks, please ensure that you have an AMD GPU with ROCm 5.6 or above running in Linux.

<p>Let us also look into a broader set of AMD devices,
more specifically, SteamDeck equipped with an AMD APU.
While the GPU VRAM available in ROCm is capped to 4GB in BIOS,
the Mesa Vulkan driver has robust support that allows the buffer to go
beyond the cap using unified memory up to 16GB,
which is sufficient to run 4bit-quantized Llama-7B.</p>

<h2 id="discussion-and-future-work">Discussion and Future Work</h2>

<p>Hardware availability has become a pressing issue in the age of generative AI.
ML compilation can help by bringing high-performance universal deployment across hardware backends.
Given the presented evidences, with the right price and availability, we think AMD GPUs can start to be useful for LLM inference.</p>

<p>Our study focuses on consumer-grade GPUs as of now. Based on our past experiences,
MLC optimizations for consumer GPU models usually are generalizable to cloud GPUs (e.g. from RTX 4090 to A100 and A10g).
We are confident that the solution generalizes across cloud and consumer-class AMD and NVIDIA GPUs,
and will also update our study once we have access to more GPUs. We also encourage the community to build solutions
on top of the MLC universal deployment flow.</p>

<p>This post is part of the ongoing effort that brings high-performance universal deployment via MLC.
We are also actively working on several areas that can generalize our study.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enable batching and multi-GPU support;</li>
  <li>Integration with PyTorch ecosystem;</li>
  <li>Empowering more quantization and model architectures;</li>
  <li>Bringing in more automatic optimizations on more hardware backends.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our final takeaway is that machine learning system engineering is a continuous problem.
NVIDIA is still leading the field with continuous innovations, and we anticipate the landscape to
change with new hardware such as H100 and, more importantly, software evolutions. So the key question is not only
about building the right solution now but also how to catch up and bring ML engineering to new platforms continuously.
Productivity in machine learning engineering is the key here. Thanks to the Python-first ML compilation development flow,
we get ROCm-optimized support in a few hours. We anticipate related approaches to become even more useful as we explore more
ideas to bring universal deployments and solve the hardware availability problem.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><main><p>Postgres wasn't always the cool kid. It didn't emerge from millions of dollars of VC funding, it didn't have a team of DevRel evangelists championing it, it simply started and evolved. Postgres just passed the 25 year milestone as an open source project. With the upcoming release of Postgres 16 in coming months, we thought we'd pause for a minute and take a look back at Postgres and how it got to where it is today.</p>
<p>If for some reason you've been living under a rock and are unfamiliar with Postgres, give a read on our write-up of <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/why-postgres">Why Postgres</a>. Or if you simply want the bullet points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reliable and safe for your data</li>
<li>Extremely feature rich</li>
<li>No central owner means no lock-in</li>
<li>More than "just a database", it's a data platform</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ingres —&gt; Postgres95 —&gt; PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>Postgres’ origin roots started with the Ingres project. It originally started at the University of California Berkeley as Ingres (<strong>IN</strong>teractive&nbsp;<strong>G</strong>raphics&nbsp;<strong>RE</strong>trieval&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>ystem) under the direction of Michael Stonebraker. They changed courses and funded a relational database project instead.</p>
<p>The original language was QUEL, not even SQL. ANSI&nbsp;officially set a preference for SQL in 1986 and many of the relational projects moved that direction. SQL support was added in 1995 when Postgres95 was released.</p>
<p>Development moved out of academia in 1996 when the first version of PostgreSQL was released as 6.0 and the PostgreSQL Global Development Team was established, which is the same leadership group currently heading the project.</p>
<p>The foundational <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/postgresql-concurrency">MVCC</a> that makes Postgres what it is was released in 1999 with Postgres 6.5.</p>
<h3>Postgres starts to grow up</h3>
<p>Today there are a lot of things you take for granted when working with a reliable database. In the year 2000, Postgres began its journey of growing up. The press release (if they did those things back then) might have read: Postgres JOINS other database ranks with foreign keys and join support.</p>
<p>The rest of the early 2000s brought more key foundational pieces, with a primary focus on being a reliable database and SQL, you got features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write-Ahead-Log (WAL)</li>
<li>Outer joins</li>
<li>TOAST</li>
<li>More than 4b transactions</li>
<li>Drop column</li>
<li>Schemas</li>
<li>IPv6 <em>Postgres was early on this one</em> 😉</li>
</ul>
<p>One of my favorite things in observing some of the details from back in 2000 is some of the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.0/release.htm#AEN18262">names that contributed</a> that are still pillars in the Postgres community today. These folks range from my colleague Tom Lane, to Josh Berkus, Bruce Momjian, Hiroshi Inoue and Peter Eisentraut.</p>
<p>But it’s not just the commits, show up at a <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/2023/">PgCon</a> or <a href="https://2023.pgconf.eu/">PGConfEU</a> and you’ll see some of the very same people pictured <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/files/community/conference06/conference_group.html">here</a> at the PostgreSQL anniversary summit in 2006 (so almost 20 years ago) including Magnus Hagander, Stephen Frost, Bruce Momjian, Devrim Gunduz, Oleg Bartunov, David Fetter, Robert Treat, Simon Riggs, Joe Conway, Tom Lane, Andrew Dunstan, Dave Page, Jean-Paul Argudo, and so many many more (and to anyone I missed, personal apologies you can point out I missed you in person at the next conference).</p>
<p>Ned Lilly said, "Everyone who is involved with Postgres feels really good about its prospects. It's not much of a stretch for them to [think] there's a market opportunity here. Oracle is monolithic, so it's not a leap to visualize [success]. The open-source database wave is starting to crest."</p>
<p>The above statement was made back in 2000, in association with the first Postgres company <strong>Great Bridge.</strong> Ned got it right, but was he 5 years, 10 years, or 15 years too early? We will never know as it was a dotcom casualty, and not long after that statement that the company <a href="https://www.notion.so/Zipline-zipline-demos-replicated-de6781664d5643c799af165e7afb5b5b?pvs=21">shutdown</a> in 2001. And if you hadn’t noticed a slight nod in the naming of <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/products/crunchy-bridge">Crunchy Bridge</a> to some PostgreSQL history, well now you know.</p>
<h3>Postgres continuing to mature</h3>
<p>As we get later into the 2000s and hit 2005, Postgres could be viewed as a fairly reliable database. With richer transaction support, broad SQL support, and pieces like WAL and VACUUM improvements, if you were an early adopter you started to trust it for production workloads. It was trustworthy, but still had some ways to go in terms of ease of use.</p>
<p>At this point in time we start to see a mix of features with multiple different themes that could be pointed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concurrent index creation</li>
<li>Warm standby servers</li>
<li>Query language improvements</li>
<li>All the data types - <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/strings-to-arrays">Arrays</a>, UUID, ENUM, XML</li>
<li>Two phase commit</li>
<li>A richer role system</li>
</ul>
<p>We still saw the same set of folks involved since early days, but others started to contribute headlining features. Some themes would emerge. As always more SQL support and better performance, embracing Postgres as an extensible database with new data types. Personally, I think the powerful reporting capabilities really made Postgres a game changer. In 2009 with Postgres 8.4 we got <strong><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/ctes-and-window-functions">window functions and common table expressions</a> (CTEs)</strong>, <em>with those in place I personally would never look back to another database</em>.</p>
<p>With Postgres as a solid foundation, around this time we'd start to see its imprint on the broader data ecosystem. Because of the solid code base but also its permissible licensing, many companies took Postgres and began to fork it. In the early to late 2000s the first thing that most of these companies would do is add MPP support to Postgres so it could target more OLAP focused workloads. When you couple that with support for things like window functions and CTEs, you have something new and powerful without having to build it from the ground up. This type of product could shave years off the time it takes to mature as a database. Many of those original forks aren't still around today, but some live on in other products...</p>
<ul><li>Aster Data → Acquired by Teradata</li>
<li>Truviso → Acquired by Cisco</li>
<li>Netezza → Acquired by IBM</li>
<li>Greenplum → Acquired by EMC</li>
<li>ParAccel → never acquired but effectively became RedShift</li></ul>
<h2>Postgres marches on</h2>
<p>Despite some proliferation of Postgres forks, Postgres kept doing what it had always done – just keep moving forward.</p>
<h3>Postgres 9.0 and 9.1 - 2000</h3>
<p><em>If you ask <a href="https://www.twitter.com/craigkerstiens">me</a></em>, this is the start of Postgres becoming cool. Support for things like listen/notify (pub-sub from your database) and hstore (a key/value data type) really didn't fit the mold of stodgy old relational databases. Upgrades finally became easier with support for <code>pg_upgrade</code>. We started to get more than just your standard B-Tree index with the arrival of GIN and GiST indexes.</p>
<p>Extensions were always part of Postgres but with some refactors in the integration they became much more readily available to users. And we saw the development of the Postgres foreign data wrapper so you could connect disparate Postgres databases.</p>
<p>Not just the old boring data types and columns and relations. Yet, all of it was built on the same ACID-compliant, trustworthy base.</p>
<h3>JSON (made you look) - 2012</h3>
<p>If the world hadn't taken notice of Postgres by now you were in for a wake up call. With the big data wave starting to cool off, but the rise of NoSQL databases (Mongo and Couchbase), it was clear developers wanted a different way of working with their data. Postgres listened, but then sort of cheated with its JSON support. In 9.2 it was JSON validation, but thrown into a text field. In reality we’d have to wait two more years before credible JSON support inside Postgres.</p>
<p>But. That didn’t stop people from starting to take notice. With the rise of Heroku for easy app deployment, Heroku Postgres being the default database, the tides from shared hosting of MySQL databases and your VPS for apps to PaaS, and more dedicated database infrastructure were growing.</p>
<h3>JSON for real, for real - 2014</h3>
<p>Postgres 9.3 was great and all, we got lateral joins, updatable foreign tables, checksums, and more. But 9.4, we got better JSON in the <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/playground/basics-of-jsonb">JSONB</a> data type. This was a binary representation of JSON on disk, this meant GIN indexes could allow you to more easily index your data without having to index on very specific JSON functions. JSONB is still a data type and feature that blows minds when people first hear about it.</p>
<p>Postgres isn’t only for app developers wanting shiny features. Logical decoding laid the groundwork for future years of easier change data capture (<a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-change-data-capture-with-debezium">CDC</a>) in Postgres. Refreshing materialized views allowed for richer reporting use cases. Background workers enabled more functionality and creative use cases in particular for extensions.</p>
<p>It was around that 9.3 timeline that Amazon announced support at Re:Invent for PostgreSQL support on RDS. Having been at most Re:Invents and being in the room, it is the only one I can recall a complete standing ovation from the audience. The speaker was noticeably thrown off by the duration of the applause, this wasn’t Amazon announcing a new thing it was them caving in to constant customer requests.</p>
<h3>9.5, 9.6, 10 - 2016</h3>
<p>At this point we started to get to the point where headline features were less common, instead we see a theme of steady performance improvements and a continuation to enhance existing features. JSONB got support for inline updates, and we started to see more parallel execution come in. But it wasn’t all small updates, depending on your needs there may have been a major feature in here that you’d been dying for. A few highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/a-postgresql-row-level-security-primer-creating-large-policies">Row level security</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/data-to-go-postgres-logical-replication">Logical replication</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/native-partitioning-with-postgres">Table partitioning</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This marching forward over several year was still largely the result of individual contributors. We also saw some concerted efforts of companies investing in particular areas like EnterpriseDB (focusing on Oracle compatibility), 2ndQuadrant (focusing on replication), Postgres Pro (focusing on JSONB), and Crunchy Data (focusing on security and cloud native).</p>
<h3>Extensions - There all along, but a new resurgence</h3>
<p>Postgres extensions are like libraries, they change Postgres behavior without contributing to the main code. Postgres had long shipped with contrib extensions, some of these were heavily used and adopted… hstore was the key/value store that people loved before JSONB arrived in Postgres. <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/tentative-smarter-query-optimization-in-postgres-starts-with-pg_stat_statements">pg_stat_statements</a> got some major improvements making it easily one of the most valuable extensions in Postgres.</p>
<p>Outside of contrib, PostGIS moved in parallel to Postgres, transforming Postgres into the world’s most powerful and feature rich geospatial database. It wasn’t just a one trick pony, it introduced new operators, new functions, and data types. For a while PostGIS was the highlight example, first we saw some clever new extensions arrive like <a href="https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/high-compression-metrics-storage-with-postgres-hyperloglog">HyperLogLog</a>. Then we saw entire companies be built around this idea of extending Postgres, first Citus, then Timescale, and now a plethora of companies.</p>
<h2>So when was it?</h2>
<p>At its core maybe it has always been the same as it is today, a reliable database you can trust – after all isn’t that what you want in a database? And yet, other new shiny things may capture your attention for a short time only for you to come back to the reliable stable workhorse we’ve had for over 20 years.</p>
<p>Was it Heroku making it the default so every Rails developer just started with Postgres? Has to be given some credit.</p>
<p>Even today, people are still shocked to learn of the rich JSON support in Postgres, and it’s been there for over 10 years now.</p>
<p>The richness of its SQL support, the continued performance improvements and flexibility in how your work with your data can’t be dismissed.</p>
<p>My <strong>personal</strong> belief, had it not been for the combination of Heroku and JSON support there wouldn’t have been pressure for the hyperscalers to add support – had the hyperscalers not supported it you’d simply pick the more available and accessible thing.</p>
<p><em>But without the continued improvement on performance and features with a steady release cycle and focus on quality it would have never had the chance. To that the credit always goes to the developers and committers that contribute often thankless work for making Postgres the solid piece of software it is.</em></p></main><section><img alt="Craig Kerstiens" src="https://www.crunchydata.com/build/_assets/craig-kerstiens.png-JNJT356V.webp" loading="lazy"></section></section></article></div></div>]]></description>

Celebrating holidays — </span><em>all holidays</em><span> — and spreading a little joy and cheer from the company (and reminding people how cool Linux is in the process).  So much fun.</span></p><p><span>The one thing we had never done, as a company, is make any mention of any Jewish holiday.  Not once, </span><em><strong>not ever</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>Well, no big deal.</p><p>Being a Jewish man, I can come up with something easily enough!  So, in 2015, I drafted and published a very small “Happy Hanukkah” post that went out on SUSE Social Media (which I controlled 100% of for many years).</p><p>It was short, simple, pleasant.</p><p>Immediately after, I received instruction (handed down from the head of Marketing, a few steps above me on the totem pole, at SUSE) to delete the “Happy Hanukkah” posts.</p><p><span>I was also instructed — explicitly — to leave all content related to every other holiday (Christmas, etc.) online.  </span><strong>The only holiday that was to be removed was the Jewish one.</strong></p><p>So I did what any good little corporate boy would do… I deleted the posts that sounded a bit too “Jew-y”.  And left all the other holiday content in place.  As instructed.  Did it make me happy as Jew?  No.  It did not.</p><blockquote><p><span>Fun side note: Within mere </span><em><strong>minutes</strong></em><span> of deleting all of the content that referenced a Jewish holiday… an email went out to SUSE employees.  Encouraging us all to sing Christmas carols.  At the company office.  Not joking.</span></p></blockquote><p>Right about now you might be thinking to yourself, “SUSE — a German company — is forbidding the mentioning of Jewish holidays?  That’s not a good look.”  And, well, you wouldn’t be alone in having that thought.</p><p>Obviously I raised a concern about this through the proper channels within SUSE.</p><p>My immediate manager did the right thing… and raised my concerns up the chain of command.</p><p><strong>That manager was promptly fired</strong><span>.  And, needless to say, the issue was not addressed.</span></p><p>A new manager was hired for my team.  After a short period of time, I brought up the whole “SUSE bans mentioning of Jews” issue to this manager as well.  And, once again, my manager did the right thing and raised the issue up the chain of command.</p><p><strong>That manager was, also, promptly fired.</strong></p><p>At which point the head of SUSE Marketing — who issued the “No Jewish Holidays” rule, was given a significant promotion.</p><blockquote><p><span>This is a good moment to mention how </span><em><strong>crazy good</strong></em><span> my performance within SUSE was.  Not only was I the most recognized name and face within the company… I was personally responsible for starting, writing, and driving some of the most successful campaigns in SUSE history.  SUSE’s financial results reflect my insanely good performance.  Literally off the chart.</span></p></blockquote><p>So, what happened next?  I was reprimanded and moved off my team.  Then denied a promised pay raise.  At which point multiple false statements (provably so) were made about me internally by upper management.</p><p>In short:</p><p><strong>The Jew that raised concerns about the German Linux company discriminating against Jews?  Punished.  Significantly.  And any manager that inquired about the discrimination was quickly fired.</strong></p><p>I stayed with the company.  I wanted to make it work.</p><p>So I raised the issue again.  To everyone in the chain of command — all the way up to the CEO.</p><p><span>To my delight, investigation was started.  Huzzah!  </span><em><strong>An investigation!  </strong></em><span>With how extensively everything was documented, surely this would help resolve the issue!</span></p><p><span>After the investigation drug on for what seemed like an eternity, I was eventually informed that no discrimination, </span><em>of any kind</em><span>, had occurred.</span></p><p><em><strong>Say, what now?!</strong></em></p><p>The evidence of discrimination was overwhelming.  The documentation (including emails detailing everything) was extensive and verifiable.  In fact, SUSE never (not once) disagreed with any of the facts… they simply didn’t think what they did was wrong.  (Even though it is under both US and German law.)</p><p>Obviously, I asked to see the results of the investigation — because, clearly, something was wrong here.  Something shady was happening.  I was told, point blank, that I would not be shown any notes or information from the investigation.  Period.  No exceptions.</p><p>No apology for discriminating against Jews.  Nor for discriminating against, and punishing, me.  Nobody that committed (the well documented) discrimination was disciplined in any way (in fact, they were promoted and praised).</p><p>I was told that I simply needed to be happy about it.</p><p>The annual conference for SUSE is known as SUSECON.</p><p>And me, being the person that controlled all of SUSE social media (and being the most high profile face within the company)… I kinda needed to be there.</p><p><span>SUSECON was schedule to occur… during the Jewish High Holy Days (the week between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur).  With the closing event occurring on Yom Kippur… the holiest day of the year.  A day when Jews absolutely </span><em><strong>do not work</strong></em><span>.</span></p><p>The management of SUSE knew all of this.  I know they knew all this… because we had talked about it many times.</p><p>And they certainly knew I was Jewish (see this entire article up until now).</p><p>There are two possibilities here:</p><ol><li><p>This was done on purpose, with malice, directed at me and the other Jewish employees of SUSE.</p></li><li><p>This was done with profound disregard for Jewish employees of SUSE.</p></li></ol><p>Those are the only two options.  Because I also know that many other dates were on the table that worked better.</p><p>Think about this for a moment…</p><blockquote><p>What if SUSECON had been scheduled on Christmas morning?</p><p>What if a devout Christian was told to delete ALL content that mentioned Christmas… but leave all Jewish and Islamic content online (and then even make more of it)?</p><p>What if that Christian raised this as an issue and then was reprimanded, passed over for raises, moved out of his/her team?</p><p>What if every manager of that Christian was fired right after raising the issue internally?</p><p>What if that Christian was told "we looked into it and it's all fine, you're wrong, go back to work... and we won't tell you details of our investigation"...?&nbsp;</p><p>Replace the word "Christian" with "Muslim", "LGBT", etc.  How does that read to you?</p><p>Classic, obvious, well documented, text book discrimination.</p></blockquote><p>What is truly mind-blowing to me: is that SUSE leadership knowingly did all of this… even though it hurt the company tremendously.</p><p>What does that suggest?  That discriminating against Jews — or covering up the fact that some of their employees had done so — was more important to SUSE than achieving corporate goals.</p><p>As time went on I began hearing more and more stories like mine.</p><p>Times when SUSE did things (sometimes large, sometimes small) that made Jews within the company feel uncomfortable.  Sometimes far more than simply “uncomfortable”.</p><p>I can’t speak for those people.  Those stories are theirs to tell.  But I have independently corroborated some of them.  And, should those individuals ever choose to speak out, I will be available to provide supporting documentation and support.</p><p>Despite all of this… I kept trying to fix things internally.</p><p>I didn’t speak about the discrimination publicly.  Despite me having a large platform — and despite the fact that I, specifically, report on Linux companies… I kept quiet.  In part out of a sense of loyalty to my friends within the company… and a genuine affection for the SUSE brand (it is the oldest Linux company, after all).</p><p><span>After </span><em><strong>years</strong></em><span> of attempting to resolve the issue… to help SUSE stop discriminating against Jews… </span></p><p>In 2017, after months of SUSE intimidating me into silence… including what I perceived as threats from their lawyers, I agreed to leave the company and not talk about these issues publicly.  They made sure I was afraid to tell my story.</p><blockquote><p><span>Just to drive home how high profile I was within the company — and how valuable I was for them — </span><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lunduke-makes-return-to-journalism-300554544.html" rel="">SUSE had to issue a press release when I left</a><span>.  That sort of thing is usually only done for departing CEOs.</span></p><p>My coworkers asked me to supply a quote for the press release… and I did so.  Begrudgingly and under more than a little duress.  A quote that was about as vague as you can get (and certainly did not address the real reason for my departure).</p></blockquote><p><span>Agreeing to not talk about these issues was a profound mistake on my part.  What I should have done is to </span><em>immediately</em><span> (once it was clear that SUSE would not fix their problems) tell the whole world what SUSE did.  And, quite honestly, SUSE should not have pressured me into agreeing to such a thing.  Their actions were deeply unethical.  And cruel.</span></p><p>It is now 2022.  The fifth year since SUSE threatened me into silence and, effectively, forced me out of the company.</p><p>In the years since, SUSE has changed hands and gotten a new CEO.</p><p>After the new CEO was appointed, I reached out to her.  In a kind way, I let her know that I had been forced to leave the company after discrimination against Jews (and a policy of forbidding public discussion of Jews).  And that I wanted her to be aware of the past issues so that she could make sure they don’t happen to others going forward.</p><p>The new CEO of SUSE responded by blocking me on Twitter.</p><p>Which was weird.</p><blockquote><p>Later, after I called the SUSE CEO on the strangeness of being blocked… she unblocked me.  Still.  Quite odd.</p></blockquote><p>Why do I bring all of this up now — nearly 5 years later?</p><p>Because this last week I spoke to someone at SUSE… who let me know of similar, current, goings on within the company.  And I want people within SUSE, who may be currently being discriminated against because they are Jewish, to know that they are not alone.  And that if they need help in telling their stories… I am here.</p><p>I am not a litigious man.  I operate under the simple notion that sunlight is the best disinfectant.</p><p>Would I like an apology?  You bet.  That would be nice (and certainly warranted).</p><p>Do I expect one?  No.  I do not.</p><p>If me publishing my own, personal, story of discrimination simply helps to put a stop to any possible future discrimination of Jews (or anyone else for that matter)?  That’ll be a good result.</p><blockquote><p>“Aren’t you afraid that SUSE will come after you, legally, because you told your story of discrimination?”</p></blockquote><p>Yes.  I am.  Very much so.</p><p>When I was forced out of SUSE, it was made clear to me that they would not allow me to tell other people what they had done.  (Which is funny, considering they also told me that what they had done was not a bad thing… if their actions are not bad… why would they not want people to know about it?)</p><p>What I have written here is (part of) my personal story.  If SUSE decides to try to intimidate me further… it should be noted that I have a great deal of documentation related to SUSE’s discrimination of me because I am a Jewish man.</p><p><span>My records are </span><strong>extensive</strong><span> and </span><strong>easily verifiable</strong><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p>“What would you like SUSE to do about all of this?”</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, a good person (or company) would simply apologize and try to not do the same, discriminatory things going forward.</p><p>Note: I did not name any names in this recounting of my story.  I am not seeking to harm anyone’s career (even those who sought to harm mine because I am Jewish).  I am not asking for anyone to be punished or fired in any way.</p><p>I tried to work with SUSE for multiple years to fix what they did.  Then I waited for half a decade, after leaving the company, to see some sort of attempt to make up for it.  Not only have I put forth a tremendous amount of (good faith) effort to help SUSE… I also gave the company many, many years more time than they needed to make amends.</p><p>What would be wonderful: If SUSE wants to reach out to me to help them to make sure they don’t discriminate against Jews going forward… I would gladly offer my advice to them and applaud them for taking a positive step forward.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

We’re the co-founders of Refine (<a href="https://github.com/refinedev/refine">https://github.com/refinedev/refine</a>), an open-source platform for developing enterprise web applications rapidly. In one year since launch we have 15K active developers each month, and over 5K projects in production. Among the 5,000+ projects deployed to production, we see a lot of admin panels, dashboards, B2B portals and SAAS interfaces.</p><p>Check out our online generator at (<a href="https://refine.dev/#playground">https://refine.dev/#playground</a>) to create a custom Refine application and download it.</p><p>Before starting refine, we spent five years as a consultancy company building internal-facing applications for enterprise clients. We have seen many complex use cases where the demanded flexibility was much higher than what existing low-code/no-code solutions provide. Moving away from rigid architectures and pre-made components that are difficult to customize, developers tend to start from the scratch. This results in a significant waste of time and resources.</p><p>In order to find a sweet spot between “starting from scratch” and higher level solutions,  we started working on refine. After a couple of iterations, we came up with a “headless” solution, separating the UI-layer completely from the rest of the frontend logic. This allowed us to support multiple UI frameworks and custom designs out of the box.</p><p>We understand the importance of frontend developers working with the stack and tools they love and are familiar with. So, we have built our project creation wizard that allows developers to mix and match their technology stack when creating a project.</p><p>After 1.5 years of development with the great support of the open-source community, Refine has become a mature framework that allows developers to rapidly build enterprise applications and have 100% control over their projects.</p><p>While remaining unobtrusive, Refine still saves a lot of development resources by eliminating repetitive tasks such as CRUD operations, state management, routing, authentication, access control, and i18n. It’s also backend-agnostic and works with any APIs or services.</p><p>The best way to start Refine development is visiting our extensive documentation at (<a href="https://refine.dev/docs/">https://refine.dev/docs/</a>). Here, you can also find tutorials and real-life examples to use as a starting point for your use case.</p><p>We had one successful Show HN earlier this year (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34515128">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34515128</a>), and have since had several major releases and added many more features.</p><p>Recently, we've released our enterprise edition featuring deployments, built-in security, backend integrations and auto-generated UI's. By expanding Refine's capabilities beyond the frontend, the enterprise edition offers a complete solution for the internal tooling requirements of larger organizations. To get more information, please see our pricing page: <a href="https://refine.dev/pricing/">https://refine.dev/pricing/</a>.</p><p>If you have any questions, ideas or suggestions please share them with us.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>I don’t want to self-host, and even worse: I think most individuals shouldn’t host services for others. Yet, I am self-hosting services and <a href="https://ergaster.org/work#deployment">I even teach people how to do it</a>.</p>
<p>Have I turned cynical, or is there a rationale behind it? Let’s cover what hosting services really means and why it makes sense to do it nonetheless.</p>
<h2 id="hosting-services-is-a-responsibility">Hosting services is a responsibility</h2>
<p>In this article, I’m only going to consider the case of individuals who are hosting services. Whether they are formal or informal, for profit or not, organisations can host services too and the dynamics at play are different.</p>
<p>Organisations and individuals have one thing in common when it comes to hosting services though: as soon as they start offering them to others, they are responsible for it. If you are an individual only hosting services for yourself, a few of the points below won’t apply to you. We’ll get to it later in the post.</p>
<h3 id="putting-services-online-is-the-easy-bit">Putting services online is the easy bit</h3>
<p>Individuals who have the opportunity to take the time to learn how to put services online can do it. There are plenty of tutorials around to break down how to do it, and while it’s not something the general public can be expected to do, tech-savvy people and tinkerers can manage to put services online.</p>
<p>The Linux fundamentals, a basic understanding of networks and a domain name will get you a long way! Putting services online also rewards you with satisfaction and pride. You set something up for you and your friends or even internet strangers. You alone, you are doing what a large corporation was doing for you and for them! Or are you?</p>
<h3 id="maintaining-services-is-tedious">Maintaining services is tedious</h3>
<p>There is not a single best technical way to host services, but there are general principles that are best-practices in the industry for a reason. Most of it boils down to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery">services continuity, disaster recovery</a> and security. I wouldn’t trust any provider with my data if they didn’t implement these practices.</p>
<h4 id="backups">Backups</h4>
<p>First and foremost: backups. Backups are a copy of your services’ data. Good backups are:</p>
<ul>
<li>done regularly</li>
<li>documented</li>
<li>tested regularly</li>
<li>stored at a different location than the computer powering your services, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#Off-site_data_protection">off-site backups</a></li>
<li>not accessible from a compromised machine in your network</li>
</ul>
<p>Some self-hosters only consider the first point, if they create backups at all. Setting up proper backups is not that trivial in itself, but documenting them and testing them takes discipline and is time consuming.</p>
<p>Storing them in a different location than the server powering your services can be costly depending on how much data you handle. Making sure they’re not accessible from a compromised machine is not trivial either, and several organisations <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware#Encrypting_ransomware">learnt it the hard way</a>.</p>
<h4 id="updates">Updates</h4>
<p>Having services running and their data backed up is not enough: the services <em>and the hosts running them</em> need to be kept up to date. New features, vulnerability patches, bug fixes: updates are not a convenience, they are basic hygiene. The difficulty of keeping services up to date grows with the number and complexity of the services you host.</p>
<p>You need to know when new updates are available, and keep track of which of your services need to be updated or have been updated. It is a good practice to test major updates in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Staging">staging environment</a> first, to find out and resolve potential issues before they impact the services actually used by your audience. This means you should either have a staging environment or spin one up that matches your production closely enough.</p>
<p>Then updates themselves can be difficult. The seemingly simple task of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html">upgrading a PostgreSQL database</a> from one major version to the next can require to dump the database data in a SQL file, upgrade the database, and import the database data back from the SQL file. Some <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/upgrading.html#UPGRADING-VIA-REPLICATION">more advanced setups involving replication</a> can be used to minimise downtime, but they are not trivial and require more advanced setups.</p>
<h4 id="security">Security</h4>
<p>Updates are a large part of security, but it goes way beyond that. There wouldn’t be a shortage of cybersecurity professionals if keeping one’s infrastructure up to date was enough to keep it secure. Improperly configured software, lack of access control, poor login policies… there is an incredibly high number of ways to poke holes into a deployment.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the above: it is very possible for open source software to be vulnerable. If the software has not been audited recently, it is likely vulnerable.</p>
<p>Big Tech companies have large security teams, they are regularly audited, and they have processes to respond to incidents. As sad as it is, a single person cannot pretend to offer the same level of security as a large company with a dedicated team.</p>
<h4 id="high-availability">High availability</h4>
<p>Both hardware and software can (and will) fail at some point. This means that the services powered by this hardware or software will be unreachable if they are not “highly available”. A simple approximation of high availability is “there’s a second copy of the service running somewhere that can be used if the first one doesn’t work”. In practice it can be complex to setup since all the instances running need to be in sync one way or another.</p>
<p>If your services were not deployed with high availability in mind and they go down, everyone who depends on your services will be unable to use them before they get back online. And this brings us to another issue: you will need to eat, sleep, and relax. You can’t be on call 24/7. Even if you set up proper monitoring and alerting, a one-person band can’t offer good availability guarantees.</p>
<p>Taking a grim approach to the question: being the single administrator of services offered to others means their data will highly likely be inaccessible for them if you end up being unable to manage the services: this concept is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a>. Self-hosting alone for family and friends puts them and their data at risk.</p>
<h4 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h4>
<p>If you dont have a support contract with them, the person or organisation that produces the code you deploy may stop distributing it. Whether it is because of a change in business model, because of sustainability issues or anything else, they can stop providing updates. While it’s true you own the data since you self-host it, you don’t necessarily have an easy migration path to another similar solution, if that solution even exists at all. Self-hosting is not a silver bullet when it comes to sustainability.</p>
<h4 id="beyond-tech">Beyond tech</h4>
<p>Finally: legal. Users screw up. Some can be malicious, some can be clumsy. Even for a seemingly private service like a Nextcloud: it’s possible to share content via a link, which means a user could host and share illegal content. You need to be able to receive requests, assess whether it’s a real request or not, how you can take action, how much time you have, how you notify the user and whether you take further action against them, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Maintaining services is <em>tedious</em>, and doing it alone puts everyone using them at risk.</p>
<h2 id="a-necessary-burden">A necessary burden</h2>
<p>If hosting services is that much of a burden, and if I’m confident a single person cannot have the time nor skills required to do it properly, why am I doing it? Why are so many of us doing it?</p>
<h3 id="surveillance--privacy">Surveillance &amp; Privacy</h3>
<p>The overwhelming response you get <a href="https://mamot.fr/@thibaultamartin/110833268021768665">when you ask people why they self-host</a> is that they want more control over their data and who has access to it. A significant number of respondents to that very un-scientific study mention they are doing it “for privacy”. I find this qualification a bit vague: it is possible to keep data significantly private even without self-hosting and <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> is a very good example of this.</p>
<p>What people often mean when they say they self-host services is that they want to protect against mass surveillance. The surveillance can come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech">Big Tech</a> who have a near monopoly on some services. For example, Google may <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/10519333?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">encrypt Google Drive files in transit and at rest</a>, but <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-workspace-encryption-wp.pdf">they still manage the keys and can technically decrypt the data</a>. I’m fairly confident that there are internal safeguards protecting employees from snooping in, but this doesn’t protect users against another major threat: subpoenas.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance can be political, and can be government-mandated. The US law is particularly insidious: federal law enforcement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act">can ask US based companies to hand them over any data, whether the servers are in the US or not</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden#Surveillance_disclosures">global surveillance disclosures</a> by Edward Snowden (in particular the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM">PRISM programme</a>) reinforce many self-hosters’s belief that their data is not safe if it’s hosted on someone else’s computer.</p>
<p>There can be valid reasons for a government to put an individual or group under surveillance. But these actions need to be motivated, and within the bounds of the law. The issue here is the <em>indiscriminate</em> surveillance of everyone, for no motive.</p>
<p>Self-hosting is an effective strategy to keep your data safe from <em>mass</em> surveillance. In the case of <em>targeted</em> surveillance it’s only a mild inconvenience. A single person has very little chances against a nation state actor trying to find out specific information when it comes to digital devices. The role of self-hosting here is to raise the cost of getting access to your data, be it by making it technically or legally more difficult.</p>
<p>It should be noted that self-hosting is not a silver bullet and can backfire. If the servers hosting the services used exclusively by activists were seized (as it <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/fbi-seizure-mastodon-server-wakeup-call-fediverse-users-and-hosts-protect-their">happened for Kolektiva.social</a> among others), the data can be weaponised against those activists. Worst: it can help discovering new activists that were under the radar.</p>
<p>End-to-end encrypted (E2EE) solutions can mitigate some of those issues: the content is only decipherable by the end users of the app, using keys stored on their devices. The service provider is not able to look at the data. This means if the servers are seized, the data remains indecipherable for everyone else.</p>
<p>Here again it should be noted that more often then not, the content is indecipherable but the metadata is not. In the case the case of a drive service, the content of the files would be encrypted but not who owns them, and with whom they are shared. In the case of instant messaging the messages would be encrypted but not who sends them nor to whom.</p>
<h3 id="personal-interest">Personal interest</h3>
<p>Self-hosting is a journey. Putting services online is the easy bit. The more a deployment grows, the more self-hosters need to learn. You start with a service, then two, then three. Then you end up adding SSO because it’s difficult to keep up with the various accounts. Then you hit scaling issues. Then you decide to rationalise services and trim down your offer. Then you set up monitoring. Then, then, then it never ends and that’s for the best.</p>
<p>Hosting services is a hands-on way to learn more about how a large part of our online life works behind the scenes. It’s also a very effective way to develop skills that are useful on the market. Self-hosting is about independence, and it cannot happen without learning.</p>
<h2 id="the-self-in-self-hosting">The self in self-hosting</h2>
<p>As self-hosters we are not going to change the face of the world. The other 98% of the general public is going to use hegemonic services: self-hosting is a privilege for those who have the education, time and money to put into it. We’re only deploying solutions that work for us, individually. Hosting services for our relatives puts them at risk of losing their data if something happened to us.</p>
<p>My recommendation to most people putting services online would be: either do it for yourself <em>only</em>, or do it as a team with proper structure and processes. What sounds like an initiative to emancipate people could actually alienate them to you, and that is a huge responsibility.</p>
<p>I believe it’s important to be able to self-host, even if only to prove it’s possible to do without hegemonic services. But we need to figure out how to do decentralise services and data storage for individuals <em>at scale</em>. This is not just a technical problem, and while E2EE is a good starting point it’s not a silver bullet. I will expand in a further post about the role of E2EE, where it falls short, and what I think we should do as a society to improve the situation.</p>
<h2 id="seamless-self-hosting">Seamless self-hosting</h2>
<p>We have seen that self-hosting can be more difficult than it appears. I used to be very worried about my deployment since it didn’t cover all the points above. Using standards and open source products, I was able to architecture a solution that allows me to self-host services without compromising my peace of mind. In a following blog post I will explain why my bicycle, ansible, RSS and buckets are key to a setup that doesn’t keep me up at night.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Almost every day, Anca Nitu comes home from work to find an Amazon package she did not order at her doorstep.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">For the past two months, Nitu says she's received more than 50 parcels containing women's shoes at her home in Langley, B.C. They were sent by people across North America who intended to return them to the Amazon seller, with each box containing a return authorization slip to her address.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">She says couriers have also abandoned packages on her porch, denying her the opportunity to refuse them. It has also resulted in more than $300 worth of Collect-on-Delivery&nbsp;(COD) customs charges from&nbsp;the United Parcel Service (UPS). The bills are mailed to her by the delivery company.</p><p dir="ltr">"I start shaking when I see packages at my door," said Nitu, who says the stress has cost her sleep and her appetite. "They keep coming&nbsp;and it just doesn't end."&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">While she has not determined an exact cause, Nitu suspects her residence is being used as a return address for sellers or third-party handlers to dump their unwanted products.</p><p dir="ltr">The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says it sounds like a vendor-return scheme, where sellers, usually from overseas countries like China or India, skirt shipping and warehouse fees by using a residence to ship their returned products.&nbsp;</p><div dir="ltr"><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/brushing-scam-alberta-amazon-mystery-packages-1.5656192" text="Mysterious Amazon packages linked to review-boosting scam, warns BBB" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>Mysterious Amazon packages linked to review-boosting scam, warns BBB</span></a></li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-student-union-amazon-anonymous-package-1.4517753" text="'Strange gifts': Winnipeg groups among Canadian student unions getting anonymous parcels" flag="" data-contentid=""><span>'Strange gifts': Winnipeg groups among Canadian student unions getting anonymous parcels</span></a></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr">Third-party sellers who use Amazon fulfilment centres are required to pay for picking and packing orders, shipping, handling&nbsp;and product returns.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">If an Amazon customer wishes to return a product to a third-party seller, the BBB says a company might try to save money by choosing&nbsp;a private return address rather than having to pay the cost of shipping packages overseas or having&nbsp;them&nbsp;processed in fulfilment centres.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">When a seller's returned products can't be re-sold, the companies are charged with <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GZ5Q2VW5WF4JWRGC?amp%3Bref=efph_GZ5Q2VW5WF4JWRGC_cont_G201411300&amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank">removal and disposal order fees</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Woman says her address is being used as dumping ground for unwanted purchases:</em>&nbsp;</strong><span><span><div title="B.C. woman bombarded with Amazon packages she never ordered" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><p><img srcset="

ordinary <code>struct</code>s and <code>enum</code>s, but we cannot do
it because we are unable to extract the very structure of a type
definition (fields and types/variants and their function signatures)
from a corresponding type name, especially if this type is external to
our crate and we cannot put a derive macro onto it <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. To
resolve the issue, Frunk developers decided to create such a procedural
macro that examines the internal structure of a type definition by
implementing the <a href="https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/generic/trait.Generic.html"><code>Generic</code></a>
trait for it; it has the <code>type Repr</code> associated type, which,
when implemented, equals to some form of a manipulatable heterogenous
list. Still, all other types (well, transparent ones, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transfer_object">DTOs</a>) that
do not have this derive macro, are left unexaminable, owing to the
aforementioned limitations of Rust.</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity/rust-meme.png"></p><a href="#sum-type-tree"><h2 id="sum-type-tree">Sum type – Tree</h2></a><p>One may find sum types good to represent an AST node (<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=e5031b0c2888fe9ea336789ee1cdf049">playground</a>):</p><p>

case), and <code>impl ... for S&lt;Lhs&gt;</code> is the induction step
(recursion case) – similar to how we did with pattern matching using
<code>match</code>. Likewise, as in the first example, the induction
works by reducing the first argument to <code>Z</code>:
<code>&lt;Lhs as Add&lt;Rhs&gt;&gt;::Result</code> works just like
<code>add(next, rhs)</code> – it invokes pattern matching once again to
drive the computation further. Note that the two trait implementations
indeed belong to the same logical function implementation; they look
detached because we perform pattern matching on our type-level number
(<code>Z</code> and <code>S&lt;Next&gt;</code>). This is somewhat
similar to what we are used to see in Haskell, where each pattern
matching case looks like a separate function definition:</p><p>

the latter, please refer to an awesome library called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/type-operators"><code>type-operators</code></a>

manipulations on them similar to how you normally do in Rust, but in the
end, the whole code will dwell on the type-level. For more details, see

be it statics or dynamics.</p><a href="#the-unfortunate-consequences-of-being-static"><h2 id="the-unfortunate-consequences-of-being-static">The unfortunate
consequences of being static</h2></a><blockquote>
<p>Are you quite sure that all those bells and whistles, all those
wonderful facilities of your so called powerful programming languages,
belong to the solution set rather than the problem set?</p>
</blockquote><p>Programming languages nowadays do not focus on the logic. They focus
on the mechanisms inferior to logic; they call boolean negation the most
simple operator that must exist from the very beginning but <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues/1834">negative trait
bounds</a> are considered a debatable concept with “a lot of issues”.
The majority of mainstream PLs support the tree data structure in their
standard libraries, but sum types <a href="https://bitbashing.io/std-visit.html">stay unimplemented for
decades</a>. I cannot imagine a single language without the
<code>if</code> operator, but only a few PLs accommodate full-fledged
trait bounds, not to mention pattern matching. This is
<strong>inconsistency</strong> – it compels software enginners design
low-quality APIs that either go dynamic and expose a very few
compile-time checks or go static and try to circumvent the fundamental
limitations of a host language, thereby making their usage more and more
abstruse. Combining statics and dynamics in a single working solution is
also complicated since you cannot invoke dynamics in a static context.
In terms of <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">function
colours</a>, dynamics is coloured red, whereas statics is blue.</p><p>In addition to this inconsistency, we have the feature
<strong>biformity</strong>. In such languages as C++, Haskell, and Rust,
this biformity amounts to the most perverse forms; you can think of any
so-called “expressive” programming language as of two or more smaller
languages put together: C++ the language and C++ templates/macros, Rust
the language and type-level Rust + declarative macros, etc. With this
approach, each time you write something at a meta-level, you cannot
reuse it in the host language and vice versa, thus violating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY
principle</a> (as we shall see in a minute). Additionally, biformity
increases the learning curve, hardens language evolution, and finally
ends up in such a feature bloat that only the initiated can figure out
what is happening in the code. Take a look at any production code in
Haskell and you will immediately see those numerous GHC

<p>[<strong>C</strong>] My own compile-time metaprogramming framework <a href="https://github.com/Hirrolot/metalang99">Metalang99</a> does the
same job by (ab)using the C preprocessor. It came to such extent that I
was forced to literally <a href="https://github.com/Hirrolot/metalang99/blob/master/include/metalang99/eval/rec.h">re-implement
recursion</a> through the combination of a Lisp-like trampoline and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">Continuation-Passing
Style (CPS)</a> techniques. In the end, I had a cornucopia of list
functions in the standard library, such as <a href="https://metalang99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list.html#c.ML99_listMap"><code>ML99_listMap</code></a>,
<a href="https://metalang99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list.html#c.ML99_listIntersperse"><code>ML99_listIntersperse</code></a>,
and <a href="https://metalang99.readthedocs.io/en/latest/list.html#c.ML99_listFoldr"><code>ML99_listFoldr</code></a>,
which arguably makes Metalang99, as a pure data transformation language,
more expressive than C itself <a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>

<p>[<strong>Rust</strong>] In the first example of inconsistency
(<code>Automobile</code>), we used a heterogenous list from the <a href="https://docs.rs/frunk/latest/frunk/index.html">Frunk</a> library.
It is of no difficulty to see that Frunk <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/frunk/blob/master/core/src/hlist.rs">duplicates</a>
some of the functionality of collections and iterators just to elevate
them to type-level. It could be cool to apply <code>Iterator::map</code>
or <code>Iterator::intersperse</code> to heterogenous lists, but we
cannot. Even worse, if we nevertheless want to perform declarative
type-level data transformations, we have to maintain the 1-to-1
correspondence between the iterator adaptors and those of type-level;
each time a new utility is implemented for iterators, we have one
utility missing in <code>hlist</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[<strong>Rust</strong>] <a href="https://docs.rs/typenum/latest/typenum/">Typenum</a> is yet
another popular type-level library: it performs integral calculations at
compile-time, by encoding integers as generics <a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>. By
doing this, the part of the language responsible for integers finds its
counterpart in the statics, thereby introducing even more biformity <a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>. We cannot just parameterise some
type with <code>(2 + 2) * 5</code>, we have to write something like
<code>&lt;&lt;P2 as Add&lt;P2&gt;&gt;::Output as Mul&lt;P5&gt;&gt;::Output</code>!
The best thing you could do is to write a macro that does the dirty job
for you, but it would only be syntax sugar – you would anyway see hordes
of compile-time errors with the aforementioned traits.</p>

</ul><p>Recalling the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenspun%27s_tenth_rule">Greenspun’s
tenth rule</a>, such handmade metalanguages are typically “ad-hoc,
informally-specified, bug-ridden, and slow”, with quite vague semantics
and awful documentation. The concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalinguistic_abstraction">metalinguistic
abstraction</a> simply does not work, albeit the rationale of creating
highly declarative, small domain-specific languages sounds so cool at
first sight. When a problem domain (or some intermediate machinery) is
expressed in terms of a host language, you need to understand how to
chain function calls together to get things done – this is what we
usually call an API; however, when this API is written in another
language, then, in addition to the calling sequence, you need to
understand the syntax and semantics of that language, which is very
unfortunate for two reasons: the mental burden it lays upon developers
and a very limited number of developers that can support such
metalanguages. From my experience, handmade metalinguistics tend to
quickly go out of hand and spread across the whole codebase, thereby
making it harder to dig into. Not only reasoning is impaired but also
compiler-developer interaction: have you ever tried to use a
sophisticated type or macro API? If yes, then you should be perfectly
acquainted with inscrutable compiler diagnostics, which can be
summarised in the following screenshot <a href="#fn8" id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/whats-the-point-of-the-c-preprocessor-actually/2.jpg"></p><p>This is woefully to say, but it seems that an “expressive” PL
nowadays means “Hey there, I have seriously messed up with the number of
features, but that is fine!”</p><p>Finally, a word has to be said about metaprogramming in a host
language. With such templating systems as <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/A_practical_Template_Haskell_Tutorial">Template
Haskell</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html">Rust’s
procedural macros</a>, we can manipulate an AST <a href="#fn9" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> of
a host language using the same language, which is good in terms of
biformity but unpleasant in terms of general language inconsistency.
Macros are not functions: we cannot partially apply a macro and obtain a
partially applied function (or vice versa), since they are just
different concepts – this can turn out to be a pain in the ass if we are
to design a generic and easy-to-use library API. Personally, I do think
that procedural macros in Rust are a <strong>giant design
mistake</strong> that is comparable to <code>#define</code> macros in
plain C: aside from pure syntax, the macro system simply has no idea
about the language being manipulated; instead of a tool to extend and
work with a language gracefully, you get slightly enhanced text
substitution and nothing more <a href="#fn10" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>. E.g., imagine there
is an enumeration called <code>Either</code>, whose definition is as
follows:</p><p>
<code>either.rs</code>
</p><div id="cb19"><pre><code><span id="cb19-1"><a href="#cb19-1"></a><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> Either<span>&lt;</span>L<span>,</span> R<span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb19-2"><a href="#cb19-2"></a>    Left(L)<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb19-3"><a href="#cb19-3"></a>    Right(R)<span>,</span></span>
<span id="cb19-4"><a href="#cb19-4"></a><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div><p>
Adapted from <a href="https://docs.rs/either/latest/either/enum.Either.html">either::Either</a>.
</p><p>Now imagine we have an arbitrary trait <code>Foo</code>, and we are
willing to implement this trait for <code>Either&lt;L, R&gt;</code>,
where <code>L</code> and <code>R</code> both implement <code>Foo</code>.
It turns out that we cannot apply a derive macro to <code>Either</code>
that implements this trait, even if the name is known because, in order
to do this, this macro must know all the signatures of <code>Foo</code>.
To make the situation even worse, <code>Foo</code> may be defined in a
separate library, meaning that we cannot augment its definition with
extra meta-information needed for the derivation for
<code>Either&lt;L, R&gt;</code>. While it may seem as a rare scanario,
in fact it is not; I highly encourage you to look at <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/">tokio-util</a>’s <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-util/latest/tokio_util/either/enum.Either.html"><code>Either</code></a>,
which is <strong>exactly</strong> the same enumeration but it implements
Tokio-specific traits, such as <code>AsyncRead</code>,
<code>AsyncWrite</code>, <code>AsyncSeek</code>, etc <a href="#fn11" id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>.
<del>Now imagine you have five different <code>Either</code>s in your
project that came from different libraries – that would be a true
integration headache!</del> <a href="#fn12" id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> While type
introspection may be a compromise, it would nonetheless make the
language even more complex than it already is.</p><a href="#idris-the-way-out"><h2 id="idris-the-way-out">Idris: The way out?</h2></a><blockquote>
<p>One of the most fundamental features of Idris is that types and
expressions are part of the same language – you use the same syntax for
both.</p>

n.d.)</span>
</p><p>Let us think a little bit about how to workaround the issue. If we
make our languages fully dynamic, we will win biformity and
inconsistency <a href="#fn13" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>, but will imminently lose the
pleasure of compile-time validation and will end up debugging our
programs at mid-nights. The misery of dynamic type systems is widely
known.</p><p>The only way to approach the problem is to make a language whose
features are both static and dynamic and not to split the same feature
into two parts. Thus, the ideal linguistic abstraction is both static
and dynamic; however, it is still a single concept and not two logically
similar concepts but with different interfaces <a href="#fn14" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a>.
A perfect example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compile-time_function_execution">CTFE</a>,
colloquially known as <code>constexpr</code>: same code can be executed
at compile-time under a static context and at run-time under a dynamic
context (e.g., when requesting a user input from <code>stdin</code>.);
thus, we do not have to write different code for compile-time (statics)
and run-time (dynamics), instead we use the same representation.</p><p>One possible solution I have seen is dependent types. With dependent
types, we can parameterise types not only with other types but with
values, too. In a dependently typed language <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/">Idris</a>, there is a type called
<code>Type</code> – it stands for the “type of all types”, thereby
<strong>weakening the dichotomy between type-level and
value-level</strong>. Having such a powerful thing at our disposal, we
can express <em>typed</em> abstractions that are usually either built
into a language compiler/environment or done via macros. Perhaps the
most common and descriptive example is a type-safe <code>printf</code>
that calculates types of its arguments on the fly, so let give us the
pleasure of mastering it in Idris <a href="#fn15" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>!</p><p>First, define an inductive data type <code>Fmt</code> and a way to
get it from a format string:</p><div id="cb20"><pre><code><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Fmt</span> <span>=</span> <span>FArg</span> <span>Fmt</span> <span>|</span> <span>FChar</span> <span>Char</span> <span>Fmt</span> <span>|</span> <span>FEnd</span></span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2"></a></span>
<span id="cb20-3"><a href="#cb20-3"></a><span>toFmt</span> <span>:</span> (fmt <span>:</span> <span>List</span> <span>Char</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Fmt</span></span>
<span id="cb20-4"><a href="#cb20-4"></a>toFmt (<span>'*'</span> <span>::</span> xs) <span>=</span> <span>FArg</span> (toFmt xs)</span>
<span id="cb20-5"><a href="#cb20-5"></a>toFmt (  x <span>::</span> xs) <span>=</span> <span>FChar</span> x (toFmt xs)</span>
<span id="cb20-6"><a href="#cb20-6"></a>toFmt [] <span>=</span> <span>FEnd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Later, we will use it to generate a type for our <code>printf</code>
function. The syntax resembles Haskell a lot and should be
comprehensible for a reader.</p><p>Now the most interesting part:</p><div id="cb21"><pre><code><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1"></a><span>PrintfType</span> <span>:</span> (fmt <span>:</span> <span>Fmt</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb21-2"><a href="#cb21-2"></a><span>PrintfType</span> (<span>FArg</span> fmt) <span>=</span> ({ty <span>:</span> <span>Type</span>} <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> ty <span>=&gt;</span> (obj <span>:</span> ty) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>PrintfType</span> fmt)</span>
<span id="cb21-3"><a href="#cb21-3"></a><span>PrintfType</span> (<span>FChar</span> <span>_</span> fmt) <span>=</span> <span>PrintfType</span> fmt</span>
<span id="cb21-4"><a href="#cb21-4"></a><span>PrintfType</span> <span>FEnd</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span></span></code></pre></div><p>What this function does? It <strong>calculates a type</strong> based
on the input argument <code>fmt</code>. As usual, we case-split
<code>fmt</code> into three cases and deal with them separately:</p><ol type="1">
<li><code>(FArg fmt)</code>. Since <code>FArg</code> indicates that we
are to provide a printable argument, this case produces a type signature
that takes an additional parameter:
<ol type="1">
<li><code>{ty : Type}</code> means that Idris will deduce a type
<code>ty</code> of this argument automatically (<a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/miscellany.html#implicit-arguments">implicit
argument</a>).</li>
<li><code>Show ty</code> is a type constraint that says that
<code>ty</code> should implement <code>Show</code>.</li>
<li><code>(obj : ty)</code> is that printable argument we must provide
to <code>printf</code>.</li>
<li><code>PrintfType fmt</code> is a recursive call that deals with the
rest of the input <code>fmt</code>. In Idris, inductive types are
managed by inductive functions!</li>
</ol></li>
<li><code>(FChar _ fmt)</code>. <code>FChar</code> indicates an ordinary
character in a format string, so here we just ignore it and continue
with <code>PrintfType fmt</code>.</li>
<li><code>FEnd</code>. This is the end of input. Since we want our
<code>printf</code> to produce a <code>String</code>, we return

in the type signature, meaning that the whole type of

<code>printf</code> takes <code>fmt : String</code>, we should convert
it to <code>List Char</code> beforehand because we match this string in
<code>toFmt</code>; as far as I know, Idris does not allow matching an
ordinary <code>String</code> in the same way. Likewise, we do
<code>unpack fmt</code> before calling <code>printfAux</code>, since it
also takes <code>List Char</code> as a result accumulator.</p><p>Let us examine the <code>printfAux</code> implementation:</p><ol type="1">

<code>acc</code> and call <code>printfAux</code> once again on
<code>fmt</code>.</li>

<code>List Char</code> but we have to return <code>String</code>
(according to the last case of <code>PrintfType</code>), we call

basically how you implement type-safe <code>printf</code> with
first-class types. If you are curious about the same thing in Rust, take
a look at <a href="https://willcrichton.net/notes/type-safe-printf/">Will Crichton’s
attempt</a>, which relies heavily on heterogenous lists we have seen
above. The downside of this approach now should be perfectly clear to
you: in Rust, the language of the type system differs from the main
language, but in Idris, it is indeed the same thing – this is why we can
freely define type-level functions as regular functions returning a
<code>Type</code> and invoke them later in type signatures. Moreover,
because Idris is dependently typed, you can even compute a type based on
some run-time argument, which is impossible in such languages as <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>.</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity/printf-meme.png"></p><p>I already anticipate the question: what is the problem of
implementing <code>printf</code> with macros? After all, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.println.html"><code>println!</code></a>
works just fine in Rust. The problem is macros. Think for yourself: why
a programming language needs heavy-duty macros? Because we may want to
extend it. Why may we want to extend it? Because a programming language
does not fit our needs: we cannot express something using regular
linguistic abstractions, and this is why we decide to extend the
language with ad-hoc meta-abstractions. In the main section, I provided
an argumentation why this approach sucks – because a macro system has no
clue about a language being manipulated; in fact, procedural macros in
Rust is just a fancy name for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">M4
preprocessor</a>. You guys integrated M4 into your language. Of course,
this is <a href="https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/whats-the-point-of-the-c-preprocessor-actually.html">better than
external M4</a>, but it is nevertheless a method of the 20’th century;
proc. macros even cannot manipulate an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>abstract</em>
syntax tree</a>, because <a href="https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/enum.Item.html"><code>syn::Item</code></a>,
a common structure used to write proc. macros, is indeed known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree"><em>concrete</em> syntax
tree</a>, or “parse tree”. On the other hand, types are a natural part
of a host language, and this is why if we can express a programmatic
abstraction using types, we <em>reuse</em> linguistic abstractions
instead of resorting to ad-hoc machinery. Ideally, a programming
language should have either no macros or only a lightweight form of
syntax rewriting rules (like Scheme’s <a href="https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/racket/pubs/lasc1990-sf.pdf"><code>extend-syntax</code></a>
or <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/syntax.html">syntax
extensions</a> of Idris), in order to keep the language consistent and
well-suited to solve expected tasks.</p><p>That being said, Idris erases the first biformity “values-generics”
by introducing <code>Type</code>, the “type of all types”. By doing so,
it also resolves a bunch of other correspondences, such as recursion
vs.&nbsp;type-level induction, functions vs.&nbsp;trait machinery, and so forth;
this, in turn, allows programming in the same language as much as
possible, even when dealing with highly generic code. E.g., you can even
represent a list of types as <code>List Type</code>, just like
<code>List Nat</code> or <code>List String</code>, and deal with it as
usual! It is possible due to a <a href="https://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/faq/faq.html#does-idris-have-universe-polymorphism-what-is-the-type-of-type">cumulative
hierarchy of universes</a>: simply speaking, <code>Type</code> is of
type <code>Type 1</code>, <code>Type 1</code> is of type
<code>Type 2</code>, and so on. Since <a href="https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2/blob/0d58282087a8dce89a036e31e192af13b9199850/libs/prelude/Prelude/Basics.idr#L164"><code>Data.List</code></a>’s
generic named <code>a</code> is “implicitly” typed <code>Type</code>, it
can be <code>Nat</code> and <code>String</code> as well as
<code>Type</code>; in the latter case, <code>a</code> would be deduced
as <code>Type 1</code>. Such an infinite sequence of types is needed to
avoid a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">Russell’s
paradox</a> by making an inhabitant “structurally smaller” than its
type.</p><p>Idris, however, is not a simple language. Our twenty line example of
<code>printf</code> already uses a “whole lotta features”, such as
inductive data types, dependent pattern matching, implicits, type
constraints, to mention a few. Additionally, Idris features <a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/effects/index.html">computational
effects</a>, <a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/elaboratorReflection/index.html">elaborator
reflection</a>, coinductive data types, and many-many stuff for theorem
proving. With such a pleiad of typing facilities, you typically twiddle
with your language machinery rather than doing some meaningful work. I
can hardly believe that in their current state, dependent types will
find massive production use; as for now, in the programming world, they
are no more than a fancy thing for PL researchers and random enthusiasts
like me. Dependent types alone are just too low-level.</p><a href="#zig-simpler-but-too-systems"><h2 id="zig-simpler-but-too-systems">Zig: Simpler, but too systems</h2></a><blockquote>

errors…</a> Much like C++ templates. However, I admit that this can be
solved (or at least workarounded) by more explicit type constraints.
Overall, the design of Zig’s type system seems reasonable: there is a
type of all types called <code>type</code>, and using
<code>comptime</code>, we can <a href="https://ikrima.dev/dev-notes/zig/zig-metaprogramming/">compute
types</a> at compile-time via regular variables, loops, procedures, etc.
We can even perform type reflection through the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeInfo"><code>@typeInfo</code></a>,
<a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#typeName"><code>@typeName</code></a>,
and <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#TypeOf"><code>@TypeOf</code></a>
built-ins! Yes, we can no longer depend on run-time values, but if you
do not need a theorem prover, probably full-blown dependent types are a
bit of overkill.</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/why-static-languages-suffer-from-complexity/types-meme.png"></p><p>Everything is good except that Zig is a systems language. On <a href="https://ziglang.org/">their official website</a>, Zig is described
as a “general-purpose programming language”, but I can hardly agree with
this statement. Yes, you can write virtually any software in Zig, but
should you? My experience in maintaining high-level code in Rust and C99
says <strong>NO</strong>. The first reason is safety: if you make a
systems language safe, you will make programmers deal with borrow
checker and ownership (or equivalent) issues that have absolutely
nothing to do with business logic (believe me, I know the pain);
otherwise, if you choose the C-way manual memory management, you will
make programmers debugging their code for long hours with the hope that
<code>-fsanitize=address</code> would show something meaningful.
Moreover, if you want to build new abstractions atop of pointers, you
will end up with <code>&amp;str</code>, <code>AsRef&lt;str&gt;</code>,
<code>Borrow&lt;str&gt;</code>, <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code>, and the
similar. Come on, I just want a UTF-8 string; most of the time, I do not
really care whether it is one of those alternatives.</p><p>The second reason is concerned with a language runtime <a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>: for a language to be systems, to
avoid hidden performance penalties, it should have a minimum runtime –
no default GC, no default event loop, etc., but for particular
applications, it might be necessary to have a runtime – for asynchronous
ones, for instance, so actually you <em>must</em> deal with custom
runtime code in some way. Here we encounter a whole new set of problems
regarding <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">function
colours</a> <a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>: e.g., having <code>async</code> in
your language and having no tools to <em>abstract over</em> synchronous
and asynchronous functions means that you divided your language into two
parts: synchronous and asynchronous, and say, if you have a generic
higher-order library, it will be inevitably marked <code>async</code> to
accept all kinds of user callbacks. To resolve the issue, you need to
implement some form of <a href="http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/effects/index.html">effect
polymorphism</a> (e.g., monads or algebraic effects), which is still a
research topic. High-level languages have innately fewer problems to
deal with, and this is why most of the software is written in Java, C#,
Python, and JavaScript; in Golang, conceptually, every function is
<code>async</code>, thus facilitating consistency <em>by default</em>,
without resorting to sophisticated type features. On the contrary, Rust
is already considered a complex language and still has no standard means
to write truly generic asynchronous code.</p><p>Zig can still be used in large systems projects like web browsers,
interpreters, and operating system kernels – nobody wants these things
to freeze unexpectedly. Zig’s low-level programming features would
facilitate convenient operation with memory and hardware devices, while
its sane approach to metaprogramming (in the right hands) would
cultivate understandable code structure. Bringing it to high-level code
would just increase the mental burden without considerable benefits.</p><blockquote>
<p>Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about
programs without thinking of them as pieces of executable code.</p>

<p>Looking at crash stats I'll note that of ~200 crashes, 95% are coming from Samsung mobiles. Almost all the samsung crashes have crash addresses ended in <code>fa9</code> -- which feels important but I'm not sure what it means; they all appear to come to the same build IDs. Looking at the registers, there's a register with the crashing address (but aligned, ending in <code>fa8</code>). Unfortunately I can't see what instruction is being used to do the load, so I'm not sure if this is like 1-past the end of a buffer or if we're doing an unaligned load where we ought to not be.</p>
<p>There's also a series of crashes at <code>0x0000087c</code>, all with the same install time (2023-05-09 17:49:58) -- these can be disregarded as bad hardware I suspect.</p>

It says the faulting instruction pointer is 0x6c1b455dc0 and here's what I've gotten with some work</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455da0	ldr x10, [x27, #0x28]
0x6c1b455da4	strb w23, [x10, x24]
0x6c1b455da8	ldrsb w10, [x9, #1]
0x6c1b455dac	ldr x9, [x27, #0x28]
0x6c1b455db0	tbnz w10, #0x1f, #0x6c1b455de8
0x6c1b455db4	add x11, x9, x24
0x6c1b455db8	ldrb w12, [x11]
0x6c1b455dbc	add x10, x19, x12, lsl #3
0x6c1b455dc0	ldrsb w13, [x10, #1]   &lt;-------- FAULTING INSTRUCTION HERE.
0x6c1b455dc4	tbnz w13, #0x1f, #0x6c1b4591ac
0x6c1b455dc8	and w11, w13, #0xff

0x6c1b455dd0	ldrsb w10, [x10, #2]
0x6c1b455dd4	sub w11, w12, w11
</code></pre>
<p>So the unaligned access of <code>x10+1</code> is coming directly from the assembly. The origin of that value is <code>x19+ x12 &lt;&lt; 3</code> (previous instruction). Sure enough, doing this calculation using the values from one of the dumps seems to confirm that what I'm seeing is real:</p>
<pre><code>js&gt; (0x000000700d6711d8 + (0x00000000ffffffba &lt;&lt; 3)).toString(16)
'700d670fa8'
</code></pre>
</div><div id="c8" data-comment-id="16426217" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Best guess is that these instructions are implementing</p>
<pre><code>   JSOp op = JSOp(*pc);
  int nuses = CodeSpec(op).nuses;
</code></pre>
<p>from <code>js::StackUses</code></p>
<p>Reading the back trace, it seems like we're emitting either a GetAliasedVar or GetAliasedDebugVar; we then call into <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp#l369" rel="nofollow"><code>emitN</code></a> where we set the initial value of the <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeEmitter.cpp#l361" rel="nofollow">bytecode pointer</a>.</p>
<p>Next we call <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-release/file/8141476bccc7d2e2468b740df03954d6ab212248/js/src/frontend/BytecodeSection.cpp#l176" rel="nofollow">updateDepth at that offset</a> -- this reads back the immediately prior written bytecode. I don't know why this doesn't work on samsung phones, but I'll bet that this is the root cause -- see, under this theory, <code>x12</code> should be our <code>JSOp</code> -- but the actual value in the register we have is <code>0x00000000ffffffba</code> which is way out of bounds for our bytecode count.</p>
<p>Why this is happening now, in 113 where it didn't happen previously is totally unclear. For some reason clang is now emitting a sequence that is tripping this hardware issue?</p>
<p>I've no idea how to resolve this. Patching this flow to avoid the read-after-write is awkward.</p>
</div><div id="c9" data-comment-id="16426231" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I tried to reverse engineer the assembly, but I do not see what it might corresponds to within StackUses:</p>
<pre><code>  unknown64_t* x19 = /* ??? */;
  size_t x12 = /* ??? */;
  unknown64_t* x10 = &amp;x19[x12];
  int8_t w13 = x10.one_byte_within;
  if (w13 % 32) {  // Potentially a switch statement condition with cases which are all below 32.
    return; // jump far further.
  }
  uint8_t w11 = w13 &amp; 0xff;
  uint64_t (w12, w13) = x27.some_field_in_large_struct; // offset of field 0xf0
  int8_t w10 = x10.two_bytes_within;
  uint16_t w11 = w12 - w11;  // x27.some_field_in_large_struct.first - x10.one_byte_within &amp; 0xff;
</code></pre>
<p>At first I thought x10 could be the CodeSpec, but I would not expect any condition to be added after loading <code>nuses</code>.<br>
Then I wondered if the condition could be the switch statement, but some of the matched opcodes are larger than 32.<br>
I would not expect any of of the complex code path from GET_UINT16.</p>
<p>So I do not think this code belongs to StackUses as reported in the stack trace.</p>
<p>Right, this is potentially the <code>nuses</code> field which is being repeated before being tested elsewhere.</p>
</div><div id="c10">

  <p>Just in case it's helpful, i've uploaded the -whole- disassembly I generated; the version in the comment was a snippet.</p></div><div id="c11" data-comment-id="16427047" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>I am not sure what the assembly maps to. x19 is table of uint64_t struct indexed by a uint8_t. This would sounds like this is a table indexed by opcodes, but there are 2 occurrences where the field at offset 1 is compared against 32 (_ % 32 == 0, or _ &amp; 31 == 0) at 0x6c1b455db0 and 0x6c1b455dc4.<br>
I do not know from where these comparisons are coming from.</p>
<p>Also, given that 0x6c1b455da8 works, this is sounds quite unlikely that a failure would happen at 0x6c1b455dc0, especially since LRDB at 0x6c1b455db8 is suppose to read a single byte.</p>
<p>Could this be a sign issue? LDRB doing a sign extension in w12, which then causes problem when being used by reading the value from in incorrect memory page?</p>

</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Be careful JS shift operators only work with 32 bits values, and not 64 bits. Thus this is not the correct result here.</p>
</div><div id="c12"><p>I'm at my own wits end on this one; I'm going to leave this one in your hands</p></div><div id="c13" data-comment-id="16433006" data-ismarkdown="true"><p>Poked at this a bit. It looks like everything's all been inlined together into one big pile of instructions and interleaved, but I think I've made a bit of progress.</p>
<p>Consider these instructions from the beginning of Matt's assembly sequence:</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d50	cmp w8, #6    
0x6c1b455d54	movn w9, #0x45   
0x6c1b455d58	cinc w23, w9, ne 
</code></pre>
<p>We are loading the constant ~0x45, then incrementing it if w8 is not 6. Interestingly, ~0x45 is 0xffffffba, which is precisely the mystery value that Matt found in x12. Later on, we have these instructions:</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d7c	adrp x19, #0x6c1d6c5000
0x6c1b455d80	add x19, x19, #0x1d8
...
0x6c1b455d94	and x9, x23, #0xff
...
0x6c1b455d9c	add x9, x19, x9, lsl #3
...
0x6c1b455da8	ldrsb w10, [x9, #1]
</code></pre>
<p>The first two instructions load a hardcoded pointer. The next two compute <code>base_address + (our_mystery_register &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; 3</code>. This looks like we're finding an entry from the CodeSpecTable. The last instruction loads (and sign-extends) a value from the CodeSpec: specifically, nuses is at offset 1.</p>
<p><code>0xffffffba &amp; 0xff</code> is 0xba, which is JSOp::GetAliasedVar. 0xbb is JSOp::GetAliasedDebugVar. So the first set of instructions I pulled out maps to <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c2945ad4769e2d4428c72e6ddd78d60eb920394/js/src/frontend/NameOpEmitter.cpp#117-119" rel="nofollow">this code</a>, which we can confirm by noticing that NameLocation::Kind::EnvironmentCoordinate is 6, matching the hardcoded constant.</p>
<p>Staring at the rest of the code, I've convinced myself that x27 is the BytecodeEmitter, and it's being used to reference the vector of bytecode we're emitting. A BytecodeEmitter contains a BytecodeSection at offset 32, which contains a BytecodeVector at offset 0. Doing the math, this means that x27+0x28 is <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0c2945ad4769e2d4428c72e6ddd78d60eb920394/mfbt/Vector.h#402" rel="nofollow">mBegin</a>, x27+0x30 is the length, and x27+0x38 is the capacity. With that in mind, here's another interesting sequence of instructions. In this code, x23/w23 holds <code>0xffffffba</code>.</p>
<pre><code>0x6c1b455d4c	ldr x24, [x27, #0x30]     // x24 = offset (length of buffer before writing anything)
...	          
0x6c1b455da0	ldr x10, [x27, #0x28]     // x10 is address of buffer
0x6c1b455da4	strb w23, [x10, x24]      // write opcode in buffer at offset
...				          
0x6c1b455dac	ldr x9, [x27, #0x28]      // x9 is address of buffer
...				          
0x6c1b455db4	add x11, x9, x24          // x11 is offset of opcode we just wrote
0x6c1b455db8	ldrb w12, [x11]           // load the opcode
0x6c1b455dbc	add x10, x19, x12, lsl #3 // look it up in the codespec table
0x6c1b455dc0	ldrsb w13, [x10, #1]      // CRASH!
</code></pre>
<p>In short, we store the opcode in the buffer, then load it again to use as an index into the codespec table. The really interesting thing here is the ldrb. The ARM docs describe it as:</p>
<pre><code>LDRB Wt, addr
Load Byte: loads a byte from memory addressed by addr, then zero-extends it to Wt.
</code></pre>
<p>Since we just stored <code>0xba</code>, that's what x12 should contain. However, that's not what we're seeing. Looking at a dump, I see <code>x12 = 0x00000000ffffffba</code>. That's not zero-extended.</p>
<p>I have a strong suspicion that Samsung (or whoever designed this particular chip) messed up their store forwarding, and accidentally forwarded the entire register without clearing the upper bits.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQLedge</h2>
<p dir="auto">[State: alpha]</p>
<p dir="auto">SQLedge uses Postgres logical replication to stream the changes in a source Postgres database to a SQLite database that can run on the edge.
SQLedge serves reads from its local SQLite database, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server that it's replicating from.</p>
<p dir="auto">This lets you run your apps on the edge, and have local, fast, and eventually consistent access to your data.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge/blob/main/etc/sqledge.png?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/zknill/sqledge/raw/main/etc/sqledge.png?raw=true" alt="SQLedge"></a></p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQL generation</h2>
<p dir="auto">The <code>pkg/sqlgen</code> package has an SQL generator in it, which will generate the SQLite insert, update, delete statements based on the logical replication messages received.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SQL parsing</h2>
<p dir="auto">When the database is started, we look at which tables already exist in the sqlite copy, and make sure new tables are created automatically on the fly.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Postgres wire proxy</h2>
<p dir="auto">SQLedge contains a Postgres wire proxy, default on <code>localhost:5433</code>. This proxy uses the local SQlite database for reads, and forwards writes to the upstream Postgres server.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Compatibility</h3>
<p dir="auto">When running, the SQL statements interact with two databases; Postgres (for writes) and SQLite (for reads).</p>
<p dir="auto">The Postgres wire proxy (which forwards reads to SQLite) doesn't currently translate any of the SQL statements from the Postgres query format/functions to the SQLite format/functions.
Read queries issued against the Postgres wire proxy need to be compatible with SQLite directly.
This is fine for simple <code>SELECT</code> queries, but you will have trouble with Postgres-specific query functions or syntax.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Copy on startup</h2>
<p dir="auto">SQLEdge maintains a table called <code>postgres_pos</code>, this tracks the LSN (log sequence number) of the received logical replication messages so it can pick up processing where it left
off.</p>
<p dir="auto">If no LSN is found, SQLedge will start a postgres <code>COPY</code> of all tables in the <code>public</code> schema. Creating the appropriate SQLite tables, and inserting data.</p>
<p dir="auto">When the replication slot is first created, it exports a transaction snapshot. This snapshot is used for the initial copy. This means that the <code>COPY</code> command will read the data from
the transaction at the moment the replication slot was created.</p>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>once a year, i'm on a client isolated network that i want to chat with friends over</li>
<li>i'm completely insane</li>
<li>i'm a programmer</li>

<p dir="auto">(i swear, i might actually briefly have a use for this! it might not be entirely useless! ... and other lies i tell myself)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">limitations</h2>
<p dir="auto">yes</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">things i made arpchat do</h2>
<p dir="auto">you can send messages tens of thousands of characters long because i implemented a (naive) generalizable transport protocol on top of arp. there's also a bit of compression.</p>
<p dir="auto">if you wanted, you could probably split off the networking part of this and use it instead of udp. please don't do this.</p>
<p dir="auto">not only are join and leave notifications a thing, i built an entire presence discovery and heartbeat system to see an updated list of other online users. ironically, part of this serves a similar purpose to arp itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">for more information on how this all works technically, check out <a href="https://kognise.dev/writing/arp" rel="nofollow">the little article i wrote</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">running</h2>
<p dir="auto">if you actually want to install this for some reason, you can get it from <a href="https://github.com/kognise/arpchat/releases/latest">the releases page</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">on windows, you probably need <a href="https://npcap.com/#download" rel="nofollow">npcap</a>. make sure you check "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode" in the installer!</p>
<p dir="auto">on linux, you might have to give arpchat network privileges:</p>

<p dir="auto">then just run the binary in a terminal. you know it's working properly if you can see your own messages when you send them. if you <em>can't</em> see your messages, try selecting a different interface or protocol!</p>
<p dir="auto">have any issues? that really sucks. you can make an issue if it pleases you.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">building</h2>
<p dir="auto">you don't really want to build this. anyway, it's tested on the latest unstable rust.</p>
<p dir="auto">on windows, download the <a href="https://www.winpcap.org/devel.htm" rel="nofollow">WinPcap Developer's Pack</a> and set the <code>LIB</code> environment variable to the <code>WpdPack/Lib/x64/</code> folder.</p>

<p>Nintendo has made a significant number of their registered patents public in the past month, and an overwhelming number of them seem to pertain to <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</strong>. Various aspects of Tears of the Kingdom’s mechanics and gameplay being patented had been a topic of discussion in the past as well, with some being of the opinion that Nintendo may be a tad too aggressive with their patents, registering functionalities that could be considered “too general” and unfair to block by patenting.&nbsp; Among the patents recently made public, there are some functionalities which seem to be rather “basic,” but a thorough look at them does reveal unique points as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within Japan’s game and entertainment industry, Nintendo stands out for the volume and competitiveness of their patents. In a study by Patent Result, it was found that Nintendo’s patents had been cited as ground for rejection of other companies’ patents in 180 cases during the year 2022 (<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20230629-19839/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Related article</a>). A large portion of Nintendo’s patents are unsurprisingly related to technology used in the latest entry to the Zelda series, Tears of the Kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the period between July 10 and August 4, Nintendo made public a total of 32 patents, 31 of which seem to be related to Tears of the Kingdom, including patents pertaining to more general mechanics and in-game abilities such as Ultrahand and Fuse, as well as more specific patents related to the abilities of certain side characters, such as Riju’s <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-098591/BB4EADB6A73C0E74F4018D19374909FDB297562A23808006D8F65C29875E323E/11/ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remote lightning attack</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One patent (as spotted by <a href="https://naoya2k.hatenablog.com/entry/2023/08/07/034044" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">naoya2k</a>) that appears to be “obvious” as a functionality at first glance is related to the calculations performed while Link rides on top of objects. The <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-103273/6B1E7E15670E730C5DEAF877AF466F706D91B47CAD6DC015008FDC07DA623400/11/ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solution</a> is described as follows: “the movement of movable dynamic objects placed in the virtual space is controlled by physics calculations, and the movement of the player’s character is controlled by user input. When the player’s character and a dynamic object come in contact in the downward direction relative to the character (in other words, when the character is on top of an object), the movement of the dynamic object is added to the movement of the player’s character.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Put simply, the game judges when Link is making contact with a movable object underneath him, and if the object moves, Link will automatically move in the same way and speed as the object does, without any input being made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The functionality seems at first glance to be a given for any game with a similar environment, but according to an observation by naoya2k, what makes Nintendo’s solution unique is that there are no physics working between Link and the dynamic object. Since both the character and object use physics, the most straightforward solution would be that Link moves together with the moving objects he is on top of as a result of physics (such as frictional force), but Nintendo apparently decided that what works better game-wise is Link being given the same movement that the object is performing, without any physics working between the two. At the same time, it’s still hard to firmly state there are no predecessors to the mechanic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-103274/F63BED3D38106634E5C0FFF731694ECD21E4C076D346A9ECA12C0ACF0A40DFBA/11/ja" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related patent</a> defines a mechanic that prevents Link from grabbing an object he is on top of using Ultrahand, which also seems rather intuitive. The patent does, however, go into details such as the mechanic also blocking Link from using Ultrahand on objects which have been joined to an object he is on top of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A rather unexpected mechanic of Tears of the Kingdom that has been patented by Nintendo is the very brief loading sequence that commences when using fast travel to instantly relocate to another place in the vast world. The <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-2023-098720/8ECFEDAFDFB078FD2FB805A24CB80BBC213DAF27A5458BF4E5A29C3059A3B590/11/ja">patent</a> is a solution to providing “a game processing method capable of enriching game presentation during a waiting period in which at least part of the game processing is interrupted” and consists of filling up the loading period that ensues after the user inputs their fast travel destination with a sequence in which an image of the starting point’s map transitions into a map of the destination. After this sequence, the character is placed into the virtual space of the destination.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="932" height="807" src="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004.jpg 932w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-380x329.jpg 380w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-768x665.jpg 768w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-150x130.jpg 150w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-300x260.jpg 300w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-696x603.jpg 696w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-485x420.jpg 485w, https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/20230808-20590-header-004-534x462.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 932px) 100vw, 932px"></figure>
<p>It’s fascinating to see that even game mechanics that most will barely register while playing, such as a loading screen sequence, can be legally protected patents. When asked what technology used in Tears of the Kingdom is new and unique, surely no one would think of the map transition that happens in between fast travelling. It just goes to show how thoroughly designed every aspect of the game is, whether apparent or running in the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the same time, the detailed patenting by Nintendo has also been criticized as excessive by some, both in the sense of them patenting mechanics that have seen predecessors, such as the time manipulating ability Recall, as well as in the sense of blocking other developers from using mechanics that players would want to see implemented elsewhere as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">From the beginning...</h2>
<p dir="auto">I've done <a href="https://github.com/kognise">a lot of things with computers</a>, but I've always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I've used syscalls, but how do they <em>work</em>? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?</p>

Someone with long hair is confused as they peer down at a computer ingesting binary. Suddenly, they have an idea! They start researching on a desktop computer with bad posture." width="700"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren't many comprehensive systems resources if you aren't going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would've killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I'm writing the article that I wished I had.</p>
<p dir="auto">And you know what they say... you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.</p>

<h3>from the <i>can-we-not?</i> dept</h3>

<p>I do understand why so many people, especially creative folks, are worried about AI and how it’s used. The future is quite unknown, and things are changing very rapidly, at a pace that can feel out of control. However, when concern and worry about new technologies and how they may impact things morphs into mob-inspiring fear, dumb things happen. I would much rather that when we look at new things, we take a more realistic approach to them, and look at ways we can keep the good parts of what they provide, while looking for ways to mitigate the downsides.</p>
<p>Hopefully without everyone going crazy in the meantime. Unfortunately, that’s not really the world we live in.</p>
<p>Last year, when everyone was focused on generative AI for images, we had Rob Sheridan on the podcast to talk about why it was important for creative people to figure out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/09/13/techdirt-podcast-episode-329-is-ai-art-the-end-for-artists/" target="_blank">how to embrace the technology</a> rather than fear it. The opening story of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/technology/mike-masnick-techdirt-internet-future.html" target="_blank">recent NY Times profile of me</a> was all about me in a group chat, trying to suggest to some very creative Hollywood folks how to embrace AI rather than simply raging against it. And I’ve already called out how folks rushing to copyright, thinking that will somehow “save” them from AI, are <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/07/19/stop-rushing-to-copyright-as-a-tool-to-solve-the-problems-of-ai/" target="_blank">barking up the wrong tree</a>.</p>
<p>But, in the meantime, the fear over AI is leading to some crazy and sometimes unfortunate outcomes. Benji Smith, who created what appears to be an absolutely amazing tool for writers, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.shaxpir.com/" target="_blank">Shaxpir</a>, also created what looked like an absolutely fascinating tool called Prosecraft, that had scanned and analyzed a whole bunch of books and would let you call up really useful data on books.</p>
<p>He created it years ago, based on an idea he had years earlier, trying to understand the length of various books (which he initially kept in a spreadsheet). As <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.shaxpir.com/taking-down-prosecraft-io-37e189797121">Smith himself describes in a blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I heard a story on NPR about how </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oP3c1h8v2ZQ"><em><u>Kurt Vonnegut</u></em></a><em> invented an idea about the “shapes of stories” by counting happy and sad words. The University of Vermont “Computational Story Lab” published </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hedonometer.org/papers.html"><em><u>research papers</u></em></a><em> about how this technique could show the major plot points and the “emotional story arc” of the </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://hedonometer.org/books/v2/Harry%20Potter%20and%20the%20Sorcerer's%20Stone/"><em><u>Harry Potter</u></em></a><em> novels (as well as many many other books).</em></p>
<p><em>So I tried it myself and found that I could plot a graph of the emotional ups and downs of any story. I added those new “sentiment analysis” tools to the prosecraft website too.</em></p>
<p><em>When I ran out of books on my own shelves, I looked to the internet for more text that I could analyze, and I used web crawlers to find more books. I wanted to be mindful of the diversity of different stories, so I tried to find books by authors of every race and gender, from every different cultural and political background, writing in every different genre and exploring all different kinds of themes. Fiction and nonfiction and philosophy and science and religion and culture and politics.</em></p>
<p><em>Somewhere out there on the internet, I thought to myself, there was a new author writing a horror or romance or fantasy novel, struggling for guidance about how long to write their stories, how to write more vivid prose, and how much “passive voice” was too much or too little.</em></p>
<p><em>I wanted to give those budding storytellers a suite of “lexicographic” tools that they could use, to compare their own writing with the writing of authors they admire. I’ve been working in the field of computational linguistics and machine learning for 20+ years, and I was always frustrated that the fancy tools were only accessible to big businesses and government spy agencies. I wanted to bring that magic to everyone.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Frankly, all of that sounds amazing. And amazingly useful. Even more amazing is that he built it, and it worked. It would produce useful analysis of books, such as this example from Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland:</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/66fe5a2d-6b6a-4a0c-ac35-ac0be3cae2b0-RackMultipart20230808-122-dsis3v.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>And, it could also do further analysis like the following:</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/ed8ec575-1878-412b-a5f5-6d8b19fc0166-RackMultipart20230808-139-rgmlwd.png?resize=550%2C198&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="550" height="198" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>This is all quite interesting. It’s also the kind of thing that data scientists do on all kinds of work for useful purposes.</p>
<p>Smith built Prosecraft into Shaxpir, again, making it a more useful tool. But, on Monday, some authors on the internet found out about it and lost their shit, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gizmodo.com/prosecraft-books-shut-down-ai-algorithms-novel-fiction-1850715319" target="_blank">leading Smith to shut the whole project down</a>.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about all of this. Smith notes that he had researched the copyright issues and was sure he wasn’t violating anything, and he’s right. We’ve gone over this many times before. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2013/11/14/google-gets-total-victory-over-authors-guild-book-scanning-is-fair-use/" target="_blank">Scanning books is pretty clearly fair use</a>. What you do with that later <em>could</em> violate copyright law, but I don’t see anything that Prosecraft did that comes anywhere even remotely close to violating copyright law.</p>
<p>But… some authors got pretty upset about all of it.</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/5b81191f-7361-47b1-88d5-4260025691ea-RackMultipart20230808-162-wkk8di.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>I’m still perplexed at what the complaint is here? You don’t need to “consent” for someone to analyze your book. You don’t need to “consent” to someone putting up statistics about their analysis of your book.</p>
<p>But, Zach’s tweet went viral with a bunch of folks ready to blow up anything that smacks of tech bro AI, and lots of authors started yelling at Smith.</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/c1fdb6a0-0bca-4b2c-b9c6-5103b6997b50-RackMultipart20230808-122-gei1hr.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>The Gizmodo article has a ridiculously wrong “fair use” analysis, saying “Fair Use does not, by any stretch of the imagination, allow you to use an author’s entire copyrighted work without permission as a part of a data training program that feeds into your own ‘AI algorithm.’” Except… it almost certainly does? Again, we’ve gone through this with the Google Book scanning case, and the courts said that you can absolutely do that because it’s transformative.</p>
<p>It seems that what really tripped up people here was the “AI” part of it, and the fear that this was just another a VC funded “tech bro” exercise of building something to get rich by using the works of creatives. Except… none of that is accurate. As Smith explained in his blog post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>For what it’s worth, the prosecraft website has never generated any income. The Shaxpir desktop app is a labor of love, and during most of its lifetime, I’ve worked other jobs to pay the bills while trying to get the company off the ground and solve the technical challenges of scaling a startup with limited resources. We’ve never taken any VC money, and the whole company is a two-person operation just working our hardest to serve our small community of authors.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also recognizes that the concerns about it being some “AI” thing are probably what upset people, but plenty of authors have found the tool super useful, and even added their own books:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I launched the prosecraft website in the summer of 2017, and I started showing it off to authors at writers conferences. The response was universally positive, and I incorporated the prosecraft analytic tools into the Shaxpir desktop application so that authors could privately run these analytics on their own works-in-progress (without ever sharing those analyses publicly, or even privately with us in our cloud).</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve spent thousands of hours working on this project, cleaning up and annotating text, organizing and tweaking things. A small handful of authors have even reached out to me, asking to have their books added to the website. I was grateful for their enthusiasm.</em></p>
<p><em>But in the meantime, “AI” became a thing.</em></p>
<p><em>And the arrival of AI on the scene has been tainted by early use-cases that allow anyone to create zero-effort impersonations of artists, cutting those creators out of their own creative process.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s not something I ever wanted to participate in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Smith took the project down entirely because of that. He doesn’t want to get lumped in with other projects, and even though his project is almost certainly legal, he recognized that this was becoming an issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Today the community of authors has spoken out, and I’m listening. I care about you, and I hear your objections.</em></p>
<p><em>Your feelings are legitimate, and I hope you’ll accept my sincerest apologies. I care about stories. I care about publishing. I care about authors. I never meant to hurt anyone. I only hoped to make something that would be fun and useful and beautiful, for people like me out there struggling to tell their own stories.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find all of this really unfortunate. Smith built something really cool, really amazing, that does not, in any way, infringe on anyone’s rights. I get the kneejerk reaction from some authors, who feared that this was some obnoxious project, but couldn’t they have taken 10 minutes to look at the details of what it was they were killing?</p>
<p>I know we live in an outrage era, where the immediate reaction is to turn the outrage meter up to 11. I’m certainly guilty of that at times myself. But this whole incident is just sad. It was an overreaction from the start, destroying what had been a clear labor of love and a useful project, through misleading and misguided attacks from authors.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/8/9/infrastructure-audit-completed-by-radically-open-security/">https://mullvad.net/en/blog/2023/8/9/infrastructure-audit-completed-by-radically-open-security/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37060654">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>We tasked the Netherlands based security firm Radically Open Security (RoS) with performing the third audit towards our VPN infrastructure.</p>

<p>We asked them to focus solely on VPN servers that run from RAM, one OpenVPN and one WireGuard server.</p>

<p>We invite you to <a href="https://mullvad.net/media/Mullvad_VPN_Pentest_Report_2023_1.1.pdf">read the final report</a><strong> </strong>of our third security audit, concluded in mid-June 2023, with many fixes deployed late June 2023. Further re-tests and a verification pass was performed during July.</p>

<p>RoS discovered a number of new findings, and we would like to thank them for their thorough and detailed report. They stated , amongst other things that: that whilst they found some issues, that: “The Mullvad VPN relays which were the subject of this test showed a mature architecture…” and “During the test we found no logging of user activity data..”</p>

<p>We gave RoS full SSH access to two (2) VPN servers that were running from RAM, using our latest slimmed down Linux kernel (6.3.2) and customised Ubuntu 22.04 LTS based OS. These servers were deployed as though they were <strong>to be</strong> production customer-facing servers, however these servers <strong>have never been utilised </strong>as such.</p>

<p>We asked them to verify:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Security and set up of servers internally</li>
	<li>Security and set up of servers externally</li>
	<li>Whether or not we log customer activity</li>
</ul>

<p>RoS also asked whether they should investigate the source code of various binaries running on our systems, or whether they should take into consideration the hardware-level security. We declined both offers, stating that this is to be considered an <em>“after the system is running and in-use by customers”</em> audit.</p>

<h2>Overview of findings</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Radically Open Security found no information leakage or logging of customer data</li>
	<li>RoS discovered 1 High, 6 Elevated, 4 Moderate, 10 Low and 4 info-severity issues during this penetration test.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key takeaway:</strong> Our VPN infrastructure has been audited for the third time.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous issues of interest</h2>

<h3>MLL-024 Production multihop traffic on test system (High)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS:</strong><em> “Impact - Production user traffic is visible to pentest users.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>RoS were given production-like servers, provisioned and deployed like all other customer facing servers. The difference between these and the rest of our fleet is that they have never been made available for customers to connect, they were not advertised in our server list, and not offered up to users. However, as these servers are connected to our WireGuard multihop functionality, <strong>any customer scanning for IPs</strong> can send traffic though them whilst connected to another VPN server using a SOCKS5 proxy, as there is nothing blocking it.</p>

<p>In what RoS discovered there was only the IP from the WireGuard internal interface. This interface is only available to SOCKS5 multihop traffic, so it would be the entry WireGuard server.</p>

<p>Without providing RoS with production servers the audit would not have been valid as a production server audit, and there would have been no way to prevent customer traffic from being visible on the servers.</p>

<h3>MLL-019 - LPE to root using systemd timers and insecure directory permissions (Elevated)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS:</strong><em> “Low-privileged system accounts can elevate their privileges to root by manipulating systemd timer script content.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>It became obvious after consulting with RoS that the primary issue here is the use of nested home directories, and the addition of administrator users being part of the <code>mad</code> group.</p>

<p>The usage of the nested <code>/home/mad</code> directory structure is a legacy remnant of pre-RAM VPN servers, which is going to be removed in the upcoming updates to our infrastructure. In the short-term we have removed all administrator users from being part of the <code>mad</code> group, but we have also moved all related scripts to <code>/opt/local_checks</code> which RoS acknowledged as resolving the issue.</p>

<h3>MLL-045 — Administrator access to production machines (Moderate)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS:</strong> <em>“VPN servers accept remote logins from administrators, who technically have the ability to tap into production users' VPN traffic”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>We have been aware of this issue for some time, and conversing with RoS only confirmed our plans to implement such measures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Implement a method by which unauthorised logins can be auditable, and add a log of all the commands (without arguments) used on these servers. We are implementing such a system.</li>
	<li>Remove support for SSH entirely, this would mean that even administrators could not enable logging of customer traffic, since no access is enabled over SSH. We are investigating such a system, though this will take more time to perform correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MLL-016 - Telegraf password shared across servers (low)</h3>

<p><strong>To quote RoS: </strong><em>“Shared Influx database credentials used by Telegraf across VPN servers allows manipulation of global server metrics, such as CPU and disk usage or network metrics.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Our comments:</strong></p>

<p>We deemed the best course of action here to implement client certificates for authentication using the PKI infrastructure available within Hashicorp Vault. This has now been implemented, and we will investigate the use of such certificates in other places across our infrastructure.</p>

<p>---</p>

<p>There are more changes to be deployed in the near future, and the listed fixes are examples of the most interesting issues that Radically Open Security found.</p>

<p>For the universal right to privacy,<br>
Mullvad</p>

<h2>J-CIA - MOS 6526 / 8521 / (8520) FPGA REPLACEMENT</h2>
<p><img src="https://1nt3r.net/j-cia/JCIA64_2.JPG" alt="J-CIA, J-CIA64, J6526, FPGA 6526 / 8521"></p><h2>Modern spare part for Commodore 64, Commodore 128, SX-64 and 1570/1571 -drives</h2>

<li>FPGA based replacement for MOS 6526 &amp; 8521 CIA chips</li>
<li>Complete logic and all features of the original IC's implemented</li>
<li>All diagnostic &amp; software tests passed 100%, including all tests in Wolfgang Lorenz's test suite and Vice-project's CIA-tests.</li>
<li>[Vice's ciaports-tests may show partly incorrect results, but then again, original cias show variable results too.]</li>
<li>Hundreds of demos and games already tested, no known compatibility issues currently</li>
<li>Physically about the same size as the original CIAs</li>
<li>Lots of hardware tested and found to be compatible including (but not limited to) WifiModem, Ultimate-II+, SD2IEC, TapeCart, 1351-mouse</li>
<li>Tested with all C64 mainboard revisions, SX-64 and with EVO64 mainboard, Commodore 128 (including CP/M and disk drive burst-mode) and 1570 &amp; 1571.</li>
<li>Works in 1 MHz and 2 MHz modes.</li>
<li>This 6526/8521 version has been tested to work on a 1581 drive too by a betatester, but full compatibility cannot be guaranteed.
</li><li>(8520 Amiga -version would be the correct one for 1581)</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li><span color="red">This "J-CIA64" -version is not compatible with Amiga / 8520-CIA and cannot be later converted or upgraded to be.</span></li>
<li>Amiga -compatible version will be a separate product that will be released later.</li>

<h3>Changing mode between 8521 "new" and 6526 "old" CIA:</h3>
<li>Mode between new (8521) and old (6526) cia type can be changed</li>
<li>with a solder jumper on the underside of J-CIA64</li>
<li>"New" 8521 mode is default and 6526-mode can be enabled by soldering</li>
<li>two pads together as in the right on the image below:</li>
<p><img src="https://1nt3r.net/j-cia/mode-jumper.jpg" alt="J-CIA64 mode jumper"></p><li>Usually, the mode doesn't need to be changed,</li>
<li>most sofware and hardware are designed to work with both versions.</li>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<li>Although J-CIA could be soldered directly to mainboard, using IC sockets is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Pins on J-CIA are gold plated round pins, which will work with all kinds of sockets, but</li>
<li>the pins are a bit thicker than original IC-pins, which may cause slight stress to some leaf-type</li>
<li>sockets. This is a the same with all reproduction IC's with turned pins. </li>
<li>Be careful when pressing the J-CIA into a socket and make sure it is aligned properly and </li>
<li>pressed down evenly to avoid bending or breaking of pins.</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>J-CIA orientation: PIN 1 is marked with a number 1 on PCB. That should match PIN 1 position on mainboard.</li>
<li>There is also a half circle marked on the top of the J-CIA. This relates to the notch on original IC's and the notch on IC-sockets</li>
<li>On a C64 CIA PIN 1 is located on top left of the both CIA -locations.</li>
<li>On a C128 the other CIA position is "upside-down", so be careful installing a new CIA the correct way</li>
<li>&nbsp;</li>
<li>Original RF-shields may require insulating, modifications or even removing.</li>
<li>Before turning on the power, check that the RF-shield metal does not touch J-CIA(s).</li>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<li>J-CIA / J-CIA64 reproduces the functionality of the original MOS CIA's</li>
<li>Because it's a reproduction, it cannot be ever fully like the original.</li>
<li>Logic aims to be exactly like the original, but there may be differences that have not been found yet.</li>
<li>Electrically J-CIA is "close enough" to the original CIA, but it is not exactly the same.</li>
<li><i>Although tested with a lot of hardware and software, compatibility with all hardware and software cannot be guaranteed.</i></li>
<li>nstalling the J-CIA64 requires delicate handling and taking the proper precautions to prevent antistatic discharges.</li>
<li>The seller or manufacturer cannot be held responsible for any possible damage this product may cause to your</li>
<li>equipment due to incorrect installation or mishandling of the product.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/15kj845/canonical_the_recruitment_process_really_is_that/">https://old.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/15kj845/canonical_the_recruitment_process_really_is_that/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37059857">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In case you’re wondering how Canonical’s infamous recruitment process plays out, here’s a step-by-step account of what I went through for a non-technical role. I didn’t have any immediate need to land a new job, which is part of the reason why I decided to stick with it to see how it worked. (Had I succeeded, I would have been onboarded 4-5 months after I’d sent in my CV.)</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr It took 81 days, a CV, a cover letter, an application form, a 22-question written interview, two standardised tests, and four (4) in-person interviews. And that wasn’t even close to the entire recruitment process!</strong></p>

<p>Day 0: I read about this job and I was SO EXCITED because it ticked all my boxes. I literally got home from work and applied. I submitted my CV and answered the questions in their application form. Some of them asked about high school. Canonical – or, should we say, Mark Shuttleworth, the self-appointed benevolent dictator for life - genuinely believes that knowing what you did in high school will give useful information about whether they should hire you. They justify this all over the place.</p>

<p>Day 25: Automated email from a person stating they were my hiring lead. &nbsp;This email included the written interview – 22 questions about everything from ‘What would you most want to change about Canonical?’ (sure, let me just critizicize the company I am trying to work for) to multiple questions about high school. Even if you are in a country where it isn’t called high school, or if you were homeschooled, or were in a chaotic foster care situation and moved schools multiple times, or if you dropped out and later got a GED (or didn’t). They don’t care if you have to drag up actual traumas from decades ago - you WILL tell them about high school.</p>

<p>I suspect most of the value here is that they use it as a winnowing process, given that they have tens of thousands of applicants every month. If you’re not willing to jump through this hoop, that’s one less person they have to consider.</p>

<p>I didn’t keep notes from my first interview and that person may have referred to my written interview, but no one else did, even though I had some brilliant answers (the way I won a major post-college scholarship was a masterpiece of An Example Of A Time Where I Showed Initiative, thanks very much).</p>

<p>Here it is:</p>

<p><em>Context</em></p>

<p><em>Outline your thoughts on the mission of Canonical. What is it about the company's purpose and goals which is most appealing to you? What do you see as risky or unappealing?</em></p>

<p><em>Why do you most want to work for Canonical?</em></p>

<p><em>What would you most want to change about Canonical?</em></p>

<p><em>What gets you most excited about this role?</em></p>

<p><em>What support would you need from Canonical to be successful</em></p>

<p><em>Experience</em></p>

<p><em>Please outline your most relevant experience for this role.</em></p>

<p><em>What are the key attributes of an outstanding executive assistant?</em></p>

<p><em>Please describe a situation where you had to hold firm on a difficult issue.</em></p>

<p><em>What is different about the role of Executive Assistant in a remote-first business?</em></p>

<p><em>Describe any experience you have working across many time zones.</em></p>

<p><em>Describe improvements you have made to a process in previous roles.</em></p>

<p><em>How do you remain calm in a high-stress, fast-paced environment?</em></p>

<p><em>What has been the highlight of your career so far, and why?</em></p>

<p><em>Education</em></p>

<p><em>We consider academic results in high school and university for all roles, regardless of seniority or department. To enjoy a long and varied career at Canonical, one would need to tackle problems that cannot be defined today! From engineering to marketing to operations and sales, we intensely value colleagues who are able to puzzle through difficult problems and find the optimal path forward.</em></p>

<p><em>How did you rank in your high school, in your final year in maths and hard sciences? Which was your strongest?</em></p>

<p><em>How did you rank in your high school, in your final year in languages and the arts? Which was your strongest?</em></p>

<p><em>Please state your high school graduation results or university entrance results, along with the system used, and how to understand those. For example, in the US, you might give your SAT or ACT scores. In Germany, you might give your scores 1-5.</em></p>

<p><em>What sort of high school student were you? Outside of class, what were your interests and hobbies? What would your high school peers remember you for, if we asked them?</em></p>

<p><em>Which university and degree did you choose? What other universities did you consider, and why did you select that one?</em></p>

<p><em>At university, did you do particularly well in an area of your degree?</em></p>

<p><em>Overall, what was your degree result and how did that reflect on your ability?</em></p>

<p><em>In high school and university, what did you achieve that was exceptional?</em></p>

<p><em>What leadership roles did you take on during your education?</em></p>

<p>Day 29: Submitted the written interview.</p>

<p>Day 30: Completed the Thomas GIA test. This is a standardised test which makes you rotate shapes in a box, work out basic logic problems, and do things with words and numbers. I hate standardised tests, because all they reveal is how good you are at taking standardised tests (this is what I mentioned in the ‘tell us what you’d change’ section of the written interview) and no, they are not unbiased.</p>

<p>I did as many practice tests as I could to make sure I aced it, and according to the Thomas International report I got afterwards, I scored well in all five areas. They didn’t give me my actual scores but I was ‘above average’, and they gave advice on how these results would affect&nbsp;my working relationships. For all five areas, the advice they gave me was basically, ‘when you’re talking to your wooden-headed co-workers, dumb&nbsp;it down for the proles, Brainiac.’</p>

<p>Day 32: I was invited for an interview. Or rather, three interviews – two with people on the team I was applying to, one on a different team. One hour each. They don’t compare notes, so all of their opinions are allegedly unbiased, but a) this means you get asked the same/similar questions, which is boring for me and a waste of time for them, and b) exactly how unbiased is it when every person I interviewed with was exactly my demographic? (White, female, American/western European. The fifth interview, had I reached it, would have been in that demographic too. My hiring lead was a woman of colour, but my only non-automated contact with her was one brief response to an email I sent her early in the process.)</p>

<p>Day 35: Automated email from Mark Shuttleworth which started, ‘Given that you are now starting the final stage interview to join our team’, even though I was nowhere near the final stage interviews. Mark’s icon is a green dragon, which indicated that if I made it through this interminable quest, he would be the final boss fight. Someone might want to fix the typos in this email.</p>

<p>Day 46: Peer interview 1. Pretty chill. She said she was the newest member of the team.</p>

<p>Day 51: Cross-team interview. Since this was with someone in the travel department (there was a LOT of travel with this job), I assumed she would ask me about my extensive travel experience...but no, it was all boring rote competency stuff (‘tell me about a time you solved a problem’). The final question was the ‘fun’ one – what was I watching on my favourite streaming service? I don’t have one, thanks. Seriously, though, your entire career is in travel, and this job is a lot about travel (both doing it and organising it), and I have travelled to one of the most dangerous places on earth multiple times, as I mentioned in my cover letter, and you’re not going to ask me a single question about that?</p>

<p>Day 52: Peer interview 2. Geniunely one of the most fun interviews I’ve ever had. She told me outright that she was putting me forward as a good prospect, calling me an Ubuntu fangirl (aw, shucks), telling me I’d fit in and it was great that I was genuinely interested in the product and open source and would fit in with their software engineers.</p>

<p>Day 65: Received an invitation to book my interview with the Talent team – they call them Talent Scientists (?! – even one of my interviewers thought that was a dumb name) – and do the most ridiculous standardised test ever, the Thomas PPA, where you pick words that are most and least like you, and then they calculate your actual personality from the words you don’t choose, or something. I pretended I was the best example of my role and chose the words that described that persona. No one ever referred to either of these standardised tests, by the way.</p>

<p>The interview booking email included&nbsp;the following line about scheduling this interview:</p>

<p><em>‘We’d appreciate it if you pick the earliest time available.’</em></p>

<p>You <strong>what</strong>?</p>

<p>You’ve been stringing me along for over two months, and you’re instructing <strong>me</strong> not to dawdle?</p>

<p>At some point around this time, I realised the main problem with this ridiculously drawn-out interview process was that I didn’t care anymore. I was so excited when I applied, and I lost every bit of that along the way. All I was doing was jumping through their hoops and answering the same types of questions. No one actually wanted to talk to me about any of the great things I’d told them about in my written interview, or even the interesting stuff I’d done in my most recent jobs, even when it was highly relevant for this job.</p>

<p>Day 78: Interview with the Talent ‘Scientist’. (Another white western woman.) This interview was so dry and robotic. 30 minutes of going backwards through my CV, with her asking the same rote questions about each job. No, I don’t know what the guy who hired me ad hoc for a few months to write some grant applications would have said my weaknesses were, but dammit she insisted I had to come up with something. 20 minutes of the same competency-based questions hurled at me for the three previous interviews. I clearly got dinged for not showing enough initiative in one of my examples and for only having done a particular aspect of my role for 12 people (when for this job I’d have needed to do it for hundreds of people).</p>

<p>There was all of 10 minutes to actually discuss working conditions at the company. This was my fourth interview, and only now were things like ‘we don’t provide you with a laptop’ coming up. (And you have to install Ubuntu on it - which, sure, eat your own dog food, but if you’re using a Macbook, installing Ubuntu is a pain. And it wasn’t as if I was actually going to be working with the product itself.) Annual leave allowances were generous, definitely above the statutory UK requirements, but not being able to float the bank holidays implied that non-Christian staff members would need to use annual leave for their own religious holidays while being mandated to take off Good Friday and Easter Monday. Salary expectations were mentioned but I literally had no idea, so that was something that would have been discussed later on in the process, had I made it that far.</p>

<p>I didn’t.</p>

<p>Day 81: Automated rejection. A long, long email I didn’t read to the end. I wonder whether their Talent ‘Scientists’ factor in interview fatigue when they judge whether you are permitted to move forward.</p>

<p>Had I continued the process, I would have gone through at least four and possibly five more interviews with:</p>

<p>- a senior member of the team</p>

<p>- the leader of the team</p>

<p>- my hiring lead</p>

<p>- one of the people I would have been working with</p>

<p>- and possibly the space-faring South African billionaire himself. I even knew what witty question I would have asked him. Alas, ‘twill never be.</p>

<p>So that’s what you can expect with Canonical. Go for it if the job is something you really want, and if you have no immediate need for a job, and if you really really REALLY like having interviews.</p>

<p>PS Just before posting this, I got an automated email asking me, “how has [sic] your interview experience?” Well, here’s your answer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/amazon_arm_servers/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/amazon_arm_servers/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37059533">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Amazon is the most successful manufacturer of Arm server chips, accounting for just over half of Arm-based server CPUs currently deployed, while some chipmakers are also now betting on Arm-based Windows PCs.</p>
<p>This information comes from a report issued by Bernstein Research which estimates that nearly 10 percent of servers across the world contain Arm processors, and 40 percent of those are located in China, as we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/02/arm_server_china/">reported</a> earlier.</p>
<p>But that total is beaten by just one company – Amazon – which has slightly above 50 percent of all Arm server CPUs in the world deployed in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) datacenters, said the analyst.</p>

    

<p>Amazon currently uses its own Graviton family of chips, designed by the Annapurna Labs division of Amazon Web Services and introduced to the world back in 2018, which are for its own internal use only. The latest iteration is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/29/aws_graviton3e_srd/">Graviton3E</a> for high-performance computing applications, introduced towards the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/01/04/inside-amazons-graviton3-arm-server-processor/">end of 2022</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>According to Bernstein, because these chips were optimized for the specific needs of AWS, the company is able to fit in more cores per socket or per rack and the chips consume less power, translating to lower spending on space and cooling.</p>
<p>It is often asserted that while Arm cores might be more energy efficient, they provide lower performance than x86 chips. However, the report said that customer testimonies compiled by Amazon claim 20 percent to 70 percent lower cost at the same performance as comparable x86 chips.</p>

        

<p>Bernstein's report estimates that Graviton represented about 20 percent of AWS CPU instances by mid-2022, most of which would have been the 7nm Graviton2, but Amazon is moving to deploy 5nm Graviton3 and 3E instances and is expected to introduce a Graviton4 with the Armv9 architecture fabricated using TSMC's 3nm production process in 2025.</p>
<p>Ampere is credited as being "arguably the second most successful Arm server CPU supplier," which the report estimates to have between 5 and 10 percent of this market. It managed to grow from essentially nothing to account for 0.6 percent of all CPU instances available from cloud providers globally by mid-2022, as per the report.</p>
<h3>Future of Huawei and Phytium CPUs 'unclear'</h3>
<p>Other companies with Arm server chips include Nvidia, which is introducing <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/17/nvidia_arm_servers/">products based on its Grace Arm CPU</a> to market, plus Huawei and Phytium in China. However, Bernstein notes that "US export controls put Phytium on the Entity List and Huawei on the Foreign Direct Product rule," as a consequence of which, both are facing difficulties in accessing foundries with advanced process node technologies and "the future of their CPUs is very unclear."</p>
<p>Looking beyond servers, Bernstein's report estimates that Arm chips powered about 12 percent of PCs shipped in the fourth quarter of 2022 (excluding Chromebooks), with the vast majority of these being Macs.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/03/aws_custom_xeon_m7i_instances/">AWS is running a 96-core, 192-thread, custom Xeon server</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/amd_aws_bergamo/">Amazon isn't sold on AMD's tiny Zen 4c cores in manycore Bergamo processors</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/19/microsoft_hiring_chip_designers/">Microsoft offers electrical engineers a lifeline as it pursues custom cloud silicon</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/27/bitnami_arm_support/">Arm has legs: VMware's Bitnami starts packaging apps for Graviton and Ampere</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The research notes that Qualcomm has invested heavily to try to replicate Apple's success with Arm-based Macs on Windows PCs, via its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/16/qualcomm_closes_nuvia_announces_chipset/">acquisition of chip designer Nuvia</a>. Bernstein expects to see Qualcomm launch the first chip later this year, and that devices such as Microsoft's Surface will be available with it shortly after.</p>
<p>However, the report warns that unlikethe "closed" software systems of Apple and the cloud providers, the open software ecosystem of Windows (sorry readers, that's what the report says), with its catalogue of x86 applications, makes introducing Windows-based PCs on a new CPU architecture a much more difficult proposition.</p>
<p>Other companies dipping a toe in the Arm-based PC market include Taiwan-based <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/16/qualcomm_arm_windows/">MediaTek</a> and Samsung, and Microsoft notably launched an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/25/windows_dev_kit_2023/">Arm-powered developer system</a>, the Windows Dev Kit 2023, late last year. ®</p>
