            <guid>37163187</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 15:28:39 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil">https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163187">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are happy to announce the initial release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/turmoil"><code>turmoil</code></a>,
a framework for developing and testing distributed systems.</p>
<p>Testing distributed systems is hard. Non-determinism is everywhere (network,
time, threads, etc.), making reproducible results difficult to achieve.
Development cycles are lengthy due to deployments. All these factors slow down
development and make it difficult to ensure system correctness.</p>
<p><code>turmoil</code> strives to solve these problems by simulating hosts, time and the
network. This allows for an entire distributed system to run within a single
process on a single thread, achieving deterministic execution. We also provide
fine grain control over the network, with support for dropping, holding and
delaying messages between hosts.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use <code>turmoil</code>, add the crate to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code><span>[dev-dependencies]</span>
<span>turmoil</span> = <span>"0.3"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://docs.rs/loom/latest/loom/#writing-tests"><code>loom</code></a>, we provide simulated networking types that mirror
<code>tokio::net</code>. Define a new module in your crate named <code>net</code> or any other name of
your choosing. In this module, list out the types that need to be toggled
between <code>turmoil</code> and <code>tokio::net</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(not(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>))]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> tokio::net::*;

<span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> turmoil::net::*;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, write your software using networking types from this local module.</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>mod</span> simulation {
    <span>#[test]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>simulate_it</span>() <span>-&gt;</span> turmoil::<span>Result</span> {
        <span>// build the simulation</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>sim</span> = turmoil::Builder::<span>new</span>().<span>build</span>();

        <span>// setup a host</span>
        sim.<span>host</span>(<span>"server"</span>, || <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// host software goes here</span>
        });

        <span>// setup the test</span>
        sim.<span>client</span>(<span>"test"</span>, <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// dns lookup for "server"</span>
            <span>let</span> <span></span><span>addr</span> = turmoil::<span>lookup</span>(<span>"server"</span>);

            <span>// test code goes here</span>

            <span>Ok</span>(())
        });

        <span>// run the simulation</span>
        sim.<span>run</span>()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each host (including the test code) runs on its own <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html"><code>Runtime</code></a>, which is
managed by the simulation. Within <code>run()</code>, the simulation steps each runtime a
configurable duration until the test code completes.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>This crate is still experimental. Your use cases and feedback are invaluable in
guiding our development.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/turmoil/issues">file issues</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/tokio">ping us on Discord in
#turmoil-simulation</a>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5650651831645025424" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
So, a while ago I built a gaming PC with the following specification:</p><div><p><span>&nbsp; Case&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dan A4 v4.1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Motherboard&nbsp; &nbsp; Z690I Strix Gaming</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Processor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i5-12400F</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; CPU Cooler&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NH-L9i-17xx Chromax Black</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NA-FD1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corsair CMK32GX5M2B5200C40</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; GPU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GeForce RTX 3070 Eagle</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Storage&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Seagate Firecuda 530 1TB</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Case fans&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Noctua A9x14 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; PSU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corsair SF750</span></p></div><p><span>And one day after months of use it froze mid-game and went into a BIOS loop and wouldn't boot. I quickly realized that only one of the&nbsp;</span>Seagate Firecuda 530 SSDs was detected. After some unscrewing and experimenting with the two drives in the two slots I found that one of them was dead.</p><p>And then I left the PC alone for a few days and turned it on again. It booted into Windows and immediately crashed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib0tZhWawGzg3BQEATkDGi381NDN5c1L9m_Tap_8MUDCHyuRRXmELQkIfAO1EJxIgI1y46Wdue0wjlqOVAdHNJc_NQnFoSCJA93Xvdf_Aiuy2iM9MjjiZk9CSUgwmulIMKxoygy3zvJb4kr8ywLUkTo8w9V1nu511qHqW2Tfm779QWdSK334Kq3w/s1024/firecuda-2.jpg"><img data-original-height="760" data-original-width="1024" height="476" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib0tZhWawGzg3BQEATkDGi381NDN5c1L9m_Tap_8MUDCHyuRRXmELQkIfAO1EJxIgI1y46Wdue0wjlqOVAdHNJc_NQnFoSCJA93Xvdf_Aiuy2iM9MjjiZk9CSUgwmulIMKxoygy3zvJb4kr8ywLUkTo8w9V1nu511qHqW2Tfm779QWdSK334Kq3w/w640-h476/firecuda-2.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>That made me wonder if the failure was temperature related; when cool it seemed to work. So, I left the Firecuda in the freezer at -18C for 30 minutes. Inserting it into an NVMe M.2 USB case I was able to see the drive on my Mac. Success!</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzvkNr-q7YxTA6V5PecJgrv0uOLzeO0oOt2P7fuvPmchXcI3b3ZS9c8mH5FxGgtKBsC6Pst1j3AcZKyV3Nfer92BVv6cUGhAWaaPZ5CSFTYxoJeCDTu9VPFq2QVYeQQs88yWq6XPQ4IrQ3APEMAzf1dnS1ByOimjbavsfXDW1UY5wkLlQt4wDOHA/s1646/firecuda-1.png"><img data-original-height="497" data-original-width="1646" height="194" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzvkNr-q7YxTA6V5PecJgrv0uOLzeO0oOt2P7fuvPmchXcI3b3ZS9c8mH5FxGgtKBsC6Pst1j3AcZKyV3Nfer92BVv6cUGhAWaaPZ5CSFTYxoJeCDTu9VPFq2QVYeQQs88yWq6XPQ4IrQ3APEMAzf1dnS1ByOimjbavsfXDW1UY5wkLlQt4wDOHA/w640-h194/firecuda-1.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Well, for a few minutes. It seemed that as the drive heated up it failed again. Which lead me to believe that there was a faulty connection somewhere on the board. Very careful plugging and unplugging of the board helped me find the right spot to squeeze one of the chips to make the SSD work: no low temperatures needed.</p><p>Now, I couldn't possibly sit and hold the SSD squeezing the chip while I copied off the data so I came up with another solution. A metal G clamp and strips of a Silicon Valley Bank credit card under the SSD to support the PCB.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the contraption with just the right amount of turns on the G clamp to get the SSD to work.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRvr7hH-IeJhEQCKuri9rMVuPK2M8CEfCR1d_v7-IZwhaviCaiaIBkw7dC_bkrpyqV2G9mxTZqgIMlSMHwpuugwKVahIXc2e2gCX1nozSIPqQ8OBnAWxHtGHdfLLtN6-YK0Xq9OSHjAiBlip32U5EGGd7mVUG7uwmKXJ-5p1uM5WsriRX-bi-aTg/s1432/firecuda-3.jpg"><img data-original-height="1432" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRvr7hH-IeJhEQCKuri9rMVuPK2M8CEfCR1d_v7-IZwhaviCaiaIBkw7dC_bkrpyqV2G9mxTZqgIMlSMHwpuugwKVahIXc2e2gCX1nozSIPqQ8OBnAWxHtGHdfLLtN6-YK0Xq9OSHjAiBlip32U5EGGd7mVUG7uwmKXJ-5p1uM5WsriRX-bi-aTg/w572-h640/firecuda-3.jpg" width="572"></a></p><p>But, of course, the SSD gets quite hot during operation so I used one of the heatsinks from the PC and another made from part of carpentry square and some thermal adhesive tape to keep things cool.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin_w7Ss4XJ7pzNHx_cl9cb_KiTKSz95dyLNngCJbc3k15dr_6QUYt_msIkoFwUVYs0mztA1rUwAa9Y8AYgG6Bhq6jSTTaupCIwHbM092LlYOte3rJJZKcIIUJ_qAk8G4YUYir5r7bv5D1lrvyNReOtDlcJLOA5Ih7PCUlHcWDk55O61eP-pB3JHQ/s1492/firecuda-4.jpg"><img data-original-height="1492" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin_w7Ss4XJ7pzNHx_cl9cb_KiTKSz95dyLNngCJbc3k15dr_6QUYt_msIkoFwUVYs0mztA1rUwAa9Y8AYgG6Bhq6jSTTaupCIwHbM092LlYOte3rJJZKcIIUJ_qAk8G4YUYir5r7bv5D1lrvyNReOtDlcJLOA5Ih7PCUlHcWDk55O61eP-pB3JHQ/w550-h640/firecuda-4.jpg" width="550"></a></p><p>During the copy operation I kept an eye on the temperatures with the thermal camera in my CAT S60 phone. Toasty.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhk1dztLcppM4o2UN8IJk2XxAd4jcPPQ61SR5KFE-YaWhNEN2MISEmviKVLsI060LnLztBhgHwVxtzKcATpIM3HjjewczjxrJNQ6atLHvw_47DBsKuVd6fJycWlzmLcIOxgLXWs-SzhA6OGp33CULOf4FPpZfguoAWZkUbHe7m3XpOb6bf-vbT8Vg/s640/firecuda-5.jpg"><img data-original-height="480" data-original-width="640" height="480" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhk1dztLcppM4o2UN8IJk2XxAd4jcPPQ61SR5KFE-YaWhNEN2MISEmviKVLsI060LnLztBhgHwVxtzKcATpIM3HjjewczjxrJNQ6atLHvw_47DBsKuVd6fJycWlzmLcIOxgLXWs-SzhA6OGp33CULOf4FPpZfguoAWZkUbHe7m3XpOb6bf-vbT8Vg/w640-h480/firecuda-5.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>With that combination I was able to copy the /Users directory off the drive for safekeeping. After that I decided to push my luck an image the entire drive into a single 1TB file using dd.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm tempted to try to permanently fix the SSD using my SMD hot air blower. But maybe I should just replace it at this point.</p><p>PS I couldn't resist using the SMD hot air blower on the chip with the red arrow on it below, and now the SSD works without having woodworking tools applied to it! It even boots in the PC.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpNU6GWNhhH3ie3A8oKIg_AgDs0BEmdfw83v6sZfXlXcR9_1qBlmHgWNEFVoDv2pGj8vlUfe8dhu49ZacN9pOjezWwuNv7LFMOdTGbq4kGXKvkNmJjo210tqAvFOgFFQIT2fET4hRBQbnyjk_S9gNqhTICgLr0YZeY3pb2haI1DwqAKF0COyK9jA/s2954/firecuda-6.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="1527" data-original-width="2954" height="330" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpNU6GWNhhH3ie3A8oKIg_AgDs0BEmdfw83v6sZfXlXcR9_1qBlmHgWNEFVoDv2pGj8vlUfe8dhu49ZacN9pOjezWwuNv7LFMOdTGbq4kGXKvkNmJjo210tqAvFOgFFQIT2fET4hRBQbnyjk_S9gNqhTICgLr0YZeY3pb2haI1DwqAKF0COyK9jA/w640-h330/firecuda-6.jpg" width="640"></a></p><br>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-218644.html">https://www.autoevolution.com/news/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-218644.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37160677">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There are two main arguments against hydrogen use in transportation. The first is that it is mostly generated from fossil fuels, which does not make it helpful against climate change. When it is genuinely green, it is obtained through electrolysis, a process that is only 70% to 80% efficient. That's not bad compared to internal combustion engines (ICEs), but fuel cell detractors use that to bash them anyway. Scientists at Tel Aviv University plan to kill that argument with a method that is over 90% efficient in generating green hydrogen.</p><div><p>
		The doctoral student Itzhak Grinberg and Dr. Oren Ben-Zvi explored the fact that photosynthesis breaks water into oxygen and hydrogen to try to reproduce the method plants adopt to do that. Microscopic organisms – probably some sort of algae – helped them with the enzymes that became the key to the idea they developed with the guidance of professors Iftach Yacoby and Lihi Adler-Abramovich. Their study was published in the June edition of Carbon Energy.</p><p>

In a plant, the sun powers the enzyme that decomposes the water molecules into gases – called hydrogenase. The solution the Israeli scientists developed was to replace the sun's power with electricity. An electrode feeds the enzymes, but the electric charge repels them. What Grinberg and Ben-Zvi did was create a chemical treatment that prevented that: a hydrogel mixed with hydrogenase.</p><p>

The researchers were pretty happy with the material they created because <em>"the gel assembles itself."</em> According to Adler-Abramovich, when it is placed in water, it makes nanometric fibers that hold hydrogenase in place. These materials are much cheaper than the platinum that electrolyzers have to use, among other precious metals. The hydrogen is also apparently produced with any kind of water, not only distilled water, as electrolyzers demand. The researchers said salt water is more beneficial to the enzyme to work, for example. That makes green hydrogen production much cheaper, without the need for any secondary process.</p><div><a id="xaegal_5" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_5.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(5, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" title="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" data-gidm="1905316" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="9"></picture></a><p>Photo: Nel ASA</p></div>

According to these scientists, it can cost 15 times more than gray hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas. Hydrogen can also be made from coal in a process called gasification – that's black or brown hydrogen. The scientists said gray, black, and brown hydrogen release 9 to 12 tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of hydrogen produced. Yet, they correspond to 95% of all hydrogen currently produced worldwide for agricultural and industrial needs. Even if this green hydrogen does not help move a vehicle, it is a welcome way to curb the production of the gray and black kinds.</p><p>

Currently, the hydrogen refueling infrastructure does not increase because green hydrogen prices are too high. In June, Alexander Vlaskamp warned that hydrogen costs four to five times more than it would be acceptable for truck buyers to use it. Although <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/fuel-cell-trucks-face-a-danger-worse-than-weight-that-s-hydrogen-costs-217098.html">the MAN CEO</a> has to justify why Volkswagen is betting so heavily on batteries, the green hydrogen cost was something that needed to be solved quickly. The Israeli production method may be the answer that can solve this once and for all. We just need to have a more refined and commercially usable system to confirm the benefits this idea may bring.</p><p>

If the prices really get more competitive, energy solar and wind farms may dedicate to producing hydrogen when there is no demand for the electricity they generate. That's a better idea than spending millions of dollars on expensive stationary storage systems: these batteries could have better uses in vehicles or houses. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/hydrogen/">Hydrogen</a> storage would still be a problem unless the gas was transformed into synthetic fuel. Hopefully, another scientific breakthrough could address that as soon as possible. We also have another idea floating around that may help solve that.</p><div><a id="xaegal_64" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_64.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(64, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg" width="860" height="483" alt="NamX's CapXtores will allegedly provide hydrogen in Gogoro fashion for the HUV to run in 2026" title="NamX's CapXtores will allegedly provide hydrogen in Gogoro fashion for the HUV to run in 2026" data-gidm="1905375" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="127"></picture></a><p>Photo: NamX</p></div>
<p>
NamX wants its first vehicle – the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/NamX%20HUV/">HUV</a> – to use swappable hydrogen capsules that can be bought anywhere. If these capsules could be refilled directly from one of the production stations, the storage problem woulxd be quickly solved. Toyota is investigating a similar solution. If we can produce green hydrogen at reasonable prices, that will be a good starting point.</p><p>

It may also be the case that we have to develop vehicles in a different way. Riversimple proposed that when it argued that we are currently trying to make fuel cells fit the cars we already have, just like some carmakers tried to use internal combustion engine (<span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/i.html#ge-internal-combustion-engine" title="ICE - click for definition">ICE</span>) platforms to make electric vehicles. It did not work. FCEVs have to be conceived around fuel cells and not the other way around. If you check the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai NEXO, they are the perfect example of what Riversimple tried to demonstrate: they look like ordinary vehicles with motors and a fuel cell instead of a combustion engine and a fuel tank. It makes sense that an established automaker will try to keep things as they are, but that will bite them back when competitors find a better way to do that. The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cey2.411">Israeli scientists</a> may have found precisely what was missing to kick this off. Find yourself a comfortable seat to follow how everything unfolds from here. <i></i></p>

<p>Over 30 years ago the late Ian Murdock
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993.txt">wrote</a>
to the comp.os.linux.development newsgroup about the completion of a brand-new
Linux release which he named "The Debian Linux Release".</p>
<p>He built the release by hand, from scratch, so to speak. Ian laid out
guidelines for how this new release would work, what approach the release
would take regarding its size, manner of upgrades, installation procedures; and
with great care of consideration for users without Internet connection.</p>
<p>Unaware that he had sparked a movement in the fledgling F/OSS community, Ian
worked on and continued to work on Debian. The release, now aided by volunteers
from the newsgroup and around the world, grew and continues to grow as one of
the largest and oldest FREE operating systems that still exist today.</p>
<p>Debian at its core is comprised of Users, Contributors, Developers, and
Sponsors, but most importantly, <strong><em>People</em></strong>. Ians drive and focus remains
embedded in the core of Debian, it remains in all of our work, it remains in
the minds and hands of the users of <em><strong>The Universal Operating System</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Debian Project is proud and happy to share our anniversary not exclusively
unto ourselves, instead we share this moment with everyone, as we come together
in celebration of a resounding community that works together, effects change,
and continues to make a difference, not just in our work but around the world.</p>
<p>Debian is present in cluster systems, datacenters, desktop computers, embedded
systems, IoT devices, laptops, servers, it may possibly be powering the web
server and device you are reading this article on, and it can also be found in
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux/">Spacecraft</a>.</p>
<p>Closer to earth, Debian fully supports projects for accessibility:
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/edu/">Debian Edu/Skolelinux</a> - an operating system
designed for educational use in schools and communities,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience">Debian Science</a> - providing free
scientific software across many established and emerging fields,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/blends/hamradio/about">Debian Hamradio</a> - for amateur
radio enthusiasts,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/">Debian-Accessibility</a> - a
project focused on the design of an operating system suited to fit the
requirements of people with disabilites, and
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/astro/">Debian Astro</a> - focused on supporting
professional and hobbyist astronomers.</p>
<p>Debian strives to give, reach, embrace, mentor, share, and teach with
internships through many programs internally and externally such as the Google
Summer of Code, Outreachy, and the Open Source Promotion Plan.</p>
<p>None of this could be possible without the vast amount of support, care, and
contributions from what started as and is still an all volunteer project.
We celebrate with each and every one who has helped shape Debian over all of
these years and toward the future.</p>
<p>Today we all certainly celebrate 30 years of Debian, but know that Debian
celebrates with each and every one of you all at the same time.</p>
<p>Over the next few days Celebration parties are planned to take place in
Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany
(CCCcamp), India, Iran, Portugal, Serbia, South Africa, and Turkey.</p>
<p>You are of course, invited to join us!</p>
<p>Check out, attend, or form your very own
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2023">DebianDay 2023 Event</a>.</p>
<p>See you then!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you all so very much.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div id="attachment_3218"><p><a href="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3218" decoding="async" src="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-300x240.png" alt="" width="300" height="240" srcset="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-300x240.png 300w, https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-768x614.png 768w, https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-375x300.png 375w, https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3218">National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab</p></div>
<p>Great. The fusion hype is bad enough already. Now its resurgence is going to interrupt the series of posts I’m in the middle of publishing in order for this post to be “timely.”</p>
<p>The first (and much bigger) round of breathless excitement came in December 2022 when the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) announced a (legitimate) breakthrough in achieving fusion: more energy came out of the target than laser energy injected.</p>
<p>At the time, I brushed it off without even reading any articles because I already knew about the NIF’s purpose and limitations, and a few headlines told me everything I needed to know. Who cares how much <em>laser</em> energy went in: how much energy went into <em>creating</em> the laser energy? The laser I used for lunar ranging took 5 kW from the wall plug and delivered 2 W of laser power for a dismal 0.04% efficiency. Such is the cost for shaping ultra-brief pulses: lots of energy is thrown away. The headlines were clearly overblown.</p>
<p>Enough students in my energy class in Spring 2023 asked about the fusion breakthrough (doesn’t that mean we’re done?) that I dug into the details. Even so, I still deemed it unworthy of writing up as a post. But a few days ago, my friend asked me if I was excited about the recent fusion news. I hadn’t heard a peep, but after searching I found a new round of articles based on a second “net gain” laser shot and realized I probably ought to put out a quantitative post on the matter, reminiscent of my blogging origins.</p>
<p>In the end, the NIF fusion accomplishment might be called a stunt.&nbsp; Stunts explore what we <em>can</em> do (often after an insane amount of preparation, practice, and failure), rather than what’s practical.&nbsp; Stunts hide the pains and present an appearance of ease and grace, but it’s a show.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, it’s as if you spot a slot machine in a casino that looks very promising. You’re dying to play, because it just feels right—mysteriously appealing to your sense of self. It calls to you. You notice that it takes $2 tokens, but you have none. You go to the window to purchase a token, and are shocked to learn that one $2 token costs $400. Not wanting to look like an uninformed fool, you gulp and buy the token. This slot machine had better live up to its promise! You pull the lever, and surprise! You actually <em>do</em> win! You put in a $2 token and the machine makes very happy noises and flashes lots of lights as it spits out…$3 (and some neutrons, oddly). Queue the headlines! Want to play again?&nbsp; Actually, this wasn’t your first shot: just the first success after years of trying (but hush!).</p>

<h2>Energetics</h2>
<p>That’s the essence of the story. The December announcement indicated that they launched 2.05&nbsp;MJ of laser energy onto the target sphere, and 3.15&nbsp;MJ came out. The recent articles indicate a second “score,” but fail to give energy specifics, other than “more” energy out. I am assuming an incremental bump, still under 4&nbsp;MJ—otherwise the factor of improvement would be prominently touted in the coverage.</p>
<p>Let’s pause to say: well done! Honestly. No sarcasm. What they did was ridiculously hard, and it finally worked after more than a decade of trying. They actually produced a significant number of fusion events! There’s no faking that, and I’d like to see you try. So let’s be clear that I’m not knocking the accomplishment in itself. My major beef is how we interpret the implications for society. To be fair, the scientists did not supply the hype. They didn’t have to: the rest of the universe was more than ready to fill in that yawning gap.</p>
<p>As I scanned articles from December 2022, most were about the triumph, a reminder that the sun works by fusion, and talk about being the first major step toward limitless clean energy. That’s what people want to hear. It plays right into our cultural mythology: humans defy all limits through ingenuity and technology. Build a story around that theme, and you’ve got yourself some guaranteed click-bait.</p>
<p>A <em>very</em> few articles mentioned the energetic price of generating the laser pulse. In particular, I found <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/department-of-energy-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-nif-livermore/672439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in The Atlantic</a> by Charles Seife:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “more energy out than laser energy in” equation masks several fundamental problems. NIF’s doped glass lasers have an efficiency of about 0.5 percent, meaning that they would have sucked in roughly 400 megajoules of energy from the grid in order to produce the 2.1 megajoules of light energy…</p></blockquote>
<p>The second was a <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/fusion-power-nif-hype-lose-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Think article</a> by Tom Hartsfield.</p>
<blockquote><p>The laser energy delivered to the target was 2.05 MJ, and the fusion output was likely about 3.15 MJ. According to multiple sources on NIF’s website, the input energy to the laser system is somewhere between 384 and 400 MJ.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that’s just the laser energetics. The whole facility consumes scads more for countless other purposes. According to the <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLNL NIF FAQs</a> (are you letting me get away with a triple acronym?),</p>
<blockquote><p>NIF’s 192 powerful laser beams, housed in a <b>10-story building</b> the size of <b>3 football fields</b>, can deliver more than 2 million joules of ultraviolet laser energy in billionth-of-a-second pulses onto a target about the size of a pencil eraser.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is mine, to highlight the point that this is a massive laser and facility. It’s like ten Walmart superstores stacked on top of each other. The lighting <em>alone</em> is likely taking tens of kilowatts, which could hypothetically be run for less than a minute on the energy gain from the fusion pop.&nbsp; It would be fun to count all the megajoules that went into press coverage of the event!</p>
<h2>Power Plant Energetics</h2>
<p>Let’s connect the 3 MJ output to that of actual power plants, forgetting for a moment the tremendous energy loss represented in getting 3 MJ out from a 400 MJ input. A typical electrical power plant (nuclear, coal, etc.) delivers about 1 GW of electrical power. But it’s a heat engine operating at 30–40% thermodynamic efficiency. So it takes roughly 3 GW of <em>thermal</em> energy to export 1&nbsp;GW as electricity. 3&nbsp;GW is 3&nbsp;GJ per second, or 3,000&nbsp;MJ per second.</p>
<p>The same efficiency factor would apply to a putative fusion plant. The concept behind fusion power is that it’s <em>just</em> another thermal source—an excruciatingly elaborate way to boil water to make steam to drive a turbine to run a generator. So our 3&nbsp;MJ would need to be replicated 1,000 times per second to amount to 3&nbsp;GW.</p>
<p>Laser repetition rates can be all over the map. 1,000 Hz is not in itself unusually fast by any stretch. What is the repetition rate of the NIF laser? Handily, LLNL <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/nif-target-shot-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides these statistics</a>. The average since 2015 is 377 shots per year, with a high of 417 and a low of 327. That’s about a shot per day—or two on a good day. It’s only 100 million times shy of 1 kHz. Oh dear.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/12/the-energy-departments-fusion-breakthrough-its-not-really-about-generating-electricity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> of physicist Bob Rosner in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists helpfully puts the NIF in context (it’s not about societal energy). In it, he reinforces some of what we’ve covered, and adds some financial detail.</p>
<blockquote><p>This facility can do one shot a day; this is at slightly more than two megajoules (of output). For an energy source, it would have to do the same thing at least 10 times a second. If you ask, “Do the lasers exist that can do this?” Not in your dream. The pellet cost a bit over $100,000 to manufacture.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 10 shots per second, I gather, is if the fusion yield could be improved by a couple orders of magnitude—approaching actual break-even. At $100,000 per (literal) pop, and even just ten shots per second, we’re talking a cool million dollars per second!</p>
<p>Let’s wave a magic wand for a minute and say that the 400 MJ input produced a 700 MJ output for a net of 300 MJ: 100 times the recent breakthrough. This accords with the ten shots per second mentioned above. What is the price of the delivered electricity? After thermodynamic inefficiency is accounted, we get 100 MJ out for $100,000 cost, or $1,000 per megajoule. We are accustomed to using the kilowatt-hour (kWh) as a measure of delivered energy, which is 3.6 MJ. The cost becomes, then, $3,600 per kWh. Typical electricity costs are in the neighborhood of $0.15–0.20 per kWh, so we’re dealing with a cost that is 20,000 times higher than nominal. And don’t forget, we used a magic wand to even get there. It’s closer to 2 million times more expensive currently, and as a net energy loser to boot.</p>
<p>Granted, the research and development phase is not characteristic of operational costs. But try knocking on a venture capitalist’s door and making the argument that you can trim costs to 0.005% of their current amount. Slam!</p>
<p>This massive reduction, incidentally, translates to a cost of $5 per pellet. I don’t care what mass-production slave labor you might dream of employing. A cryogenic hydrogen-ice target made to demanding precision specifications, containing deuterium and transmuted lithium (to make tritium) is not going to cost $5. You lost me at cryogenic. Also, they would have made many pellets by now and I’m sure don’t relish spending $100,000 each. If they’re clever enough to accomplish fusion, they would be clever enough to have already reduced costs dramatically if it were straightforward.</p>
<h2>Fusion Efficiency</h2>
<p>Here’s the part where I earn my keep as a physicist translating technical matters. I found details about the NIF targets in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/FST10-3697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 paper</a> by Bernard Koziokiemski et al. The abstract alone clarifies much. The target is a shell of hydrogen ice 75 μm thick on a 1 mm radius sphere, cooled below 19 K. Pause for a moment to contemplate the challenges that would be involved if trying to maintain the targets at such low temperatures in a 3 GW power plant “furnace” environment.</p>
<p>Hydrogen ice has a density of 86&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which in the specified volume (10<sup>−9</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) translates to 5×10<sup>19</sup> lattice sites (nuclei/atoms). Deuterium/tritium ice has a higher density than hydrogen ice, but the atomic spacing is unchanged so that the pure hydrogen calculation gives the correct number.</p>
<p>How many fusion events took place to crank out 3&nbsp;MJ of energy? Each deuterium–tritium fusion event releases 17.6&nbsp;MeV of energy, or 2.8×10<sup>−12</sup>&nbsp;J. Calling this 3×10<sup>−12</sup>&nbsp;J (among friends; makes for easy math), we find that we need 10<sup>18</sup> fusion events to amount to 3 MJ. Each event involves 2 nuclei. We calculated above that the shell contains 50×10<sup>18</sup> nuclei, meaning that 4% of them participated in fusion.</p>
<p>This event therefore produced a 4% yield. I’m actually very impressed! That’s nothing to sneeze at. The laser-induced implosion is very fast, very violent, and leaves lots of room for nuclei failing to “find” each other if not compressed almost flawlessly and symmetrically to sub-micron scale. Before doing the calculation, I might have guessed a yield orders-of-magnitude smaller.</p>
<p>So this news is both good and bad. Hats off for cracking into single-digit yield! But that leaves less room to improve. Even at 100% efficiency, we’d get just 25 times more energy out, or 75&nbsp;MJ. That’s still not enough to pay for the price of admission (400&nbsp;MJ, just for the laser part).</p>
<h2>NIF Purpose</h2>
<p>This avenue, therefore, seems painfully far away from achieving practical societal energy. Even 100% yield (for the present design) could not produce net energy. Even if it <em>could</em> produce net energy, the laser repetition rate is a million times too slow. And then, even if the laser could fire fast enough, the cost of each target is prohibitively high by over four orders-of-magnitude.</p>
<p>Then, we have a raft of practical considerations for turning an experimental facility into a functional power plant. No design exists at present to extract the heat produced at NIF. That’s not what it’s for—it wouldn’t make any sense to put effort in that direction.&nbsp; Such a design would have the unenviable thermal challenge of delivering cryogenic targets into a hellfire-hot environment. For energy extraction, tokamak designs like ITER are less unsuitable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In either case, all this to boil water. Bless their hearts.</p>
<p>But the NIF was never “about” societal energy. Its primary purpose is nuclear weapons research. This pesky thing called the nuclear test ban treaty means we can’t just go around detonating nuclear bombs whenever we feel like it. Surely we did not run out of South Pacific island paradises to blow to smithereens. The NIF allows study of matter at extremely high energy density. Other targets besides deuterium–tritium can be placed in the converging laser beams. Essentially, we can create the unbelievably hot conditions relevant to nuclear detonations in the safety of our own national lab.</p>
<p>Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) constitutes a small fraction of <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/nif-target-shot-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIF’s laser shots</a>. Most of the work is labeled HED for high-energy-density research. The people at NIF are under no false impression about the potential of this type of approach for generating societal energy. They know what they’re about. At the same time, why not poke? It certainly has some benefits in terms of public attention, translating to funding.</p>
<h2>How Embarrassing</h2>
<p>So what can we say about the public reaction to this news? Headlines in December gushed about the dawn of a new era of limitless energy. People got excited. Many of my students came away thinking it was basically a done deal—now just a matter of putting into practice. That’s how it works in entertainment: a genius breakthrough followed by immediate implementation free of complication. The emphasis is on human ingenuity, not on physical reality. In my experience, ideas are a dime-a-dozen. The hard part is coming up with an idea that can be practically brought to fruition.</p>
<p>I often encounter a disconnect on matters of this sort when interacting with people—whether about space colonization, fusion, renewable energy, or prospects for modernity’s continuation. I frequently find myself outnumbered. Why am I so negative about these things? The disconnect might have something to do with how information is received and processed. If all I had to go on were popular media accounts, word-of-mouth, and entertainment, I’d probably be similarly miscalibrated. But my background, training, experiences, and accomplishments enable an uncommon approach that is less dependent on what other people are saying, and more strongly tied to the underlying drivers. That’s not to say I’ll always have a more accurate take, but just that my process generally involves more independent thought and analysis than I suspect it does for most people.&nbsp; I’m no fun at parties.</p>
<p>In any case, the public reaction to the fusion story tells me a lot about our collective psychology. To me, it speaks to a sense of desperation. I think people sense that the “bad news” side of the ledger is overcrowded of late, and it’s starting to dawn on people that the future could possibly be worse than the present. This causes a cognitive dissonance in that our cultural narrative is one of progress, growth, and innovation. How can these competing visions be squared? News of fusion has the effect of temporarily permitting people to shed the anxiety and embrace the dream all the more strongly. Words that come to mind are: embarrassing, pathetic, humiliating.</p>
<p>What if you see a movie star across the street, overcome by excitement as they stop, look at you, and wave enthusiastically. You, of course, wave back. They <em>see</em> you. They recognize you as special, just as you knew all along. Only, it then becomes apparent that their movie star fling (according to the tabloids) was passing behind you. Now how do you feel? How could you fall for it? That’s the question I find myself asking about the fusion hype. It’s so obviously far from relevant, how could we (and the media establishment) fall for it?</p>
<p>My suspicion is that it plays perfectly into our culture’s irrational hopes and dreams. We have a weak spot in our armor for things that sound too good to be true. We want to believe the narrative (mythology) that humans are exempt from all limits, and that our ingenuity will save the day every time. We want to believe that the movie star would adore us, if only they got the chance to meet us.&nbsp; Instant besties!</p>
<p>Many in our culture truly believe in “the amazing future,” uncritically extrapolating our fossil-fueled joy ride into ever-more impressive innovations and technologies. Of course we will someday roam the galaxy. Of course we will have warp drive (how else would we roam the galaxy?). Of course fusion is a necessary stepping stone on this path. It’s silly to imagine warp drive and teleportation without first cracking fusion. So societal fusion power <em>has</em> to happen, in their imaginations.</p>
<p>The problem is that such imaginings are not tethered to physical reality. They are driven by ideology, or I would say mythology. The physical reality is that we are living in an ecologically, evolutionarily untested paradigm that is very recent (on relevant timescales) and powered by patently unsustainable practices and resource use. The cost is rapid ecological degradation and global disruption to the biosphere. It seems quite clear that the track we are on does not lead to the stars, but to ignominious self-termination of this whacky mode called modernity. It simply does not add up, once the mythology is stripped away. The venture capitalist of nature is about to slam the door on our faces.</p>

            <guid>37159744</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 10:51:56 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/">https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we announced the launch of the Mullvad Browser, a browser built by the Tor Project team and distributed by <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">Mullvad</a>.</p>
<p>Mullvad and the Tor Project have been part of the same community that is dedicated to developing technology that prioritizes protecting people's right to privacy for many years now. Mullvad contributes to the Tor Project at the highest level of membership, Shallot, and were a founding member of the Tor Project's Membership Program. They approached us to help them develop their browser because they wanted to leverage our expertise to create a product that is built on the same principles and with similar safety levels as the Tor Browser&nbsp;-- but that works independently of the Tor network. The result is the Mullvad Browser, a free, privacy-preserving web browser to challenge the all-too-prevalent business model of exploiting people's data for profit.</p>
<h2>Why use the Mullvad Browser?</h2>
<p>In short: the Mullvad Browser is Tor Browser without the Tor Network -- a browser that allows anyone to take advantage of all the browser privacy features the Tor Project has created. If people want to connect the browser with a VPN they trust, they can easily do so.</p>
<p>Our goal was to give users the privacy protections of Tor Browser without Tor. For instance, the Mullvad Browser applies a "hide-in-the-crowd" approach to online privacy by creating a similar fingerprint for all of its users. The browser's 'out-of-the-box' configurations and settings will mask many parameters and features commonly used to extract information from a person's device that can make them identifiable, including fonts, rendered content, and several hardware APIs. By default, Mullvad Browser has private mode enabled, blocks third-party trackers and cookies, and makes it easy to delete cookies between visiting pages during the same session.</p>
<p>The Mullvad Browser is another option for internet users who are looking for a privacy browser that doesn't need a bunch of extensions and plugins to enhance their privacy and reduce the factors that can accidentally de-anonymize themselves. And unlike other browsers on the market, Mullvad Browser's business model does not rely on capitalizing on users' behavioral data.</p>
<h2>Why collaborate?</h2>
<p>Our mission at the Tor Project is to advance human rights by building technology that protects people's privacy, provides anonymity and helps them bypass censorship. We want to give people options and demonstrate to the world that through partnerships like these, you can create technology with these values in mind.</p>
<p>That is why we jumped at the opportunity to help Mullvad with their browser. We agree with them that demand for a browser that is built to the same standards as Tor Browser exists.</p>
<p>We hope to inspire other tech builders and organizations to take a page out of our playbook --and think of privacy as a 'feature' that can enhance user experience-- and not as an afterthought. This collaboration with Mullvad illustrates that it is possible to build privacy-preserving technology that protects users like ours does together, rather than in competition with each other.</p>
<h2>What does that mean for us and Tor Browser?</h2>
<p>Let's be clear: Tor Browser is here to stay, and we'll continue to iterate and improve on it and our other services. We know that millions of users around the world rely on Tor Browser and other solutions that the Tor Project offers to safely connect to the internet, to browse anonymously online and to circumvent censorship. Therefore Tor Browser will continue to exist.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to continue to maintain and improve Tor Browser, it is still one of the few solutions that provides anonymity online because it funnels traffic through the Tor network. A privacy browser plus the Tor network is a powerful combination and sometimes one of the few options that censored and surveilled users have in their region to freely and safely access the internet. Tor Browser is also a free solution for all, making it an affordable solution for people at risk.</p>
<p>This joint project with Mullvad has brought positive changes to Tor Browser by allowing us to address legacy issues, fix vulnerabilities for Tor Browser and make necessary UX improvements that benefit both Tor and Mullvad Browsers, as well as the global privacy-preserving tech ecosystem. And, over the last five years, the Tor Project has launched a number of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift">initiatives to increase adoption of our technologies</a> and made <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-advancing-privacy-innovation/">significant improvements</a> to the usability of our own products. And we are currently working on more to come!</p>
<p>We encourage you to check out the Mullvad Browser and its capabilities. It can be used without Mullvad VPN, although the combination is recommended. If you want to learn more about this partnership, you can visit <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">Mullvad.net/browser.</a></p>

<p>New evidence suggests the world’s largest known asteroid impact structure is buried near the New South Wales town of Deniliquin.</p>


<p><em>Acknowledgment: I’d like to thank my colleague Tony Yeates, who originated the view of the Deniliquin multi-ring structure as an impact structure – and who was instrumental to this work.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195122002487">recent research</a> published by myself and my colleague Tony Yeates in the journal Tectonophysics, we investigate what we believe – based on many years of experience in asteroid impact research – is the world’s largest known impact structure, buried deep in the earth in southern New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Deniliquin structure, yet to be further tested by drilling, spans up to 520 kilometres in diameter. This exceeds the size of the near-300km-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vredefort_impact_structure">Vredefort</a> impact structure in South Africa, which to date has been considered the world’s largest.</p>
<h2>Hidden traces of Earth’s early history</h2>
<p>The history of Earth’s bombardment by asteroids is largely concealed. There are a few reasons for this. The first is erosion: the process by which gravity, wind and water slowly wear away land materials through time.</p>
<p>When an asteroid strikes, it creates a crater with an uplifted core. This is similar to how a drop of water splashes upward from a transient crater when you drop a pebble in a pool.</p>
<p>This central uplifted dome is a key characteristic of large impact structures. However, it can erode over thousands to millions of years, making the structure difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Structures can also be buried by sediment through time. Or they might disappear as a result of subduction, wherein tectonic plates can collide and slide below one another into Earth’s mantle layer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, new geophysical discoveries are unearthing signatures of impact structures formed by asteroids that may have reached tens of kilometres across – heralding a paradigm shift in our understanding of how Earth evolved over eons. These include pioneering discoveries of impact “ejecta”, which are the materials thrown out of a crater during an impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1387647317300714">Researchers think</a> the oldest layers of these ejecta, found in sediments in early terrains around the world, might signify the tail end of the Late Heavy Bombardment of Earth. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1387647317300714">latest evidence</a> suggests Earth and the other planets in the Solar System were subject to intense asteroid bombardments until about 3.2 billion years ago, and sporadically since.</p>
<p>Some large impacts are correlated with mass extinction events. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Alvarez hypothesis</a>, named after father and son scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, explains how non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out as a result of a large asteroid strike some 66 million years ago.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the Deniliquin structure</h2>
<p>The Australian continent and its predecessor continent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, have been the target of numerous asteroid impacts. These have resulted in at least 38 confirmed and 43 potential impact structures, ranging from relatively small craters to large and completely buried structures.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 0 0&quot;></svg>" data-src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip"></a><figcaption>This map shows the distribution of circular structures of uncertain, possible or probable impact origin on the Australian continent and offshore. Green dots represent confirmed impact craters. Red dots represent confirmed impact structures that are more than 100km wide, whereas red dots inside white circles are more than 50km wide. Yellow dots represent likely impact structures. <em>Image credit: Andrew Glikson and Franco Pirajno</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As you’ll recall with the pool and pebble analogy, when a large asteroid hits Earth, the underlying crust responds with a transient elastic rebound that produces <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/CB-954.pdf">a central dome</a>.</p>
<p>Such domes, which can slowly erode and/or become buried through time, may be all that’s preserved from the original impact structure. They represent the deep-seated “root zone” of an impact. Famous examples are found in the Vredefort impact structure and the 170km-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">Chicxulub crater</a> in Mexico. The latter represents the impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2000, Tony Yeates suggested magnetic patterns beneath the Murray Basin in New South Wales <a href="https://www.aseg.org.au/publications/preview-old">likely represented</a> a massive, buried impact structure. An analysis of the region’s updated geophysical data between 2015 and 2020 confirmed the existence of a 520km diameter structure with a seismically defined dome at its centre.</p>
<p>The Deniliquin structure has all the features that would be expected from a large-scale impact structure. For instance, magnetic readings of the area reveal a symmetrical rippling pattern in the crust around the structure’s core. This was likely produced during the impact as extremely high temperatures created intense magnetic forces.</p>
<p>A central low magnetic zone corresponds to 30km-deep deformation above a seismically defined mantle dome. The top of this dome is about 10km <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL065345">shallower than the top</a> of the regional mantle.</p>
<p>Magnetic measurements also show evidence of “radial faults”: fractures that radiate from the centre of a large impact structure. This is further accompanied by small magnetic anomalies which may represent igneous “dikes”, which are sheets of magma injected into fractures in a pre-existing body of rock.</p>

<p>Radial faults, and igneous sheets of rocks that form within them, are typical of large impact structures and can be found in the Vredefort structure and the <a href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/maps/article/viewFile/14921/14892">Sudbury impact structure</a> in Canada.</p>
<p>Currently, the bulk of the evidence for the Deniliquin impact is based on geophysical data obtained from the surface. For proof of impact, we’ll need to collect physical evidence of shock, which can only come from drilling deep into the structure.</p>
<h2>When did the Deniliquin impact happen?</h2>
<p>The Deniliquin structure was likely located on the eastern part of the Gondwana continent, prior to it splitting off into several continents (including the Australian continent) much later.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541858/original/file-20230809-21-qpfxif.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541858/original/file-20230809-21-qpfxif.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 0 0&quot;></svg>" data-src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541858/original/file-20230809-21-qpfxif.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip"></a><figcaption>The Deniliquin structure was likely created in eastern Gondwana during the Late Ordovician.<em> Image credit: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08941-3#rightslink">Zhen Qiu et al, 2022</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The impact that caused it may have occurred during what’s known as the Late Ordovician mass extinction event. Specifically, I think it may have triggered what’s called the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction">Hirnantian glaciation stage</a>, which lasted between 445.2 and 443.8 million years ago, and is also defined as the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X23000655">Ordovician-Silurian extinction event</a>.</p>
<p>This huge glaciation and mass extinction event <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction">eliminated</a> about 85% of the planet’s species. It was more than double the scale of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Chicxulub impact</a> that killed off the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>It is also possible the Deniliquin structure is older than the Hirnantian event, and may be of an early Cambrian origin (about 514 million years ago). The next step will be to gather samples to determine the structure’s exact age. This will require drilling a deep hole into its magnetic centre and dating the extracted material.</p>
<p>It’s hoped further studies of the Deniliquin impact structure will shed new light on the nature of early <a href="https://www.livescience.com/37584-paleozoic-era.html">Paleozoic</a> Earth.</p>

<p><em>Hello dear reader, I will be improving this article based on the feedback that I received. I don't see myself as an expert, more like ever-learning amateur, so if you point out something, I will try to understand your point of view and correct any mistakes. Feel free to comment the article below, any and all feedback is welcome, just stay civil. </em></p>


<p>In the grand scheme of a software engineering path, there's a thread that weaves through every project, every failure, and every challenge. That thread is people. As a person with an engineering background, I do enjoy solving hard puzzles and fixing problems. But the most complex, intriguing, and ultimately rewarding aspect of my journey has always been managing people. I wasn’t a people person before — It’s not something I could do naturally — I had to read a lot, learn a lot, try different methodologies, and figure stuff out on the fly, but it’s still the most rewarding aspect of my job.</p>


<p>This guide is born out of those countless interactions, conversations, and experiences. Things that I’ve failed at. It's a distillation of lessons learned, a roadmap to help you, the engineering managers of today, navigate the choppy waters of managing difficult software engineers. </p>


<p><em>I'm not an expert, and am not trying to position myself as one, so if you disagree with anything here, let me know in the comments and we'll have a healthy discussion. </em></p>


<pre>🏄 Some people call developers snowflakes — they’re brilliant, opinionated, and unique in many ways. It’s easy to manage those that don’t deviate too much from all the other engineers. Still, I will focus more on those difficult employees rather than the general management of all developers.</pre>


<p>Why focus on the difficult ones, you ask? Well, it's simple. When everything is smooth sailing, when your team is balanced like a well-oiled machine, you don't need a guide. It's when you have conflicts, ego clashes, lone wolves, or when you're faced with a team member who's not pulling their weight, causing friction, or just not fitting in that's when you need a compass to guide you. And that's what this guide aims to be.</p>


<p>In the following sections, we'll delve into the various types of difficult employees you might encounter - from procrastinators and lone wolves to negative Nancies and over-promisers. We'll explore typical scenarios, describe their behaviors, and, most importantly, provide strategies for managing difficult employees effectively.</p>


<p>I will also touch a bit on the importance of communication techniques like Nonviolent Communication. We'll walk through the steps of implementing a Performance Improvement Plan and when it might be time to escalate issues and part ways.</p>


<pre>🏄 This guide is not a magic wand that will solve all your management challenges. But it's a starting point. It's also very subjective. Your mileage may vary. It's a collection of insights and advice that I hope will help you become a better manager to your team, even if some of them are not the most pleasant people to work with.</pre>


<p>So, let's embark on this journey together. Let's navigate these rough seas with your crew and turn challenges into opportunities for growth. As any seasoned sailor will tell you, it's not the calm seas but the storms that make a good captain.</p>


<h2 id="h-effectively-managing-the-norm">Effectively Managing the Norm</h2>


<p>Before diving deep into managing the difficult engineers, let’s focus first on managing those that are not as atypical. The "norm" refers to the majority of your team members who come in daily, do their job, and contribute to the team’s success — they’re competent professionals with healthy mental states and won't require any special attention. No issues, no conflicts, no special needs. These individuals form the backbone of your team and will probably represent 90% of the people you meet and work with.</p>


<p>I use a simple strategy to make sure these kinds of employees are happy — Trust, Growth, Comfort.</p>


<h3 id="h-trust">Trust</h3>


<p><strong>Trusting Them to Do the Right Things</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Assume Intelligence</strong>: Always start with the assumption that your team members are intelligent and will make informed decisions. This mindset fosters an environment of respect and empowers individuals to take initiative. It’s even better to assume they’re smarter than you and might know something you don’t. You probably hired them, so unless you’re hiring people who are worse than yourself (and I sure hope you don’t), you should assume they have better ideas than you do.</li>


<li><strong>Accountable Autonomy</strong>: Give them the freedom to make decisions and act on them. Keeping them accountable for those decisions is far more productive than questioning their every move. Autonomy comes with the price of accountability and should be stated explicitly. Do whatever you want, but you’re responsible for the fuck-ups as well.</li>


<li><strong>Allow fixable mistakes to happen</strong>: Trust means allowing room for errors. Of course, I’m not talking about senior developers with privileged access running rm -rf on production or dropping production database and deleting backups, and saying whoops — that’s a cause for corrective action. The mistakes can be divided into two parts: Mistakes that can be fixed and mistakes that cannot. Mistakes that can be fixed is anything where you write a postmortem, do a debriefing and continue on your way with lessons learned. Mistakes that cannot be fixed is people dying, something blowing up or your company going bankrupt. Allow them to make mistakes from which the company can recover and help them learn from them. <em><strong>Update: </strong>I suggest you also read the comments, there's a big discussion there regarding this point.</em></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h-growth">Growth</h3>


<p><strong>Challenging Them to Become Better</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge Regularly</strong>: Push your team members out of their comfort zones. Not talking about dropping them cold into projects where they have zero knowledge and expecting them to perform. More of — encouraging them to take on tasks that stretch their abilities, a bit more complicated than they’re used to, fostering their growth.</li>


<li><strong>Praise and Recognition</strong>: Recognize their achievements. Show them the milestones they can reach and celebrate with them when they do — be it with monetary incentives or a public announcement of their achievements. This not only boosts morale but also motivates them to aim higher.</li>


<li><strong>Constructive Feedback and clear Path</strong>: While praise is essential, it's equally important to address areas where they’re lacking. Nobody is perfect, and some of us are better at different things. However, the focus should be on improving where we excel and pulling up those things we’re bad at. They’re good at algorithms but bad at databases — time to deep dive into DBs. They’re good at small tasks but struggle with bigger things — time to learn software architecture. In any way, the feedback should be a tool for growth, not a weapon for criticism.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h-comfort">Comfort</h3>


<p><strong>Keeping It Comfortable</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Limit Interruptions</strong>: Respect their time and focus. Avoid unnecessary meetings and interruptions. Embrace asynchronous communication, allowing team members to respond when it's most convenient, fostering efficiency and respect for individual work rhythms. If the wheels are turning, there’s no need to run around interrupting them constantly. Let people work.</li>


<li><strong>Streamlined Processes</strong>: Ensure that all auxiliary processes, from software tools to administrative tasks, are efficient, user-friendly, and non-interrupting (see above). A smooth operational environment reduces frustration and allows team members to focus on what needs to be done without constant notifications.</li>


<li><strong>Less thinking, more creating</strong>: As software engineers are more creative, the fewer decisions they have to make outside of their project, the better decisions they make inside of the project. Instead of them figuring out, “Is tomorrow a non-working day or not” — make the info easily accessible. Instead of them figuring out where to get snacks — have snacks ready. You get the idea.</li>
</ul>


<p>The list above can be the catalyst that propels your team to a new steady height of productivity. These are low-hanging fruits that can create a positive atmosphere that permeates every line of code. It can enhance the quality of the software your team produces, ensuring that every product you deliver is as good as it possibly can be.</p>


<p>But let's not sugarcoat it - being an effective leader in a software engineering team is not without its challenges. You're dealing with people, each with their unique personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.</p>


<pre>🏄 One of the most common - and often most daunting - challenges is dealing with difficult employees. Whether it's the brilliant coder who can't meet a deadline, the seasoned engineer who struggles with teamwork, or the talented newcomer who's always negative — there will be many, many individuals that will not conform to the normal management described above, and you’ll need to adapt.</pre>


<p>Let's explore the challenging types of software engineers, understand their behaviors, and learn practical strategies to manage them. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about building great software; it's about having fun while building great teams.</p>


<h2 id="h-difficult-software-engineers">Difficult Software Engineers</h2>


<p><em>I use the term "difficult" to differentiate between those employees where everything is going smoothly, and those where more effort is required.</em></p>


<p>Why is it important to understand different types of difficult employees? Well, think of it this way - if you're trying to debug a piece of code, you first need to understand what each line of code is doing, right? Similarly, to address and manage problematic behaviors effectively, you first need to understand these behaviors, their motivations, and their impact on the team.</p>


<p>In this section, we'll explore a variety of difficult employee types that you might encounter in a software engineering team. Each of these types presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth and improvement. By understanding these behaviors, you'll be better equipped to manage them effectively, turning potential obstacles into stepping stones toward a more harmonious and productive team.</p>


<p><em>I want to note that some scenarios are hyperbolized, and I’m not a communications guru, so if you have better examples— please put them in the comments; much appreciated.</em></p>


<h3 id="the-procrastinator">The Procrastinator</h3>


<p>Imagine this: It's a week before a major software release. Your team is buzzing with activity, tying up loose ends, and running final tests. But there's one team member, let's call him Joe, who's yet to complete a crucial piece of the project. Despite repeated reminders, Joe always seems to have an excuse — the build is taking too long, or it works on my machine but is failing on staging — always promises to get it fixed by “tomorrow". This is a classic example of a Procrastinator.</p>


<p>Procrastinators tend to delay tasks, often focusing on less important tasks while ignoring the critical ones. They may have poor time management skills, often underestimating the time required to complete tasks. This behavior can lead to missed deadlines, increased stress for the team, and potential risks to the project.</p>


<p>Managing a Procrastinator requires a balance of firmness and support. Set clear deadlines and regularly check in on their progress. Make them accountable for those deadlines. Help them prioritize tasks and offer time management training if necessary. Ensure they update the Project Management tools daily with the progress made and things finished.</p>


<p><strong>Remember, the goal is not micromanaging but guiding them toward better work habits.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-lone-wolf">The Lone Wolf</h3>


<p>Picture this: Your team is brainstorming ideas for a new feature. Ideas are flying around, and the energy is high. But there's one person, let's call her Lisa, who's sitting quietly, not participating. Later, you find out that Lisa has gone ahead and started working on the feature without discussing her approach with the team. She assumed she knows best how to tackle the problem. This is a typical Lone Wolf scenario.</p>


<p>Lone Wolves assume they’re the most competent person and prefer to work alone, often resisting collaborative efforts — I mean, why would you need someone else’s help if they’re far inferior to you? Usually, they do not participate in team discussions unless to tell everyone that they “could’ve done that in 3 days”. While their self-reliance can sometimes be an asset, it can also lead to a lack of cohesion and potential misalignment with team goals. And most importantly — people don’t enjoy working with Lone Wolves.</p>


<pre>🏄 I see Lone Wolves as a teenager mentality. They’re stuck in this mindset that they’re the most brilliant badass coders ever.</pre>


<p>There are two ways to manage the Lone Wolf — to embrace or make them collaborate. Embracing the Lone Wolves means that this person is of very high value to your business, and keeping him comfortable is more important than the overall team morale. Not recommended, but still a possible tradeoff if the Lone Wolf is a 100x Engineer in your eyes.</p>


<p>Managing a Lone Wolf involves forcing a culture of collaboration. Encourage them to share their ideas in the meetings and involve them in team decisions more directly. It would be great if you could put them in a team where they would not be the smartest. Assign them a mentor to help them see themselves in a different light. Give them tasks that require collaboration and, most important of all — provide constructive criticism of their behavior and set ground rules for collaboration — they can either stay on the same level as they are now or grow out of this lone wolf mentality and be an even more awesome coder who people enjoy working with.</p>


<h3 id="the-negative-nancy">The Negative Nancy</h3>


<p>Let's set the scene: Your team is in a meeting discussing a new project. There's a sense of excitement in the air, a buzz of anticipation. But then there's one person, let's call him Mark, who seems to find a problem with every idea, a flaw in every plan. He constantly focuses on the negatives, rarely offers solutions, and thinks everything is impossible and the status quo is just fine. This is your typical Negative Nancy.</p>


<p>First of all — seeing issues in ideas is not a problem per se. It’s mostly the negative way the issue is portrayed. Suppose there’s a challenge that needs to be overcome to achieve the idea. In that case, Negative Nancies usually tend to say it’s impossible because of X, not that “we can make it happen if we do X and Y, which will require significant effort, but it’s still doable.”</p>


<p>Negative Nancies tend to overly focus on the negative aspects of situations, overlooking potential solutions. They may complain frequently, resist change, and spread negativity within the team. This behavior can dampen team morale and hinder creativity and innovation. “Why are they forcing us to do X? Urgh, I like how things are now.”</p>


<p>Managing a Negative Nancy involves understanding where they’re coming from — from a position of “nothing should affect my comfort, the more issues I find, the less I need to do and the less I need to move out of my comfort zone”. This negativity should be addressed directly and privately, asking them to bring solutions instead of problems. Encourage positive interactions and remind them that change will happen regardless of them and that things will move on without them if they continue to focus on the negatives. If the behavior continues, involving HR or considering whether this employee is a good fit for the team may be necessary.</p>


<h3 id="the-over-promiser">The Over-Promiser</h3>


<p>Imagine this: You're planning a new software release. One of your team members, let's call her Sarah, promises to deliver a complex functionality within a month. You're impressed by her confidence, but two weeks after she told you that “everything is fine, I’m handling it,” the functionality is nowhere near complete; even worse, it’s about 20% done. This is a classic Over-Promiser scenario.</p>


<p>Over-Promisers tend to be overly optimistic about their capabilities or the time required to complete tasks and secretive when things don’t go as planned. Even during status updates, they can say, “It’s going great,” even though they’re struggling to find a solution and face some blockers — because they still hope to finish it on time. They often fail to deliver on their promises, which leads to frustration and mistrust within the team and with the Product Owners.</p>


<pre>🏄 Over-Promisers are usually the younger developers who have not missed deadlines that often yet, and they’re still getting the hang of how much they can do and how fast.</pre>


<p>Managing an Over-Promiser involves setting realistic expectations together with the teammates — figuring out a proper deadline for this big thing that needs to be built and splitting it up into meaningful tasks (also together with the teammates) — after that, everyone agrees on how much time each of those parts will take. I don’t think there’s a way to help them make more accurate commitments besides getting more experience. If it’s a senior dev — make them accountable for the deadlines that they set. Encourage them to communicate early and openly about any challenges they're facing.</p>


<h3 id="the-know-it-all">The Know-It-All</h3>


<p>Possible Scenario: You're in a team meeting, discussing a complex problem. Different team members suggest solutions, debating pros and cons, and a healthy collaboration is happening. But then, all of a sudden, someone, let’s call him Alex, speaks up and says that he’s heard enough, everyone is stupid, all the solutions are bullshit, and his solution is the only correct one. No way you should question or poke holes in his suggestion, as nobody is more brilliant than him. He vehemently dismisses others' ideas and resists feedback. This is your typical Know-It-All.</p>


<pre>🏄 It’s very similar to lone wolf, but they don’t insist on working alone — they insist on their solution being built and praised.</pre>


<p>Know-It-Alls tend to be arrogant and closed-minded. They often lack the ability to listen to others and are highly resistant to change or new ideas. As you can imagine, this behavior is quite annoying for others who want to spar with ideas and figure out the best way to build something. Overall this stifles creativity, hinders team collaboration, and creates a hostile work environment.</p>


<p>Nobody enjoys working with the know-it-alls. They tend to shut down any, even small improvement suggestions. Imagine someone with a superiority complex — any hint that their idea is imperfect leads to a defensive discussion.</p>


<p>How to handle the know-it-all — the first step is addressing the behavior directly in a 1:1 meeting — they are likely unaware of their shortcomings, as they think everything they do is perfect. Send them this article, and tell them if they see themselves in the description above. After the confrontation — emphasize mutual respect and open-mindedness — all ideas need to be discussed/sparred/disassembled, even if they seem perfect; only then can anyone be sure the solution is correct. Encourage them to ask for feedback all the time.</p>


<p><strong>If the behavior continues, give a formal warning and consider involving HR in the meeting.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-silent-types">The Silent Type</h3>


<p>Scenario: Your team is in a lively discussion, brainstorming ideas for a new awesome feature. Everyone is participating except for one person. Let’s call her Emily. She sits quietly, not contributing to the discussion. Later, you find out that she had a great idea but didn't feel comfortable sharing it. This is a typical Silent Type scenario.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I’m writing about this type irrespective of the gender of the person. Still, I’d like to point out that female developers often have a more challenging time voicing their opinion when the team culture is similar to the frat house and values the loudest voices the most.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Silent Types, in general, tend to be introverted and may struggle with communication. Even though they might immediately see the issues with the solution, they might think, “It’s not worth it to share the concerns, to antagonize someone.” They often keep their thoughts to themselves, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for collaboration.</p>


<pre>🏄 The silent type is usually a by-product of a toxic culture where the conflicts don’t get resolved in a healthy way; hence everyone avoids them instead of dealing with them head-on. This also means other “bad” archetypes are present on the team, e.g., the know-it-all.</pre>


<p>Managing a Silent Type involves creating a safe and inclusive environment and encouraging others to speak up even when there will be conflicts of ideas. Healthy debates must happen regularly so everyone sees that voicing their opinion is not something to be afraid of. Provide various channels/platforms for communication — one-on-one meetings, meetings in a smaller group, group chats, email discussion — which may be more comfortable for them.</p>


<p><strong>But most important, recognize and value their contributions to make them feel more included even if they’re not the loudest voice in the room.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-perfectionist">The Perfectionist</h3>


<p>So, let’s set the scene: You see a Pull Request pop up from one of your team members. Let’s call him Tom. You start reviewing a piece of code — The code is well-written and does the job, but Tom is not satisfied. He's been tweaking and refining it for days, trying to make it "perfect,” eventually turning it into a one-liner. The problem? Other tasks are piling up, deadlines are looming, code looks cool only to Tom, and Tom's quest for perfection is causing delays. This is your typical Perfectionist.</p>


<p>Very often, Perfectionists are recent graduates. They tend to focus on minute details, often at the expense of the bigger picture. They may struggle with the KISS principles and delegation and have high, sometimes unrealistic, standards for themselves and others. In their mind, the code is art, and they should not be rushed while creating an art piece. This behavior leads to inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and increased stress for the whole team.</p>


<p>So how can you manage a perfectionist? <strong>Easy. Lower their expectations of themselves, help them focus on what's most important — a working solution that is not-overengineered, does not read like a poem, and is maintainable in 2 years.</strong> Encourage them to prioritize simple solutions and set realistic standards. Ask them for a second opinion on the “readiness” of the code.</p>


<p>If necessary, provide coaching on time management and book suggestions to build effective coding habits.</p>


<h3 id="the-unreliable-one">The Unreliable One</h3>


<p>Scenario: You're managing a project with a tight deadline. One of your team members, let's call her Anna, is responsible for a critical part of the project. Despite her assurances that she'll complete the task on time, the deadline comes and goes, and the task is still incomplete. This is a classic Unreliable One scenario.</p>


<p>Unreliable employees are identified by their tardiness — constantly late, submitting unfinished work, and skipping meetings. They lack commitment, discipline, or time management skills. Or all three combined. Their inconsistent performance can lead to mistrust and frustration within the team and potentially (highly likely) jeopardize project timelines.</p>


<p>Managing an Unreliable One involves setting clear expectations and holding them accountable — meaning giving formal warning after the first incident. During the first incident, provide feedback on the impact of their behavior on the team and the project. If the habit continues, set up a performance improvement plan and agree transparently on future disciplinary action. Remember, reliability is a key component of a high-performing team, and addressing issues promptly and effectively is important.</p>


<p><strong>If you don’t handle the unreliable employees, you’re doing a disservice to your team, who are trying to be effective and rely on them. </strong>They will need to spend time thinking about ways to work around them rather than work with them.</p>


<h3 id="the-conflict-instigator">The Conflict Instigator</h3>


<p>Picture this: Your team is working harmoniously on a project, but there's one person, let's call him Jake, who seems to thrive on conflict. He makes fun of others’ code, pokes at people, and often instigates arguments, spreads rumors, or creates a hostile environment. This is your typical Conflict Instigator.</p>


<p>Conflict Instigators tend to be argumentative, aggressive, and disruptive. They thrive on drama and create a toxic work environment. This behavior can lead to decreased team morale, increased stress, and reduced productivity.</p>


<p>In my opinion (Of course, you can correct me in the comments) — There’s only one way to handle such employees — with immediate addressing of the actions in private, emphasizing the importance of staying professional and a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior in the future. If it continues — cut fast and don’t look back. It’s not worth the effort to keep them on the team. Remember, a healthy team is a productive team, and toxic conflict should be addressed promptly and effectively.</p>


<h3 id="the-burned-out-employee">The Burned-Out Employee</h3>


<p>Scenario: One of your top performers, let's call her Lisa, has been showing signs of burnout. She's been great the last year, hitting milestone after milestone, but recently she’s been working long hours, missing deadlines, and seems disengaged. She's not the enthusiastic, motivated team member she used to be. This is a typical Burned-Out Employee scenario.</p>


<pre>🏄 I don’t consider a burned-out employee as a “bad employee,” but they can still have a negative impact — they are the ones you need to help and make sure they can thrive again.</pre>


<p>Burned-out employees exhibit signs of exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. They struggle to meet deadlines, have the lowest output on the team, and make more mistakes than over the previous observable period.</p>


<p>Managing a Burned-Out Employee involves addressing the issue with as much empathy and concern as you have. Suggest they take a vacation or sabbatical. Go all-in on work-life balance and provide resources for stress management.</p>


<p>Remember, your team members are your most valuable asset, and their well-being should always be a priority.</p>


<h2 id="communication-tips">Communication Tips</h2>


<p>Managing difficult employees means figuring out ways to ensure you and your employees thrive, even if the circumstances are against you. One tool stands out as particularly crucial: communication. In a software engineering team, clear and effective communication is not just a nice-to-have; it's a must-have. Bad communication is the reason teams fail.</p>


<p>Think about it. How often have you seen a project go off track due to a simple misunderstanding? How many conflicts could have been avoided with better communication? How many great ideas have been lost in the noise of poor communication?</p>


<h3 id="nonviolent-communication">Nonviolent Communication</h3>


<p>One powerful communication tool I've found particularly useful is Nonviolent Communication (NVC). Developed by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg, NVC is a method of communication that promotes empathy and understanding.</p>


<p>At its core, NVC involves four steps: Observation, Feeling, Need, and Request.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong> involves stating the facts we observe that are affecting our well-being.</li>


<li><strong>Feeling</strong> is about sharing how we feel in relation to what we observe.</li>


<li><strong>Need</strong> is expressing what we need or value that is causing our feelings.</li>


<li><strong>Request</strong> involves clearly requesting what we want without demanding it.</li>
</ul>


<p>In a management context, NVC can be a game-changer. It can help you communicate effectively with your team, constructively address issues, and build strong, positive relationships.</p>


<p>I’m not going to talk much about it, but I’m going to give you some links to read:</p>

</ul>


<h3 id="active-listening-and-empathy">Active Listening and Empathy</h3>


<p>As a manager, your role is not just to talk; it's also to listen. Active listening is a crucial skill that involves fully focusing on the speaker, understanding their message, and responding thoughtfully. It's not just about hearing the words; it's about understanding the emotions, ideas, and thoughts behind those words.</p>


<pre>🏄 My business partner, who’s a great salesperson, has this rule — after someone finishes talking to you — wait a few seconds before responding, organize your thoughts, and process what they said, only after you’re sure they’ve said everything they wanted to do you respond to them.</pre>


<p>Active listening can be improved through paraphrasing, asking open-ended questions, and showing empathy. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, plays a crucial role in management. Cultivating compassion involves being open to others' perspectives, showing genuine interest in their experiences, and responding with kindness and understanding. <strong>Simply put, before you judge anyone as a "difficult" employee, you put yourself in their shoes and see from their side.</strong> Talk with them, listen, we're all humans.</p>


<p>Your role is not just to lead; it's also to support, understand, and inspire.</p>


<h2 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next?</h2>


<p>Once you've identified and understood the types of difficult employees in your team and have communicated effectively with them, the question arises - what's the next step? What are the options? This section will guide you through the subsequent stages, from implementing Performance Improvement Plans to escalating issues when necessary.</p>


<h3 id="performance-improvement-plans">Performance Improvement Plans</h3>


<p><strong>If, after many 1:1s with the person, you could not find a solution that helps both — the employee and the company — and they still continue behavior, it's time to make it formal.</strong></p>


<p>A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a formal document that outlines an employee's performance issues and the steps they need to take to improve. It's an escalation tool that can help managers address performance issues in a structured, supportive manner.</p>


<p>A PIP may be necessary when an employee's performance is consistently not meeting expectations, despite feedback and coaching. It's a step that should be taken when other, less formal interventions have not resulted in any improvement.</p>


<p>Implementing a PIP involves several steps — first, clearly outline the performance issues and the expected improvements. Then, set realistic, measurable goals and a timeline for achieving them. Provide support and resources to help the employee improve, and schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress.</p>


<p>Monitoring progress is crucial. Regular feedback can help the employee understand where they're improving and where they still need to work. Remember, the goal of a PIP is not to punish but to support the employee in their transformation and to improve their performance.</p>


<p>To illustrate, let's consider a case study. An engineer in our team was consistently missing deadlines and marking tickets as done that would later be returned from the QA as unfinished. We implemented a PIP, setting clear expectations and defining strict rules how the behavior needed to change. Regular check-ins helped keep the engineer on track, and within a few months, their performance had significantly improved. The key lessons? Making it formal — helps a lot. It’s like getting a police ticket; people tend to react more seriously when you make it clear that it’s already escalating.</p>


<h3 id="time-to-escalate">Time to Escalate</h3>


<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts, an issue may need to be escalated. This could be due to persistent performance issues, serious misconduct, or if the employee's behavior negatively affects the team, e.g., with the conflict instigator.</p>


<p>Documenting the issue is crucial. Keep a record of the performance issues, the steps taken to address them, and the employee's response. This documentation can provide a clear picture of the problem and the efforts made to resolve it.</p>


<p>When escalating an issue, follow your organization's procedures. This may involve discussing the matter with HR or higher management. Remember, escalation is not a failure on your part as a manager. It's a step towards resolving an issue that's beyond your control. It's about ensuring a positive, productive work environment for your entire team.</p>


<h3 id="time-to-part-ways">Time to Part Ways</h3>


<p>There will come a time when, despite all efforts to improve a situation, it becomes clear that an employee is not a good fit for the team or the organization. This is a difficult realization and one that should not be taken lightly.</p>


<p>Termination should be considered when an employee's behavior or performance is consistently and significantly below expectations, despite repeated feedback, coaching, and support. Other reasons might include severe misconduct or an evident lack of alignment with the company's values or culture.</p>


<p>Termination is a last resort and should be considered only when all other avenues have been exhausted. It's a decision that can significantly impact the individual and the team, so it's crucial to handle it with care.</p>


<p>The process should be clear, fair, and transparent. The employee should be informed of the decision in a private, face-to-face meeting, and the reasons for the termination should be explained clearly. Treat the employee, even if you think they’re a “bad employee,” with respect and dignity throughout the process. Offer support where possible, and provide feedback to help them in their future careers.</p>


<p>Managing difficult employees is not just about addressing problematic habits; it's about understanding these behaviors, communicating effectively, and guiding your team members toward improvement. </p>


<p>Everyone has to have a second chance at becoming better.</p>

They talk about getting lucky or unlucky on the Q3 and Q4 on CodeSignal. It feels like getting into Big Tech pretty much just means getting good at competitive programming—if you pass the test, you get the job.</p><p>LeetCode is definitely good for improving at programming in the long run. I haven’t been to Google, so I’m not sure, but you might actually need LeetCode to get a job there. But for Apple (and many other places), you definitely don’t need it, and I’d recommend that you don’t spend too much time grinding it.</p><p>I interned at Apple over the summer. Apple is unique in the hiring process that interviews are completely team-dependent. Some teams might ask you to do LeetCode, but in my case, I didn’t even have a technical interview.</p><p>Recently I’ve been asked a lot on how I got the job, so I’m going to summarize the process here instead of responding to every DM. I’ll go over how I learned Swift, the main programming language that I use. I’ll talk about the recruitment process, the interview experience, and anything else that I can remember.

I remember that my manager specifically pointed out that he didn’t care about where I went to school or my GPA — he said something like “it only matters what you can do.” That day I also met one of my future coworkers, who gave me some tips on improving Find’s scrolling performance.</p><p>In February 2023 I went back to campus to meet the rest of the team. I talked with another manager about old age, college, and kids. It was really chill, but this was probably the behavioral assessment — they wanted to make sure I wasn’t some complete weirdo.</p><p>There was no LeetCode or technical interview. I signed the offer letter in March.</p><p><span>Obviously, this wasn’t your normal entry-level big tech interview process. I asked some other interns about their experiences — most people had a coding problem (one of my friends got two-sum, the first question on LeetCode) and the personality interview was more important. But I’m sure that at a higher position, for full-timers, there’s plenty of people who get recruited and get fast-tracked in the process. There’s nothing stopping you from taking shortcuts or a different pathway when applying for jobs. Do something different, like DM’ing the lead for the team you want to join. Make them </span><em>want</em><span> to hire you, and the interview turns into a free tour of HQ, lunch included.</span></p><p>Working at Apple was more work than I expected. I thought I’d be going in, having lunch, then leaving. I saw vlogs from people at Meta showing off the rock climbing wall and bowling alley that they had right in the office. My friend from Google was talking about how she had a couple meetings per day and the rest was just free time.</p><p>Well, not at Apple. I was there from 8 to 8, to catch the shuttle. Before my intern presentation I was working up until 12 (but that’s on me and my bad time management). You had to pay for breakfast/lunch/dinner and even the gym ($18/month). The prices were fair, but it’s not like the free food and stuff you get from the rest of big tech.</p><p>It was really fun. I was doing what I’d been doing for several years, but this time I was getting paid. I met some really cool interns and people from the design team who were absolutely cracked.</p><p>We had free corporate housing (got to be 18+ for this, so my friend actually had to live with his cousin) in this brand-new complex in Mountain View. The doors had smart locks on them that seemed cool, but were always broken. There was a hot tub on the roof complete with pool table and everything.</p><p>About the work, I was there from June 5th to August 11, so my time was relatively short and I had to cram to finish my stuff near the end. The corporate structure was definitely way different from what I was used to, but it’s well managed and gets stuff done. If you get the chance, Apple’s really worth checking out.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/dbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3316696,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdbd47005-6286-454e-9e9f-b789eb7d1c72_4032x3024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Apple Park at night</figcaption></figure></div><p>When I go on r/csCareerQuestions on reddit there’s so many posts about LeetCode, DP (dynamic programming, not double penetration), FAANG, etc… there’s people sharing tips on how to “crack the interview” and people saying “the best approach is repetition.”</p><p>I feel like people are so fixated on LeetCode and all these other coding questions that they’re forgetting that this is just one path to getting a job. There’s plenty of other ways that aren’t as hard and don’t require hours grinding over some dumb problem. Is it really worth grinding so much? Studying the most advanced Data Structures and Algorithms that you’ll easily learn just from building? And after getting the job, are you even going to use the stuff that you spent so much time practicing? </p><p>But it’s true lots of companies now just use LeetCode as their main differentiator in hiring. We can thank Google for this flawed hiring process—asking the same boring, time-consuming questions that test for proficiency in a roundabout way. Is it a coincidence that Apple was the only Big Tech company that didn’t do layoffs?</p><p>The LeetCode craze is a real problem in the field. Sometimes it feels like all the high-paying jobs require it, and as a result we see all these people burning themselves out over useless questions when they could be developing their skills organically.</p><p>Eventually I think Big Tech and the rest of the industry will move away from LeetCode and shift to project-based interviews. They might give you a take-home assignment and you can show them how applicable and relevant your skills are. But until then, I’d recommend working on cool side projects and doing stuff that matters.

But I’m not saying that you should drop out or stop doing LeetCode completely — you need college for stuff like ML research and you need LeetCode for backend. It’s just that I see a lot of people just trying to get a job — any job — in tech, and they constrain themselves to a specific role or profile. That’s definitely not the play in this horrible job market.</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p><p><span>Leave a comment or ping me on Twitter </span><a href="https://twitter.com/aheze0" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">@aheze0</a><span> anytime.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

If anyone's interested in learning more about this, I posted this on reddit and answered a bunch of questions <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/mv68gv/photos_designed_and_3d_printed_my_own_manual/" target="_blank">here</a>!</i></p><p>It's been a minute hasn't it? :)</p><p>A lot has changed since the last post (no more drones, moved to a new town, had a kid...), including the dumpster fire that is 2020. As of 7 months ago, the world changed in a completely unexpected way and during quarantine, I found myself craving a completely unexpected thing...</p><p>At <a href="https://www.bresslergroup.com/" target="_blank">Bresslergroup</a>&nbsp;where I work, the office has always had a handful of coffee dorks (I use that term affectionately) and as a result, we have a fairly large amount of coffee production paraphernalia...including an espresso machine.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fvpae_UtIgk/X35tJWPkJPI/AAAAAAACMuo/anM5lBHaXNgrXZkBciGCCivSfyl77u5FACLcBGAsYHQ/s2355/81RfdzPfrQL.jpg"><img data-original-height="2025" data-original-width="2355" height="550" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Fvpae_UtIgk/X35tJWPkJPI/AAAAAAACMuo/anM5lBHaXNgrXZkBciGCCivSfyl77u5FACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h550/81RfdzPfrQL.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>I must confess that when we first got the machine, I still thought it was pronounced "expresso" and didn't have a clue about the differences between it and coffee. Over time, I learned the basics of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso#:~:text=The%20act%20of%20producing%20a,the%20coffee%20at%20high%20pressure." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pulling a shot</a>, how <a href="https://coffeebros.com/blog/guide-to-coffee-grind-size/" target="_blank">grind profile</a> and bean type affected taste and the actual extraction process...but mostly I just wanted that sweet, syrupy elixir.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn't until I was completely deprived of my usual mid afternoon caffeine break that I realized how much I missed espresso. I inherited a used <a href="https://amzn.to/30LnP4Z" target="_blank">hand grinder</a> from a friend, bought some specialty beans for the first time in my life from a <a href="https://www.lucid.coffee/" target="_blank">local coffee shop</a>, and proceeded to make pourover each morning using the most jank setup my cheap self could manage:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2FIib0OHUs/X35uR5TUFcI/AAAAAAACMu0/Ixx9ry8kEykJ9g-GcqBN-N0fwMB4Ru6kACLcBGAsYHQ/s848/sdfadf.PNG"><img data-original-height="848" data-original-width="724" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-c2FIib0OHUs/X35uR5TUFcI/AAAAAAACMu0/Ixx9ry8kEykJ9g-GcqBN-N0fwMB4Ru6kACLcBGAsYHQ/w546-h640/sdfadf.PNG" width="546"></a></p><p>Despite how it looks, this setup actually worked really well. Inconvenient? Mildly. Inexpensive? Oh baby, yes. Was I dogged with thoughts about whether or not this method <i>actually</i>&nbsp;brewed good coffee? Day and night.&nbsp;Although this managed to scratch the caffeine itch for at least a month, my overwhelming <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Fomo" target="_blank">FOMO</a> and the fortuitous closing of a local Sur La Table led to the (very cheap) purchase of these two goodies:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ta16wnitg8c/X35z-KUWpKI/AAAAAAACMvQ/Y8YYI8ppawITJyh7S_31sEutzb--3ObMQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1147/sdfasdfasdfasd.PNG"><img data-original-height="862" data-original-width="1147" height="480" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ta16wnitg8c/X35z-KUWpKI/AAAAAAACMvQ/Y8YYI8ppawITJyh7S_31sEutzb--3ObMQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h480/sdfasdfasdfasd.PNG" width="640"></a></p><p><i>Things are starting to look a little bit more respectable.</i></p><p>I had heard a lot about the much lauded&nbsp;<a href="https://amzn.to/3jKUvmw" target="_blank">AeroPress</a>, especially from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMb0O2CdPBNi-QqPk5T3gsQ" target="_blank">James Hoffmann</a> (a veritable David Attenborough of all things coffee, quite a delight to listen to!) who highly recommends the brewer due to how forgiving it is with producing great coffee, even with subpar technique. After trying it for a few days, I realized I didn't much like the taste of <a href="http://www.craftcoffeeguru.com/immersion-vs-drip-pour-over-coffee-brewing/#:~:text=Immersion%20coffee%20brewing%20is%20any,Clever%20Dripper%20or%20an%20Aeropress.&amp;text=Once%20you're%20ready%2C%20you,cup%20of%20immersion%2Dbrewed%20coffee!" target="_blank">immersion brewing</a> and turned my attention to its much flashier partner, a <a href="https://amzn.to/3dfuut5" target="_blank">Melitta style #2 coffee filter cone</a>. Now I could finally make pourovers for guests without having to apologize for my janky setup.</p><p>None of this was espresso though and despite being cheaper, <a href="https://www.roastycoffee.com/manual-vs-automatic-espresso-machines/#:~:text=Favored%20by%20the%20traditionalists%2C%20manual,needed%20to%20pull%20a%20shot." target="_blank">manual espresso machines</a> like the <a href="https://www.flairespresso.com/product-page/flair-signature-pro-2" target="_blank">Flair</a>&nbsp;and highly regarded <a href="https://www.cafelatstore.com/products/robotpowdercoating" target="_blank">Cafelat Robot</a> were both well out of my budget (I mean c'mon, I spent an embarrassing amount of time at the supermarket debating whether or not I should spend <i>one cent</i>&nbsp;more per filter on unbleached paper vs. bleached paper). I found myself falling deep<i>&nbsp;</i>into the rabbit hole of coffee research, digging up old <a href="https://www.home-barista.com/" target="_blank">Home-Barista</a> forum posts, reading Amazon reviews of products that claimed to make espresso, and binge watching videos on tamping techniques, grinder types, and even roasting coffee. The more I read, the more I realized that the cheapest way to do this was to just to DIY it.</p><p>And so, a week later, this was staring back at me in CAD:</p><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T-7lOmsbTYA/X36Cx39lp-I/AAAAAAACMvk/u2ZN9dC9mwkmCqqP2F38P1Oai6sYZ7SawCLcBGAsYHQ/s830/proofofconcept.PNG"><img data-original-height="830" data-original-width="634" height="640" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T-7lOmsbTYA/X36Cx39lp-I/AAAAAAACMvk/u2ZN9dC9mwkmCqqP2F38P1Oai6sYZ7SawCLcBGAsYHQ/w488-h640/proofofconcept.PNG" width="488"></a></p><p><i>Uhhh...what the heck am I looking at?</i></p><p>Maybe I should back up a bit and explain: what exactly <i>is </i>espresso? The short answer is "what comes out when you force nearly boiling water through finely ground coffee beans at very high pressure". For a more eloquent and detailed explanation, read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso" target="_blank">wiki article</a>. It's what's served in Italy when you ask for coffee or "un caffè por favore" because that's where it originated (<a href="https://italyexplained.com/italian-coffee-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank">fun fact, if you sit down instead of waiting at the bar for your espresso, you'll be charged more</a>). It's fuller bodied, more intense, and arguably more flavorful than regular 'ol coffee and requires the aforementioned special (read: expensive) equipment to produce. </p><p><a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2425/8607/articles/Bottomless-Portafilter-Espresso-Extraction-Detail_23462530-15d2-487c-98e0-4d69f12b278d_2400x.jpg?v=1563398660"><img data-original-height="533" data-original-width="800" height="427" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2425/8607/articles/Bottomless-Portafilter-Espresso-Extraction-Detail_23462530-15d2-487c-98e0-4d69f12b278d_2400x.jpg?v=1563398660" width="640"></a></p><p><i>Mmmm doesn't that just look </i>so<i>&nbsp;good?</i></p><p>The key to good espresso is the high pressure (among other things). Specifically almost 9x atmospheric pressure, or about 131 psi. For reference, your car tires are (only) filled to <b>30-35</b> psi! Most <a href="https://coffeemachinewarehouse.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/La-Marzocco-Linea-Classic-7.jpeg" target="_blank">semi-automatic espresso machines like the one in your local coffee shop</a> use high pressure water pumps to hit that pressure. Manual machines like the ones I talked about above need even more effort by requiring the user to manually press down on levers with moderate to high force to generate the same pressures. See below:</p>

Instead, I settled on the simpler idea of harnessing the power of compressed gas. Instead of using a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_advantage" target="_blank">mechanical advantage</a> lever to push a piston, compressed CO2 would be dispensed from a small and inexpensive <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0080/1131/7305/products/Threaded_16g_Co2_Cartridge_1024x1024.jpg?v=1530133590" target="_blank">12g or 16g cartridge</a> which would then generate the requisite pressure to properly extract espresso. This concept is not actually novel; both an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1930097708/sippy-espresso-maker-on-the-go?ref=discovery" target="_blank">unsuccessful kickstarter</a> and a <a href="https://www.home-barista.com/reviews/mypressi-twist-second-look-t12595.html" target="_blank">now-defunct handheld espresso maker</a> (with a <a href="https://mypressi.com/" target="_blank">fanatical user base</a>) employed this mechanism. <i>(EDIT: See the end of this post regarding concerns about CO2 potentially affecting flavor)</i></p><p>What about the brew chamber? Well, in <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Make-a-Lever-Espresso-Machine/" target="_blank">some lever designs</a>&nbsp;which use conventional portafilter baskets and handles, the water chamber is separate by necessity which leads to more parts. I really loved the design of the <a href="https://www.cafelatstore.com/products/robot-basket" target="_blank">Cafelat Robot basket</a>, which holds <i>both</i> the water and the coffee grounds in a very simple setup that requires no preheating. Inspired by the <a href="http://www.francescoceccarelli.eu/Macchine/Faema/baby_faemina/baby_v.1.0_verde_215_eng.htm" target="_blank">Faema Baby</a> lever machine from the 1960s, this setup, though unconventional, has a <i>very </i>loyal following.

Also some have wondered about whether or not the liquid CO2 would lower the temperature of the water. Considering we only need 2g of CO2 and that it already boils before hitting the brew chamber (not to mention water's insanely high specific heat), I have not noticed any noticeable drop in temp during extraction. I use compressed air now and also have not noticed a difference.)</i></p></div>

Dart 3.1 contains a handful of minor updates and a few API adjustments to further use class modifiers introduced in 3.0 (which you can read more about in the </em><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#310" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>changelog</em></a><em>). Mostly, though, we’ve been spending our time on new roadmap items that we hope to see reach beta and stable over the coming releases. Stay tuned for more about that in the future!</em></p><p id="c46f"><em>So, in place of a traditional release post, we’re revisiting a subset of Dart 3’s major features to talk about how they can completely change, and in some cases, greatly improve the way you write and structure your Dart code.</em></p></div><div><h2 id="0796">How do you model data?</h2><p id="752b">Object-oriented (OO) and functional languages differ in many ways, but it’s arguable that <em>how each paradigm models data</em> is the defining characteristic that separates them. Specifically, the question of modeling different variations of related data and the operations on those variants.</p><p id="5eaa">But <em>“how should I model this data?”</em> is usually not something we consciously give much thought to when starting a new project. We tend to default to whatever data modeling paradigm is common to the type of language we’re using, as opposed to the inverse of choosing the language based on the model that makes the most sense for our data.</p><p id="7e1e">If you’re using an OO language, you’ll model data with class hierarchies and operations on subtypes. If you’re using certain functional languages, the equivalent to the class hierarchy model is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">algebraic data type</a> model, whose equivalent to operating on subtypes is switching over them with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pattern matching</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Simplified side-by-side comparison of the object-oriented class hierarchy model and the functional algebraic data type model</figcaption></figure><p id="189d">Dart is an object-oriented language, but has been steadily incorporating functional features over time, allowing for a more multi-paradigm approach to data modeling. Most recently, Dart 3 added <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pattern matching</a>, new functionality on <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#switch-statements-and-expressions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">switch</a>, and <a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealed types</a>. These features make it possible to implement algebraic data types in Dart, allowing you to write functional style code while continuing to maximize the capabilities of Dart’s object-oriented core.</p><p id="782e">Multi-paradigm languages like Dart give you the tools and the opportunity to choose how you design anything from a single line expression, to entire class hierarchies. You can consider which model makes the most sense for your project, or even just for your personal preference. To help you make the best decision, this article summarizes the structure and strengths of each paradigm separately, and then teaches you how to use new features in Dart 3 to refactor some classic object-oriented designs that most benefit from being written in a functional style.</p><h2 id="f3be">Object-oriented approach</h2><p id="077c">When you have operations specific to different data types, the standard organization approach in OO languages is to create a method on a base class, and a set of subclasses that override the base class to define their unique behavior. Each subclass has its data and operations together in one place inside its declaration.</p><p id="7024">Take this (high-level pseudocode) example of modeling recipes. It makes sense to have recipe objects, coupling ingredients and steps together with the recipe. The recipe base class would probably have some functions for the cooking methods that each recipe overrides with their unique requirements:</p><figure></figure><p id="4989">Class hierarchies with instance methods make it easy to add new subclasses without having to touch any existing code. This works perfectly for some domains, like Flutter, where you have countless widgets that all extend the <code>Widget</code> class. Each widget can uniquely extend and override any necessary behavior directly inside their definition. You <em>definitely</em> don’t need to know how every widget subtype defines its methods to add specialized behavior to your own widgets.</p><h2 id="ff91">Functional approach (algebraic data types)</h2><p id="4f68">You can think of functional style architecture as the inverse of OO architecture. Instead of having all the code for <em>one type in one place</em> (OO instance methods in subclass declarations), you have all the code for <em>one operation in one place</em> (functional switching over types to define behavior).</p><p id="954a">Which begs the question, when <em>does</em> it make sense to know how every subtype in a hierarchy defines an operation? It could be for a few reasons:</p><ul><li id="9d30">When adding, maintaining, and understanding variants of the same operation’s behavior across types is easier to do when they’re all side by side in the code.</li><li id="11c7">When you can’t modify the subclasses yourself, but you want to define new behavior that is specific to each of them.</li><li id="0322">When the variations of an operation’s behavior for different types are more related to each other than they are to the types that they’re operating on<em>.</em></li></ul><p id="829a">Sometimes it’s obvious, but mostly it’s just a perspective shift. Think about the recipe example again. From the point of view of, say, an oven manual, it would make a lot more sense to group bake instructions together in one place for each recipe:</p><figure></figure><p id="c41e">In this example, the program structure is focused on the <code>bake</code> operation. Whatever types <code>bake</code> operates on are simply different possible outputs of the same function; <code>bake</code> is independent of the types it operates on.</p><p id="dc9c">This is the <strong>algebraic data type model </strong>(named “algebraic” after mathematical set theory). It’s the core organizational model of functional languages, in the same way class hierarchies are core to OO languages. Algebraic data types separate behavior from data by grouping behavior for all types together by operation.</p><p id="5639">And now, it’s possible to cohesively implement algebraic data types with Dart 3!</p><h2 id="170c">Modeling object oriented algebraic data types</h2><p id="302b">Functional languages generally implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">algebraic data types</a> by pattern matching over the cases in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sum type</a> to assign behavior to each variant. Dart 3 achieves the same with <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#switch-statements-and-expressions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">pattern matching</a> in switch cases, and takes advantage of the fact that OO subtyping already naturally models sum types. This allows us to implement truly <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#algebraic-data-types" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">multi-paradigm algebraic data types</a> using objects that blend into Dart seamlessly.</p><p id="e835">The following sections show you how to design algebraic data type models in Dart, alongside pre-Dart 3 examples of the same functionality.</p><ul><li id="6a4b">First, we’ll explain how to group type-based variants of an operation together by switching over <a href="https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#object" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">object patterns</a>.</li><li id="5d72">Then, we’ll take a step back and look at how to architect the subclasses themselves with the new <a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealed</a> class modifier, to ensure the switch defines behavior for <a href="https://dart.dev/language/branches#exhaustiveness-checking" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">all possible subtypes the object might take</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="db12">Grouping behaviors across types</h2><p id="43c2">Individual parts of the Dart language (like statements, classes, and literals) each have their own definitions in class hierarchies, but are all subject to operations from multiple systems (such as parser, formatter, and compiler operations). Imagine how confusing the language implementation would be if every function that applied to every language element had to be defined inside those elements’ declarations! It would look something like this:</p><figure></figure><p id="fc20">Dart’s internal code already naturally leans towards the functional approach of separating functions from type definitions for this reason. Take the <code><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/pkg/analyzer/lib/src/error/annotation_verifier.dart" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">annotation_verifier</a></code> library in Dart’s analyzer. It contains functions that define behavior for annotations (like <code>@override</code> or <code>@deprecated</code>) depending on the part of code the annotation is attached to (like how <code>@override</code> affects a class as opposed to a field).</p><p id="8ebd">But assigning behavior per type is not as straightforward as making the decision to separate the behavior out in the first place. The standard way to define behaviors by type uses chained <code>if-else</code> statements, which you see a lot in the annotation verifier. Take the following verification function written without using any Dart 3 features. It verifies the behavior of the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/4079a47cc4fb8f88e2dd9b7faff3bd587931a379" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">recently contributed</a> <code>@visibleOutsideTemplate</code> annotation that opts out of the cascading effects of another annotation, <code>@visibleForTemplate</code>:</p><figure></figure><p id="f8a6">The function uses elaborate chained <code>if-else</code> statements, testing whether the grandparent of the annotation is a certain kind of declaration (either <code>ClassDeclaration</code>, <code>EnumDeclaration</code>, or <code>MixinDeclaration</code>), and then defining its behavior based on the type.</p><p id="8380">With Dart 3, you can use object patterns in switch cases to significantly refactor this structure to a more declarative style, making it shorter and easier to read. And the original author <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/4079a47cc4fb8f88e2dd9b7faff3bd587931a379/pkg/analyzer/lib/src/error/annotation_verifier.dart#L417-L426" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">did just that</a>! 16 lines of chained <code>if-else</code> statements are pared down to a 7-line switch statement:</p><figure></figure><p id="c090">Each case here is an <a href="https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#object" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">object pattern</a> that matches against the static type of <code>grandparent</code>. Instead of saying <code>if (object is Type &amp;&amp; object.property != null)</code>, each case checks if the object’s pattern matches the pattern <code>Type(propertyOfType)</code>. Plus, when an object matches an object pattern, it implicitly requires that it’s not <code>null</code>, so there’s no need for an explicit null check!</p><p id="293c">Object patterns can also contain nested <a href="https://dart.dev/language/pattern-types#variable" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">variable patterns</a> that allow you to extract (or <a href="https://dart.dev/language/patterns#destructuring" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"><em>destructure</em></a>) property values from an object in the same line of code you’re matching against. The syntax <code>(:var metadata)</code> just means “match and declare a new variable with the same name as this getter”. This is how the variable <code>metadata</code> comes into scope for the final for loop. Pretty concise!</p><p id="9df7">Notice that the <code>for</code> loop is now common between each case. Each type’s <code>declaredElement</code> property is actually a different subtype of another type, <code>InterfaceElement</code> (either a <code>classElement</code>, <code>enumElement</code>, or <code>mixinElement</code>). So, the pre-Dart 3 chained <code>if-else</code> statement iterated over <code>metadata</code> in each <code>if</code> clause separately, to ensure <code>final annotation</code> would be type safe for each of the possible types that <code>metadata</code> could take.</p><p id="db57">Now, the refactored structure uses deeply nested object patterns for each case, to upcast <code>metadata</code> to its supertype, <code>InterfaceElement</code>. This makes a single shared <code>for</code> loop iterating over <code>metadata</code> type safe across the cases.</p><figure><figcaption>Annotated depiction of the syntax for a deeply nested object and variable patterns</figcaption></figure><p id="7482">Switching over object patterns matters to Dart’s algebraic data type implementation because of its ability to concisely test subtypes and destructure values. A nice side effect is the simultaneous assurances that can be provided by a single line of code. To reiterate, each case pattern in this refactor is simultaneously verifying:</p><ul><li id="cf86">The object is one of the types <code>ClassDeclaration</code>, <code>EnumDeclaration</code>, or <code>MixinDeclaration</code>.</li><li id="a3b7">The object has the property <code>declaredElement</code>.</li><li id="9a7b"><code>declaredElement</code> has the property <code>metadata</code>.</li><li id="4be8"><code>metadata</code> is of type <code>InterfaceElement</code>.</li><li id="5d46">None of the objects or properties in question are <code>null</code>.</li></ul><p id="3739">This is the perfect example of how thoroughly Dart 3 implements patterns to account for so many nuances of OO languages, and really make object-oriented algebraic data types a realistic design option in Dart.</p><p id="ab03">Type tests over object patterns are great for separating behavior from types. But its missing one feature of OO subtyping, where the compiler lets you know if you declare a new subtype but don’t define behavior for one of its supertype’s abstract methods. How can Dart’s algebraic data type model implement the same safety assurances when we’re no longer dealing with instance methods on type declarations? The answer is <em>exhaustiveness checking</em>.</p><h2 id="94da">Exhaustiveness checking</h2><p id="b090">Functional languages’ implementations of algebraic data types use enumerable sum types, which means the compiler is always aware of all the possible variations of the type being switched over. The compiler can then let you know if your switch is missing a case, and therefore that it’s possible some values might fall through that switch without being addressed.</p><p id="f965">This is called <a href="https://dart.dev/language/branches#exhaustiveness-checking" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">exhaustiveness checking</a>. It has technically always existed in Dart for enumerable types like enums and booleans. Those types have a set of possible values that cannot change, and if you’re switching over them, the compiler knows when you’ve missed one and warns you. Using a <code>default</code> clause is another kind of pseudo exhaustiveness. Since <code>default</code> matches all cases not explicitly accounted for, it causes the compiler to consider a switch exhaustive without knowing if all potential types are actually accounted for.</p><p id="74ae">As mentioned, we wanted to use subtypes instead of sum types for Dart’s version of algebraic data type modeling. But since classes in Dart can be extended from any library, it would be impossible for the compiler to exhaustively enumerate subtypes of a class since it can’t know if any subclasses are declared in external libraries.</p><p id="3ac5">To get around this and complete Dart’s algebraic data type implementation, we added the <code><a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealed</a></code><a href="https://dart.dev/language/class-modifiers#sealed" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> class modifier</a> to Dart 3. A <code>sealed</code> class cannot be extended or implemented from any library but its own (<a href="https://dart.dev/language/libraries" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">the file that contains its definition</a>). This ensures the compiler is always aware of any and all possible subtypes, making them fully enumerable.</p><p id="ef6d">Here’s an example of an actual refactor that went into the Dart SDK as part of the 3.1 release: <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/c3e815bc7ad488eddf00344ab4106485a9d1ba32#diff-e98c6de423bf7e0b5b961cd10efed50330004229243aa87c18ad6314fef054b0L879-R879" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sealing </a><code><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/commit/c3e815bc7ad488eddf00344ab4106485a9d1ba32#diff-e98c6de423bf7e0b5b961cd10efed50330004229243aa87c18ad6314fef054b0L879-R879" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">FileSystemEvent</a></code> so its subtypes can be exhaustively switched over. Brace yourself, refactors are hard…</p><figure></figure><p id="b9a5">Just kidding, that wasn’t hard at all! It should be noted, though, that sealing an existing class hierarchy is a breaking change. Code targeting older versions of Dart won’t be able to implement or extend the class, so always check dependencies and alert any users that might be subtyping your classes elsewhere.</p><p id="2a5f">Sealing <code>FileSystemEvent</code> allows the events produced by <code>FileSystemEntity.watch</code>, which correspond to the subtypes of <code>FileSystemEvent</code>, to be exhaustively switched over. It’s typical to listen to this stream of events and use <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/52273" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">chained </a><code><a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/52273" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">if-else</a></code> statements to determine an action based on the type of the events that occur.</p><p id="a1ce">But sealing the base class doesn’t only allow you to switch over object patterns, like the <code>_checkVisibleOutsideTemplate</code> example in the previous section. It also ensures that while doing so, you’re accounting for every possible value that could arise for that type, without the need for a <code>default</code> case:</p><figure></figure><p id="521e">If a new subtype was ever added that extends <code>FileSystemEvent</code>, perhaps <code>FileSystemSyncEvent</code> for example, the compiler would be aware of it because it could only be added to the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/sdk/lib/io/file_system_entity.dart" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">same library</a> as <code>FileSystemEvent</code>. Since the class hierarchy is sealed, the compiler requires any switch over its instances to be exhaustive, and will generate <a href="https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages#non_exhaustive_switch_expression" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">an error</a> to alert the user (who wrote the switch, not the library owner) of unhandled cases:</p><pre><span id="d150">The type 'FileSystemEvent' is not exhaustively matched by the switch cases since it doesn't match 'FileSystemSyncEvent'</span></pre><p id="870d">Combining sealed classes and switches over object patterns enables a complete, object-oriented algebraic data type style of program architecture in Dart.</p><h2 id="2454">Bonus functional features</h2><p id="df8c">The exhaustive switch example above includes even more functional features from Dart 3 than just the ones that facilitate algebraic data types.</p><p id="e96c">Notice that the switch is to the right of the <code>_fileListener</code> function’s return statement—that’s Dart 3’s new <a href="https://dart.dev/language/branches#switch-expressions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">switch expression</a>.

        <p><em>The New York Times</em> and OpenAI could end up in court. </p><p>Lawyers for the newspaper are exploring whether to sue OpenAI to protect the intellectual property rights associated with its reporting, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. </p><p>For weeks, <em>The Times</em> and the maker of ChatGPT have been locked in tense negotiations over reaching a licensing deal in which OpenAI would pay <em>The Times </em>for incorporating its stories in the tech company's AI tools, but the discussions have become so contentious that the paper is now considering legal action. </p><p>The individuals who confirmed the potential lawsuit requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.</p><p>A lawsuit from <em>The Times</em> against OpenAI would set up what could be the most high-profile legal tussle yet over copyright protection in the age of generative AI. </p><p>A top concern for <em>The Times</em> is that ChatGPT is, in a sense, becoming a direct competitor with the paper by creating text that answers questions based on the original reporting and writing of the paper's staff. </p><p>It's a fear heightened by tech companies using generative AI tools in search engines. Microsoft, which has invested billions into OpenAI, is now powering its Bing search engine with ChatGPT. </p><p>If, when someone searches online, they are served a paragraph-long answer  from an AI tool that refashions reporting from <em>The Times</em>, the need to visit the publisher's website is greatly diminished, said one person involved in the talks.</p><p>So-called large language models like ChatGPT have scraped vast parts of the internet to assemble data that inform how the chatbot responds to various inquiries. The data-mining is conducted without permission. Whether hoovering up this massive repository is legal remains an open question. </p><p>If OpenAI is found to have violated any copyrights in this process, federal law allows for the infringing articles to be destroyed at the end of the case. </p>

Hollywood is already doing body scans</a></p><hr><p>In other words, if a federal judge finds that OpenAI illegally copied <em>The Times</em>' articles to train its AI model, the court could order the company to destroy ChatGPT's dataset, forcing the company to recreate it using only work that it is authorized to use. </p><p>Federal copyright law also carries stiff financial penalties, with violators facing fines up to $150,000 for each infringement "committed willfully." </p><p>"If you're copying millions of works, you can see how that becomes a number that becomes potentially fatal for a company," said Daniel Gervais, the co-director of the intellectual property program at Vanderbilt University who studies generative AI. "Copyright law is a sword that's going to hang over the heads of AI companies for several years unless they figure out how to negotiate a solution." </p><p><em>The Times </em>talks with OpenAI follow <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/08/13/2023/new-york-times-drops-out-of-ai-coalition">reports</a> that the paper will not join other media organizations in attempting to negotiate with tech companies over use of content in AI models. A person at <em>The Times</em> said not participating is unrelated to any potential litigation against OpenAI, which declined to comment through a spokesperson. </p>

"As always, the final answer will be determined by who ends up winning these lawsuits." </p><p>Legal experts say AI companies are likely to invoke a defense citing what is known as "fair use doctrine," which allows for the use of a work without permission in certain instances, including teaching, criticism, research and news reporting. </p><h3>Key question for AI suits: Will 'fair use' apply? </h3><p>There are two legal precedents that will likely play a part in the pending AI copyright disputes.</p><p>The first is <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/case/authors-guild-v-google-inc/">a 2015 federal appeals court ruling</a> that found that Google's digitally scanning of millions of books for its Google Books library was a legally permissible use of "fair use," and not copyright infringement. </p><p>The court found that Google's digital library of books did not create a "significant market substitute" for the books, meaning it did not compete with the original works. </p><p>Legal experts say proving that in the AI cases will be a major hurdle to overcome for OpenAI. </p><p>The second case expected to be relevant to the AI copyright suits is the Andy Warhol Foundation case the Supreme Court decided in May. </p><p>In it<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-869_87ad.pdf">, the high court found</a> that Andy Warhol was not protected by fair use doctrine when he altered a photograph of Prince taken by Lynn Goldsmith. Importantly, the court found that Warhol and Goldsmith were selling the images to magazines. </p><p>Therefore, the court wrote, the original and the copied work shared "the same or highly similar purposes, or where wide dissemination of a secondary work would otherwise run the risk of substitution for the original or licensed derivatives of it."</p><p>Lawyers for <em>The Times</em> believe OpenAI's use of the paper's articles to spit out descriptions of news events should not be protected by fair use, arguing that it risks becoming something of a replacement for the paper's coverage. </p><p><em>NPR's David Folkenflik contributed to this report. </em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Good day, comrades!</p><p>Today I'd like to share the good news that WebAssembly is finally coming
for the rest of us weirdos.</p><div>
<h2>A world to win</h2>
<p>WebAssembly for the rest of us</p>
<p>17 Mar 2023 – BOB 2023</p>
<p>Andy Wingo</p>
<p>Igalia, S.L.</p>
</div><p>This is a transcript-alike of a talk that I gave last week at <a href="https://bobkonf.de/2023/en/program.html">BOB
2023</a>, a gathering in Berlin of
people that are using "technologies beyond the mainstream" to get things
done: Haskell, Clojure, Elixir, and so on.  PDF slides <a href="https://wingolog.org/pub/2023-bobkonf-wasm-for-the-rest-of-us-slides.pdf">here</a>, and I'll link the video too when it becomes available.</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the story</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is an exciting new universal compute platform</p>
</div><p>WebAssembly: what even is it?  Not a programming language that
you would write software in, but rather a compilation target: a sort of
assembly language, if you will.</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the pitch</h2>
<p>Predictable portable performance</p>
<ul>
<li>Low-level</li>
<li>Within 10% of native</li>
</ul>
<p>Reliable composition via isolation</p>
<ul>
<li>Modules share nothing by default</li>
<li>No nasal demons</li>
<li>Memory sandboxing</li>
</ul>
<p>Compile your code to WebAssembly for easier distribution and composition</p>
</div><p>If you look at what the characteristics of WebAssembly are as an
abstract machine, to me there are two main areas in which it is an
advance over the alternatives.</p><p>Firstly it's "close to the metal" -- if you compile for example an
image-processing library to WebAssembly and run it, you'll get similar
performance when compared to compiling it to x86-64 or ARMv8 or what
have you.  (For image processing in particular, native still generally
wins because the SIMD primitives in WebAssembly are more narrow and
because getting the image into and out of WebAssembly may imply a copy,
but the general point remains.)  WebAssembly's instruction set covers a
broad range of low-level operations that allows compilers to produce
efficient code.</p><p>The novelty here is that WebAssembly is both portable while also being
successful.  We language weirdos know that it's not enough to do
something technically better: you have to also succeed in getting
traction for your alternative.</p><p>The second interesting characteristic is that WebAssembly is (generally
speaking) a principle-of-least-authority architecture: a WebAssembly
module starts with access to nothing but itself.  Any capabilities that
an instance of a module has must be explicitly shared with it by the
host at instantiation-time.  This is unlike DLLs which have access to
all of main memory, or JavaScript libraries which can mutate global
objects.  This characteristic allows WebAssembly modules to be reliably
composed into larger systems.</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the hype</h2>
<p>It’s in all browsers! Serve your code to anyone in the world!</p>
<p>It’s on the edge! Run code from your web site close to your users!</p>
<p>Compose a library (eg: Expat) into your program (eg: Firefox), without risk!</p>
<p>It’s the new lightweight virtualization: Wasm is what containers were to VMs! Give me that Kubernetes cash!!!</p>
</div><p>Again, the remarkable thing about WebAssembly is that it is succeeding!
It's on all of your phones, all your desktop web browsers, all of the
content distribution networks, and in some cases it seems set to replace
containers in the cloud.  Launch the rocket emojis!</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the reality</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is a weird backend for a C compiler</p>
<p>Only some source languages are having success on WebAssembly</p>
<p>
What about Haskell, Ocaml, Scheme, F#, and so on – what about <i>us</i>?
</p>
<p>Are we just lazy? (Well...)</p>
</div><p>So why aren't we there?  Where is Clojure-on-WebAssembly?  Where are the
F#, the Elixir, the Haskell compilers?  Some early efforts exist, but
they aren't really succeeding.  Why is that?  Are we just not putting in
the effort?  Why is it that Rust gets to ride on the rocket ship but Scheme does not?</p><div>
<h2>WebAssembly, the reality (2)</h2>
<p>WebAssembly (1.0, 2.0) is not well-suited to garbage-collected languages</p>
<p>Let’s look into why</p>
</div><p>As it turns out, there is a reason that there is no good Scheme
implementation on WebAssembly: the initial version of WebAssembly is a
terrible target if your language relies on the presence of a garbage
collector.  There have been some advances but this observation still
applies to the current standardized and deployed versions of
WebAssembly.  To better understand this issue, let's dig into the guts
of the system to see what the limitations are.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0</h2>
<p>Where do garbage-collected values live?</p>
<p>For WebAssembly 1.0, only possible answer: linear memory</p>
<pre>(module
  (global $hp (mut i32) (i32.const 0))
  (memory $mem 10)) ;; 640 kB</pre>
</div><p>The primitive that WebAssembly 1.0 gives you to represent your data is
what is called <i>linear memory</i>: just a buffer of bytes to which you can
read and write.  It's pretty much like what you get when compiling
natively, except that the memory layout is more simple.  You can obtain
this memory in units of 64-kilobyte pages.  In the example above we're
going to request 10 pages, for 640 kB.  Should be enough, right?  We'll
just use it all for the garbage collector, with a bump-pointer
allocator.  The heap pointer / allocation pointer is kept in the mutable
global variable <tt>$hp</tt>.</p><div>
<pre>(func $alloc (param $size i32) (result i32)
  (local $ret i32)
  (loop $retry
    (local.set $ret (global.get $hp))
    (global.set $hp
      (i32.add (local.get $size) (local.get $ret)))

    (br_if 1
      (i32.lt_u (i32.shr_u (global.get $hp) 16)
                (memory.size))
      (local.get $ret))

    <b>(call $gc)</b>
    (br $retry)))
</pre>
</div><p>Here's what an allocation function might look like.  The allocation
function <tt>$alloc</tt> is like malloc: it takes a number of bytes and returns
a pointer.  In WebAssembly, a pointer to memory is just an offset, which
is a 32-bit integer (<tt>i32</tt>).  (Having the option of a 64-bit address
space is planned but not yet standard.)</p><p>If this is your first time seeing the text representation of a
WebAssembly function, you're in for a treat, but that's not the point of
the presentation :)  What I'd like to focus on is the <tt>(call $gc)</tt> --
what happens when the allocation pointer reaches the end of the region?</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (2)</h2>
<p>
What hides behind <tt>(call $gc)</tt> ?
</p>
<p>Ship a GC over linear memory</p>
<p>Stop-the-world, not parallel, not concurrent</p>
<p>
But... <b>roots</b>.
</p>
</div><p>The first thing to note is that you have to provide the <tt>$gc</tt> yourself.
Of course, this is doable -- this is what we do when compiling to a
native target.</p><p>Unfortunately though the multithreading support in WebAssembly is
somewhat underpowered; it lets you share memory and use atomic
operations but you have to create the threads outside WebAssembly.  In
practice probably the GC that you ship will not take advantage of
threads and so it will be rather primitive, deferring all collection
work to a stop-the-world phase.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (3)</h2>
<p>Live objects are</p>
<ul>
<li>the roots</li>
<li>any object referenced by a live object</li>
</ul>
<p>Roots are globals and locals in active stack frames</p>
<p>
<b>No way to visit active stack frames</b>
</p>
</div><p>What's worse though is that you have no access to roots on the stack.  A
GC has to keep live objects, as defined circularly as any object
referenced by a root, or any object referenced by a live object.  It
starts with the roots: global variables and any GC-managed object
referenced by an active stack frame.</p><p>But there we run into problems, because in WebAssembly (any version, not
just 1.0) you can't iterate over the stack, so you can't find active
stack frames, so you can't find the stack roots.  (Sometimes people want
to support this as a <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling/issues/105">low-level
capability</a>
but generally speaking the consensus would appear to be that overall
performance will be better if the engine is the one that is responsible
for implementing the GC; but that is foreshadowing!)</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (3)</h2>
<p>Workarounds</p>
<ul>
<li>handle stack for precise roots</li>
<li>spill all possibly-pointer values to linear memory and collect conservatively</li>
</ul>
<p>Handle book-keeping a drag for compiled code</p>
</div><p>Given the noniterability of the stack, there are basically two
work-arounds.  One is to have the compiler and run-time maintain an
explicit stack of object roots, which the garbage collector can know for
sure are pointers.  This is nice because it lets you move objects.  But,
maintaining the stack is overhead; the state of the art solution is
rather to create a side table (a "stack map") associating each potential
point at which GC can be called with instructions on how to find the
roots.</p><p>The other workaround is to spill the whole stack to memory.  Or,
possibly just pointer-like values; anyway, you conservatively scan all
words for things that might be roots.  But instead of having access to
the memory to which the WebAssembly implementation would spill your
stack, you have to do it yourself.  This can be OK but it's sub-optimal;
see <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/02/07/whippet-towards-a-new-local-maximum">my recent post on the Whippet garbage
collector</a>
for a deeper discussion of the implications of conservative
root-finding.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (4)</h2>
<p>Cycles with external objects (e.g. JavaScript) uncollectable</p>
<p>A pointer to a GC-managed object is an offset to linear memory, need capability over linear memory to read/write object from outside world</p>
<p>No way to give back memory to the OS</p>
<p>Gut check: gut says no</p>
</div><p>If that were all, it would already be not so great, but it gets worse!
Another problem with linear-memory GC is that it limits the potential
for composing a number of modules and the host together, because the
garbage collector that manages JavaScript objects in a web browser knows
nothing about your garbage collector over your linear memory.  You can
easily create memory leaks in a system like that.</p><p>Also, it's pretty gross that a reference to an object in linear memory
requires arbitrary read-write access over all of linear memory in order
to read or write object fields.  How do you build a reliable system
without invariants?</p><p>Finally, once you collect garbage, and maybe you manage to compact
memory, you can't give anything back to the OS.  There are proposals in
the works but they are not there yet.</p><p>If the BOB audience had to choose between <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WorseIsBetter.html">Worse is Better and The Right
Thing</a>, I think the BOB
audience is much closer to the Right Thing.  People like that feel
instinctual revulsion to ugly systems and I think GC over linear memory
describes an ugly system.</p><div>
<h2>GC and WebAssembly 1.0 (5)</h2>
<p>
<i>There is already a high-performance concurrent parallel compacting GC in the browser</i>
</p>
<p>Halftime: C++ N – Altlangs 0</p>
</div><p>The kicker is that WebAssembly 1.0 requires you to write and deliver a
terrible GC when there is already probably a great GC just sitting there
in the host, one that has hundreds of person-years of effort invested in
it, one that will surely do a better job than you could ever do.
WebAssembly as hosted in a web browser should have access to the
browser's garbage collector!</p><p>I have the feeling that while those of us with a soft spot for languages
with garbage collection have been standing on the sidelines, Rust and
C++ people have been busy on the playing field scoring goals.  Tripping
over the ball, yes, but eventually they do manage to make within
striking distance.</p><div>
<h2>Change is coming!</h2>
<p>Support for built-in GC set to ship in Q4 2023</p>
<p>With GC, the material conditions are now in place</p>
<p>
Let’s compile <i>our</i> languages to WebAssembly
</p>
</div><p>But to continue the sportsball metaphor, I think in the second half our
players will finally be able to get out on the pitch and give it the
proverbial 110%.  Support for garbage collection is coming to
WebAssembly users, and I think even by the end of the year it will be
shipping in major browsers.  This is going to be big!  We have a chance
and we need to sieze it.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm</h2>
<p>Spritely + Igalia working on Scheme to WebAssembly</p>
<p>Avoid truncating language to platform; bring whole self</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Value representation</b>
</li>
<li>Varargs</li>
<li>Tail calls</li>
<li>Delimited continuations</li>
<li>Numeric tower</li>
</ul>
</div><p>Even with GC, though, WebAssembly is still a weird machine.  It would
help to see the concrete approaches that some languages of interest
manage to take when compiling to WebAssembly.</p><p>In that spirit, the rest of this article/presentation is a walkthough of
the approach that I am taking as I work on a WebAssembly compiler for
Scheme.  (Thanks to <a href="https://spritely.institute/">Spritely</a> for supporting
this work!)</p><p>Before diving in, a meta-note: when you go to compile a language to,
say, JavaScript, you are mightily tempted to cut corners.  For example
you might implement numbers as JavaScript numbers, or you might omit
implementing continuations.  In this work I am trying to not cut
corners, and instead to implement the language faithfully.  Sometimes
this means I have to work around weirdness in WebAssembly, and that's
OK.</p><p>When thinking about Scheme, I'd like to highlight a few specific areas
that have interesting translations.  We'll start with value
representation, which stays in the GC theme from the introduction.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Values</h2>
<pre>;;       any  extern  func
;;        |
;;        eq
;;     /  |   \
;; <b>i31</b> <b>struct</b>  array
</pre>
<p>
The unitype: <tt>(ref eq)</tt>
</p>
<p>
Immediate values in <tt>(ref i31)</tt>
</p>
<ul>
<li>fixnums with 30-bit range</li>
<li>chars, bools, etc</li>
</ul>
<p>
Explicit nullability: <tt>(ref null eq)</tt> vs <tt>(ref eq)</tt>
</p>
</div><p>The GC extensions for WebAssembly are phrased in terms of a type system.
Oddly, there are three top types; as far as I understand it, this is the
result of a compromise about how WebAssembly engines might want to
represent these different kinds of values.  For example, an opaque
JavaScript value flowing into a WebAssembly program would have type
<tt>(ref extern)</tt>.  On a system with <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations">NaN
boxing</a>,
you would need 64 bits to represent a JS value.  On the other hand a
native WebAssembly object would be a subtype of <tt>(ref any)</tt>, and might
be representable in 32 bits, either because it's a 32-bit system or
because of pointer compression.</p><p>Anyway, three top types.  The user can define subtypes of <tt>struct</tt> and
<tt>array</tt>, instantiate values of those types, and access their fields.
The life cycle of reference-typed objects is automatically managed by
the run-time, which is just another way of saying they are
garbage-collected.</p><p>For Scheme, we need a common supertype for all values: <a href="https://medium.com/@samth/on-typed-untyped-and-uni-typed-languages-8a3b4bedf68c">the unitype, in
Bob Harper's memorable
formulation</a>.
We can use <tt>(ref any)</tt>, but actually we'll use <tt>(ref eq)</tt> -- this is the
supertype of values that can be compared by (pointer) identity.  So now
we can code up <tt>eq?</tt>:</p><pre>(func $eq? (param (ref eq) (ref eq))
           (result i32)
  (ref.eq (local.get a) (local.get b)))
</pre><p>Generally speaking in a Scheme implementation there are <i>immediates</i> and
<i>heap objects</i>.  Immediates can be encoded in the bits of a value,
whereas for heap object the bits of a value encode a reference (pointer)
to an object on the garbage-collected heap.  We usually represent small
integers as immediates, as well as booleans and other oddball values.</p><p>Happily, WebAssembly gives us an immediate value type, <tt>i31</tt>.  We'll
encode our immediates there, and otherwise represent heap objects as
instances of <tt>struct</tt> subtypes.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Values (2)</h2>
<p>
Heap objects subtypes of <tt>struct</tt>; concretely:
</p>
<pre>(struct $heap-object
  (struct (field $tag-and-hash i32)))
(struct $pair
  (<b>sub $heap-object</b>
    (struct <b>i32</b> (ref eq) (ref eq))))
</pre>
<p>GC proposal allows subtyping on structs, functions, arrays</p>
<p>Structural type equivalance: explicit tag useful</p>
</div><p>We actually need to have a common struct supertype as well, for two
reasons.  One is that we need to be able to hash Scheme values by
identity, but for this we need an embedded lazily-initialized hash
code.  It's a bit annoying to take the per-object memory hit but it's a
reality, and the JVM does it this way, so it must not be so terrible.</p><p>The other reason is more subtle: WebAssembly's type system is built in
such a way that types that are "structurally" equivalent are
indistinguishable.  So a pair has two fields, besides the hash, but
there might be a number of other fundamental object types that have the
same shape; you can't fully rely on WebAssembly's dynamic type checks
(<tt>ref.test</tt> et al) to be able to query the type of a value.  Instead we
re-use the low bits of the hash word to include a type tag, which might
be 1 for pairs, 2 for vectors, 3 for closures, and so on.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Values (3)</h2>
<pre>(func $cons (param (ref eq)
                   (ref eq))
            (result (ref $pair))
  (<b>struct.new_canon</b> $pair
    ;; Assume heap tag for pairs is 1.
    (i32.const 1)
    ;; Car and cdr.
    (local.get 0)
    (local.get 1)))

(func $%car (param <b>(ref $pair)</b>)
            (result (ref eq))
  (struct.get $pair 1 (local.get 0)))
</pre>
</div><p>With this knowledge we can define <tt>cons</tt>, as a simple call to
<tt>struct.new_canon pair</tt>.</p><p>I didn't have time for this in the talk, but there is a ghost haunting
this code: the ghost of nominal typing.  See, in a web browser at least,
every heap object will have its first word point to its "hidden class" /
"structure" / "map" word.  If the engine ever needs to check that a
value is of a specific shape, it can do a quick check on the map word's
value; if it needs to do deeper introspection, it can dereference that
word to get more details.</p><p>Under the hood, testing whether a <tt>(ref eq)</tt> is a pair or not should be
a simple check that it's a <tt>(ref struct)</tt> (and not a fixnum), and then a
comparison of its map word to the run-time type corresponding to
<tt>$pair</tt>.  If subtyping of <tt>$pair</tt> is allowed, we start to want inline
caches to handle polymorphism, but the checking the map word is still
the basic mechanism.</p><p>However, as I mentioned, we only have structural equality of types; two
<tt>(struct (ref eq))</tt> type definitions will define the same type and have
the same map word (run-time type / RTT).  Hence the <tt>_canon</tt> in the name of
<tt>struct.new_canon $pair</tt>: we create an instance of <tt>$pair</tt>, with the
<i>canonical</i> run-time-type for objects having <tt>$pair</tt>-shape.</p><p>In earlier drafts of the WebAssembly GC extensions, users could define
their own RTTs, which effectively amounts to nominal typing: not only
does this object have the right structure, but was it created with
respect to this particular RTT.  But, this facility was cut from the
first release, and it left ghosts in the form of these <tt>_canon</tt> suffixes
on type constructor instructions.</p><p>For the Scheme-to-WebAssembly effort, we effectively add back in a
degree of nominal typing via type tags.  For better or for worse this
results in a so-called "open-world" system: you can instantiate a
separately-compiled WebAssembly module that happens to define the same
types and use the same type tags and it will be able to happily access
the contents of Scheme values from another module.  If you were to use
nominal types, you would't be able to do so, unless there were some
common base module that defined and exported the types of interests, and
which any extension module would need to

</div><p>But with all of that I think we have a solid story on how to represent
values.  I went through all of the basic value types in Guile and
checked that they could <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot-updates/-/blob/main/examples/basic-types.wat">all be represented using GC
types</a>,
and it seems that all is good.  Now on to the next point: varargs.</p><div>

<p>Problem: Wasm functions strongly typed</p>
<pre>(func $list (param ???) (result (ref eq))
  ???)</pre>
<p>Solution: Virtualize calling convention</p>
</div><p>In WebAssembly, you define functions with a type, and it is impossible
to call them in an unsound way.  You must call <tt>$car</tt> exactly 2
arguments or it will not compile, and those arguments have to be of
specific types, and so on.  But Scheme doesn't enforce these
restrictions on the language level, bless its little miscreant heart.
You can call <tt>car</tt> with 5 arguments, and you'll get a run-time error.
There are some functions that can take a variable number of arguments,
doing different things depending on incoming argument count.</p><p>How do we square these two approaches to function types?</p><div>
<pre>;; "Registers" for args 0 to 3
(global $arg0 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))
(global $arg1 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))
(global $arg2 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))
(global $arg3 (mut (ref eq)) (i31.new (i32.const 0)))

;; "Memory" for the rest
(type $argv (array (ref eq)))
(global $argN (ref $argv)
        (array.new_canon_default
          $argv (i31.const 42) (i31.new (i32.const 0))))</pre>
<p>Uniform function type: argument count as sole parameter</p>
<p>Callee moves args to locals, possibly clearing roots</p>
</div><p>The approach we are taking is to virtualize the calling convention.  In
the same way that when calling an x86-64 function, you pass the first
argument in <tt>$rdi</tt>, then <tt>$rsi</tt>, and eventually if you run out of
registers you put arguments in memory, in the same way we'll pass the
first argument in the <tt>$arg0</tt> global, then <tt>$arg1</tt>, and eventually in
memory if needed.  The function will receive the number of incoming
arguments as its sole parameter; in fact, all functions will be of type
<tt>(func (param i32))</tt>.</p><p>The expectation is that after checking argument count, the callee will
load its arguments from globals / memory to locals, which the compiler
can do a better job on than globals.  We might not even emit code to
null out the argument globals; might leak a little memory but probably
would be a win.</p><p>You can imagine a world in which <tt>$arg0</tt> actually gets globally
allocated to <tt>$rdi</tt>, because it is only live during the call sequence;
but I don't think that world is this one :)</p><div>

working around the lack of tail calls, and I could have done so here,

<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (1)</h2>
<p>Problem: Lightweight threads/fibers, exceptions</p>
<p>Possible solutions</p>
<ul>
<li>Eventually, built-in coroutines</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">binaryen</a>’s asyncify (not yet ready for GC); see Julia
</li>
<li>
<b>Delimited continuations</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“Bring your whole self”</p>
</div><p>Before diving in though, one might wonder why bother.  Delimited
continuations are a building-block that one can use to build other, more
useful things, notably exceptions and light-weight threading / fibers.
Could there be another way of achieving these end goals without having
to implement this relatively uncommon primitive?</p><p>For fibers, it is possible to <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2018/05/16/lightweight-concurrency-in-lua">implement them in terms of a built-in
coroutine
facility</a>.
The standards body seems willing to include a coroutine primitive, but
it seems far off to me; not within the next 3-4 years I would say.  So
let's put that to one side.</p><p>There is a more near-term solution, to use <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1294#issuecomment-520231415">asyncify to implement
coroutines</a>
somehow; but my understanding is that asyncify is not ready for GC yet.</p><p>For the Guile flavor of Scheme at least, delimited continuations are
table stakes of their own right, so given that we will have them on
WebAssembly, we might as well use them to implement fibers and
exceptions in the same way as we do on native targets.  Why compromise
if you don't have to?</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (2)</h2>
<p>Prompts delimit continuations</p>
<pre>(define k
  (call-with-prompt ’foo
    ; body
    (lambda ()
      (+ 34 (abort-to-prompt 'foo)))
    ; handler
    (lambda (continuation)
      continuation)))

(k 10)       ;; ⇒ 44
(- (k 10) 2) ;; ⇒ 42</pre>
<p>
<tt>k</tt> is the <tt>_</tt> in <tt>(lambda () (+ 34 _))</tt>
</p>
</div><p>There are a few ways to implement <a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2010/02/26/guile-and-delimited-continuations">delimited
continuations</a>,
but my usual way of thinking about them is that a delimited continuation
is a slice of the stack.  One end of the slice is the <i>prompt</i>
established by <tt>call-with-prompt</tt>, and the other by the continuation of
the call to <tt>abort-to-prompt</tt>.  Capturing a slice pops it off the stack,
copying it out to the heap as a callable function.  Calling that
function splats the captured slice back on the stack and resumes it
where it left off.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (3)</h2>
<p>Delimited continuations are stack slices</p>
<p>Make stack explicit via minimal continuation-passing-style conversion</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn all calls into tail calls</li>
<li>Allocate return continuations on explicit stack</li>
<li>Breaks functions into pieces at non-tail calls</li>
</ul>
</div><p>This low-level intuition of what a delimited continuation is leads
naturally to an implementation; the only problem is that we can't slice
the WebAssembly call stack.  The workaround here is similar to the
varargs case: we virtualize the stack.</p><p>The mechanism to do so is a continuation-passing-style (CPS)
transformation of each function.  Functions that make no calls, such as
leaf functions, don't need to change at all.  The same goes for
functions that make only tail calls.  For functions that make non-tail
calls, we split them into pieces that preserve the only-tail-calls
property.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (4)</h2>
<p>Before a non-tail-call:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push live-out vars on stacks (one stack per top type)</li>
<li>Push continuation as funcref</li>
<li>Tail-call callee</li>
</ul>
<p>Return from call via pop and tail call:</p>
<pre>(return_call_ref (call $pop-return)
                 (i32.const 0))</pre>
<p>After return, continuation pops state from stacks</p>
</div><p>Consider a simple function:</p><pre>(define (f x y)
  (+ x (g y))
</pre><p>Before making a non-tail call, a "tailified" function will instead push
all live data onto an explicitly-managed stack and tail-call the
callee.  It also pushes on the return continuation.  Returning from the
callee pops the return continuation and tail-calls it.  The return
continuation pops the previously-saved live data and continues.</p><p>In this concrete case, tailification would split <tt>f</tt> into two pieces:</p><pre>(define (f x y)
  (push! x)
  (push-return! f-return-continuation-0)
  (g y))

(define (f-return-continuation-0 g-of-y)
  (define k (pop-return!))
  (define x (pop! x))
  (k (+ x g-of-y)))
</pre><p>Now there are no non-tail calls, besides calls to run-time routines like
<tt>push!</tt> and <tt>+</tt> and so on.  This transformation is implemented by
<a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=guile.git;a=blob;f=module/language/cps/tailify.scm;h=f9ebb63d20b7ad736e74c39327d854de0fb798af;hb=refs/heads/wip-tailify">tailify.scm</a>.</p><div>
<h2>Scheme to Wasm: Prompts (5)</h2>
<p>
<tt>abort-to-prompt</tt>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Pop stack slice to reified continuation object</li>
<li>Tail-call new top of stack: prompt handler</li>
</ul>
<p>Calling a reified continuation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push stack slice</li>
<li>Tail-call new top of stack</li>
</ul>
<p>No need to wait for effect handlers proposal; you can have it all now!</p>
</div><p>The salient point is that the stack on which <tt>push!</tt> operates (in
reality, probably four or five stacks: one in linear memory or an array
for types like <tt>i32</tt> or <tt>f64</tt>, three for each of the managed top types
<tt>any</tt>, <tt>extern</tt>, and <tt>func</tt>, and one for the stack of return
continuations) are managed by us, so we can slice them.</p><p>Someone asked in the talk about whether the explicit memory traffic and
avoiding the return-address-buffer branch prediction is a source of
inefficiency in the transformation and I have to say, yes, but I don't
know by how much.  I guess we'll find out soon.</p><div>

<li>
On web: <tt>BigInt</tt>
</li>
<li>On edge: Wasm support module (mini-gmp?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dynamic dispatch for polymorphic ops, as usual</p>
</div><p>First, I would note that sometimes the compiler can unbox numeric
operations.  For example if it infers that a result will be an inexact
real, it can use unboxed <tt>f64</tt> instead of library routines working on
heap flonums (<tt>(struct i32 f64)</tt>; the initial i32 is for the hash and
tag).  But we still need a story for the general case that involves
dynamic type checks.</p><p>The basic idea is that we get to have fixnums and heap numbers.  Fixnums
will handle most of the integer arithmetic that we need, and will avoid
allocation.  We'll inline most fixnum operations as a fast path and call
out to library routines otherwise.  Of course fixnum inputs may produce
a bignum output as well, so the fast path sometimes includes another
slow-path callout.</p><p>We want to minimize binary module size.  In an ideal
compile-to-WebAssembly situation, a small program will have a small
module size, down to a minimum of a kilobyte or so; larger programs can
be megabytes, if the user experience allows for the download delay.
Binary module size will be dominated by code, so that means we need to
plan for aggressive dead-code elimination, minimize the size of fast
paths, and also minimize the size of the standard library.</p><p>For numbers, we try to keep module size down by leaning on the platform.
In the case of bignums, we can punt some of this work to the host; on a
JavaScript host, we would use <tt>BigInt</tt>, and on a WASI host we'd compile
an external bignum library.  So that's the general story: inlined fixnum
fast paths with dynamic checks, and otherwise library routine callouts,
combined with aggressive whole-program dead-code elimination.</p><div>

		<p>When NP-hardness pops up on the internet, say because some silly blogger wants to <a href="http://jeremykun.com/2012/03/22/nintendo-np-hard/">write about video games</a>, it’s often tempting to conclude that the problem being proved NP-hard is actually very hard!</p>
<p>“Scientists proved Super Mario is NP-hard? I always knew there was a reason I wasn’t very good at it!” Sorry, these two are unrelated. NP-hardness means hard in a narrow sense this post should hopefully make clear. After that, we’ll explore what “hard” means in a mathematical sense that you can apply beyond NP-hardness to inform your work as a programmer.</p>
<p>When a problem is NP-hard, that simply means that the problem is sufficiently expressive that you can use the problem to express logic. By which I mean boolean formulas using AND, OR, and NOT. In the Super Mario example, the “problem” is a bundle of (1) the controls for the player (2) the allowed tiles and characters that make up a level, and (3) the goal of getting from the start to the end. Logic formulas are encoded in the creation of a level, and solving the problem (completing the level) is the same as finding conditions to make the logical formula true.</p>

<p>In this sense, NP-hardness doesn’t make all of Super Mario hard. The levels designed to encode logical formulas are contrived, convoluted, and contorted. They abuse the rules of the game in order to cram boolean logic into it. These are&nbsp;<em>worst case levels</em>. It’s using Mario for a completely unintended purpose, not unlike <a href="https://github.com/j2kun/general-audience-math-essays/blob/master/reductions-mathematical-hacks.md">hacking</a>. And so NP-hardness is a worst case claim.</p>
<p>To reiterate, NP-hardness means that Super Mario has&nbsp;<em>expressive power</em>. So expressive that it can emulate other problems we believe are hard in the worst case. And, because the goal of mathematical “hardness” is to reason about the limitations of algorithms, being able to solve Super Mario in full generality implies you can solve any hard subproblem, no matter how ridiculous the level design.</p>
<p>The P != NP conjecture says that there’s no polynomial time algorithm to determine whether boolean logic formulas are satisfiable, and so as a consequence Super Mario (in full generality) also has no polynomial time algorithm.</p>
<p>That being said, in reality Super Mario levels do not encode logical formulas! If you use the knowledge that real-world Super Mario levels are designed in the way they are (to be solvable, fun), then you can solve Super Mario with algorithms. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44">There are many examples</a>.</p>
<p>In general, the difficulty of a problem for humans is unrelated to the difficulty for algorithms. Consider multiplication of integers. This is a trivial problem for computers to solve, but humans tend to struggle with it. It’s an <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/arthur_benjamin_does_mathemagic">amazing feat</a>&nbsp;to be able to multiply two 7 digit numbers&nbsp;in less than 5 seconds, whereas computers can multiply two thousand-digit numbers in milliseconds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding">protein folding</a> is known to be an NP-hard problem, but it’s been turned into a <a href="https://fold.it/">game sufficiently easy for humans to solve</a> that players have contributed to scientific research. Indeed, even some of the most typically cited NP-hard problems, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman</a>, have heuristic, practical algorithmic solutions that allow one to solve them (very close to optimally) in hours on inputs as large as <a href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/">every city on earth</a>.</p>
<p>So the mathematical notions of hardness are quite disconnected from practical notions of hardness. This is not even to mention that some NP-hard problems can be efficiently approximated to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial-time_approximation_scheme">within any desired accuracy</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s dig into the math a bit more. “Hardness” is a family of ideas about comparisons between problems based on reusability of algorithmic solutions. Loosely speaking, a problem $ R$ is hard with respect to a class of problems $ C$ if an algorithm solving $ R$ can be easily transformed into an algorithm solving any problem in $ C$. You have to say what kinds of transformations are allowed, and the transformation can be different for different target problems in $ C$, but that’s the basic idea.</p>
<p>In the Super Mario example, if you want to solve logical formulas, you can transform a hypothetically perfect mario-level-playing algorithm into a logic solver by encoding the formula as a level and running the mario-level-playing algorithm on it as a black box. Add an if statement to the end to translate “level can/can’t be finished” to “formula can/can’t be satisfied,” and the transformation is complete. It’s important for NP-hardness that the transformation only takes polynomial time. Other kinds of hardness might admit more or restrict to fewer resources.</p>
<p>And so this is what makes Mario NP-hard, because boolean logic satisfiability is NP-hard. Any problem in NP can be solved by a boolean logic solver, and hence also by a mario-level-player. The fact that boolean logic solving is NP-hard is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem">difficult theorem to prove</a>. But if we assume it’s true, you can compose the transformations to get from any NP problem to Super Mario.</p>
<p>As a simple example of a different kind of hardness, you can let $ C$ be the class of problems solvable using only a finite amount of memory (independent of the input). You have probably heard of this class of problems by another name, but I’ll keep you guessing until the end of the post. A $ C$-hard problem $ R$ is one for which an algorithmic solution can be repurposed to solve any finite-memory-solvable problem.</p>
<p>We have to be careful: if the transformation between solutions allows us polynomial time (in the size of the input) like it did for NP-hardness, then we might have enough time in the transformation alone to solve the entire problem, removing the need for a solution to $ R$ in the first place! For this reason, we have to limit the amount of work that can be done in the transformation. We get a choice here that influences how interesting or useful the definition of hardness is, but let’s just pick one and say that the transformation can only use finite <em>time </em>(independent of the input).</p>
<p>To be fair, I actually don’t know if there are any hard problems with respect to this definition. There probably are, but chances are good that they are not members of $ C$, and that’s where the definition of hardness gets really interesting. If you have a problem in $ C$ which is also $ C$-hard, it’s called&nbsp;<em>complete</em> for $ C$. And once you’ve found a complete problem, from a theoretical perspective you’re a winner. You’ve found a problem which epitomizes the difficulty of solving problems in $ C$. And so it’s a central aim of researchers studying a complexity class to find complete problems. As they say in the business, “ABC: always be completing.”</p>
<p>As a more concrete and interesting example, the class $ P$ of all polynomial-time solvable problems has a complete problem. Here the transformations are a bit up in the air. They could either be logarithmic-space computations, or what’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NC_(complexity)">NC</a>, which can be thought of as poly-logarithmic time (very fast) parallel computations. I only mention NC because it allows you to say “P-complete problems are hard to parallelize.”</p>
<p>Regardless of the choice, there are a number of very useful problems known to be P-complete. The first is the&nbsp;<em>Circuit Value Problem</em>, given a circuit (described by its gates and wires using any reasonable encoding) and an input to the circuit, what is the output?</p>
<p>Others include <a href="http://jeremykun.com/2014/06/02/linear-programming-and-the-most-affordable-healthy-diet-part-1/">linear programming</a> (optimize this linear function with respect to linear constraints), data compression (does the compressed version of a string $ s$ using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch">Lempel–Ziv–Welch</a>&nbsp;contain a string $ t$?), and type inference for partial types. There are many more in this <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.31.2644&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">compendium of Greenlaw et al.</a>&nbsp;Each one is expressive enough to encode any instance of the other, and any instance of any problem in P. It’s quite curious to think that gzip can solve linear programs, but that’s surely no curiouser than super mario levels encoding boolean logic.</p>
<p>Just as with NP-hardness, when a problem is P-hard that doesn’t automatically mean it’s easy or hard for humans, or that typical instances can’t be easily parallelized. P-hardness is also a worst case guarantee.</p>
<p>Studying P-completeness is helpful in the same way NP-completeness is helpful. Completeness informs you about whether you should hope to find a perfect solution or be content with approximations and heuristics (or incorporate problem context to make it easier). Knowing a problem is P-complete means you should not expect <strong>perfect</strong> efficient parallel algorithms, or <strong>perfect&nbsp;</strong>efficient algorithms that use severely limited space. Knowing a problem is NP-hard means you should not expect a&nbsp;<strong>perfect</strong> polynomial time solution. In other words, if you are forced to work with those restrictions, the game becomes one of tradeoffs. Hardness and completeness focus and expedite your work, and clarify a principled decision making process.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>
<p>P.S. The class of problems solvable in a finite amount of memory is just the class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language">regular languages</a>. The “finite memory” is the finite state machine used to solve them.</p>

<p><span>In modern </span><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/categories/vampires"><span>vampire</span></a><span> lore, the</span> process for becoming undead typically involves a darkly romantic setting, a fang-y bite, and a long, dramatic drink from the neck. But that’s the result of the last hundred years or so of vampire stories. In post-medieval <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/things-to-do/poland">Poland</a>, undead evil was far more banal and less elegant; it was believed to possess the souls of those who had the misfortune to die early in epidemics, by suicide, or simply before being baptized. So when it came time to bury these poor souls, care was taken to ensure they would not provide an easy vessel for a malicious, supernatural force.</p>
<p>In late July 2023, archaeologists working on a 17th-century cemetery outside the southeastern Polish village of Pień excavated the remains of a child who appeared to have been interred in the period’s “anti-vampire” style. The child (its sex is unknown) placed face-down—with a padlock near its feet.</p>
<p>“That was very typical for an anti-vampire security practice,” says Dariusz Poliński, from the Middle Ages department at Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, who led the excavation.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to know a post-medieval undertaker’s exact intentions, but Poliński’s conclusions about the practice were bolstered by a similar grave nearby. in 2022, his team excavated the body of a young woman who’d also been buried with a padlock, this time on her toe, and a sickle positioned over her throat.</p>
<p>The locks, sickle, and prone position fall into the category of burial known as apotropaic—that is, people buried in a way meant to ward off evil. Said evil could come from forces outside the grave or, more often, within. Should a vampire or other undead presence awaken, the reasoning goes, the lock and downward-facing position would hold it in place. Woe to the revenant who tried to rise with a sharp sickle positioned over its throat.</p>
<p>Apotropaic graves of this sort date back to the Early Middle Ages and have also appeared in Slovakia, Hungary, Austria, and Romania. In addition to the features observed at Pień, such burials may involve decapitations, stakes through the chest, or protective coins placed in the deceased’s mouth. They tend to appear most frequently during times of mass tragedy—epidemics, wars, or any other time when people might see the tragedy around them and assume that evil is afoot.</p>
<p>Seventeenth-century Poland was an ideal setting for this. That is, it was an especially brutal time to be alive. “This was a century of wars, crisis, and very cold weather,” Poliński says. “It was a small ice age.”</p>

<p>There were several plagues throughout the 1600s—including cholera epidemics that spread across Eastern Europe in waves—that may have led to a spike in ritual and fear surrounding death, especially those whose deaths weren’t easily explained. Similar graves have been found at a 17th-century site in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0113564">northwest Poland</a>. A <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26160144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1674 account</a> describes a town that was terrorized by a revenant that drank human blood (the townspeople, eventually, decapitated him).</p>
<p>Marek Polcyn, an anthropologist at Ontario’s Lakehead University, suggests another potential reason for anti-demonic burials in 17th-century Poland. In a paper, “<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/buried-with-sickles-early-modern-interments-from-drawsko-poland/791AADE59597383DA4D5EA0221034AF9">Buried with Sickles: Early Modern Interments from Drawsko, Poland,</a>” Polcyn writes that the rise of Catholic dogma during the Counter-Reformation—when the Catholic Church pushed back against Protestantism—caused a resurgence of folkloric beliefs. As Catholic clergy stoked fears of the devil and witchcraft, he argues, Polish villagers turned back to traditional Slavic beliefs, including superstitions about the living dead.</p>
<figure><img src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/HcErykLvdn4HTLrM3kF7ruOsi_AQKR55NGbV_PO5eWQ/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy83MGI2Mzk5YWEw/ZmUzMjA4NGVfSU1H/XzMxMDkuSlBH.jpg" alt="A padlock placed on the woman's foot was intended, archaeologists believe, to hinder her escape from the grave." width="auto" data-kind="article-image" id="article-image-96105" data-src="https://img.atlasobscura.com/HcErykLvdn4HTLrM3kF7ruOsi_AQKR55NGbV_PO5eWQ/rt:fill/w:1200/el:1/q:81/sm:1/scp:1/ar:1/aHR0cHM6Ly9hdGxh/cy1kZXYuczMuYW1h/em9uYXdzLmNvbS91/cGxvYWRzL2Fzc2V0/cy83MGI2Mzk5YWEw/ZmUzMjA4NGVfSU1H/XzMxMDkuSlBH.jpg"><figcaption>A padlock placed on the woman’s foot was intended, archaeologists believe, to hinder her escape from the grave. <a target="_blank" href="https://portal.umk.pl/">Photo Łukasz Czyżewski/Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the term “anti-vampire” is often used to describe these burials, Polcyn points out that “vampire” is a modern term, and is applied to just one of several undead forces in Slavic folklore. The <em>upiór—</em>a sort of proto-vampire—was an unclean or cursed spirit; the <em>strzyga </em>was a witch-like demon; and the <em>strigoi</em> was a shape-shifter that craved human blood. But scholars say that the graves were a kind of catch-all practice that could have applied to any of these beasties.</p>
<p>To sort through the superstition and get at the social processes behind the bodies at Pień, Poliński’s team is conducting genetic testing, specifically for evidence of disease or unusual physical attributes. Any variation, in a time of such social stress, might have inspired the fear behind the rituals.</p>
<div><p>Poliński knows there’s also the chance that there will be nothing unusual about the woman and child. As during the 17th-century <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/witch-house-salem">witch trials</a> centered around Salem, Massachusetts, he says, Polish villagers might not have needed much to label a person as a supernatural threat—sometimes a grudge was at work, or perhaps scapegoating.</p><p>“It also might have been something very simple,” he says, “like an argument between neighbors.”</p></div>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We conducted a search for narrowband radio signals over four observing
sessions in 2020-2023 with the L-band receiver (1.15-1.73 GHz) of the 100 m
diameter Green Bank Telescope. We pointed the telescope in the directions of 62
TESS Objects of Interest, capturing radio emissions from a total of ~11,860
stars and planetary systems in the ~9 arcminute beam of the telescope. All
detections were either automatically rejected or visually inspected and
confirmed to be of anthropogenic nature. In this work, we also quantified the
end-to-end efficiency of radio SETI pipelines with a signal injection and
recovery analysis. The UCLA SETI pipeline recovers 94.0% of the injected
signals over the usable frequency range of the receiver and 98.7% of the
injections when regions of dense RFI are excluded. In another pipeline that
uses incoherent sums of 51 consecutive spectra, the recovery rate is ~15 times
smaller at ~6%. The pipeline efficiency affects SETI search volume calculations
as well as calculations of upper bounds on the number of transmitting
civilizations. We developed an improved Drake Figure of Merit for SETI search
volume calculations that includes the pipeline efficiency and frequency drift
rate coverage. Based on our observations, we found that there is a high
probability (94.0-98.7%) that fewer than ~0.014% of stars earlier than M8
within 100 pc host a transmitter that is detectable in our search (EIRP &gt; 10e12
W). Finally, we showed that the UCLA SETI pipeline natively detects the signals
detected with AI techniques by Ma et al., 2023.

In particular, it focuses on physical manufacturing.</p><p>It's in the form of a fictitious personal tale. A plant manager struggles to save his plant from closure, and his marriage from falling apart.</p><p>The lesson is about lean management.</p><p>My main takeaway is the realization that when we try to optimize something, we focus on how to do something more efficiently. What more often is a problem is that people and processes are blocked from doing work. They spend a lot of time waiting and doing nothing. Focusing on reducing waits will produce better results than focusing on doing the work faster. Of course reducing the waits might mean doing some targeted piece of work faster. It could also mean doing better scheduling or focusing on other resource contention.</p><p>Recently I used this mindset to optimize a legacy DB struggling under the weight of a hodgepodge of unmaintained code. It worked wonderfully. Instead of fixing the slowest queries, focused on fixing the ones that block the most often. The result was that the DB <i>was</i> able to handle the workload after all.

I'm not sure what possessed me to read these books but I was curious about both industries since they are significant parts of the economy but I knew next to nothing about them.<p>The banking book is called "The Most Fun I Never Want To Have Again: A Mid-Life Crisis in Community Banking"[0] and it tells the story of an attempted bank startup in Georgia just before the financial crisis. It has a very clear explanation of the bank business model and how small banks make money. One of the surprising things I took away from it is that bank founders think of starting a bank in ways that are very similar to how tech founders think of starting of company. The main difference is that the bank business model is already well understood to those in the industry and success depends much more on your positioning in the market than it does on innovation.</p><p>The insurance book is called "Risk &amp; Reward: An Inside View of the Property/Casualty Insurance Business"[1] and is by Stephen Catlin, who founded an insurance company that he grew to several thousand employees with offices around the world and later sold for $4 billion. Very UK centered since that's mostly where his career took place but I don't think the fundamentals of the industry change that much around the world. Pretty detailed on the mechanics of how insurance underwriting works and what insurance underwriters think about when pricing risk. Made me realize insurance is much more like trading than I'd previously thought.</p><p>[0]: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ELPOA3S/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ELPOA3S/</a></p><p>[1]: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073NRDNSC/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073NRDNSC/</a>

The thesis is that the Christian Church inadvertently created modern society by prohibiting polygamy and cousin marriage.</p><p>The topic of polygamy is what’s really stuck in my head. Polygamy is a more natural state for civilized human societies than we think it is. It may be to women’s advantage to choose an “elite” spouse she has to share because it could mean a better quality of life for her and her children than the alternatives. Chris Hemsworth could have two dozen wives if it were legal and social acceptable (and he wanted to), and his wives might be happy with that. But the downside (or one of them) is that it creates huge imbalances in society—men find it really hard to find a mate. They then do risky stuff to make it into the elite to try to attract a mate—steal to accumulate wealth or kill potential romantic rivals.</p><p>This isn’t in the book, but it made me think—are we back in that same position now? Polygamy isn’t *technically* legal or common, but you still have plenty of people who have many romantic partners—just not at the same time. We know the what the activity of dating apps looks like—a very small subset of “elite” men get an outsized proportion of likes and matches from women. It’s slim pickings for the rest of the men. Are men, unable to find a mate, going to resort to risky behavior to try to make it into that subset that are able to attract women?

The earth is absolutely covered in life.</p><p>And it all came out of mud!</p><p>I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to nerd out on ecology, aquariums, water, etc.

The book focuses on rural China and it's challenges. The gist of the book is that countries generally move from low to middle income by doing cheap labor. The move from middle to high income requires a educated workforce. If you don't have enough educated workers across the board you fall into the middle income trap where you have large structural unemployment and get high crime. This happened to Mexico and Brazil for example. China's rural population struggles with a low education level. The author investigated why. The answers come down to a mix of health issues, lack of education on how to raise babies, dysfunction in the education system and the houku system.<p>Short interesting read for anyone interested in China or development economics. The book does a great job composting to other countries and showing that way how development works and doesn't.

He recently started a new series called Hierarchy, which I also recommend. They're very "grounded" fantasy, and the magic systems is very woven into society and its structure. The human relationships in his books are pretty nuanced, which is why I like his works so much.

But its more for the different perspective of a chinese writer talking about western events, and the general outlook of how events progress - the downplay of individuality, the scope of things, and some history of the chinese point of view.<p>However what I didn’t like throughout all 3 books is just how predictable the antagonists are … like the main characters devise a plan, stick to it and things unfold generally how they’ve predicted, with very few (though big) exceptions.</p><p>Maybe thats also part of the chinese perspective? I’m used to Branden Sanderson type of narrative where the bad guys are smarter than the good ones, outplay and counter moves, and apply constant pressure, but can be outplayed themselves as well.</p><p>Three body problem was more like if the other side has an advantage, there’s nothing you can do, and if they don’t, just follow the plan … But apart from that incredible series.

Just giving myself some time for experience to percolate and synthesize into something worth publishing. Meanwhile, I'll give one instance of how it helps practically.<p>Say, I manage engineers, and I have a new intern, who is supposed to behave in a particular way, with particular standards. Their words strongly suggest sincerity, but again and again their actions go in the opposite direction. Why does this happen, what's the "problem"?</p><p>From Bohms framework, this sort of behavior is way too common, and it is due to the paradoxical nature of our psychological machinery. It's not a problem, it's a paradox. In the mind of the intern, there tends to be competing and opposing needs. One hand, they want higher quality output (verbally asserted). On the other hand, the unspoken parts of the mind demand comfort and energy saving. On top of this "incoherent" intentions/results, the intern will seem like they're lying, since words and actions/results don't match. They say they want quality, but behavior goes another way.</p><p>So, I see this entire situation clearly, so I become more patient. I understand it's not a simple situation, there's a lot going on underneath the hood. I can help this intern see their inner contradiction, generate higher awareness, make them work with less inner friction (and eventually less external friction). My process for helping someone out becomes accurate, crisp and helpful due to these additional insights from Bohm.</p><p>This is just one instance of Bohms framework helping me out in a practical organizational context.

What a ride. I know it's a famous series, but I'm outside the US and so only recently became aware of its existence, and also therefore went in mostly blind as to the subject (I knew very little of LBJ prior). Am partway through the 2nd book now, with the conclusion of the 1948 Texan Senate Democratic primary, and my mouth just sort of hung open for pages at a time during that.<p>Caro's a talented writer, but what really shows through is just the sheer years of hard work he clearly put into the books. I don't know how one can focus for so many years on just one writing project.

<p>At Terraform Industries we believe in a future where energy is universally cheap, clean, and abundant. We’re developing a scalable electrolyzer to deliver the cheapest possible green hydrogen, which we use as a precursor chemical to make cheap synthetic carbon neutral natural gas in our <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2023/06/26/the-terraformer-mark-one/">Terraformer</a>.</p>

<p>We find in our conversations with other builders in the climate/energy space that the destiny of hydrogen is often incompletely understood, so I’m writing this post to explain how Terraform is approaching the question.</p>



<p>Hydrogen production uses a lot of energy. Green hydrogen, produced without CO2 emissions, is currently a more expensive option than production from CH4, which produces a lot of CO2. We want green hydrogen to compete on cost, not just vibes. We believe that correctly developed energy should deliver a green dividend rather than demanding a green premium, and that rapid mass market adoption depends on beating the incumbent polluters on price.</p>



<p>(As an aside, it is quite obviously impossible to enforce universal adoption of more expensive carbon-free energy through, eg, mandatory carbon offsets, as higher gas prices are political suicide regardless of system of government.)</p>



<p>The cost of green hydrogen is a combination of the embodied energy (opex) and the amortized cost of the hydrogen electrolyzer (capex) which splits water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. Hydrogen distribution costs are also extremely high, but because Terraform is only using hydrogen as an immediate precursor we’re going to ignore distribution costs here. There are other methods for making carbon-free hydrogen, such as methane pyrolysis, which we will also not develop further in this post.</p>



<p>Let’s get quantitative. The best real world legacy electrolysis systems consume about 50 kWh/kg-H2. The theoretical optimum is 39.4 kWh/kg-H2, and Terraform’s electrolyzers are closer to 80 kWh/kg-H2 as it allows us to deliver a lower cost of hydrogen for reasons that will soon be apparent.</p>



<p>The cost goal for green hydrogen is $1/kg-H2. It is widely believed that if green hydrogen can reach this threshold it will be much much more attractive on the energy market. For context, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) green hydrogen production tax credit (PTC) in section 45V is worth $3/kg-H2, which may be enough to make it competitive with steam reforming in the short term.</p>



<p>The cheapest retail grid power is roughly $100/MWh. Using 50 kWh/kg-H2, we see that electricity cost alone works out at $5/kg-H2 – a clear non-starter. Assuming a $1/kg cost is achieved, electricity cost must be less than $20/MWh, and that’s assuming zero capex – an unwise assumption as electrolyzers are traditionally very expensive pieces of equipment.</p>



<p>Still, $20/MWh focuses the attention. Where can one find power that cheap or, ideally, cheaper? Enter solar! This isn’t the place to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAU5D8hqIUI">talk endlessly about solar</a>, but if hypothetically we were looking for an energy generation technology which a) got 10x cheaper in the last 10 years, b) was scaling up production by at least 50% per year, and c) had no moving parts, solar photovoltaic (PV) is it! Indeed, in many large markets today it is now cheaper to install and operate a solar plant than to operate an already existing coal or gas plant. And if you love some other electricity generation technology, I’m happy for you, please reach $10/MWh LCOE and I’ll buy terawatts of it. </p>

<p>We want the cheapest possible power. What adds cost to solar power? Moving it from the array to another place. Using it at night. Using it when there are clouds blowing by. A typical solar-grid system today will have, in addition to the solar panels, a large and expensive “balance of plant” including inverters, battery storage, substations, grid interconnects, and then the rest of the electricity distribution grid, which includes long distance transmission lines, more substations, transformers, power lines, repair crews, insurance, fire safety, billing departments, legacy power plants, etc etc etc.</p>



<p>We want the cheapest possible power, so we have to delete all these additional cost sinks which do not actually make power and which add much much more than $20/MWh in cost. Then, determine if we can use the resulting, cheapest possible raw solar electricity to make hydrogen. Indeed, right now we have a test rig set up to derisk solar panels directly feeding an electrolyzer, without any intermediate power conversion.</p>

<p>The single biggest objection we hear to feeding raw solar direct current (DC) into our electrolyzer is that solar utilization is around 0.25 so our electrolyzer will need to be able to throttle down overnight, and our electrolyzer utilization will only be 0.25. For a given quantity of hydrogen, we will need 4x as many electrolyzers and they are extremely expensive.</p>



<p>Adding batteries to smooth out supply adds substantial cost, with the cheapest geography-dependent wind/solar/battery green power coming in at about $45/MWh, or $2.25/kg-H2 on power alone. At current rates of battery cost improvement, it will be several decades until 24/7 power will be less than $1/kg-H2, so we must find another way!</p>



<p>Let’s detour slightly into electrolyzer cost land. Large scale 50 kWh/kg-H2 electrolyzers typically cost $1000s/kW, but we’ll stick to $1000/kW as a nice round number. 1 MWh of electricity produces 20 kg of H2. If we operate a $1m, 1 MW electrolyzer for 50,000 hours (5.7 years flat out), we will produce 1,000,000 kg-H2. Assuming zero financing or maintenance costs and total amortization over that period, capex alone works out to $1/kg, which is extremely ominous. I can’t see how we can get to $1/kg-H2 if capex is $1/kg and the cheapest 24/7 power is $2.25/kg-H2, for a total of $3.25/kg-H2. </p>



<p>50 kWh/kg-H2 is already close to ideal electrical efficiency, so the only way to cut the per-unit capex cost is to amortize equipment over a longer time period. But even if 0% financing and $0 maintenance costs can be found, hitting $1/kg-H2 will require (eg) 24/7 electricity for $15/MWh and a 25 year payback period, which places severe constraints on the industry’s ability to scale up quickly. There just isn’t that much 0% interest money on 25 year loans floating around.</p>



<p>Why are electrolyzers so expensive? To hit 50 kWh/kg-H2 or ~80% efficiency, electrolyzers need to use expensive platinum group metal electrodes, special separation membranes, heat exchangers, pumps, post-processing, and extremely high pressures and temperatures, which further restrict material choices and manufacturing processes. But in essence, electrolyzers are glorified electric resistors, with no more intrinsic complexity than a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OVENTE-Electric-Borosilicate-Boiling-Countertop/dp/B00DEPGY7G/">kettle that boils water</a> and costs $15/kW, including free two day shipping from China! </p>



<p>Let’s re-examine the above hopeless economics with a different set of numbers. For the sake of argument, let’s say the Terraform electrolyzer can hit $100/kW and 80 kWh/kg-H2. This is much cheaper than a traditional electrolyzer, but it’s also just 50% efficient, which enables us to delete all the expensive stuff. Critically, it is happy to eat variable diurnal solar DC directly from the panel at $20/MWh. We’ll amortize over the same 5.7 years, but assume only 0.25 utilization for a total of 12500 hours. </p>



<p>Our hypothetical 1 MW electrolyzer costs just $100,000. Over 12,500 hours it consumes 12,500 MWh, producing 156,250 kg-H2, costing just $0.64/kg-H2 for capex. Power costs work out to $1.60/kg-H2, for a total of just $2.24/kg-H2 – more than $1 cheaper than the higher utilization, higher efficiency legacy electrolyzer model. </p>



<p>This is interesting – it goes against our intuition about the virtue of high efficiency and high capital utilization. But it’s not particularly mysterious. Hydrogen is an energy product, and if we’re doing it right then 70-80% of the product cost will be electricity opex. This is particularly important in the context of solar cost continuing to decline. A high capex option will still cost a lot even if electricity cost goes to zero, whereas a lower efficiency, higher power consumption option will pass cost savings on cheap power through to the consumer. Practically speaking, the best way to “short” future solar cost declines is to develop infrastructure now that achieves highly scalable low capex by trading away some electrical efficiency and being flexible enough to consume intermittent renewable electricity sources.</p>



<p>To make this future extremely legible, let’s run the numbers again but with $10/MWh solar cost, such as we expect by about 2028, the same lower efficiency (50%, 80 kWh/kg-H2) and with $50/kW capex, which is still more expensive than most household appliances of comparable complexity. Now capex is just $0.32/kg-H2 while opex is $0.80/kg-H2, for a total of just $1.12/kg-H2, which is extremely close to the magical $1/kg, while legacy systems that cannot exploit cheap solar will still be around $3/kg. </p>



<p>For the fully general case, the figures below give quantitative model analysis showing that the cost penalty of solar load shifting beyond ~0.25 utilization places insurmountable barriers on reaching $1/kg-H2 for green hydrogen. There is a saving grace! We can build low utilization lower efficiency electrolyzers cheaply enough to get to $1/kg-H2, but we have to follow the cheapest solar wherever it leads – in this case away from 100% utilization and high electrical efficiency. </p>

<p>I am 100% confident that by the time we are mass producing this system at these prices later this decade, not only will this be the cheapest hydrogen available anywhere, it will also be the cheapest chemical energy and by far the most scalable – offering &lt;5 year ROI with an extremely competitive supply chain and able to address nearly every market on Earth. This is in sharp contrast to fossil oil and gas, which is hidden underground in just a few places on Earth and impossible to exploit without global infrastructure. </p>



<p>Indeed, as we’ve <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2023/01/09/terraform-industries-whitepaper-2-0/">written before</a> once solar synthetic gas hits the cost parity threshold with fossil hydrocarbons there will be unstoppable global development until further price reductions and capacity increases saturate demand. Conservatively, we expect the oil and gas industry to grow from $6.4T/year today to at least $25T/year once second order global economic growth is factored in, and if we execute well we could be done by ~2040. </p>

<p>Render of 1 MW Terraformer showing electrolyzer stacks (blue), CO2 capture system (orange) and fuel synthesis reactor (yellow). There are 32 electrolyzer stacks each consuming 25 kW directly from adjacent panels (not pictured). </p>



<p>This natural implication of the basic underlying economics implies some potentially unexpected future developments, which I will list here for completeness. We expect to see the development of roughly <a href="https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2022/07/24/were-going-to-need-a-lot-of-solar-panels/">400 TW of solar worldwide</a>, &gt;90% of which will supply synthetic fuels most likely via hydrogen electrolysis and then catalytic synthesis using direct air capture (DAC) CO2. This will consume roughly 5% of Earth’s land surface area, comparable to current roads and urbanization and a lot less (in terms of both area and ecological impact) than current exploitation with farming and forestry, not to mention conventional fossil fuels extraction or uninhabited deserts.</p>



<p>While electrification will continue to displace existing hydrocarbon usage, particularly in ground transportation and some residential heating applications, we expect hydrocarbon consumption to shift and grow, particularly in manufacturing and aviation as we move towards a near term future of unconditional material abundance for everyone on Earth. Do we want a future where Europe pushes through mandatory low quality carbon offsets on airfares, further restricting the privilege of high speed travel to the richest of the rich? Or do we want a future where cheap carbon-neutral aviation fuel expands access to globe-spanning travel opportunities for hundreds of millions of people while also enabling a renaissance of supersonic transport?</p>



<p>While hydrocarbons today supply roughly 2/3 of the ~100 quads of energy consumed annually in the US, by ~2040 hydrocarbons will be downstream of cheap solar, just as nearly all grid electricity will be downstream of solar, providing energy to customers through parallel distribution networks of electricity, oil, and gas. </p>



<p>This Sankey diagram provides a rough sketch of the <a href="http://energyliteracy.com/">US energy economy</a> as it existed in 2021.</p>

<p>The Terraform electrolyzer is composed of roughly 4000 individual cells. 100% market saturation implies the deployment of 400 million 1 MW electrolyzers worldwide. Not including ongoing fleet turnover, we expect the synthetic fuel industry to build and deploy 1.6 trillion electrolyzer cells, each roughly the size and cost of a dining plate, over the next 20 years. On average this works out to 2500 cells per second! I am wary of exaggeration but I think it is fair to say that in terms of parts, factories, ramp rate, and energy consumption, this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale">single largest technology roll out</a> to occur in the history of humanity, and will cause the other so-called industrial revolutions to pale into insignificance. </p>

    <p>Never before in my life had I seen so many smart people working on the same goal: making LLMs better. After talking to many people working in both industry and academia, I noticed the 10 major research directions that emerged. The first two directions, hallucinations and context learning, are probably the most talked about today. I’m the most excited about numbers 3 (multimodality), 5 (new architecture), and 6 (GPU alternatives).</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="1_reduce_and_measure_hallucinations">1. Reduce and measure hallucinations</h2>

<p><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html#rlhf_and_hallucination">Hallucination</a> is a heavily discussed topic already so I’ll be quick. Hallucination happens when an AI model makes stuff up. For many creative use cases, hallucination is a feature. However, for most other use cases, hallucination is a bug. I was at a panel on LLM with Dropbox, Langchain, Elastics, and Anthropic recently, and the #1 roadblock they see for companies to adopt LLMs in production is hallucination.</p>

<p>Mitigating hallucination and developing metrics to measure hallucination is a blossoming research topic, and I’ve seen many startups focus on this problem. There are also ad-hoc tips to reduce hallucination, such as adding more context to the prompt, chain-of-thought, self-consistency, or asking your model to be concise in its response.</p>

<p>To learn more about hallucination:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="2_context_learning">2. Optimize context length and context construction</h2>

<p>A vast majority of questions require context. For example, if we ask ChatGPT: “What’s the best Vietnamese restaurant?”, the context needed would be “where” because the best Vietnamese restaurant in Vietnam would be different from the best Vietnamese in the US.</p>

<p>According to this cool paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06157.pdf">SituatedQA</a> (Zhang &amp; Choi, 2021), a significant proportion of information-seeking questions have context-dependent answers, e.g. roughly 16.5% of the <a href="https://ai.google.com/research/NaturalQuestions">Natural Questions NQ-Open dataset</a>. Personally, I suspect that this percentage would be even higher for enterprise use cases. For example, say a company builds a chatbot for customer support, for this chatbot to answer any customer question about any product, the context needed might be that customer’s history or that product’s information.</p>

<p>Because the model “learns” from the context provided to it, this process is also called context learning.</p>

<center>
    <figure>
    <img alt="Context needed for a customer support query" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/llm-research/2-context.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>Context length is especially important for RAG – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401">Retrieval Augmented Generation</a> (Lewis et al., 2020) – which has emerged to be the predominant pattern for LLM industry use cases. For those not yet swept away in the RAG rage, RAG works in two phases:</p>

<p>Phase 1: chunking (also known as indexing)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Gather all the documents you want your LLM to use</li>
  <li>Divide these documents into chunks that can be fed into your LLM to generate embeddings and store these embeddings in a vector database.</li>
</ol>

<p>Phase 2: querying</p>

<ol>
  <li>When user sends a query, like “<em>Does my insurance policy pay for this drug X</em>”, your LLM converts this query into an embedding, let’s call it QUERY_EMBEDDING</li>
  <li>Your vector database fetches the chunks whose embeddings are the most similar to QUERY_EMBEDDING</li>
</ol>

<p>Screenshot from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njzB6fm0U8g">Jerry Liu’s talk on LlamaIndex</a> (2023)</p>

    <figure>
    <img alt="Context needed for a customer support query" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/llm-research/2-rag.jpg">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>The longer the context length, the more chunks we can squeeze into the context. The more information the model has access to, the better its response will be, right?</p>

<p>Not always. How much context a model can use and how efficiently that model will use it are two different questions. In parallel with the effort to increase model context length is the effort to make the context more efficient. Some people call it “prompt engineering” or “prompt construction”. For example, a paper that has made the rounds recently is about how models are much better at understanding information at the beginning and the end of the index rather than in the middle of it – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172">Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts</a> (Liu et al., 2023).</p>

<h2 id="3_incorporate_other_data_modalities">3. Incorporate other data modalities</h2>

<p>Multimodality, IMO, is so powerful and yet so underrated. There are many reasons for multimodality.</p>

<p>First, there are many use cases where multimodal data is required, especially in industries that deal with a mixture of data modalities such as healthcare, robotics, e-commerce, retail, gaming, entertainment, etc. Examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oftentimes, medical predictions require both text (e.g. doctor’s notes, patients’ questionnaires) and images (e.g. CT, X-ray, MRI scans).</li>
  <li>Product metadata often contains images, videos, descriptions, and even tabular data (e.g. production date, weight, color). You might want to automatically fill in missing product information based on users’ reviews or product photos. You might want to enable users to search for products using visual information, like shape or color.</li>
</ul>

<p>Second, multimodality promises a big boost in model performance. Shouldn’t a model that can understand both text and images perform better than a model that can only understand text? Text-based models require so much text that there’s a realistic concern that <a href="https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html#data_bottleneck_for_pretraining">we’ll soon run out of Internet data to train text-based models</a>. Once we run out of text, we’d need to leverage other data modalities.</p>

<p>One promising use case is that multimodality can also enable visually impaired people to browse the Internet and also navigate the real world.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a post on multimodality that hopefully I can share soon!</p>

<h2 id="4_make_llms_faster_and_cheaper">4. Make LLMs faster and cheaper</h2>

<p>When GPT-3.5 first came out in late November 2022, many people had concerns about latency and cost of using it in production. However, latency/cost analysis has changed rapidly since then. Within half a year, the community found a way to create a model that came pretty close to GPT-3.5 in terms of performance, yet required just under 2% of GPT-3.5’s memory footprint.</p>

<p>My takeaway: if you create something good enough, people will figure out a way to make it fast and cheap.</p>

<p>Four years ago, when I started working on the notes that would later become the section <strong><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/ch07.html#model_compression">Model Compression</a></strong> for the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Machine-Learning-Systems-Production-Ready/dp/1098107969"><strong>Designing Machine Learning Systems</strong></a>, I wrote about four major techniques for model optimization/compression:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Quantization</strong>: by far the most general model optimization method. Quantization reduces a model’s size by using fewer bits to represent its parameters, e.g. instead of using 32 bits to represent a float, use only 16 bits, or even 4 bits.</li>
  <li><strong>Knowledge distillation</strong>: a method in which a small model (student) is trained to mimic a larger model or ensemble of models (teacher).</li>
  <li><strong>Low-rank factorization</strong>: the key idea here is to replace high-dimensional tensors with lower-dimensional tensors to reduce the number of parameters. For example, you can decompose a 3x3 tensor into the product of a 3x1 and a 1x3 tensor, so that instead of having 9 parameters, you have only 6 parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Pruning</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>All these four techniques are still relevant and popular today. Alpaca was trained using knowledge distillation. QLoRA used a combination of low-rank factorization and quantization.</p>

<h2 id="5_design_a_new_model_architecture">5. Design a new model architecture</h2>

<p>Since AlexNet in 2012, we’ve seen many architectures go in and out of fashion, including LSTM, seq2seq. Compared to those, Transformer is incredibly sticky. It’s been around since 2017. It’s a big question mark how much longer this architecture will be in vogue.</p>

<p>Developing a new architecture to outperform Transformer isn’t easy. Transformer has been so heavily optimized over the last 6 years. This new architecture has to be performing at the scale that people care about today, on the hardware that people care about. Side note: <a href="https://timdettmers.com/2018/10/17/tpus-vs-gpus-for-transformers-bert/">Transformer was originally designed by Google to run fast on TPUs</a>, and only later optimized on GPUs.</p>

<p>There was a lot of excitement in 2021 around S4 from Chris Ré’s lab – see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396">Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces</a> (Gu et al., 2021). I’m not quite sure what happened to it. Chris Ré’s lab is still very invested in developing new architecture, most recently with their architecture <a href="https://together.ai/blog/monarch-mixer">Monarch Mixer</a> (Fu et al., 2023) in collaboration with the startup <a href="https://together.ai/blog/monarch-mixer">Together</a>.</p>

<p>Their key idea is that for the existing Transformer architecture, the complexity of attention is quadratic in sequence length and the complexity of an MLP is quadratic in model dimension. An architecture with subquadratic complexity would be more efficient.</p>

<p>I’m sure many other labs are working on this idea, though I’m not aware of any attempt that has been made public. If you know of any, please let me know!</p>

<h2 id="6_develop_gpu_alternatives">6. Develop GPU alternatives</h2>

<p>GPU has been the dominating hardware for deep learning ever since AlexNet in 2012. In fact, one commonly acknowledged reason for AlexNet’s popularity is that it was the first paper to successfully use GPUs to train neural networks. Before GPUs, if you wanted to train a model at AlexNet’s scale, you’d have to use thousands of CPUs, like the one <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/technology/in-a-big-network-of-computers-evidence-of-machine-learning.html">Google released just a few months before AlexNet</a>. Compared to thousands of CPUs, a couple of GPUs were a lot more accessible to Ph.D. students and researchers, setting off the deep learning research boom.</p>

<p>In the last decade, many, many companies, both big corporations, and startups, have attempted to create new hardware for AI. The most notable attempts are Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/intro-to-tpu">TPUs</a>, Graphcore’s <a href="https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu">IPUs</a> (what’s happening with IPUs?), and <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/cerebras-sells-100-million-ai-supercomputer-plans-8-more/">Cerebras</a>. SambaNova raised over <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/sambanova-ceo-ai-interview">a billion dollars to develop new AI chips</a> but seems to have pivoted to being a generative AI platform.</p>

<p>For a while, there has been a lot of anticipation around quantum computing, with key players being:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum">IBM’s QPU</a></li>
  <li>Google’s Quantum computer reported <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00536-w">a major milestone in quantum error reduction</a> earlier this year in Nature. Its quantum virtual machine is publicly accessible via <a href="https://quantumai.google/quantum-virtual-machine">Google Colab</a></li>

<p>Another direction that is also super exciting is photonic chips. This is the direciton I know the least about – so please correct me if I’m wrong. Existing chips today use electricity to move data, which consumes a lot of power and also incurs latency. Photonic chips use photons to move data, harnessing the speed of light for faster and more efficient compute. Various startups in this space have raised hundreds of millions of dollars, including <a href="https://lightmatter.co/">Lightmatter</a> ($270M), <a href="https://ayarlabs.com/">Ayar Labs</a> ($220M), <a href="https://www.lightelligence.ai/">Lightelligence</a> ($200M+), and <a href="https://www.luminous.com/">Luminous Computing</a> ($115M).</p>

<p>Below is the timeline of advances of the three major methods in photonic matrix computation, from the paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41377-022-00717-8">Photonic matrix multiplication lights up photonic accelerator and beyond</a> (Zhou et al., Nature 2022). The three different methods are plane light conversion (PLC), Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI), and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM).</p>

<h2 id="7_make_agents_usable">7. Make agents usable</h2>

<p>Agents are LLMs that can take actions, like browsing the Internet, sending emails, making reservations, etc. Compared to other research directions in this post, this might be the youngest direction.</p>

<p>Because of the novelty and the massive potential, there’s a feverish obsession with agents. <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT">Auto-GPT</a> is now the 25th most popular GitHub repo ever by the number of stars. <a href="https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer">GPT-Engineering</a> is another popular repo.</p>

<p>Despite the excitement, there is still doubt about whether LLMs are reliable and performant enough to be entrusted with the power to act.</p>

<p>One use case that has emerged though is the use of agents for social studies, like the famous Stanford experiment that shows that a small society of generative agents produces emergent social behaviors: <em>for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party …</em> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442">Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior</a>, Park et al., 2023)</p>

<p>The most notable startup in this area is perhaps Adept, founded by two Transformer co-authors (though <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/two-co-founders-of-adept-an-openai-rival-suddenly-left-to-start-another-company">both already left</a>) and an ex-OpenAI VP, and has raised almost half a billion dollars to date. Last year, they had a demo showing their agent browsing the Internet and adding a new account to Salesforce. I’m looking forward to seeing their new demos 🙂</p>

<h2 id="8_improve_learning_from_human_preference">8. Improve learning from human preference</h2>

<p><a href="https://huyenchip.com/2023/05/02/rlhf.html">RLHF, Reinforcement Learning from Human Preference</a>, is cool but kinda hacky. I wouldn’t be surprised if people figure out a better way to train LLMs. There are many open questions for RLHF, such as:</p>

<p><strong>1. How to mathematically represent human preference?</strong></p>

<p>Currently, human preference is determined by comparison: human labeler determines if response A is better than response B. However, it doesn’t take into account how much better response A is than response B.</p>

<p><strong>2. What’s human preference?</strong></p>

<p>Anthropic measured the quality of their model’s responses along the three axes: helpful, honest, and harmless. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073">Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback</a> (Bai et al., 2022).</p>

<p>DeepMind tries to generate responses that please the most people. See <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/publications/fine-tuning-language-models-to-find-agreement-among-humans-with-diverse-preferences">Fine-tuning language models to find agreement among humans with diverse preferences</a>, (Bakker et al., 2022).</p>

<p>Also, do we want AIs that can take a stand or a vanilla AI that shies away from any potentially controversial topic?</p>

<p><strong>3. Whose preference is “human” preference, taking into account the differences in cultures, religions, political leanings, etc.?</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of challenges in obtaining training data that can be sufficiently representative of all the potential users.</p>

<p>For example, for OpenAI’s InstructGPT data, there was no labeler above 65 years old. Labelers are predominantly Filipino and Bangladeshi. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155">InstructGPT: Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback</a> (Ouyang et al., 2022).</p>

</center>


<p>Community-led efforts, while admirable in their intention, can lead to biased data. For example, for the OpenAssistant dataset, 201 out of 222 (90.5%) respondents identify as male. <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1647763133665271808/photo/1">Jeremy Howard has a great Twitter thread on this</a>.</p>

<h2 id="9_improve_the_efficiency_of_the_chat_interface">9. Improve the efficiency of the chat interface</h2>

<p>Ever since ChatGPT, there have been multiple discussions on whether chat is a suitable interface for a wide range of tasks.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/naturallanguageui.html">Natural language is the lazy user interface</a> (Austin Z. Henley, 2023)</li>
  <li><a href="https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/boo-chatbots">Why Chatbots Are Not the Future</a> (Amelia Wattenberger, 2023)</li>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17710">What Types of Questions Require Conversation to Answer? A Case Study of AskReddit Questions</a> (Huang et al., 2023)</li>

  <li><a href="https://eugeneyan.com/writing/llm-ux/">Interacting with LLMs with Minimal Chat</a> (Eugene Yan, 2023)</li>
</ul>

<p>However, this is not a new discussion. In many countries, especially in Asia, chat has been used as the interface for super apps for about a decade. <a href="http://dangrover.com/blog/2014/12/01/chinese-mobile-app-ui-trends.html">Dan Grover had this discussion back in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The discussion again got tense in 2016, when many people thought apps were dead and chatbots would be the future.</p>

</ul>

<p>Personally, I love the chat interface because of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Chat is an interface that everyone, even people without previous exposure to computers or the Internet, can learn to use quickly. When I volunteered at a low-income residential neighborhood (are we allowed to say slum?) in Kenya in the early 2010s, I was blown away by how comfortable everyone there was with doing banking on their phone, via texts. No one in that neighborhood had a computer.</li>
  <li>Chat interface is accessible. You can use voice instead of text if your hands are busy.</li>
  <li>Chat is also an incredibly robust interface – you can give it any request and it’ll give back a response, even if the response isn’t good.</li>
</ol>

<p>However, there are certain areas that I think the chat interface can be improved upon.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple messages per turn</p>

    <p>Currently, we pretty much assume one message per turn. This is not how my friends and I text. Often, I need multiple messages to complete my thought, because I need to insert different data (e.g. images, locations, links), I forgot something in the previous messages, or I just don’t feel like putting everything into a massive paragraph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Multimodal input</p>

    <p>In the realm of multimodal applications, most energy is spent on building better models, and very little on building better interfaces. Take <a href="https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/playground/models/neva">Nvidia’s NeVA chatbot</a>. I’m not a UX expert, but I suspect there might be room for UX improvement here.</p>

    <p>P.S. Sorry the NeVA team for calling you out. Even with this interface, your work is super cool!</p>

    <center>
     <figure>
     <img alt="NVIDIA's NeVA interface" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/llm-research/9-neva.png">
     </figure>
 </center>
    
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Incorporating generative AI into your workflows</p>

    <p>Linus Lee covered this point well in his talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd-J3hmycQs">Generative AI interface beyond chats</a>. For example, if you want to ask a question about a column of a chart you’re working on, you should be able just point to that column and ask a question.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Editing and deletion of messages</p>

    <p>How would editing or deletion of a user input change the conversation flow with the chatbot?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="10_build_llms_for_non_english_languages">10. Build LLMs for non-English languages</h2>

<p>We know that current English-first LLMs don’t work well for many other languages, both in terms of performance, latency, and speed. See:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05613">ChatGPT Beyond English: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models in Multilingual Learning</a> (Lai et al., 2023)</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized">All languages are NOT created (tokenized) equal</a> (Yennie Jun, 2023)</li>

    <img alt="Tokenization for non-English languages" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/llm-research/10-non-english-tokens.png">
    </figure>
</center>


<p>I’m only aware of the effort to train Vietnamese ChatGPT (<a href="https://discord.gg/a2PCzB4AdE">Symato</a> might be the biggest community effort). If you’re aware of community initiatives in other languages, I’d be happy to include them here.</p>

<p>Several early readers of this post told me they don’t think I should include this direction for two reasons.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>This is less of a research problem and more of a logistics problem. We already know how to do it. Someone just needs to put money and effort into it. This is not entirely true. Most languages are considered low-resource, e.g. they have far fewer high-quality data compared to English or Chinese, and might require different techniques to train a large language model. See:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07264">Low-resource Languages: A Review of Past Work and Future Challenges</a> (Magueresse et al., 2020)</li>
      <li><a href="https://aclanthology.org/P19-1310/">JW300: A Wide-Coverage Parallel Corpus for Low-Resource Languages</a> (Agić et al., 2019)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Those more pessimistic think that in the future, many languages will die out, and the Internet will consist of two universes in two languages: English and Mandarin. This school of thought isn’t new – anyone remembers Esperando?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The impact of AI tools, e.g. machine translation and chatbots, on language learning is still unclear. Will they help people learn new languages faster, or will they eliminate the need of learning new languages altogether?</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Phew, that was a lot of papers to reference, and I have no doubt that I still missed a ton. If there’s something you think I missed, please let me know.</p>

<p>Some of the problems mentioned above are harder than others. For example, I think that number 10, building LLMs for non-English languages, is more straightforward with enough time and resources.</p>

<p>Number 1, reducing hallucination, will be much harder, since hallucination is just LLMs doing their probabilistic thing.</p>

<p>Number 4, making LLMs faster and cheaper, will never be completely solved. There is already so much progress in this area, and there will be more, but we will never run out of room for improvement.</p>

<p>Number 5 and number 6, new architectures and new hardware, are very challenging, but they are inevitable with time. Because of the symbiosis between architecture and hardware – new architecture will need to be optimized for common hardware, and hardware will need to support common architecture – they might be solved by the same company.</p>

<p>Some of these problems won’t be solved using only technical knowledge. For example, number 8, improving learning from human preference, might be more of a policy problem than a technical problem. Number 9, improving the efficiency of the chat interface, is more of a UX problem. We need more people with non-technical backgrounds to work with us to solve these problems.</p>

<p>What research direction are you most excited about? What are the most promising solutions you see for these problems? I’d love to hear from you.</p>

						<p><em>Posted on behalf of:</em></p><p><strong>Author:</strong> Brian Will</p><p><strong>Contributors:</strong> David Qian, Abhishek Khade, Joel Schuetze</p><h2 id="toc-hId--1301673934">Introduction</h2><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">Zstandard</a></strong> (zstd) is one of the most popular lossless compression algorithms/formats in use today due to its exceptional speed in decompression and compression while achieving impressive compression ratios. It's a very flexible format allowing for adaption to many types of data and applications. At a high level, the algorithm is a two-stage process. First, the process of finding matches or repetition in the data that results in possible areas of replacement with a more condensed representation, namely a dictionary coder (e.g., LZ77). The output of this stage is several sequences, each of which specifies an offset to a match, match length, and potentially a literal length. The second stage is a process of encoding these output sequences using Finite State Entropy encoding (FSE) or Huffman encoding.</p><p>The topic for this blog is a new feature added to zstd v1.5.4, which allows for an external implementation of a sequence producer to be injected into the zstd pipeline. This enables the utilization of Intel® QuickAssist Technology (Intel® QAT), which can deliver up to <strong>3.2x better throughput</strong>, <strong>3.8x reduction in P99 latency</strong>, and <strong>3.3x better performance per watt</strong> when compared to zstd for compression. With these improvements, it's expected that Intel QAT will open new breakthrough use cases where compression can now be leveraged for workloads where it would not have been feasible previously.</p><p>Intel QAT will be an external sequence producer for zstd, improving performance while exposing the functionality to applications through the familiar zstd interface.</p><h2 id="toc-hId-1185838899">External Sequence Producers</h2><p>An external sequence producer searches an input buffer for matching bytes in the input set.&nbsp;These matches are represented as a list of `ZSTD_Sequesnce`'s capturing information on:</p><ul><li>distance to matching sequence</li><li>match length</li><li>is match a literal</li><li>rep code information</li></ul><p>We'll also cover details of the interfaces to support external sequence producers, along with an implementation for Intel QAT.</p><h4 id="toc-hId-79449014">Zstandard sequence producer registration function</h4><p>In zstd v1.5.4, the <strong><a href="http://In%20zstd v1.5.4, the block-level sequence producer interface was introduced; this allowed an external ‘plugin’ to be invoked per block of data and respond with a set of sequences (literals and matches) for that data.

While the API is compatible with all zstd APIs which respect advanced parameters, there are some <strong><a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/7806d803383b75b00868a5367154a18caf535a92/lib/zstd.h#L2752" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">limitations</a></strong>.</p><h4 id="toc-hId--1728005449">QAT Zstandard Plugin sequence producer API</h4><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/intel/QAT-ZSTD-Plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer">QAT-ZSTD-Plugin</a></strong> provides acceleration of sequence production using Intel QAT through the zstd APIs.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Attendees at Def Con, one of the world’s largest hacking conferences, are used to weird shenanigans, such as <a href="https://www.wallofsheep.com/pages/wall-of-sheep" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a seemingly innocuous wall of computer screens that display people’s passwords</a> sniffed over the conference Wi-Fi network. But at this year’s event, even conference veterans were confused and concerned when their iPhones started showing pop-up messages <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/researcher-says-they-were-behind-iphone-popups-at-def-con/">prompting them to connect their Apple ID or share a password with a nearby Apple TV</a>.</p>

<p>As it turned out, these alerts were part of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/14/researcher-says-they-were-behind-iphone-popups-at-def-con/">a research project that had two goals</a>.</p>
<p>One was to remind people that to switch off Bluetooth on an iPhone, you have to dig into the Settings app and not just tap it off on the quick-access Control Center, which is displayed by swiping down from the top right corner of the iPhone.</p>
<p>The other was “to have a laugh,” <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@jb0x168/110879394826675242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Jae Bochs</a>, the security researcher who said they walked around the conference triggering these pop-ups with a custom-made device.</p>
<p>“I had it in my bag throughout linecon [an informal term that refers to the time spent in line at a conference], vendor areas, and when I was walking around. I tried to remember to disconnect it if I was hanging out for a talk,” Bochs said.</p>
<p>Bochs told TechCrunch that all they needed for this experiment was a contraption consisting of a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W</a>, two antennas, a Linux-compatible Bluetooth adapter, and a portable battery.</p>
<p>Bochs estimated that this combination of hardware, excluding the battery, costs around $70 and has a range of 50 feet, or 15 meters.</p>

<p>They explained that Apple’s protocols for Bluetooth low energy, or BLE, allow the company devices to communicate with each other. Bochs said that they focused on “proximity actions,” which appear on an iPhone screen when Apple devices are close to each other.</p>
<p>“Proximity is determined by BLE signal strength, and it seems most devices intentionally use lowered transmit power for these to keep the range short. I don’t :),” Bochs said.</p>
<p>Bochs also said they created a proof-of-concept that “builds a custom advertisement packet that mimics what Apple TV etc. are constantly emitting at low power,” effectively spoofing an Apple device that tries to repeatedly connect to nearby devices and triggers the pop-ups.</p>
<p>Unlike real Apple devices, his contraption wasn’t programmed to collect any data from nearby iPhones, even if the person tapped and accepted the prompts. But, in theory, they could have collected some data, according to Bochs.</p>
<p>“If a user were to interact with the prompts, and if the other end was set up to respond convincingly, I think you could get the ‘victim’ to transfer a password,” Bochs said. “There’s an issue known for a few years where you can retrieve phone number, Apple ID email, and current Wi-Fi network from the packets.”</p>
<p>The researcher said these issues are already known, at least since <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2019 academic paper</a> that studied Apple’s Bluetooth low energy protocol and concluded that there are “several flaws” that “leak device and behavioral data to nearby listeners.”</p>
<p>“Individually, each flaw leaks a small amount of information, but in aggregate they can be used to identify and track devices over long periods of time,” the researchers wrote in the paper.</p>
<p>That’s why, Bochs said, they think Apple won’t do anything about this.</p>
<p>“Most or all of this is certainly by design, so that watches and headphones keep working with Bluetooth toggled,” they said.</p>
<p>Perhaps, they added, Apple could add a warning message when using the Control Panel toggles that alerts the user that tapping on its Bluetooth icon doesn’t completely shut off Bluetooth and their iPhone can still interact with proximity-activated beacons, such as Bochs’ contraption.</p>
<p>By turning Bluetooth off in the settings, an iPhone user would be safe from devices like theirs, Bochs explained.</p>
<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

Her presence confidently occupies the space she's carved out, one where authenticity and expertise are the primary criteria for recognition. However, her relatability might have exposed her to additional risks. Despite the challenges she faces at home, her success as a major tech influencer on the global stage seems to have placed her within her government's sights.</p><p>Despite her primarily Western audience, Wu has consistently encountered unfavorable treatment from Western media, often tinged with misogyny. Notably, a VICE Magazine reporter appeared to consider outing Wu without her consent, potentially jeopardizing her safety by revealing personal information. In a separate troubling incident, the founder of Make Magazine was compelled to issue a public apology after insinuating that Wu wasn't a "real" human, a baffling assertion considering her substantial and well-documented contributions on YouTube.</p><p>Naomi Wu's devastating July 7th tweet alluded to a pressure that had long been feared by many, yet optimistically hoped she could manage to avoid indefinitely.</p><div><figure><blockquote><p>Ok for those of you that haven't figured it out I got my wings clipped and they weren't gentle about it- so there's not going to be much posting on social media anymore and only on very specific subjects.

Or merely some unfortunate oversight amidst the relentless news churn on the part of those outlets who previously covered her? The tech media's relative silence in the face of Wu's abrupt disconnection illuminates a disconcerting landscape of media acquiescence.</p><p>The omission of her predicament by the media isn't just an oversight—it's a signal suggesting that a significant portion of western media may be increasingly compromised by Beijing's influence, finding themselves unable to criticize foreign policy, lest they rile the tiger and negatively impact their business. A key reason influencers like Wu are able to gain traction is because of the validation they receive from the public and media alike. Silence in such distressing situations can easily be misinterpreted as indifference. Furthermore, when cultural ambassadors like Wu find themselves precipitously exiled from public life, it sends a cautionary tale to those who might have once been emboldened to share their own stories.</p><p><span>These conditions are exacerbated by an apparent and </span><a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/resources/2023/04/18/china-challenges-open-source-osint-social-media/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">ever-tightening grip</a><span> on information from inside China, and amidst these macro concerns lies an added poignant truth about representation and freedom of expression: Naomi Wu is not just a tech virtuoso; she is a living embodiment of resilience for a global LGBTQ community which is navigating increasingly restrictive terrains. Wu's pullback from the public gaze not only deprives the tech world of an icon, it also robs Wu's wider community of a valuable symbol of tenacity, hope, and self-love in the face of repressive state control.</span></p><p>The relentless surveillance and censorship tactics utilized by the Chinese Communist Party are not unfamiliar to the global audience. The tragic predicament of the Uyghurs, a cultural and ethnic Chinese minority subjected to what many have called genocide, stands testament to the CCP's intent to tightly control the cultural viewpoints of its population by any means they consider necessary, even if brutal.</p><p><span>Given these precedents, there is a growing apprehension that Wu's digital silence signals a new chapter in China's human rights transgressions–one in which the LGBTQ community potentially emerges as the newest target of state-led oppression, in keeping with </span><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/09/06/how-targeting-lgbtq-rights-are-part-authoritarian-playbook" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">global trends</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Ying Xin, Beijing's LGBT Center's Executive Director, </span><a href="https://outrightinternational.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/Ying_Xin_China_panel.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">provided</a><span> the statistic that only 5% of Chinese people identifying as LGBTIQ are "out" to their families, with an added 0.1% reporting being out in their professional lives as well.</span></p><p><span>As described by </span><a href="https://outrightinternational.org/our-work/human-rights-research/precarious-progress-advocacy-human-rights-lgbt-people-china" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Outright International</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>The LGBT community in China has experienced a period of tremendous change.

Police also started taking activists to the police station for these “teas,” the activist said.</p></blockquote><p>When I was able to speak to Ms. Wu about the "tea drinking" session (euphemism for police harassment), she sharply conveyed her sense of vulnerability due to the lack of interest in her stepping away from her popular Twitter account, stating,</p><blockquote><p>Literally the only thing that was keeping me online for the past few years was they were worried it would make China look bad if they cracked down on me.

We will publicly disclose the vulnerability after July 31, 2023.</p></blockquote><p><span>As we can see, the vendor finally sat up and took official notice of this severe, privacy-affecting software bug on June 25th–</span><em>only five days before Wu, who has previously tweeted about a vulnerability affecting the same Sogou software, was paid a visit by Chinese authorities.</em></p><p>Wu explicitly drew this connection in my discussion with her:</p><blockquote><p>Five days after Tencent (Shenzhen) admits to the IME vulnerability, the Chinese person (in Shenzhen) who originally publicized it suddenly gets dragged in by the cops and forced offline.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>NONE of them could read English to see my account does not even make China look bad, it was all Baidu fucking translate and demands why I was talking about Signal and the keyboard</p></blockquote><p>Her account concluded with an unsettling revelation about the risk she would face if she were to continue tweeting: having already received two "strikes" from the authorities, a third could mean a years-long prison sentence.</p><blockquote><p>I had to sign and fingerprint a "confession".</p></blockquote><p>So, how could a security vulnerability in a Chinese mobile software play a part in Wu's recent warning from Chinese police?</p><p><span>Wu herself had previously sent various public tweets obliquely warning about similar, privacy harming issues associated with the Sogou software in 2019, citing a 2015 </span><a href="https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~lin.3021/file/SEC15.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">report</a><span> describing similar vulnerabilities. A particular concern she shared was that users of Sogou may decide to install Signal App to communicate, believing the app's safety profile to be broadly appropriate for many people. However, the eavesdropping and network fingerprinting risks associated with the use of a third party keyboard such as Sogou take precedence over Signal's security profile.</span></p><p>This means Signal App cannot stop an input method such as Sogou from recording keystrokes and sending them back to its developer, as explicitly warned by Citizen Lab.</p><p>💡</p><p>China's National Security Law, established in 2020, empowers the government to access surveillance data from Chinese tech companies without the need for a judicial process. This grants authorities the ability to obtain private information whenever deemed necessary.</p><p>It is possible that Wu's tweets about the issues in the Sogou software of which she was aware may have caught the attention of Chinese authorities who were searching for related information on Western networks.</p><p>Wu's theory that her tweets about these vulnerabilities could have led to her temporary detention and coercion now seems entirely plausible.</p><blockquote><p>After 8 years of daily tweeting one of the loudest, most candid voices coming out of China has been deplatformed- absolutely no one gives a shit. I could be dead in a ditch- but we aren’t actually people, we’re just signs for people like you in the West to wave at each other in their ideological war. &nbsp; –Naomi Wu</p></blockquote><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe Now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.hackingbutlegal.com/subscribe?" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><span>Subscribe Now</span></a></p><p><em><strong>Thank you for reading.</strong></em><span> Subscribe here 👆</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">Ubicloud is an open, free, and portable cloud. Think of it as an open alternative to
cloud providers, like what Linux is to proprietary operating systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">Ubicloud provides IaaS cloud features on bare metal providers, such as Hetzner, OVH,
and AWS Bare Metal. You can set it up yourself on these providers or you can use our
managed service. We're currently in public alpha.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick start</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Managed platform</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can use Ubicloud without installing anything. When you do this, we pass along the
underlying provider's benefits to you, such as price or location.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://console.ubicloud.com/" rel="nofollow">https://console.ubicloud.com</a></p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Build your own cloud</h3>
<p dir="auto">You can also build your own cloud. To do this, start up Ubicloud's control plane and
connect to its cloud console.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone git@github.com:ubicloud/ubicloud.git

# Generate secrets for demo
./demo/generate_env

# Run containers: db-migrator, app (web &amp; respirate), postgresql
docker-compose -f demo/docker-compose.yml up

# Visit localhost:3000"><pre><code>git clone git@github.com:ubicloud/ubicloud.git

# Generate secrets for demo
./demo/generate_env

# Run containers: db-migrator, app (web &amp; respirate), postgresql
docker-compose -f demo/docker-compose.yml up

# Visit localhost:3000
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The control plane is responsible for cloudifying bare metal Linux machines.
The easiest way to build your own cloud is to lease instances from one of those
providers. For example: <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/sb" rel="nofollow">https://www.hetzner.com/sb</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once you lease instance(s), run the following script for each instance to cloudify
the instance. By default, the script cloudifies bare metal instances leased from
Hetzner. After you cloudify your instances, you can provision and manage cloud
resources on these machines.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Enter hostname/IP and provider, and install SSH key as instructed by script
docker exec -it ubicloud-app ./demo/cloudify_server"><pre><code># Enter hostname/IP and provider, and install SSH key as instructed by script
docker exec -it ubicloud-app ./demo/cloudify_server
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Later when you create VMs, Ubicloud will assign them IPv6 addresses. If your ISP
doesn't support IPv6, please use a VPN or tunnel broker such Mullvad or Hurricane
Electric's <a href="https://tunnelbroker.net/" rel="nofollow">https://tunnelbroker.net/</a> to connect. Alternatively, you could lease
IPv4 addresses from your provider and add them to your control plane.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why use it</h2>
<p dir="auto">Public cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud made life easier for
start-ups and enterprises. But they are closed source, have you rent computers
at a huge premium, and lock you in. Ubicloud offers an open alternative, reduces
your costs, and returns control of your infrastructure back to you. All without
sacrificing the cloud's convenience.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, AWS offers about two hundred cloud services. Ultimately, we will implement
10% of the cloud services that make up 80% of that consumption.</p>
<p dir="auto">Example workloads and reasons to use Ubicloud today include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">You have an ephemeral workload like a CI/CD pipeline (we're integrating with
GitHub Actions), or you'd like to run compute/memory heavy tests. Our managed
cloud is ~3x cheaper than AWS, so you save on costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You want a portable and simple app deployment service like
<a href="https://github.com/mrsked/mrsk">MRSK</a>. We're moving Ubicloud's control plane
from Heroku to MRSK; and we want to provide open and portable services for
MRSK's dependencies in the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">You have bare metal machines sitting somewhere. You'd like to build your own
cloud for portability, security, or compliance reasons.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">Ubicloud is in public alpha. You can provide us your feedback, get help, or ask
us to support your network environment in the
<a href="https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/discussions">Community Forum</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We follow an established architectural pattern in building public cloud services.
A control plane manages a data plane, where the data plane leverages open source
software.  You can find our current cloud components / services below.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Elastic Compute</strong>: Our control plane communicates with Linux bare metal servers
using SSH. We use <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor">Cloud
Hypervisor</a> as our virtual
machine monitor (VMM); and each instance of the VMM is contained within Linux
namespaces for further isolation / security.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Virtual Networking</strong>: We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec" rel="nofollow">IPsec</a>
tunneling to establish an encrypted and private network environment. We support IPv4
and IPv6 in a dual-stack setup and provide both public and private networking. For
security, each customer’s VMs operate in their own networking namespace. Everything
in virtual networking is layer 3 and up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Block Storage, non replicated</strong>: We use Storage Performance Development Toolkit
(<a href="https://spdk.io/" rel="nofollow">SPDK</a>) to provide virtualized block storage to VMs. SPDK enables
us to add enterprise features such as snapshot and replication in the future. We
follow security best practices and encrypt the data encryption key itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong>: With ABAC, you can define attributes,
roles, and permissions for users and give them fine-grained access to resources. You
can read more about our <a href="https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/blob/main/doc/authorization.md">ABAC design here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What's Next?</strong>: We're planning to work on the elastic load balancer or simple
storage service next. If you have a workload that would benefit from a specific cloud
service, please get in touch with us through our <a href="https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/discussions">Community
Forum</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Control plane: Manages data plane services and resources. This is a Ruby program
that stores its data in Postgres. We use the <a href="https://roda.jeremyevans.net/" rel="nofollow">Roda</a>
framework to serve HTTP requests and <a href="http://sequel.jeremyevans.net/" rel="nofollow">Sequel</a> to
access the database. We manage web authentication with
<a href="http://rodauth.jeremyevans.net/" rel="nofollow">RodAuth</a>. We communicate with data plane servers
using SSH, via the library <a href="https://github.com/net-ssh/net-ssh">net-ssh</a>. For our
tests, we use <a href="https://rspec.info/" rel="nofollow">RSpec</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Cloud console: Server-side web app served by the Roda framework. For the visual
design, we use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" rel="nofollow">Tailwind CSS</a> with components from
<a href="https://tailwindui.com/" rel="nofollow">Tailwind UI</a>. We also use jQuery for interactivity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you’d like to start hacking with Ubicloud, any method of obtaining Ruby and Postgres
versions is acceptable. If you have no opinion on this, our development team uses <code>asdf-vm</code>
as <a href="https://github.com/ubicloud/ubicloud/blob/main/DEVELOPERS.md">documented here in detail</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Do you have any experience with building this sort of thing?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Our founding team comes from Azure; and worked at Amazon and Heroku before that.
We also have start-up experience. We were co-founders and founding team members
at <a href="https://github.com/citusdata/citus">Citus Data</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18990469" rel="nofollow">which got acquired by
Microsoft</a>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How is this different than OpenStack?</h3>
<p dir="auto">We see three differences. First, Ubicloud is available as a managed service (vs boxed
software). This way, you can get started in minutes rather than weeks. Since Ubicloud
is designed for multi-tenancy, it comes with built-in with features such as encryption
at rest and in transit, virtual networking, secrets rotation, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Second, we're initially targeting developers. This -we hope- will give us fast feedback
cycles and enable us to have 6 key services in GA form in the next two years. OpenStack
is still primarily used for 3 cloud services.</p>
<p dir="auto">Last, we're designing for simplicity. With OpenStack, you pick between 10 hypervisors,
10 S3 implementations, and 5 block storage implementations. The software needs to work
in a way where all of these implementations are compatible with each other. That leads
to consultant-ware. We'll take a more opinionated approach with Ubicloud.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Preface</h2>
<details>
<summary>Preface</summary>
<p dir="auto">This was supposed to be a blog post, but I have neither the knowledge, nor the time, nor the energy to set up a nice statically-generated blog like everyone else does on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" rel="nofollow">Hacker News</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming" rel="nofollow">proggit</a>.
Of course, I <em>want</em> one, but I also want to use a fully .NET Core-based static site generator, and therefore have experimented with <a href="https://www.statiq.dev/web" rel="nofollow">Statiq.Dev Web</a>.
However, it turns out that I still need to pick up non-trivial HTML and CSS to make it look like anything but a website from the 1990s.</p>
<p dir="auto">For now, though, GitHub-flavoured Markdown handles almost all use-cases I can think of (embedded images, this spoiler you've opened, complicated lists, in-line HTML for <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, in-line <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$\LaTeX{}$</math-renderer> for <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$\text{maths} \equiv \text{fun}$</math-renderer>...), and GitHub Gists renders Markdown as formatted text anyway, so what else do I need?
I can even pin these gists to my GitHub profile, which is also very nice.
If I ever <em>do</em> prepare a blog, it should be fairly straightforward to migrate these posts to it: they're just Markdown, after all.
The only thing (so far) I've noticed that is missing is auto-numbered headings, although that's apparently a matter of CSS styling.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">I've been meaning to write this for a <em>very</em> long time—more or less since I ever started using Linux properly four years ago, discovered <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ls.1.html#:~:text=entries%20starting%20with%20.-,%2DA%2C%20%2D%2Dalmost%2Dall,-do%20not%20list" rel="nofollow"><code>ls -A</code></a>, and realised what a clutter <code>~</code> was.
At the same time I noticed that the situation on my Windows install was even <em>worse</em>.
What <em>really</em> inspired me to get started was <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/ReportConfigFileLocations" rel="nofollow"><em>Everything that uses configuration files should report where they're located</em></a>.
I resonate strongly with the author's sentiment, and more importantly, dislike 'opinionated' software that likes to do what its author thinks is best instead of following system conventions.</p>
</details>
<h2 dir="auto">1 What is <code>$HOME</code> to you?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Home.
It is where you're supposed to be most comfortable in.
It is your place of refuge, and a sanctum from the mess and chaos of the outside world.
It is where you have complete liberty over <em>everything</em>: what you do, when you do things, how you do them, what things you have.
It is where these things are supposed to be where <em>you</em> want them, and <em>how</em> you want them to be.</p>
<p dir="auto">You buy things to decorate, maintain, and improve your home: paintings, photographs, vases, light fixtures, sofas, chairs, ovens, vacuum cleaners.
You have your own volition to put these wherever you want, and set them up however you want.
Your vacuum cleaner in a wardrobe? Sure.
Or in the washroom, or in the service balcony, or the backyard. You can put its dust bag anywhere you want, too.</p>
<p dir="auto">What if there existed a vacuum cleaner that stopped working if you plugged it into a different socket to the one the manufacturer set out in the manual?
What if it stopped working if you changed where you put its dust bag, or swapped it out for a <em>new</em> dust bag?
Would you buy this vacuum cleaner?
Suppose that this vacuum cleaner was given to you for free, anyway.
Would you still use it, but live with the compromise that your home is not <em>exactly</em> how you want it?</p>
<p dir="auto">If you answer 'maybe', or even 'yes', then welcome to the world of software, where your home is violated on a regular basis.
Software that spews configuration files, temporary and cache files, generated and save files, catalogue files, downloaded files <em>everywhere</em>.
There is little rhyme or reason to any of it: many applications never tell the user they are putting these files <strong>HERE</strong> or <strong>THERE</strong>, and if the user wants to move them around, they aren't given a choice in the matter.
Applications regularly disregard platform conventions (many ironies abound, to be detailed below); even if these conventions are clearly documented, some go <em>out of their way</em> to do their own thing.
Some applications pretend that everything is immaculate, by <em>hiding</em> their mess (and they typically don't do a great job of it: look at many Linux-first program ported to Windows).</p>
<p dir="auto">It would irritate <em>anyone</em>.
I am <em>particularly</em> compulsive about software doing what I'd like it to do, and about following platform conventions.
Conventions, standards, and protocols exist so everyone is on the same page, and there is a common 'language' for software to communicate with.
When software authors break them just for the sake of 'opinionation', or because they <em>feel like it</em> (a worse justification, in my opinion), it only leads to much exasperation on the users' end, because it comes as a surprise to them, and software should <em>not</em> be surprising.
It ought to be reliable, reproducible, and follow expectations.</p>
<p dir="auto">This post is a detailed discussion into user profiles, their directories, and how they are—to put it bluntly—in total disarray on Windows and Linux (I haven't used a Mac in ages, but I assume the situation is very similar there, too).
Applications treat the user profile as a dumping ground, and any user with a reasonably wide list of installed software will find their user profile very difficult to traverse after some time in use.
There are platform conventions and attempts to standardise things on more open-source platforms, but a lot of developers resolutely refuse to change the behaviour of their software for a variety of reasons (some less valid than others).</p>
<p dir="auto">The first part is a deep dive into user profiles on Linux and Windows, and the conventions that have been established on these platforms over the years.
The second section details <em>how</em> they are broken on each platform, and <em>why</em> they are broken.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is a bit of a soapbox, but I hope developers read this, and at least <em>attempt</em> to fix their software so that home directories are cleaner, and users have easier lives maintaining and using their computers.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em><strong>If you want to skip all the setup drudgery, go to <a href="#3conventions-and-why-theyre-broken">§3</a></strong></em>.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">2 Setup</h2>
<p dir="auto">Before I begin, there are some platform-specific details and setup to be discussed, as well as phrasing <em>conventions</em>.
I will use the terms 'home directory' and 'user profile directory' somewhat interchangeably in this post, whereas 'user profile' means the home directory itself and its contents—including user-specific configuration and data—<em>combined</em>.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">2.1 Linux</h3>
<p dir="auto">Linux is famously fragmented, but even so, there exist <em>some</em> conventions for user profiles, especially for desktop environments.
As far as I've seen, Linux user profiles are typically created in <code>/home/&lt;username&gt;</code>.
The directory path may be chosen during the out-of-box experience (OOBE)/first-time setup of a Linux distro or entirely manually, with <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/useradd.8.html#:~:text=%2Dd%2C%20%2D%2Dhome%2Ddir%20HOME_DIR" rel="nofollow"><code>useradd -d</code></a>, which writes to <code>/etc/passwd</code>.
Sometimes, <code>/home</code> might occupy an altogether separate partition/sub-volume (if the user is using Btrfs, for instance).</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.1.1 <code>$HOME</code></h4>
<p dir="auto">Regardless of its location, the environment variable <code>$HOME</code> is set by a login process or graphical display manager (e.g. <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/login.1.html" rel="nofollow"><code>login</code></a>, <code>gdm</code>, <code>sddm</code>, etc.) upon login, based on values previously set in <code>/etc/passwd</code>.
This file is plaintext, but it may also be read using the Linux API:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre>#<span>include</span> <span><span>&lt;</span>cstdio<span>&gt;</span></span>

#<span>include</span> <span><span>&lt;</span>unistd.h<span>&gt;</span></span>

<span>auto</span> <span>main</span>() -&gt; int
{
    <span>auto</span> <span>const</span> pw = <span>getpwuid</span>(<span>getuid</span>());
    <span>if</span> (pw != <span>nullptr</span>) {
        <span>std::printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>User name: %s<span>\n</span><span>"</span></span>, pw-&gt;<span>pw_name</span>);
        <span>std::printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>User ID: %d<span>\n</span><span>"</span></span>, pw-&gt;<span>pw_uid</span>);
        <span>std::printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>Group ID: %d<span>\n</span><span>"</span></span>, pw-&gt;<span>pw_gid</span>);
        <span>std::printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>Home directory: %s<span>\n</span><span>"</span></span>, pw-&gt;<span>pw_dir</span>);
        <span>std::printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>Login shell: %s<span>\n</span><span>"</span></span>, pw-&gt;<span>pw_shell</span>);

        <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
        <span>return</span> <span>1</span>;
    }
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Strictly speaking, though, there is no real concept of a home directory <em>per se</em> on Linux/UNIX (hereafter referred to as *nix), and they aren't treated any differently by the OS (unlike Windows, as seen below).
The <code>pw_dir</code> member variable is just the initial working directory of the login shell and any subsequent shells started by the corresponding user; it could technically point to <em>any</em> directory that has read permissions for said user.
The <code>pwd.h</code> manual <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man0/pwd.h.0p.html#:~:text=char%20%20%20%20*pw_dir%20%20%20%20Initial%20working%20directory" rel="nofollow">states as much</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most shells and desktop environments parse <code>~</code> as an alias to <code>$HOME</code>; running <code>cd</code> without any command-line arguments also <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cd.1p.html#:~:text=2.%20If%20no%20directory%20operand%20is%20given%20and%20the%20HOME%20environment%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20variable%20is%20set%20to%20a%20non%2Dempty%20value%2C%20the%20cd%20utility%20shall%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20behave%20as%20if%20the%20directory%20named%20in%20the%20HOME%20environment%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20variable%20was%20specified%20as%20the%20directory%20operand." rel="nofollow">navigates to <code>$HOME</code></a>.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.1.2 Dot-files and dot-directories</h4>
<p dir="auto">On *nix, prefixing a file or directory with a full-stop (<code>.</code>) excludes said path from being listed in userland utilities, such as <code>ls</code> or graphical file managers by default.
These files are considered 'hidden', although no special meaning is given to them by the filesystem itself (unlike on Windows).
This is <em>convention</em> dating to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190211031031/https://plus.google.com/+RobPikeTheHuman/posts/R58WgWwN9jp" rel="nofollow">earliest days of UNIX</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most Linux users' home directories will contain a collection of these <em>dot-files</em> and <em>dot-directories</em>, and they are typically used to set user-specific configuration for almost all programs on *nix.
They typically reside in the top level of <code>$HOME</code>; for instance, the Vim configuration is in <code>$HOME/.vimrc</code>.
If you <em>do</em> want to list hidden files with <code>ls</code>, use <code>ls -a</code> or <code>ls -A</code>.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.1.3 XDG Base Directories</h4>
<details>
<summary>XDG</summary>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/#:~:text=an%20acronym%20for%20the%20Cross%2DDesktop%20Group" rel="nofollow">XDG stands for 'Cross-Desktop Group'</a>.</p>
</details>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html" rel="nofollow">XDG Base Directory specification</a> defines several environment variables expanding to subdirectories of <code>$HOME</code> in an attempt to standardise dot-files and dot-directories.
I summarise them below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><strong>Variable</strong></th>
<th><strong>Default value</strong></th>
<th><strong>Details</strong></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>$XDG_DATA_HOME</code></td>
<td><code>$HOME/.local/share</code></td>
<td>User-specific data files; e.g. program databases, caches that persist through multiple program runs, search indices, 'Trash' directory for desktop environments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code></td>
<td><code>$HOME/.config</code></td>
<td>User-specific configuration files, including <code>.*rc</code> and <code>.*env</code> files; VS Code <code>settings.json</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>$XDG_STATE_HOME</code></td>
<td><code>$HOME/.local/state</code></td>
<td>User-specific state files, such as terminal history files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>$XDG_CACHE_HOME</code></td>
<td><code>$HOME/.cache</code></td>
<td>Caches limited to single runs of a program, but can extend to persistent caches, e.g. user-installed package manager caches for <code>pip</code>, <code>pacman</code> AUR wrappers, <code>vcpkg</code>, etc.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p dir="auto">Notice the specification provides for the scenario that these environment variables are <em>not</em> defined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">If <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> is either not set or empty, a default equal to <code>$HOME/.config</code> should be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 dir="auto">2.1.4 <code>xdg-user-dirs</code></h4>
<p dir="auto">Since Linux does not provide an 'official' userland environment (unlike Windows), the XDG people have again made effort to set up 'Windows-style' user directories <em>with localisation</em>, called <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs/" rel="nofollow"><code>xdg-user-dirs</code></a>.
Both GNOME and KDE Plasma Desktop require it.
This tool is configured with a straightforward script in <code>$(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs</code>.
The default directories generated on an English-language install are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Desktop</li>
<li>Documents</li>
<li>Downloads</li>
<li>Music</li>
<li>Pictures</li>
<li>Public</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Videos</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As always, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_user_directories" rel="nofollow">relevant article at the Arch wiki</a> is very useful.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.1.5 <code>systemd-homed</code></h4>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-homed.service.html" rel="nofollow"><code>systemd-homed</code></a> allows Linux administrators to create and manage user profiles, and optionally encrypt them.
It also has roughly equivalent functionality to Active Directory and roaming user profiles on Windows, where user profiles may be encrypted and stored remotely on some server, for retrieval by terminals upon login.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">2.2 Windows</h3>
<details>
<summary>Windows and Microsoft commentary</summary>
<p dir="auto">I hold several very controversial opinions about Microsoft and Windows that would at best, raise many hackers' eyebrows, and at worst, get me called an astroturfer or Microsoft shill.
These are best left to a separate blog post.</p>
</details>
<p dir="auto">User profiles on Windows are a rather complex matter, which is not necessarily unwelcome.
Most of it is configurable, fairly well-documented, and there is more than one way to do things, although some are clearly better than others.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.2.1 Environment variables</h4>
<p dir="auto">Modern Windows (i.e. Vista and later) also has environment variables for important directories, including those within the user profile directory.
Many are listed <a href="https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> (Microsoft's <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/windows/deployment/usmt/usmt-recognized-environment-variables" rel="nofollow">official documentation</a> is a little less forthcoming), and I reproduce a few in the table below.</p>
<table>

<p dir="auto">These environment variables may be accessed from C or C++ with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/getenv-wgetenv?view=msvc-170" rel="nofollow"><code>getenv()</code></a>, or any other language-specific API.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.2.2 User profile creation and naming</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is a mess on Windows. Until Windows 8, user profile creation was straightforward, and only local accounts could be created (not including Active Directory roaming profiles).
Since then, however, OneDrive (previously SkyDrive) and Microsoft account integration has thoroughly road-rolled over this simplicity.
Today, creating a local, non-connected user profile in the OOBE in Windows 11 is <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-set-windows-11-without-microsoft-account#:~:text=Use%20the%20%22Shift%20%2B%20F10%22%20keyboard%20shortcut%20to%20open%20Command%20Prompt" rel="nofollow">a particularly convoluted process</a>, and may require Windows 11 Pro, which is usually not shipped with consumer devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">This digression is to discuss what home directory name users end up with: on a profile connected to a Microsoft account, the user home directory has a name that is the first five characters, in lowercase, of the email address or name provided.
For instance, in the first case, I would have <code>%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Users\shara</code>, but on a 'local account', it would be <code>%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Users\Sharadh</code> (mine is <em>actually</em> the latter—I am obsessive about this, so I created a local account first, and <em>then</em> synced it to OneDrive).
Like many things Windows, configuring the user profile directory after account creation requires <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/troubleshoot/windows-client/user-profiles-and-logon/renaming-user-account-not-change-profile-path" rel="nofollow">editing registry keys</a> using <em>another</em> administrator account.</p>

<p dir="auto">These libraries are initially created under <code>%USERPROFILE%</code>, but may be moved (right click → <code>Properties</code> → <code>Location</code> tab → <code>Move...</code>) by the user at their own discretion.
The Windows API provides enumerated GUIDs called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/windows/win32/shell/knownfolderid" rel="nofollow"><code>KNOWNFOLDERID</code></a>s that map to these directories, as well as <em>most</em> of the system directories listed in <a href="#221environment-variables">Environment variables</a>.

<h5 dir="auto">2.2.3.1 Hidden folders on Windows</h5>
<p dir="auto">In particular, the parent directory of <code>shell:AppData</code> and <code>shell:Local AppData</code>—<code>%USERPROFILE%\AppData</code>—is a <em>hidden</em> directory.
Unlike *nix, 'hidden' on Windows has special semantics accorded by the filesystem (usually NTFS).
This can be set either graphically (right-click → <code>Properties</code> → <code>General</code> tab → <code>Hidden</code> checkbox under <code>Attributes</code>), or retrieved/set programmatically in the Windows API, using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileattributesw" rel="nofollow"><code>GetFileAttributes</code></a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getfileattributesw" rel="nofollow"><code>SetFileAttributes</code></a>.

<h4 dir="auto">2.2.4 Windows XP to Vista changes</h4>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://archive.ph/eOGDp" rel="nofollow"><em>A Brief History of Windows Profiles</em></a> is a great article, but I want to focus on one important section.
Windows 2000 and XP used <code>%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;</code> for the home directory, which was moved to <code>%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Users\&lt;username&gt;</code> with Vista and later.
Windows Vista also introduced the above-mentioned <code>KNOWNFOLDERID</code>s, which superseded the older <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/windows/win32/shell/csidl" rel="nofollow"><code>CSIDL</code></a> enumeration (although the latter is still available, and used by the .NET API).</p>
<p dir="auto">Many environment variables like <code>%APPDATA%</code> were also redirected to the current locations (the previous was a mouthful: <code>%SYSTEMDRIVE%\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Local Settings\Application Data</code>).
New known folders were added, such as <code>Downloads</code> and <code>Saved Games</code>; the <code>My⎵</code> prefix was removed from <code>My Documents</code> and <code>My Music</code>; locations such as <code>Start Menu</code> were moved (in this case, to <code>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">The reason for this move is anyone's guess, but I feel the <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$\geq$</math-renderer> Vista convention makes a lot more sense than the <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$\leq$</math-renderer> Windows XP one.
There is an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120621131135/http://technet.microsoft.com:80/en-sg/library/cc766489(v=ws.10).aspx" rel="nofollow">old guide</a> for sysadmins migrating from Windows XP to Vista, and there is another blog post for Windows application developers: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/archive/blogs/patricka/where-should-i-store-my-data-and-configuration-files-if-i-target-multiple-os-versions#targeting-vista-and-higher" rel="nofollow"><em>Where Should I Store my Data and Configuration Files if I Target Multiple OS Versions?</em></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As an aside, there is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29187896" rel="nofollow">an apocryphal tale</a> for the reason why programs are stored in <code>Program Files</code> and not <code>ProgramFiles</code> or <code>Program_Files</code>: apparently Microsoft wanted to force programmers to write code defensively, and handle spaces in paths without crashing, so they made the program install location itself have spaces in it (this then raises the question: why <code>ProgramData</code>?)
<a href="https://archive.ph/Eqvd4" rel="nofollow">Windows also has decent localisation</a> (at least amongst Indo-European languages employing the Latin script): set the system language to German, for instance, and <code>Program Files</code> is now <code>Programme</code>; it is <code>Programfiler</code> in Norwegian.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">2.2.5 <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> registry hive</h4>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, many user-specific configurations are stored in the <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</code> registry hive (abbreviated as <code>HKCU</code>), stored in <code>%USERPROFILE%\NTUSER.dat</code>.
This includes changes made in both Control Panel and Windows Settings, as well as settings for Microsoft programs like the Office suite.
This hive is synchronised across terminals on roaming user profiles (such as with Active Directory and domains).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">2.3 Linux and Windows equivalents</h3>
<p dir="auto">So far, I've discussed user profiles on Linux and Windows. There are some rough equivalents between the two, which ought to be useful for developers aiming to write <em>well-behaved</em> cross-platform applications:</p>

<h2 dir="auto">3 Conventions, and why they're broken</h2>
<h3 dir="auto">3.1 Respecting the user's choice and expectations</h3>
<p dir="auto">Okay; that was a pretty long introduction, but I haven't really gotten into <em>why</em> these user profile conventions have been established in the first place.
It seems like pointless bike-shedding—discussing where user data ought to be saved—but there are real issues which said conventions attempt to solve.</p>
<p dir="auto">These specifications don't exist merely to 'put things somewhere' for the hell of it. Disparate applications from a wide variety of developers and backgrounds which implement these specifications will have a only single place to write to (and read from), and a single point of backup, which reduces user workload.
As I mentioned in the introduction, software ought not to be surprising or unnecessarily opinionated.
Users see a specification, or some clearly-labelled pre-generated folder in their home directory, and <em>expect</em> software to write to adhere to these specifications, and write to a sensible location.</p>
<p dir="auto">GitHub user Lyle Hanson (<a href="https://github.com/lhanson">@lhanson</a>) puts it more clearly than I could, <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/2034#issuecomment-559254363" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/vim/vim/issues/2034/hovercard">in the issue for Vim</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The benefit of respecting the specification isn't just to put it "somewhere else", it's to put it <em>where I (the user) want it, without having to repeat myself every time I install anything.</em></p>
<p dir="auto">... I may eventually get around to trying to back up and/or version control my configuration files without hauling around everything else on my drive and I'll be delighted that most of them seem to be in <code>~/.config</code>.
When I have to add exceptions and regex matches for every program which stores its files in what seem to me like a jumble of random locations, the fact that a given program has done it that way for 30 years doesn't make my job any easier or less frustrating than for a program that was written last week without knowing any better.</p>
<p dir="auto">... From a UX point of view, I'd rather express my preferences at most once and be able to leverage reasonable assumptions later as my file management habits evolve than to have to express my preferences <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$n \times m$</math-renderer> times, where <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$n$</math-renderer> is the number of programs I use and <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$m$</math-renderer> is the number of unique configuration options each of them exposes to specify where all of their files go.</p>
<p dir="auto">... It's not about simply appeasing a subset of Vim users who for some reason have glommed onto some new-fangled specification, it's about <em>respecting users in general and making things easier for them by default.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I'd like to tack on to his point about 'respecting users': just because the user's home directory and its contents have full read-write-execute permissions for the user does not mean that software executed by said user should have free rein over the directory.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">3.2 So, what now?</h3>
<p dir="auto">The default assumption by a programmer might be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Let's put config and data files in the same directory as the program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This assumption immediately breaks on most modern desktop operating systems, because programs are typically installed to locations which require elevated write permissions (e.g. <code>/bin</code>, <code>%PROGRAMFILES%</code>) which means neither users nor their processes can write there willy-nilly.
Furthermore, most desktop OSs are multi-user, which means handling several different configurations and data for multiple users.
Even <em>Android</em>, a smartphone OS, <a href="https://www.android.com/versions/lollipop-5-0/#:~:text=Multiple%20users%20for%20phones." rel="nofollow">supports multiple user profiles since 5.0 Lollipop</a>, which means providing ways for developers to handle different user profiles.</p>
<p dir="auto">From my experiments, apps and their data are completely sandboxed per-user on Android, so apps installed by one user can be neither seen nor accessed by another user.
This is workable on desktop OSs, except that it still doesn't really solve the backup problem: do we just sync the entire app and its contents to a server?
Many programs on desktop OSs are several gigabytes large, and naïvely syncing this much data is a waste of bandwidth.
And it hearkens back to the point mentioned above: any backup utility or the user will have to handle a polynomially large number of application-user-configuration combinations.</p>

Developers cite only a few reasons for not wanting to adhere to conventions, and the following are lifted <em>verbatim</em> from their respective issue trackers (many closed as 'won't fix'):</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">There is no actual problem here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In a nutshell, these reasons are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>ignorance</strong>, i.e. the developer doesn't know the specification exists</li>
<li><strong>arrogance</strong>, i.e. 'my way is correct, I don't care what my users say because they're stupid', or even 'it works on my machine';</li>
<li><strong>fear of</strong> introducing <strong>change</strong> for change's sake, and breaking user workflows;</li>
<li><strong>fear of</strong> introducing <strong>complexity</strong> in handling these conventions, especially if the program is multi-platform.</li>
</ul>
<h4 dir="auto">3.2.1 Ignorance</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is more understandable than the rest, and is easily mitigated, especially if the developer is responsive and accepting of changes.
Nothing else to say here, honestly; if you don't know the platform conventions, you don't; hopefully you pick it up and rewrite your software to be a good citizen of the platform you're targetting.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">3.2.2 Arrogance</h4>
<p dir="auto">This is the least acceptable, and it reveals an ugly superiority complex.
If developers don't respect their users, then why even bother releasing software publicly, except to flex and collect bragging rights?
Many open-source authors angrily retort: 'develop it yourself if you want <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="199d30469088046bb8786592166a214d">$x$</math-renderer> feature'.
Yes, there are dire warnings about 'as-is', and 'no warranty' for 'merchantability' and 'fitness for a purpose', and I'm not claiming that open-source software authors are legally obliged to make quality-of-life changes.
The <em>social contract</em>, however, is that said developers and maintainers listen to and judges user feedback on their own merits, and implements frequently-asked-for features or fixes.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">3.2.3 Fear of change and complexity</h4>
<p dir="auto">I'm not going to quote Heraclitus or Benjamin Franklin here ('change is the only constant'), but software should be developed to fit users' needs, and platform conventions.
As software is developed, it <em>changes</em>, doesn't it?</p>
<p dir="auto">In all honesty, it seems like this fear is a function of <em>what</em> is being changed:
developers tend to view adding fancy new features with delight, but see more menial tasks like properly handling paths and correct cross-platform behaviour with disdain.
If your program is going to be cross-platform, you <em>will</em> have to handle the inherent complexity in supporting all those platforms, and again, <em>be a good citizen on those platforms</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Merely using cross-platform frameworks (like Electron or Qt) is not a panacea: if your program writes to a non-canonical location in the user's home directory, it ought to tell the user where it is writing to, and what it is writing.
Case in point: Visual Studio Code is a fairly big problem (see below).</p>

<p dir="auto">Of the above directories and files, I created exactly <em>two</em> manually: <code>OneDrive</code>, and <code>bin</code>.
The rest (excluding the XDG directories) were either auto-generated by <code>xdg-user-dirs</code> (which is okay), or created and written to by non-compliant software.</p>
<p dir="auto">The link above discussing the origin of dot-files makes it clear that the current behaviour was possibly <em>a mistake</em> made by the original developers of UNIX.
Even if it wasn't, the result today is a messy litter of dot-files dumped all over a user's home directory.
The XDG Base Directory (hereafter, XBD) specification is more than a decade old—an eternity in computing terms—and yet, there is a veritable parade of very well-known programs that refuse to follow its guidelines: see the quotes above in <a href="#33screw-your-conventions-weve-always-done-it-this-way">§3.3</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Arch Wiki has <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Base_Directory#Support" rel="nofollow">a list of programs</a> that are XBD-compliant by default, may be forced to comply after user intervention, and those with hard-coded non-XBD paths.
The latter two lists combined is almost <em>twice</em> as long as the compliant list, and includes some very prominent *nix-first software like Bash, Vim, OpenSSH, and Firefox.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's little more to say here: there exists a specification, many programs adhere to it, and many don't.
Fragmentation is only useful in grenades, and not in software specifications.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the record, people have found XBD compliance painful enough that someone developed a tool <em>dedicated</em> to finding non-compliant programs, and suggesting user-side workarounds: <a href="https://github.com/b3nj5m1n/xdg-ninja"><code>xdg-ninja</code></a> (written in Haskell, by the way, which is nice).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">4.2 Windows</h3>
<p dir="auto">Windows... Ah, Windows.
Bastion of backwards compatibility, keeping icons and settings options from Windows 3.1 NT around in Windows 11...
And the source of all your problems.</p>

<p dir="auto">Yep, <em>dot-files</em>... in <em>Windows</em>.
Windows does <em>not</em> automatically hide dot-files, whether it be in Explorer, <code>dir.exe</code>, or <code>Get-ChildItem</code>.
Notice the above listing is missing <code>AppData</code>—that's because it is properly hidden by the filesystem as mentioned in <a href="#2231hidden-folders-on-windows">§2.2.3.1</a>.
This is frequently violated by software written for *nix first—notice <code>.git</code>, <code>.ssh</code>... There's even the full set of XDG base directories, which is a *nix specification!</p>
<p dir="auto">Developers either assume Windows operates the same as *nix, or don't care about Windows much ('second-class citizen'), and again, couch any changes to fix this as 'introducing unnecessary complexity'.
Honestly, one would instead think the change is fairly straightforward: test which OS the program is running on using <code>#ifdef</code>s and OS-specific macros, and delegate to the appropriate function.
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/OperatingSystems/" rel="nofollow">Here's a wiki</a> listing some of these macros.
Better still, use the ecosystem's build system to configure builds for different platforms, and shift this test to configure and compile-time instead of run-time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some semi-compliant software hard-codes library paths, assuming user libraries will remain in the default locations, i.e. sub-directories of <code>%USERPROFILE%</code>.
This is <em>not</em> true, and users can change their locations as mentioned above.
Notice there's a <code>Contacts</code> directory in the listing above: this was created by <a href="https://kdeconnect.kde.org/" rel="nofollow">KDE Connect</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">That said, not <em>all</em> the above dot-directories are created by traditionally *nix programs, which is a good segue to the next section...</p>

<p dir="auto">Notice <code>.dotnet</code>, <code>.nuget</code>, <code>.omnisharp</code>, <code>.templateengine</code>, <code>.vscode</code>, and <code>source</code>.
Microsoft <em>itself</em> is a lousy citizen of Windows.
<code>source</code> is repeatedly created by Visual Studio (not Code), especially on a fresh install.
The rest of the projects are open-source, and have active/on-going issues related to home directory pollution:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>dotnet</code> CLI and <code>.templateengine</code>: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/8678" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/dotnet/sdk/issues/8678/hovercard">issue closed</a>, but requires setting <code>DOTNET_CLI_HOME</code> environment variable.

</ul>
<p dir="auto">It feels like developers who have never natively used Windows or its stack, work on and contribute to Microsoft software, without liaising with veteran Windows teams.
Maybe that's why Windows 11 looks so...<em>inspired</em>... by macOS (which is an aberration; the macOS windowing system sucks).</p>
<h4 dir="auto">4.2.2 Video games</h4>
<p dir="auto">Video games on Windows deserve a special heading of their own, because they are <em>particularly</em> egregious offenders.
In my opinion, game devs <em>really</em> have no excuse: almost all games primarily target Windows, or are ported by dedicated teams who know Windows inside out, and more importantly, develop using an entirely native toolchain.
Even Unreal and Unity have functionality to call out to native code, and developers <em>still</em> don't use it to properly handle save data.
The issue is such that the PCGamingWiki has dedicated 'save file location' and 'config file location' headings for every single game in its database.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most video games seem to like writing their save files, screenshots, and settings data into <code>Documents\</code> or <code>Documents\My Games</code>, which is a holdover from Windows XP.
Look, I get it, many game engines are old; they trace their lineage to engines first written in the 1990s and early 2000s.
But if developers can add ray-tracing updates to a 16-year-old game (<em>Portal: RTX</em>), surely they can spend a couple hours fixing this too.</p>

<p dir="auto"><em>Anno 1404</em>, what the hell are you doing? <em>Six</em> different (localised) directories, all containing the same paths.</p>
<p dir="auto">Honestly speaking, I doubt game developers are going to change to <code>Saved Games</code>, and this is partially Microsoft's fault, again.
The folder is neither listed in the default File Explorer <code>Libraries</code> view, nor in the <code>My PC</code> view; users have to manually navigate to it.
Its rarity is demonstrated by the ratio of games using either <code>Documents</code> or <code>Documents\My Games</code> compared to those using <code>Saved Games</code>: <strong>32:4</strong> on my computer (the four games using <code>Saved Games</code> are <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Metro: Exodus</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and **)
Some games forgo <code>Documents</code> altogether, and put the save files directly with the game files, or even in <code>%APPDATA%</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/a/108243/157009" rel="nofollow">This answer on the Game Development StackExchange</a> is relevant:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The best reason I can think of is <strong>to reduce cost of customer support</strong>. The problem is that <code>%APPDATA%</code> and <code>%LOCALAPPDATA%</code> are hidden directories, and nobody seems to know about <code>%UserProfile%\Saved Games</code>. Placing the files in <code>Documents</code>, studios can save money on support calls that ask how to backup savegames, or how to migrate the savegames from one machine to another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Notice even here that Microsoft is polluting <code>Documents</code> with <code>Custom Office Templates</code>, <code>FeedbackHub</code>, <code>My Data Sources</code>, <code>Outlook Files</code>, <code>Visual Studio 20XX</code>, <code>PowerShell</code>, <code>PowerToys</code>, and <code>WindowsPowershell</code> (yes; there are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-sg/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7.3" rel="nofollow"><em>two</em> PowerShells</a>).
The folder contains everything <em>but</em> documents now, and it is so cluttered that I have the <code>_Documents</code> subfolder for <em>my</em> stuff—files I explicitly created via a save dialog box or the command-line.
The leading underscore is a necessary evil, as it means the directory is listed first when sorted by name in File Explorer.</p>
<p dir="auto">In a nutshell... A hopeless situation.
There's no saving Windows user profiles when Microsoft itself doesn't adhere to its own conventions.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">5 Solutions</h2>
<p dir="auto">So if things are so 'hopeless' as I put it, then why bother with this article?
I think <em>any</em> change towards compliance is better than no change, that's all.</p>
<p dir="auto">On *nix, the answer is straightforward: get everyone to adhere to the XDG Base Directory specification.
Of course, 'get everyone to' is doing a lot of work in that sentence: it involves submitting an issue, convincing maintainers that this is a worthwhile, and possibly writing code to satisfy the specification, correctly (including the fall-back directories), and all the review drudgery before things are finally merged.</p>
<p dir="auto">On Windows, the problems arise from within, and I sincerely don't see a solution.
Thankfully, many non-compliant projects are fully open-source, and contributing to them, or up-voting issues, will hopefully help.
Game developers are famously opaque (especially given how lucrative the industry is as a whole), and as mentioned above, they do have genuine reasons for saving stuff in <code>Documents</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">That being said, there is still value in attempting to fix this on Windows.
The specification is clear, some developers clearly know about it, and it is a good starting point for new projects (Microsoft is apparently promoting Rust now over C++ for green-field Windows development, so maybe there's hope yet).</p>
<h3 dir="auto">5.1 Home, sweet home</h3>
<p dir="auto">We have so many real-life analogues in our computers: from files, folders, and rubbish bins, to the 'desktop' metaphor.
Surely we can extend the concepts of 'clutter' and 'cleanup', too?
Let's be good citizens of the platforms we develop for, and give our users choices and control over their data, and where it is stored.
I'd like a nice vacuum cleaner for my home directory, please.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/the-amazon-prime-day-2023-aws-bill/">https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/the-amazon-prime-day-2023-aws-bill/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37153426">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Jeff Barr recently posted his annual <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/prime-day-2023-powered-by-aws-all-the-numbers/">Prime Day by the numbers</a> blog post, and I was immediately inundated by questions around “How much did this cost?”</p>
<p>There are a few answers possible, none of which are quite correct.</p>
<p>There’s an argument that in absolute terms the answer is “zero,” because it’s simply money transferring from one part of Amazon’s balance sheet to another — but that’s unsatisfying.</p>
<p>There’s the internal chargeback costs that AWS charges Amazon for services that would be subject to (at a minimum) significant discounting just due to volume, but also quite possibly modified at some foundational level. I don’t actually know how it works in practice (Amazon is not an AWS bill optimization customer of mine — YET!), and if I did, I wouldn’t be able to talk about it publicly.</p>
<p>So let’s use the only estimates that make sense here: what the on-demand cost of this would be, at retail pricing posted on the AWS website, assuming it’s all in us-east-1.</p>
<p>We’re going to include the numbers only for the 48 hours that Prime Day ran and not include any support charges (which you would be frankly nuts to not pay for at this scale). Further, nobody at this scale would ever actually <em>pay</em> retail prices, but it’s enough for a fun thought experiment. Let’s begin.</p>
<h2 id="h-the-cost-analysis-of-prime-day-2023">The cost analysis of Prime Day 2023</h2>
<p>The by-the-numbers post gives us a list of some crucial usage numbers for our calculations, broken down by each AWS service.</p>
<h3 id="h-ebs">EBS</h3>
<p>Jeff tells us that Amazon added an incremental 163 petabytes of EBS storage capacity. Given that EBS comes in many different flavors, there’s a range here. If it’s gp3 (which is what most folks should start with), it’d be roughly $878,000, if it’s slow magnetic sc1 then it would cost $164,000, and if it’s io2 volumes, it soars to $3.4 million. In reality, it’s almost certainly a mix. Further, despite Jeff telling us that it served 15.35 trillion requests and 764 petabytes of data transfer per day, there’s no way to say what this cost (if anything) in terms of additional provisioned IOPS or throughput. I’ll mark it at zero, and assume it’s all gp3 volumes for simplicity.</p>
<p>EBS thus costs <strong>$878,003.00</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="h-cloudtrail">CloudTrail</h3>
<p>AWS CloudTrail processed over 830 billion events in support of this year’s Prime Day. This is kind of tricky to calculate along a few axes. If they were all management events, they were free for the first trail. Every additional management trail (usually configured by accident!) would add another $16.6 million for this charge. And if these were all data events, the cost would be $830K.</p>
<p>In all probability, these charges were a mix of both types of event. Let’s split the difference, be extremely charitable and assume there’s only one management trail, and call it 415 billion free management events and $415,000 for 415 billion chargeable data events.</p>
<p>CloudTrail thus costs <strong>$415,000</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="h-dynamodb">DynamoDB</h3>
<p>DynamoDB processed “trillions of requests” and peaked at 126 million requests per second. This is so vague as to be fodder for absolute despair, but we can reason about this a bit.</p>
<p>We’ll disregard storage costs and only care about the transaction volume. Let’s also assume 50% read/write split, eventual consistency, and that we’ll have to provision for that peak throughout the whole 48 hours, since autoscaling DynamoDB is … laggy. This brings us to about $2.5 million. If you have a problem with this, or think I’m being unfair, remember that I could have instead said that this was all on-demand capacity instead, in which case the cost for this line item would instead be $249 million over two days.</p>
<p>DynamoDB costs <strong>$2,505,360</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="h-aurora">Aurora</h3>
<p>This is incredibly hard to calculate; the numbers given include 5,835 database instances running the PostgreSQL-compatible and MySQL-compatible editions of Amazon Aurora that processed 318 billion transactions, stored 2,140 terabytes of data, and transferred 836 terabytes of data.</p>
<p>Hoo boy.</p>
<p>Let’s assume 2,000 MySQL instances, and 3,835 PostgreSQL instances, purely because “POST-gruh-SQUEAL” is incredibly fun to say. We’ll assume that these are the I/O Optimized option, because calculating out how Aurora accounts for IO charges is incredibly frustrating, and that they aren’t using either of the Aurora Serverless offerings for obvious expensive reasons..</p>
<p>Instance sizing is tricky, and it’s also everything to this calculation. RDS instances can each cost as much as $19,000 a month, or as little as $90. Let’s pick something middle of the road: the db.r6i.12xlarge, which comes in at $7,000 for a full month.</p>
<p>Smack these two groups together, and the MySQL instances cost $2,412,864, while the PostgreSQL instances cost $3,681,231 for these 48 hours.</p>
<p>The Aurora cost comes to <strong>$6,094,095</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="h-ses">SES</h3>
<p>Now, the only data available in this post states that “SES sent 56% more emails than last year.” However, Amazon separately stated that <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-prime-day-2023-stats">customers purchased 375 million items</a>. While I could snidely suggest that each sale generated 40 emails, a quick check of my own purchase history indicates that every order spits out 3 emails: a confirmation, a shipment notification, and a delivery notification. While many orders were obviously multiple items, we’ll balance this out by ignoring all of the promotional email around Prime Day deals. That means that we’ll say SES sent customers 1.125 billion emails for Prime Day, and assume each one is 20KB. They talk about deliverability rates, which means they’re using SES’s rather snazzy Deliverability Manager, and that brings the cost of these billion-plus emails to a bit under $200K.</p>
<p>SES cost comes to <strong>$193,824.84</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h-cloudfront">CloudFront</h2>
<p>Amazon CloudFront handled “a total of over 1 trillion HTTP requests during Prime Day.” This is not strictly accurate. I pay attention to these things, and I can assure you that every connection as a part of the shopping process is in fact HTTPS. In fact, [Amazon.com)[https://amazon.com] is on the HSTS preload list, which means that browsers will actively refuse to connect to that domain over HTTP. Why is this important? Because the public pricing for CloudFront shows that HTTPS requests cost more! Curiously, the AWS Pricing Calculator does not draw a distinction here at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>Also, CloudFront pricing varies depending upon where the user is requesting the data from, which makes accurate numbers impossible here. Let’s be incredibly generous to Amazon and pretend that all of this traffic came from the U.S. and Mexico, as those are the cheapest rates.</p>
<p>Jeff declines to state how much data was transferred, so we have to guess wildly here. Let’s assume 100 kilobytes per request, which comes out to 90 petabytes.</p>
<p>Requests plus data egress means that CloudFront costs a bit under $3 million for these 48 hours.</p>
<p>CloudFront costs us <strong>$2,928,161</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h-sqs">SQS</h2>
<p>SQS processed a peak of 86 million messages a second, end of data. Hmm. That’s … a bit open-ended, isn’t it? Each second at that rate costs $34, and thus if this were sustained it would cost over $5.8 million for the whole 48 hours.</p>
<p>What makes this extra fun is that the AWS Pricing Calculator refuses to accept that this scale is possible; their form yells at you two orders of magnitude before you get to this number. This suggests that there’s a lack of scale imagination happening somewhere. As a result, I’m left to use the first tool in the Cloud Economist’s toolbox: arithmetic. Let’s round this to $2 million — I find that more than fair.</p>
<p>SQS costs <strong>$2 million</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h-pinpoint">Pinpoint</h2>
<p>Pinpoint sent “tens of millions of SMS messages.” OK, let’s assume 50 million, all to U.S. numbers. The cost for that is $0.00581 a message, so blowing up your phone is straight arithmetic. Note that the AWS Pricing Calculator directs you to an “SMS pricing tool” that is simply a table. This is a poor experience.</p>
<p>Pinpoint SMS costs <strong>$290,500</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="h-ec2">EC2</h3>
<p>Finally, we come to EC2. The assertion that Amazon “used tens of millions of normalized AWS Graviton-based Amazon EC2 instances” is not only vague, it’s a problem. The idea of “normalized instance hours” may make sense internally at Amazon, but I can borderline promise that it doesn’t make as much sense as you might hope for reasoning about <em>your</em> cloud costs. I will no doubt rant about this at a future date.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s assume 50 million “normalized instances,” which we’ll call c7g.medium since it’s directionally accurate. We’ll have to use arithmetic here, since the AWS Pricing Calculator refuses to believe that more than 50,000 EC2 instances are possible within a single region. Oh, honey — I have some of our mutual customers to introduce you to.</p>
<p>For these 48 hours, we do simple math.</p>
<p>EC2 costs <strong>$87,120,000</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="h-the-cost-of-prime-day-2023">The cost of Prime Day 2023</h2>
<p>Adding all of these (again, inaccurate) numbers together demonstrates that at retail pricing, running the infrastructure for Amazon Prime Day for 48 hours would cost you <strong>$102,424,943.84</strong>.</p>
<p>While this is obviously way higher than reality, assume for a minute that it isn’t. $102 million in infrastructure spend for an event that brought in over $12.7 billion in sales isn’t the worst return on investment that companies could make — by a landslide!</p>

After trying endlessly for two years to run a file sharing site with user anonymity we have been tired of handling the extreme volumes of people abusing it and the headaches it has created for us. <br>
Maybe it is hard to understand but after tens of million uploads and many petabytes later all work of handling abuse was automated through all available channels to be fast as possible. <br>
We have auto banned contents of hundreds of thousands files. <br>
Banned file names and also banned specific usage patterns connected to abusive material to the point where we did not care if we accidental delete thousands of false positive in this process. <br>
Even after all this the high volume of abuse will not stop. <br>
This is not the kind of work we imagine when acquiring it and recently our proxy provider shut us down.  </p><p>

This can not continue. </p><p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


The <code>ts_zip</code> utility provided with
the <a href="https://bellard.org/ts_server/index.html">ts_server</a> software can
compress (and hopefully decompress) text files with Large Language
Models. The compression ratio is much higher than with other
compression tools. There are some caveats of course:
<ul>
  <li>Unlike <a href="https://bellard.org/nncp">NNCP</a>, the language
    model must be available when decompressing.</li>
  <li>A GPU is mandatory to get a reasonable speed. Depending on the
  model size, the speed varies between a few kB/s to one
  hundred kB/s.</li>
  <li>The same exact GPU model and program versions must be used for
    compression and decompression.</li>
  <li>The model is frozen so it works only for text files in a
    language that the model has already seen.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Compression Ratio</h4>
<p>
The compression ratio is given in bits per byte for each
model. <a href="http://www.byronknoll.com/cmix.html">CMIX v19</a> is
one of the best lossless data compression program.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>
  The smaller <a href="https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM">RWKV</a>
  models seem a good compromise for text compression because they use
  a small amount of memory due to their RNN structure and have a
  (relatively) high running speed.

    <div>
        <p>I'm sorry if the following post comes off as a bit angry. I'm writing this off the cuff and am very aggravated by the situation.</p><p>Today I received an email from Google Play Support stating that Luck be a Landlord has been geo-blocked in the following countries: United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Iran, Jordan, South Korea, Libya, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen.</p><p>According to Google, the app "contains content that doesn't comply with the Gambling policy."</p><p>It should go without saying that I 100% disagree with this decision. Luck be a Landlord does not violate any gambling policy that Google has in their terms of service.</p><p>The e-mail states that "Apps that simulate gambling, or games of chance or skill that are conducive to gambling are prohibited in the above locales."</p><p>By that logic, you could argue any game with an element of chance or luck violates Google's Gambling policy.</p><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.jetpackjoyride&amp;ref=blog.trampolinetales.com">Jetpack Joyride</a>, a game with a literal slot-machine mechanic, is rated E10+ and isn't geo-blocked. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.terrycavanaghgames.diceydungeons&amp;ref=blog.trampolinetales.com">Dicey Dungeons</a>, a game with themes of luck and rolling dice, isn't geo-blocked. A <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sneakypanda.spincraftclassic&amp;ref=blog.trampolinetales.com">literal clone of my game</a>, which raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/sneaky-panda-raises-6m-to-launch-new-kind-of-mobile-game/?ref=blog.trampolinetales.com">$6,000,000 in venture capital</a>, is somehow rated "E for Everyone" and isn't geo-blocked, despite <strong>literally having a battle pass and random-chance micro-transactions</strong>. Don't even get me started on how loot boxes are allowed (and encouraged) on these platforms!</p><p>It should go without saying that I don't think these other apps should be geo-blocked. I'm saying it's very easy to see that my game is getting unfair treatment.</p><p>I have brought this up to Google and they were dismissive of my reasoning, refusing to do anything.</p><p>I am exploring options of how to get this fixed but I am extremely upset that Google has made this ridiculous decision and that players in the aforementioned countries will be unable to download the game on the Google Play Store.</p><p>My apologies for those inconvenienced by this who were interested in playing Luck be a Landlord. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1404850/Luck_be_a_Landlord/?ref=blog.trampolinetales.com">Steam version</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/luck-be-a-landlord/id6450724928?ref=blog.trampolinetales.com">iOS version</a> of the game remain up without any issue at the time of me writing this.</p><p>-Dan</p>
