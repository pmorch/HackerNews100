<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
        <p>A year ago, at ElixirConf EU 2022, we announced an effort to research
and develop a type system for Elixir (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jf5Hsa1KOc8">video presentation</a>)
(<a href="https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2022/10/05/my-future-with-elixir-set-theoretic-types/">written report</a>).</p>

<p>This work is happening under the lead of <a href="https://www.irif.fr/~gc/">Giuseppe Castagna</a>,
CNRS Senior Researcher, and taken by
<a href="https://www.irif.fr/users/gduboc/index">Guillaume Duboc</a> as part of his
PhD studies, with further guidance from myself (José Valim).</p>

<p>This article is a summary of where we are in our efforts and where we
are going.</p>

<h2 id="out-of-research">Out of research</h2>

<p>Our main goal during research is to find a type system that can model
most of Elixir’s functional semantics and develop brand new theory on
the areas we found to be incompatible or lacking. We believe we were
able to achieve this goal with a gradual set-theoretic type system
and we are now ready to head towards development. Over the last 2 months,
we have published plenty of resources on our results:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06391">A technical report on the design principles of the Elixir type system</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=gJJH7a2J9O8">A technical presentation by Guillaume Duboc at ElixirConf 2023 on the work above</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://smartlogic.io/podcast/elixir-wizards/s10-e12-jose-guillaume-giuseppe-types-elixir/">An informal discussion with Giuseppe Castagna, Guillaume Duboc, and José Valim on the SmartLogic podcast</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1841707383">An informal Q&amp;A with Guillaume Duboc, José Valim, and the community on Twitch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Our focus so far has been on the semantics. While we have introduced a
new syntax capable of expressing the semantics of the new set-theoretic
type system, the syntax is not final as there are still no concrete
plans for user-facing changes to the language. Once we are confident
those changes will happen, we will have plenty of discussion with the
community about the type system interface and its syntax.</p>

<p>The work so far has been made possible thanks to a partnership between
the <a href="https://www.cnrs.fr/fr">CNRS</a> and <a href="https://remote.com/">Remote</a>,
with sponsorships from <a href="https://www.fresha.com/">Fresha</a>,
<a href="https://supabase.com/">Supabase</a>, and <a href="https://dashbit.co/">Dashbit</a>.</p>



<p>While there is still on-going research, our focus for the second semester
of 2023 onwards is on development.</p>

<p>Incorporating a type system into a language used at scale can be a daunting
task. Our concerns range from how the community will interact and use the
type system to how it will perform on large codebases. Therefore, our plan
is to gradually introduce our gradual (pun intended) type system into the
Elixir compiler.</p>

<p>In the first release, types will be used just internally by the compiler.
The type system will extract type information from patterns and guards to
find the most obvious mistakes, such as typos in field names or type
mismatches from attempting to add an integer to a string, without introducing
any user-facing changes to the language. At this stage, our main goal is
to assess the performance impact of the type system and the quality of
the reports we can generate in case of typing violations. If we are
unhappy with the results, we still have time to reassess our work or drop
the initiative altogether.</p>

<p>The second milestone is to introduce type annotations only in structs,
which are named and statically-defined in Elixir codebases. Elixir programs
frequently pattern match on structs, which reveals information about
the struct fields, but it knows nothing about their respective types.
By propagating types from structs and their fields throughout the program,
we will increase the type system’s ability to find errors while further
straining our type system implementation.</p>

<p>The third milestone is to introduce the (most likely) <code>$</code>-prefixed type
annotations for functions, with no or very limited type reconstruction:
users can annotate their code with types, but any untyped parameter
will be assumed to be of the <code>dynamic()</code> type. If successful, then we
will effectively have introduced a type system into the language.</p>

            <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 18:47:55 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website/">https://www.kodingkitty.com/blog/how-to-build-a-website/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36591032">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
An innocent question <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/21-websites-for-free-illustrations-29a45232db" target="_blank">was posted</a> on IndieHackers the other day:
<span>"I'm asking what did you use to build your website"</span>.
    </p><p>
The question also had a second part.
So just to be fair, here it is in its entirety: <span>"I'm asking what did you use to build your website, I really love the design and feeling of kodingkitty."</span></p><p>
But this post is not about people loving our website.
Although we're obviously happy about that.
    </p><p>
Too lazy to read? <a href="#kittys-tool-chain">Check out Koding Kitty's simple toolchain</a>.
      </p><h2>The shocking truth</h2><p>
The question sparked an idea to write about the tech stack that KodingKitty team uses for its own web.
And we warn you beforehand: it's so simple that some of you might find it shocking.
    </p><p>
You have been warned.
    </p><h2>Hype is just a coincidence</h2><p>
Our tech stack has nothing to do with the current hype about lightweight or simplified web development.
Not everyone rides that wave, and that's fine.
    </p><p>
On the other hand, we believe that in many cases, "back to the roots" or "simplicity is the ultimate perfection" is a better solution for customers than convoluted web of overused frameworks and libraries.
    </p><p>
To put it another way, the solution we designed for our website and the current hype is just a coincidence.
Our stack is simple because we wanted something pragmatic with minimal friction for the developers.
    </p><p>
And even though we wanted Koding Kitty website to have a distinctive yet subtle design, it is important to mention that it could have been achieved in many other ways.
    </p><h2>Comparing options</h2><p>
Our website and the way it is built comes from our past experience.
    </p><p>
We had the chance to work with different web frameworks in the past.
We know this is a luxury not everyone has.
It has allowed us to compare different technologies and decide what works best for us.
    </p><p>
From the beginning we agreed to start with a static website.
After all, what does a kitty's web really need?
A front page, a showcase, a blog ... and probably not much more.
At least in the beginning.
    </p><h2>Our requirements</h2><p>
We set the following set of requirements:
    </p><ul><li>Fast website</li><li>Fast to develop</li><li>Inexpensive hosting</li><li>Minimal complexity</li></ul><p>
What are the options today to have a website with the above requirements?
    </p><h2>Wordpress (and similar CMS)</h2><p>
Nothing against WordPress, it's done a tremendous job for the internet but&nbsp;...<br>
...&nbsp;honestly, it's a bit overkill for our modest needs.
    </p><p>
We don't need to store our content in a database.
We don't need to deal with plugins.
We don't need a visual editor to write our content.
    </p><h2>No-Code</h2><p>
Yes, that's one area where there's a lot of the hype these days.
    </p><p>
But to be a web coder and use a no-code tool?
Seriously?
It sounds weird.
    </p><p>
We want to own our content.
We want to do whatever we want with our web.
We can code a website faster than we can build it in the no-code WYSIWYG editor.
    </p><p>
The last point is that such tool still requires initial (and then ongoing) learning.
    </p><h2>Frameworks</h2><p>
We have an experience with frameworks.
    </p><p>
But, did we want to do the whole setup?
Although it can be done quickly, we would end up with too many parts.
Like a database, configuration, libraries, admin, and so on.
Yes, it is a fully customizable solution, but we would end up with something that resembles WordPress.
    </p><p>
And that's not what we wanted.
    </p><h2>Jamstack (aka Site generators)</h2><p>
Static site generators look like a tempting option for our needs, don't they?
    </p><p>
Just pick a programming language, do some coding, press a button (or run a script) and voila&nbsp;...<br>
...&nbsp;your fast static site is generated.
    </p><p>
Unfortunately, Jamstack tools require an initial setup and an initial (and continuous) learning.
    </p><p>
We understand, that writing a blog in markdown is convenient, but taking all things into consideration we decided for simpler solution.
    </p><h2>KittyStack</h2><p>
Our solution is obvious, when you review our requirements (repeated below for your convenience):
    </p><ul><li>Fast website</li><li>Fast to develop</li><li>Inexpensive hosting</li><li>Minimal complexity</li></ul><p>
Let's discuss them one by one:
    </p><h2>Fast website</h2><p>
Is a static website fast?<br>
Yes, it is!
    </p><h2>Fast development</h2><p>
Now, you may be thinking: "If you're not writing your content in markdown, you're not using a fancy editor, then what are you using?"
    </p><p>
We write our content in HTML!
    </p><p>
Take a look at our website.
For the kind of posts we publish there, HTML is ideal.
We mix the text with HTML/CSS/JS widgets, so it makes sense to have a post written directly in HTML.
    </p><h2>Inexpensive hosting</h2><p>
Is hosting a static site inexpensive?
    </p><p>
It depends on the provider and all the bells and whistles you decide you need.
    </p><p>
We decided to go with the absolute minimum, because hosting static sites doesn't require a massive hardware setup.
    </p><p>
Mind you, Hetzner <a href="https://www.hetzner.com/webhosting" target="_blank">webhosting</a> starts at 2 EUR!
How crazy is that?
    </p><p>
And if you are worried that your site will not survive a massive spike in traffic - like when your post hits the front page of Hacker News - it probably will.
At least our site did.
    </p><h2>Minimal complexity</h2><p>
We insisted on minimal complexity, but some of our pages and posts have repeating patterns.
    </p><p>
While it is possible to use a copy+paste routine, it can quickly get out of control.
Using some form of loops would help a lot.
Also, the ability to include some blocks of code - like header, footer, and the alike - would be beneficial.
    </p><h2>Templating to the rescue</h2><p>
And so we come to the last piece of the puzzle.
    </p><p>
Meet <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/" target="_blank">Jinja</a> templates, which make our life much easier.
Jinja allows us to use loops, include files (navigation bar, footer, etc.) and much more.
    </p><p>
Plus, we didn't have to learn a new system as we were already using frameworks based on Jinja before.
    </p><h2 id="kittys-tool-chain">A simple toolchain</h2><p>
Now you might be wondering how we generate the final, static page.
    </p><p>
We use a short Python script with exactly 45 lines of code.

(NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="92bd">On the 2nd of July 2021, a Boeing 737–200 hauling cargo between the Hawaiian Islands lost power in one engine shortly after takeoff from Honolulu. As the pilots attempted to turn back toward the airport, they reported the unthinkable: their second engine was going too, and they weren’t going to make it. While the Coast Guard scrambled to respond, the crew carried out an extraordinary ditching at sea in the dark of night, successfully bringing their 737 down on the heaving waters of Mamala Bay, 3.3 kilometers off the coast of Oahu. Although the plane broke into two pieces on impact, both pilots managed to escape, and in a harrowing rescue they were plucked from the water just as the remains of the airplane slipped beneath the waves.</p><p id="193e">Two years later, the publication of the National Transportation Safety Board’s final report has confirmed what many long suspected: that the crash of Transair flight 810 was not a story of exemplary airmanship, but quite the opposite, as a relatively minor engine failure snowballed into a dangerous ditching that need never have been attempted. The unfortunate truth was that the pilots never properly addressed the emergency, and in their confusion, reduced power on their functioning engine — a tale as old as the very concept of multi-engine airplanes. The cockpit voice recording and interviews with the pilots revealed the factors which may or may not have contributed, from their muddled attempts to declare an emergency, to an incomplete control handover, to simple stress, as the captain delivered a heated and sometimes sexist 32-minute pre-flight monologue about a fellow pilot. In any case, the findings raised questions about the safety culture at Transair, a scrappy (and now defunct) cargo airline operating 50-year-old airplanes — and highlighted how a breakdown in communication and critical thinking can turn a minor failure into a potentially deadly crash.</p><p id="1194">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>Transair 737s on the ramp in Honolulu. (Transair)</figcaption></figure><p id="c619">In the archipelago of Hawaii, modern life depends on the fast and efficient transfer of goods between the state’s seven inhabited islands, especially by air. Numerous small companies have historically competed for this market, including — until recently — Rhoades Aviation, better known under its public-facing name Transair, which branded itself as “Hawaii’s leader in interisland air cargo.” Founded in 1982 by Iranian-born businessman Teimour Riahi, the airline slowly grew from a few small turboprops to a fleet of several first-generation Boeing 737–200 jets, surviving for decades despite its small size and even a failed attempt to expand into passenger services in 2005.</p><p id="2cbd">For Transair pilots, the pay was mediocre and the hours were unpredictable, but by the 2020s, Transair was one of at most two or three remaining operators of the ancient Boeing 737–200 left in the United States, and anyone who wanted to fly the classic jets would have had few other options. Others were simply attracted by the promise of working in Hawaii, including one of the main characters of this story, 58-year-old Captain Henry Okai. Born in the West African nation of Ghana, he came to the United States decades ago to pursue his dream of flying, which was met with success as he passed pilot training and got a job with regional carrier Allegheny Airlines. Over the years he flew for a variety of companies, both in the United States and abroad, until he finally landed with Transair, having been drawn to the airline in a spur-of-the-moment decision.</p><figure><figcaption>N810TA, the aircraft involved in the accident. (Li Cheng Tsai)</figcaption></figure><p id="9353">Just after midnight on the 2nd of July, 2021, Captain Okai reported for duty at Honolulu International Airport to fly Transair flight 810, a regular service from Hawaii’s capital and largest city, to Kahului, the largest town on the island of Maui. Joining him was 50-year-old First Officer Gregory Ryan, founder of the local Honolulu law firm Greg Ryan and Associates. Ryan first flew for commuter carrier Mesa Airlines from 1991 to 1995, before switching careers to become a divorce lawyer. In 2019, however, he decided to get back into flying, and for the last two years he had been splitting his time between Transair and his legal practice.</p><p id="72f6">That night they would be flying a Boeing 737–200 built in 1975 and registered as N810TA (at Transair, the flight number was based on the registration number — any route that N810TA happened to be flying was “flight 810”). When they arrived at the ramp, cargo handlers were loading the plane with several tons of frozen seafood, pharmaceuticals, and other perishable items typically shipped by air in Hawaii. After performing the pre-flight checks, the pilots sat down in the cockpit to wait for the cargo loading to finish, at which point Captain Okai began to vent about an incident that had allegedly occurred on July 1st, less than 24 hours previously. First Officer Ryan appears to have been already aware of what happened, suggesting that the conversation may actually have begun earlier, but what is known is that the issue would come to dominate the cockpit conversation almost until the moment of takeoff.</p><p id="45da">Most of the information about what happened comes from Captain Okai’s own statements captured by the cockpit voice recorder, but what is known is that on the morning of the 1st, Okai had been rostered to fly with the airline’s sole female First Officer, identified as Gina Moore. After a fraught disagreement over procedures, the two apparently found themselves in a shouting match in the cockpit, at which point Moore announced that she would not fly with Captain Okai, and walked away from the flight in the middle of the after start checklist. A new first officer had to be found, and the flight was delayed. (According to Moore’s own testimony, which is very sparse in detail, she did not ask to be replaced — rather, the Chief Pilot replaced her as soon as she told him she was uncomfortable with Captain Okai. Okai may have been unaware of this.)</p><figure><figcaption>Another photo of N810TA at Honolulu International Airport. (Chris Hoare)</figcaption></figure><p id="3c87">From the transcript, Captain Okai clearly had not mentally moved on from the incident. The conflict seemed to have arisen because Okai and Moore had different interpretations of the procedures in the manual, and neither was willing to compromise with the other, a hallmark of poor crew resource management. As First Officer Ryan listened, interjecting only occasionally to affirm his captain, Okai described his interpretation of the procedures, then discussed how Moore walked out in the middle of the checklist, which apparently prompted him to say a number of hostile words, including “what’s wrong with you,” “this is a joke,” and “you’re going to finish the checklist.” A shouting match ensued, which Ryan recognized as a safety issue, although neither pilot pointed out Okai’s own role in the altercation. In fact, he said, “<em>This is the way we work when I am with her, you know, you have to yell at her to force her to do things.”</em></p><p id="ca03">This incident had apparently been escalated all the way to the airline’s owner, but Okai accused the Chief Pilot of favoring Moore at his expense. He then professed a belief that First Officers needed to acquiesce to their captains regardless of what they thought “the book” said. Again, not a hallmark of an effective team player.</p><p id="68c6">At around quarter past 1:00, the cargo loading concluded, and the pilots paused the conversation to conduct the departure briefing, complete the before start checklist, and start the engines — although Okai interrupted the checklist to mention that he was going to use his cell phone to send pictures of the wording in the manual to the Chief Pilot in order to prove Moore wrong.</p><p id="b372">Several minutes later, the flight was ready to taxi, and the pilots proceeded toward the runway — only for Okai’s mind to come back to Moore again. Spotting a pothole in the runway, Okai began to describe how he accidently ran through that same pothole during a landing rollout because he was distracted arguing with Moore. “This girl is driving me crazy, you know!” he said.</p><p id="9272">Moments later, he brought the rant to a new level, graduating from personal animosity to outright misogyny. “These are the kind of women you don’t wanna get married to,” he said. “You know, some men, they lose their temper and the next thing you know, the wife is dead, you know… they start punching them and kicking them, and they lost their minds, you know… they kill the woman… it’s the woman who can drive you to do crazy stuff, you know?”</p><blockquote><p id="3de9">(Public service announcement: if a husband murders his wife because he thinks she’s annoying, that’s the husband’s fault. I shouldn’t need to say this.)</p></blockquote><p id="2704">◊◊◊</p><p id="89f1">Minutes later, at 1:33 a.m., flight 810 arrived at the head of the runway with takeoff clearance in hand, and Captain Okai handed over control to First Officer Ryan. Working together, they pushed the thrust levers to takeoff power, and the engine instruments responded normally. Okai observed that the exhaust gas temperatures, or EGTs, were hovering very close to the yellow “caution” zone on the gauge, but he had seen this indication many times before on multiple Transair planes, and he wasn’t concerned.</p><p id="e467">As the 737 accelerated down the runway, Okai made the standard callout, “Eighty knots,” followed by “V1,” or decision speed, and then “rotate.” Ryan pulled the nose back, and the plane lifted off, prompting Okai to call out, “positive rate.”</p><p id="e1b7">“Gear up,” Ryan ordered, and Okai complied.</p><p id="59a9">Then, just as the gear finished retracting, a loud “thud” was heard, accompanied by vibrations and a long “whooshing” sound, like an engine rolling back.</p><p id="b2fa">“Oh shit,” Ryan exclaimed.</p><p id="40e9">“Lost an engine, you got it?” Okai asked.</p><p id="1ad6">“Okay, I got it, yep,” Ryan said, instinctively stepping on the rudder to counteract the developing asymmetric thrust.</p><p id="2ee7">“Yep, you lost number…” Okai started to say, trying to determine which engine had failed.</p><p id="d720">“Number two, yep,” said Ryan, referring to the right engine.</p><p id="21e9">“Number two,” Okai agreed.</p><figure><figcaption>The damage to the turbine blades that precipitated the emergency. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="a09a">The pilots’ assessment was correct. Inside the high pressure turbine within the right (№2) engine, corrosion had been eating away at two of the turbine blades from the inside, expanding outward around each blade’s internal lightening holes — voids in the material designed to reduce the weight of the blades. The corrosion steadily weakened the blades, until one or both failed under the stresses of normal operation. The broken blade tips were then sucked back through the low pressure turbine, causing further damage that reduced the engine’s ability to produce power. In fact, within seconds of the failure, the Engine Pressure Ratio, or EPR, for the right engine — a proxy for its power output — decreased from 1.97, which is approximately takeoff power, to 1.43, which is closer to cruise.</p><p id="ceef">When an engine failure occurs on takeoff in a twin-engine jet like the 737, the procedure is to declare an emergency, climb to a safe altitude, level off, identify which engine has failed, complete the “engine failure or shutdown” checklist, and then return to the airport. Therefore, to start things off, Captain Okai jumped on the radio and said, “Rhoades eight ten, we have an emergency, stand by.”</p><p id="04f4">“Rhoades Express eight ten, radar contact, fly heading of one one zero to join victor two, resume own navigation,” the controller said, having apparently missed the content of the transmission.</p><p id="e4aa">“Eight twenty [sic] has emergency, on a two twenty heading, stand by,” Okai repeated. Turning to his first officer, he added, “Okay, you can inch up to two thousand.” 2,000 feet would be an excellent safe altitude at which to level off while they completed the engine failure procedure.</p><p id="fb7d">About 12 seconds later, Okai said, “Okay, coming up on two thousand, we’ll level at two thousand… you have two twenty heading, right?”</p><p id="0edd">In addition to flying with less power on the right side, First Officer Ryan was also navigating through a procedure turn to the right following takeoff, but he seemed to be handling it just fine, so he simply said, “Yes.”</p><p id="b11b">Moments later, the flight reached 2,000 feet, and Ryan began leveling the plane. At the same time, the controller called them again to repeat her earlier clearance. “Rhoades Express eight ten, radar contact, turn left heading zero niner zero, join victor two, resume own navigation, climb and maintain one three thousand, say altitude,” she said.</p><p id="6fa4">Wondering whether the controller wasn’t able to hear them, Okai said, “Okay, Rhoaaades eight ten, radio check, how do you read?”</p><p id="9f9b">“Rhoades Express eight ten, loud and clear, how do you hear? Turn left heading one eight zero,” the controller replied, again without mentioning the emergency. The simple truth, which Okai would later realize, was that the controller was handling a large volume of traffic, and other planes were stepping on his transmissions, making them hard to understand. But in the moment, her failure to appreciate the emergency declaration was probably frustrating.</p><p id="359b">“Okay, Rhoades eight ten, we’ve lost an engine, we are on a two twenty heading, maintaining two thousand, declaring an emergency, how do you read?” Okai repeated.</p><p id="a674">But the controller was in the middle of talking to their sister aircraft, Transair flight 809, and when Okai stopped talking, he heard only the end of their conversation: “…say again, heading two four zero?”</p><p id="4ea2">“Okay, two four zero heading, Rhoades eight ten,” Okai replied, thinking the transmission was for him.</p><p id="449b">“No, Rhoades eight oh nine, Rhoades eight oh nine, left two four zero,” the controller clarified. Then, finally recognizing that flight 810 was in trouble, she added, “Rhoades Express eight ten, you are cleared visual approach runway four right, you can turn in towards the airport.”</p><p id="a709">“Okay, Rhoades eight ten, we’re gonna have to run a checklist, if we can get a delay vector and uh, we’ll let you know when we’re ready to come into the airport,” Okai replied.</p><p id="a97d">“Just keep me advised and maintain two thousand if that’s the altitude you’d like,” said the controller.</p><p id="2fbb">“Okay, two thousand is good for now,” said Okai. “We’ll stay around fifteen miles from the airport and uh, maintaining two thousand, Rhoades eight ten.”</p><figure><figcaption>The EPR gauges on the accident airplane, which would have been the primary instrument indication of engine performance. The values depicted are not what was shown at any point during the accident sequence; the photo is illustrative of the concept only. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="f7d4">By the time the conversation concluded, a minute and forty seconds had passed with little to no discussion between the pilots. First Officer Ryan spent that time leveling off at 2,000 feet and trying to achieve the target airspeed for an engine-out scenario, which was about 220 knots. He initially overshot both, climbing to 2,100 feet and reaching a speed of 250 knots, so he began incrementally reducing power in both engines in order to slow down. In accordance with standard procedures, he moved both thrust levers together, since they had not formally carried out the identification process for the failed engine.</p><p id="da2a">Returning his attention to the cockpit, Captain Okai now said, “Okay, let’s uh… two forty heading.” He appeared not to have understood that this heading was not for him. He then added a question: “You want me to take over, or you got it?”</p><p id="aa5d">“No, I’m okay, thank you,” said Ryan.</p><p id="1cf9">In an emergency, it’s normal for the First Officer to fly while the Captain develops a strategy and completes the abnormal checklists. This was not an official rule nor was it set in stone, but Okai’s offer contradicted it nonetheless.</p><p id="4267">At that moment, the controller called again. “Rhoades Express eight ten, uh, when you get a chance can I get the nature of the emergency, I know you said an engine out, which one? Uh, how many souls on board, and fuel?”</p><p id="17b6">“Okay, all that is good, we’ll give you all that in a little bit, in a little bit, Rhoades eight ten,” Okai replied. Turning back to First Officer Ryan, he said, “Okay, so we’ll plan for two.. say two twenty speed, eh?”</p><p id="c734">“Kay,” said Ryan. By now, both thrust levers had been rolled all the way back to flight idle, the lowest flight setting, and the left and right EPRs had dropped to 1.05 and 1.09 respectively, indicating very little forward thrust. Their speed was dropping nicely toward 220 knots, which was what they wanted.</p><p id="e59f">Now, about 45 seconds after his first offer to take control, Okai said, “Let me take over briefly, and you…”</p><p id="efb2">“Okay,” First Officer Ryan agreed. He would later state that he perceived Okai’s statement as an order, so he agreed to hand over control, even though he was having no issues flying the plane. In fact, with both engines at idle, the asymmetric thrust had disappeared, and it was trivial to keep the plane straight and level.</p><p id="eb32">“You set your things up, I have control,” said Captain Okai.</p><p id="6855">“Okay, you have control,” Ryan acknowledged.</p><figure><figcaption>This 3-D reconstruction shows how the plane began slowly losing altitude just minutes after takeoff. (FlightAware)</figcaption></figure><p id="254a">Now that he was flying the plane, Okai immediately noticed that not all was as it should be. Their speed had dropped to the target of 220 knots, but they were losing altitude, having fallen from 2,100 down to 1,700 feet. Okai tried pitching up to regain their planned altitude, but as a result their speed dropped even more, to 196 knots, and the plane barely climbed. Of course, the reason was because First Officer Ryan had set both thrust levers to idle, and because of the control handover, no one pushed them back up again. But Okai didn’t realize that. Instead, he said, “Okay, let’s see what is the problem. Which one… what’s going on with the gauges? Read the gauges and see which one… who one… which… who has the EGT?”</p><p id="58f8">Glancing over at the engine gauges, First Officer Ryan attempted to determine which engine had abnormal parameters, including but not limited to the exhaust gas temperature (EGT). But with both engines still running at idle power, it was quite difficult to tell. Out of the indicated parameters, engine pressure ratio (EPR) was usually the biggest clue, but the EPR for both engines was almost the same. Instead, Ryan attempted to recall what symptoms he had noticed when the engine first failed: he heard a sound which seemed to come from the left, and the plane yawed left — didn’t it? So it must have been the left engine. Its indicated EPR, slightly below that of the right engine, was consistent with such an interpretation. And so he said, “Yep, so it looks like the number one.”</p><p id="34d2">“Number one is gone?” Okai asked.</p><p id="53b6">“It’s gone, yep,” said Ryan. “So we have number two.”</p><p id="810e">“So we have number two, okay,” said Okai.</p><p id="8443">You might have already noticed what’s wrong with this picture. When the failure first happened, didn’t both pilots identify the problem as being with the right engine? First Officer Ryan even used the rudder to prevent the plane from yawing right! But, as it turns out, human memory is more fallible than we would sometimes like to admit, and in the intervening four minutes, both pilots had somehow entirely forgotten their initial impressions. First Officer Ryan even seemingly forgot that the left engine was at idle power because he put it there himself not even two minutes earlier. If at that moment some outside observer had asked Ryan why he thought the number one (left) engine was faulty, he might not even have been able to give a straight answer, and yet in the moment he expressed his determination with unquestioned conviction, and Captain Okai, believing Ryan to be a competent and trustworthy pilot, accepted his conclusion unconditionally.</p><figure><figcaption>The 737–200 Engine Failure or Shutdown checklist. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="00f4">Having concluded that the left engine was at fault, Okai advanced the right thrust lever in order to stabilize their flight path, then moved to their next priority: completing the engine failure checklist. His plan was to fly 15 miles out from the airport on their assigned heading before turning back, which would give them plenty of time to complete the procedure, so he said, “Alright, uh, two forty heading, I have control.”</p><p id="ceb1">“Okay, should we head back toward the airport though, before we get too far away?”</p><p id="1164">“Yeah, we’ll stay within fifteen… alright, I have controls, you run the checklist, let’s do the engine failure shutdown checklist.”</p><p id="3a69">First Officer Ryan would later assert that he disagreed with the decision to spend so much time in the air, but that Okai was the captain, so he obeyed him. Besides, given their earlier conversation, he surely knew where arguing with Okai would get him (which was nowhere). Okai, for his part, would later note that he had been reprimanded by the Chief Pilot for landing without performing the checklist after a previous engine failure, and had promised not to do so again.</p><p id="e5c0">Some 30 seconds later, Okai asked air traffic control for permission to begin turning in, and received a new heading. Meanwhile, First Officer Ryan started reading off the conditions for performing the checklist. “Okay, engine failure or shutdown,” he recited. “When these occurs… engine failure, engine flameout, or another checklist directs an engine failure…”</p><p id="59e1">At that moment, Ryan seemed to notice that the EGT on the right engine was abnormally high, almost inside the red “warning” zone on the gauge. If they let the exhaust gas temperature climb into the red zone, severe engine damage could occur. Of course, the reason for this was that the right engine was already damaged and was not running properly, causing its internal temperature to rise, but in the moment it appeared to First Officer Ryan that they were simply demanding too much of the old, somewhat underpowered engine. “We’re… we’re red line here, we should pull the right one back a little bit,” he said.</p><p id="ce16">Captain Okai immediately recognized that this was a serious issue. He had already moved the right thrust lever to a reasonable power setting, but the EPR was much lower than it should have been, only about 1.22, which was not enough to keep them airborne for long. And yet even at this low power setting, the engine was overheating. His immediate conclusion was that they were about to lose thrust in both engines, and that they needed to get on the ground as soon as possible, so he said, “Okay, shoot, we should head towards the airport.”</p><figure><figcaption>The location and appearance of the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) gauges on a Boeing 737–200. (Chris Brady)</figcaption></figure><p id="6aa3">As the gravity of the situation set in, First Officer Ryan began setting up for the approach, while Captain Okai informed air traffic control that they were turning in and did not have the airport in sight.</p><p id="ab6d">“Rhoades Express eight ten, fly heading of zero two zero and would you like to intercept the localizer or do you want vectors?” the controller asked.</p><p id="aad8">“No, vectors straight to the airport,” Okai said. “We might lose the other engine too.”</p><p id="5c4d">Back in the cockpit, Okai asked, “We are clean, right?” His concern was that the flaps or landing gear might be extended, causing drag that was reducing their performance (a plane with no flaps or gear is referred to as “clean”). But they were in fact clean, so that wasn’t the problem.</p><p id="5d77">“Okay,” said Ryan.“Just have to watch this though, the number two.”</p><p id="2230">By now they had fallen to 1,000 feet, their speed was down to 157 knots, and both parameters were still decreasing. “Damn,” Okai said. Suddenly, the stick shaker activated, warning that they were flying too slowly and could stall if they didn’t increase their airspeed. With their only working engine redlined — or so they thought — the only way to gain speed was by pitching down, but that would only hasten their already alarming descent.</p><p id="3df3">“What’s this?” Okai exclaimed. “Hey man, we can’t keep going down!”</p><p id="23ec">“We’re descending,” Ryan agreed.</p><p id="a48b">Okai advanced the right thrust lever even more, and the EPR crept up to a still meager 1.37, but the temperature only continued rising into the red zone, until finally it reached the maximum that gauge could indicate.</p><p id="7f6e">“Okay, see, see if you can see the airport now,” Okay said, growing worried.</p><p id="03eb">“Uh, we’re descending, we have to climb!” said Ryan.</p><p id="e0dd">“Double check the airplane is cleaned up,” said Okai.</p><p id="290b">“Yeah, flaps are up, speedbrakes…” Ryan replied.</p><p id="f650">“How is the EGT?” Okai asked.</p><p id="a1e5">“It’s max, it’s beyond max,” said Ryan.</p><p id="cdd6">“Okay, we’re barely holding altitude,” Okai said. “Okay, see what you can do in the checklist, finish as much as possible.”</p><p id="c1df">“This says, uh, airframe vibrations, abnormal engines exist…” Ryan said, speed reading the checklist introductions. “It says do the engine shutdown only when flight conditions — we have to fly the airplane though.”</p><p id="5c09">The full phrase was “when flight conditions allow” — and in Ryan’s view, that meant when their altitude and speed were stable, which they were not. And that meant flying the airplane had to come before finishing the checklist.</p><p id="414f">“Okay,” said Okai. “Damn.”</p><p id="aaa0">“We’re losing altitude,” Ryan repeated.</p><p id="b519">“Yeah. Fifteen miles out,” Okai said. They were on their way back to the airport now, but they were so low that it was difficult to make out the airport lights on the horizon, and they were still dropping. Unless they managed to find some more thrust, they weren’t going to make it. Of course, if someone had simply advanced the left thrust lever, all their problems would have been solved, but nobody even thought to try, so down they went.</p><figure><figcaption>The full annotated flight path of flight 810. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="b8ec">Desperate now to avoid losing altitude, First Officer Ryan thought it was time to start deploying the flaps, knowing that while they would allow them to fly at a lower speed, they would also increase drag. “Do we go flaps, flaps one?” he asked.</p><p id="6bcb">“No no, not yet,” said Okai.</p><p id="13ef">“Kay, we’re, we’re very slow though,” said Ryan. If they didn’t deploy the flaps, Okai would have to keep pitching down to avoid stalling.</p><p id="88b6">“Shoot, okay, flaps one,” Okai agreed.</p><p id="94ed">“Five hundred,” an automated voice called out, reciting their height above the water. It was followed by a callout from the Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System, or EGPWS: “TOO LOW, GEAR!”</p><p id="aa09">Keying his mic, Captain Okai said to air traffic control, “Okay, Rhoades eight ten, uh situation, we’ve lost number one engine and um, we’re coming straight to the airport… we’re gonna need the fire department, there’s a chance we’re gonna lose the other engine too, it’s running very hot. And um, speed is um, we’re pretty low on the speed and it doesn’t look good out here… you might want to let the Coast Guard know as well.” This request would probably end up being the best decision Captain Okai made during the entire emergency.</p><p id="75c0">“TOO LOW, GEAR!” the EGPWS repeated.</p><p id="0e80">“Just fly, fly the airplane please!” said Ryan.</p><p id="6a3c">“TOO LOW, TERRAIN,” said the EGPWS. “TOO LOW, GEAR! TERRAIN! TERRAIN!</p><p id="7b36">“Do you have the airport?” Okai desperately asked.</p><p id="940b">“PULL UP,” the EGPWS blared.</p><p id="c1fc">“Pull up, we’re low!” Ryan repeated.</p><p id="ffad">“PULL UP! PULL UP!”</p><p id="09f8">“Rhoades Express eight ten, do you have the airport in sight?” the controller asked.</p><p id="157c">“Negative!” Ryan replied.</p><p id="7aea">“And Rhoades Express eight ten, low altitude alert, are you able to climb at all?”</p><p id="3603">“No, negative,” Ryan again replied.</p><p id="690e">“Rhoades Express eight ten, roger, proceed direct to the airport and you are cleared to land any runway,” the controller said, followed by a heading. But they were running out of time.</p><figure><figcaption>A graph of the engine pressure ratios over time shows how both engines were reduced to near idle, before the right thrust lever was advanced again. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="5e9a">As flight 810 dropped the last few hundred feet toward the ocean, the EGPWS continued to blare: “TOO LOW, TERRAIN! Three hundred! TOO LOW, GEAR!”</p><p id="056d">“Rhoades Express eight ten, the trucks are rolling,” said the controller.</p><p id="24a8">Jumping on the radio again, Okai replied, “Roger, you wanna — you wanna let the Coast — Coast Guard know as well?</p><p id="5895">“Say that again?”</p><p id="194a">“Can you let the Coast Guard know, we cannot maintain altitude,” Okai repeated.</p><p id="3591">“We will,” said the controller.</p><p id="983a">At that moment, the EPR on the right engine increased to over 1.4, and for a brief moment the plane seemed to level off, before entering an extremely shallow climb. “Hold that please, it’s climbing, hold that, hold that,” First Officer Ryan exclaimed. “Pull back, we’ve got a climb! Pull back to the stick shaker!”</p><p id="93f2">“Shoot, the three hundred feet…” Captain Okai started to say.</p><p id="8240">“It’s okay, we’re climbing — ” Ryan began, but at that moment the right engine started losing power again, and they began descending once more, having gained only 50 feet. “Oh, we’re not climbing, damn,” Ryan concluded.</p><p id="4665">“How’s the EGT?” Okai asked again.</p><p id="9104">“Hot, way over,” said Ryan.</p><p id="44c4">“TOO LOW, TERRAIN!” said the EGPWS. “TOO LOW, GEAR! TOO LOW, GEAR! TOO LOW, GEAR!”</p><p id="4c09">“Rhoades Express eight ten, the Coast Guard is on the way,” said the controller.</p><p id="c814">“TOO LOW, GEAR! TOO LOW, TERRAIN!”</p><p id="ef86">“Pull back please!” said Ryan.</p><p id="dc4a">“Rhoades Express eight ten, if you can get to runway eight right or Kalaeloa, do you want Kalaeloa?” the controller asked, referring to a military airfield off their left side. It was closer than Honolulu International, but probably still too far away.</p><p id="37fe">“We’d like the closest airport runway please,” Ryan replied.</p><p id="016f">“Anything we can land on,” Okai interjected.</p><p id="29ec">“[Kalaeloa air]port is three miles north of you, uh, off your nine to ten o’clock,” said the controller.</p><p id="258f">“Wanna go there?” Ryan asked. The stick shaker stall warning activated for two seconds, prompting Okai to pitch down again.</p><p id="b70f">“Can you get that, Rhoades Express eight ten, it’s three uh, to your left about three miles northwest of you,” the controller said.</p><p id="33bf">“TOO LOW, GEAR! TOO LOW, GEAR!”</p><p id="0f38">“Okay, give me a heading,” Captain Okai transmitted.</p><p id="e9ab">“TOO LOW, GEAR! TOO LOW, GEAR!” the EGPWS blared, followed again by the stick shaker.</p><p id="77f9">“Rhoades Express eight ten, uh the airport is about a three one zero heading from you,” said the controller.</p><p id="5b4e">But it was too late even for this last-ditch effort. As Captain Okai turned left toward the airbase, the pace of the EGPWS alerts became even more frenetic: “TERRAIN! TERRAIN! PULL UP! PULL UP!”</p><p id="0df6">“Three one zero, thank you,” Okai said to the controller. It would be the last transmission from flight 810.</p><p id="1b57">“PULL UP,” the EGPWS screamed. “PULL UP! PULL UP! PULL UP! PULL UP!”</p><p id="09f6">“You have control and you have control!” Okai exclaimed. It’s unclear what he meant, since he retained control of the plane and neither pilot would be able to recall the statement later.</p><p id="5633">“PULL UP!”</p><p id="419b">“Okay,” said Ryan.</p><p id="b608">“Shoot, this is the water, we in the water,” Okai said, spotting the shining black waters of Mamala Bay rising beneath them.</p><p id="5f52">“PULL UP!” The stick shaker rattled briefly again. “PULL UP! PULL UP! PULL UP! TOO LOW, TERRAIN!”</p><p id="f257">“Oh man, we’re in the water, we’re in the water, we can’t…” Okai said, on the verge of hyperventilation.</p><p id="3ce1">The stick shaker started rattling continuously now, punctuated by more EGPWS alerts: “TERRAIN! TERRAIN! PULL UP!”</p><p id="3c76">“Damn!” Okai shouted.</p><p id="eac7">The EGPWS mustered one last “pull up,” and then, with a tremendous shudder, the plane hit the water.</p><figure><figcaption>First Officer Ryan’s seat collapsed forward, causing him to strike his head. It was found still in that position when the plane was recovered. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="2ea2">The impact was hard, and over quickly. Within seconds, the plane ground to a halt, but its fuselage had cracked in two just ahead of the wings, and water was pouring in. By the time Captain Okai managed to undo his seatbelt, the water outside the plane was half way up his window, and it came rushing into the cockpit when he slid it open. Fighting against the inflow, he forced his way out the window and into the heaving ocean. Meanwhile, First Officer Ryan’s seat had collapsed forward on impact, causing him to strike his head, but he too managed to open his window and clamber out into the watery darkness. Now only one objective remained: to survive.</p><p id="ca82">In search of something to hang onto, Captain Okai swam toward the tail section, but no cargo or panels had come loose, so he simply grabbed the automatic direction finder antenna on the vertical stabilizer and hauled himself onto the top of the sinking empennage, where he clung to the tail as waves crashed over him. At the same time, First Officer Ryan held onto the nose section, but as it began to slip beneath the surface, he spotted a loose cargo pallet and climbed aboard, using it as a makeshift raft. He called his captain’s name, and Okai called his name in return, but Okai was in trouble, as waves repeatedly knocked him off his perch, forcing him to swim back again.</p><figure><figcaption>A Coast Guard helicopter and boat respond to the scene of the crash. (US Coast Guard)</figcaption></figure><p id="6569">Suddenly, the roar of a helicopter overcame the rumble of the waves, and floodlights illuminated the desperate scene. The Coast Guard had arrived! At that moment, a wave again swept Captain Okai into the water, but this time he became disoriented; he could no longer find the tail, which was rapidly sinking. Floundering in the heaving sea, he began inhaling water and jet fuel. Realizing that his captain’s life was in danger, First Officer Ryan pointed the helicopter toward the tail section, and the rescuers got the message. An elite rescue swimmer jumped from the hovering helicopter and swam to Okai’s aid, pulling him back from the brink at the last possible moment. The swimmer and the unconscious captain were then winched back aboard — at which point the rescue swimmer jumped right back in again to save First Officer Ryan. With Captain Okai in apparently critical condition, the helicopter departed without them, but the Coast Guard had a plan B: a rescue boat, which was just now arriving at the scene. Grabbing onto the First Officer’s cargo pallet, the rescue swimmer swam through the ocean, pushing the improvised raft ahead of him, until they reached the boat and were hoisted aboard.</p><p id="5445">Against all odds, having ditched their plane in the ocean in the middle of the night, both pilots had been saved in the nick of time.</p><p id="24ce">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>The aft section of N810TA as seen on the bottom of the ocean. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="6b1c">When National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived in Hawaii later that day, they knew from the publicly available air traffic control tapes that the pilots of flight 810 reported an inability to maintain altitude and a possible dual engine failure, leading to a forced landing on water at night. Although it was clear that the pilots were lucky to be alive — in fact both were released from hospital within 48 hours — little else about the nature of the events was immediately obvious. And with the plane, and its black boxes, sitting somewhere on the bottom of Mamala Bay, the only way to find out what happened was to ask the two men who were there.</p><p id="ff31">The interviews with the pilots, which have been publicly released, provide a glimpse into what the crew thought was going on during the emergency. Captain Okai reported believing that the number two (right) engine had failed, but that when First Officer Ryan told him the faulty engine was number one (left), he had no reason to disbelieve him. After all, Ryan was the one flying the plane, so he would have been in a better position to detect which side was lacking thrust. First Officer Ryan, for his part, stated in full confidence that the sound of the “thud” came from the left side, that the plane yawed to the left, and that he had always known it was the left engine that failed. Only after this did it become clear that the right engine was running very hot and was not producing enough thrust to keep them in the air. But both pilots agreed on one thing: they had no idea why the plane wouldn’t fly, and were eager to find out.</p><figure><figcaption>The forward fuselage and cockpit of N810TA came to rest some distance away. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="33d0">The recovery of the plane from under 110 to 130 meters (360 to 420 feet) of water ultimately took four months, but when the NTSB finally received the flight data and cockpit voice recordings, their contents underscored just how unreliable witness testimony can often be. In fact, the data showed that the right engine suddenly lost power about 7 seconds after liftoff, confirming Captain Okai’s initial impression that this engine had failed. Furthermore, the resulting yaw to the right was countered correctly by First Officer Ryan, showing that he knew which side had lost thrust. The cockpit voice recorder was even more unequivocal: in fact, both pilots explicitly stated that the right engine had failed. This was confirmed by metallurgical analysis, which showed that corrosion had led to at least one blade failure in the right engine’s high pressure turbine, but that no defects were present in the left engine until it hit the water.</p><p id="eaad">The error chain began minutes after the initial failure, when First Officer Ryan began reducing thrust on both engines toward idle in order to slow the plane from 250 to 220 knots. After this occurred, the pilots again revisited the question of which engine had failed, and came to a startlingly different conclusion. In his interview, Ryan said that in addition to the symptoms described earlier, he saw that the left engine’s EPR and other parameters had fallen to idle, leading him to a conclusion that this engine had failed. But the left engine was at idle because he put it there! How was it possible for him to have become so confused? In the end, we may never know for sure — but it is possible to say a lot more about why Captain Okai failed to notice.</p><figure><figcaption>Part of one of N810TA’s two JT8D engines lies on the sea floor. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="cbca">As pilot monitoring during the takeoff, it was Captain Okai’s primary responsibility to watch the instruments and note any abnormalities. But almost as soon as the failure occurred, he took it upon himself to declare an emergency to air traffic control, an effort which he admitted “became a project.” In fact, Okai spent one minute and 40 seconds in a confused exchange with the oversaturated controller before he finally returned his attention to the cockpit, demonstrating rather poor task prioritization. Ideally, he should have analyzed the situation first and declared an emergency second, and if the controller did not hear his emergency declaration, he could have used the transponder to “squawk” 7700, the universal emergency code, instead of wasting more time on the radio. But he did not.</p><p id="1e83">By the time Captain Okai returned his attention to the cockpit, First Officer Ryan had already rolled back both engines to idle and leveled off at 2,000 feet, eliminating the most salient clues as to which engine had failed. At this point, they found themselves outside the boundaries of the assumptions built into their training scenarios and emergency checklists. The procedures for responding to an engine failure on takeoff assumed two things: first, that one engine would stop producing power entirely, resulting in warnings and zeroes on gauges; and second, that the adverse yaw from the asymmetric thrust would persist, providing a powerful clue about which engine had failed. But in this case, neither of these assumptions held, because the right engine only suffered a partial loss of power, and by the time the pilots got around to formally identifying the failed engine some four minutes after takeoff, both engines were producing the same amount of thrust (very little), so the adverse yaw was gone. At that point the only obvious difference between the two sets of gauges would have been a higher temperature on the right engine. As a result, there was nothing to obviously indicate to Captain Okai that First Officer Ryan’s conclusion about the failed engine was wrong. There was nothing to indicate that it was right, either, but Okai’s trust in Ryan was apparently good enough. Had he attempted to verify this by advancing both thrust levers in turn, which is a prescribed procedure for identifying a failed engine, he would have realized that the left engine was fine, but he never tried.</p><figure><figcaption>A closer view of the damaged nose section. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="8224">Because the pilots never increased power on the left engine, the plane did not have enough thrust to maintain altitude, even with the right thrust lever fully forward, because they were relying only on the damaged right engine. At any point, the pilots could have averted the accident by simply moving the left thrust lever forward, which would be a sensible thing to do when one is about to hit the water, even if one believes that that engine has failed. After all, the worst that can happen is it doesn’t work, and in the best case scenario, it could save lives. But when the NTSB conducted follow-up interviews in March 2022 to clarify why, among other points, the pilots did not move the left thrust lever, both replied that it simply never occurred to them. By the time it had become clear that they could not maintain altitude, both pilots were suffering from tunnel vision, and were singularly focused on flying the airplane to the end, rather than thinking outside the box for solutions. And with their focus so consumed by the task of flying, no one even looked at the thrust levers, let alone considered moving them.</p><p id="66fa">Had the pilots completed the engine failure and shutdown checklist, which required moving the affected thrust lever to idle before cutting fuel, the pilots might have noticed that the left thrust lever had been at idle the whole time, and might have tried advancing it. But in the event, they never actually started the checklist, because by the time they got around to it, their flight path was no longer stable, and First Officer Ryan had decided that flying the plane was a higher priority. Captain Okai, for his part, told the NTSB that he thought the checklist would be useless once the second engine started to fail, so he didn’t order Ryan to finish it.</p><figure><figcaption>The aft section of N810TA is recovered from the water in November 2021. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="f4e3">In the end, the fact that the pilots rolled back the wrong engine was attributed to poor communication and insufficient procedural discipline. The flight operations manual included the following prescient warning: “<em>Any time an engine shutdown is required in flight, good crew coordination is essential. Airplane incidents have turned into airplane accidents as a result of the flight crew shutting down the incorrect engine. When the flight path is under complete control, the crew should proceed with a deliberate, systematic process that identifies the correct engine and ensures that the operating engine is not shut down.”</em> In the event, the flight path was stable at 2,000 feet for several minutes, but no “deliberate” or “systematic” attempt to identify the correct engine was ever carried out. Ultimately, this was the pilots’ biggest and most unfortunate mistake.</p><p id="899f">The NTSB also criticized Captain Okai for demonstrating poor task prioritization (communicating with ATC instead of analyzing the situation, failing to ensure that the checklist was performed in a timely manner); poor crew resource management (failing to trust but verify, failing to monitor his First Officer’s actions); and poor leadership (failing to establish a plan, failing to enforce adherence to procedures). However, investigators also wrote that many of his mistakes could have been influenced by stress, which is known to have effects similar to fatigue, including inhibited decision-making and reduced ability to conduct critical thinking.</p><p id="27a5">Although the NTSB pointed to the nature of the emergency itself as the possible source of his stress, it’s also worth noting that the cockpit voice recorder transcript supports a hypothesis that Captain Okai was already stressed before the flight even took off. He had been in a shouting match with another pilot less than 24 hours earlier and may have felt hurt or insulted by her refusal to fly with him. The salience of this event was clear, given that Okai spent a total of 32 minutes before the flight talking about his experiences with First Officer Moore, including after starting the engines and during taxi, in violation of the sterile cockpit rule, which prohibits off-topic conversations between engine start and 10,000 feet. This violation almost certainly had no effect on the course of events, but it did suggest that Okai was having difficulty focusing on the task at hand. In the end, the NTSB declined to mention these conversations in its final report, which is normal — most of the time, the agency doesn’t wade into pilots’ personal disputes — but when taken in context, it’s difficult to ignore.</p><p id="fa8b">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>The nose section is loaded onto a barge. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="b3e4">Although the crash was the direct result of the flight crew’s actions, it’s worth summarizing the mechanical aspects before bowing out. The final report and its supporting documentation are light on details, but the cause of the failure seems to have been simple corrosion of either one or two high pressure turbine blades. The question of whether this corrosion was detectable during routine inspections, and why the corrosion appeared in the first place, don’t seem to have been addressed. However, given that the corrosion was internal to the blades, it’s possible that it was difficult to detect, which is supported by the NTSB’s explicit conclusion, stated in its report, that “maintenance was not a factor in this accident.” Furthermore, corrosion is an inevitability on airplanes and engines operating in Hawaii’s humid, salty climate, especially over long timeframes. The engine that failed was built in 1968 and was 53 years old at the time of the crash, plenty long enough to develop all manner of problems, especially if the maintenance was not always up to par.</p><p id="3bc1">There was plenty of circumstantial evidence to suggest that maintenance was a major problem area for Transair. Captain Okai said he had experienced five engine failures while flying 737s for Transair, which is a lot, and issues like high engine temperatures on takeoff were common. The airline’s chief maintenance inspector had also resigned two weeks before the crash, citing insufficient staffing, time, and experience. And according to a colleague, First Officer Ryan had previously called the airline’s safety culture “screwed up” and “beyond help.” These problems had been brewing in the background for some time, and in May 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration revoked Rhoades Aviation’s air operator certificate, permanently grounding Transair, after an investigation found numerous maintenance violations, including 33 flights performed with unairworthy engines. However, the investigation and its findings were said to have nothing to do with the accident, which was caused by an apparently undetectable issue.</p><p id="4122">◊◊◊</p><figure><figcaption>The underside of the nose section was heavily damaged during the impact. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="5789">With Transair having ceased to exist by the time the investigation concluded, and with very few Boeing 737–200s remaining in service in the United States, the NTSB did not issue any safety recommendations as a result of the accident. Nevertheless, as the latest example in a series of crashes involving shutdown of an incorrect engine, it’s worth extracting some lessons anyway. The crash of Transair flight 810 in particular evokes the 1989 disaster involving <a rel="noopener" href="https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/lefts-rights-and-wrongs-the-crash-of-british-midland-flight-92-or-the-kegworth-air-disaster-a3989feb4d3a#:%7E:text=On%20the%208th%20of%20January,height%20of%20just%20900%20feet">British Midland flight 92</a>, another Boeing 737 that suffered a partial engine failure, only to crash short of the airport after the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine. The reasons for the engine failures and for the pilots’ mistakes in both crashes were different — for instance, the British Midland investigation cited poorly designed gauges that were not installed on earlier 737–200s like that involved in the Transair crash. However, both cases were characterized by a lack of due care in determining the failed engine, including captains who uncritically believed their first officers’ unsupported and incorrect determinations.</p><figure><figcaption>An NTSB investigator examines the recovered nose section. (NTSB)</figcaption></figure><p id="967e">The fact that the same mistakes could occur again after 32 years underscores the need for pilots to double and triple check which engine has failed, but it also highlights the limitations of better training and words of caution in manuals as a solution to this recurring issue. As I mentioned in my article on the British Midland crash, the most effective way to prevent this kind of accident is by fitting airplanes with an Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System, known as EICAS, or similar equipment. These systems automatically monitor engine performance and, should an engine fail, will produce a message informing the pilots which engine is the cause of the problem, dramatically reducing the probability of an incorrect identification. However, retrofitting the systems onto older 737s, which are most at risk, is not required and may be impractical or impossible. For that reason, as long as first and second generation 737s continue to fly, a safety risk still exists, and now that the findings of the Transair investigation have been released, that fact bears repeating: as long as pilots rely on context clues to determine which engine has failed, the opportunity for this type of error will remain. Let us merely be thankful that this latest warning did not come to us at the cost of lives — and let us not squander it.</p><p id="482b">_______________________________________________________________</p><p id="2a7e"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CatastrophicFailure/comments/14nxu5c/2021_the_crash_of_transair_flight_810_a_boeing/?" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Join the discussion of this article on Reddit</a></p><p id="72db"><a href="https://www.patreon.com/Admiral_Cloudberg" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Support me on Patreon</a> (Note: I do not earn money from views on Medium!)</p><p id="b1bb"><a href="https://twitter.com/KyraCloudy" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Follow me on Twitter</a></p><p id="5a52">Visit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AdmiralCloudberg/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">r/admiralcloudberg</a> to read and discuss over 240 similar articles</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Sometimes it seems like good, high quality writing always finds its way to the front page; other times, it feels like the mods are out to get you. So I started (very manually) collecting data on what the top 30 posts on HN are at the end of any given day.</p>

<li>ShowHN posts almost never make the front page (&lt;2%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s the breakdown more visually:</p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/top-30-by-category.png"></p>
<p>Before some more analysis and a few more charts, I want to preface this post by saying that I don’t mean to comment on the <em>inherent value</em> of getting your content to the front page of Hacker News. Whether this is the right goal, or if perhaps you should pursue a different goal like number of upvotes, or maybe comments, or maybe <em>angry</em> comments, is a discussion for another post.</p>
<h2>How I gathered and categorized the data</h2>
<p>The way I gathered this (small) data set was by manually<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> combing through the top 30 posts on Hacker News using the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front"><code>past</code></a> feature. For each post, I clicked on the link to see what the content was about, who published it, and where. Partially in advance, and then partially on the fly the more stuff I saw, I classified each post into a category. Since my main focus is technical writing and marketing, the categories I chose relate to that lens:</p>
<ul>
<li>News / opinion articles in media publications</li>
<li>Academic journals and papers</li>
<li>Blog posts
<ul>
<li>Personal blog vs. a corporate blog vs. an open source entity</li>
<li>Types of content: tutorials, thought leadership, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hiring announcements</li>
<li>ShowHN</li>
<li>Misc.
<ul>
<li>Repo links</li>
<li>Non-blog websites</li>
<li>Tweets, Reddit posts, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These categories have excellent coverage (Misc. &lt;5%) despite them being oddly specific. You can see that I wasn’t particularly concerned with the <em>subject matter</em> per se (everything is about Rust anyway) but more the format and the authoring entity.</p>
<p>The astute reader will note several limitations of the data set. </p>
<p>First, the data I collected represents what <em>finished</em> the day on the front page of Hacker News. But many items will <em>be</em> on the front page over the course of a given day, and then end the day somewhere else (perhaps number 35, or 67). What “gets to” the front page – a group that contains, and exceeds the size of, what “ends” on the front page - is a richer data set but I do not have access to it / it may not exist.</p>
<p>Second, and perhaps more importantly, the dataset doesn’t record the <em>attempts</em> made to get to the front page, i.e. all posts on Hacker News in a given day. It’s possible that there are orders of magnitude more blog posts <em>posted</em>  but fewer that <em>make</em> the FP, whereas 95% of any academic paper submitted makes the front page (extreme figures used for illustrative purposes). So for simplicity, I’ll say “the likelihood of making the FP” which assumes a constant rate of conversion from post to FP across different categories.</p>
<p>Limitations aside, the results started to converge very clearly after only 5 or 6 days of data, although there were a few outlier days with spikes in a particular category. In total I collected and sifted through 30 days worth of data, and hope to add more in the future.</p>
<h2>What kinds of blog posts get to the front page?</h2>
<p>Statistically, your best shot of getting your writing to the front page of Hacker News is by writing something (with nothing to promote) on your personal website or blog. 26% of total FP posts are blogs like this, while only 11% of total FP posts (or 24% of FP <em>blog</em> posts) came from corporate<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> entities on their corporate blogs or websites. 20% of blog posts are from some sort of open source entity (usually launches).</p>
<p>On the subject of what to post, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html">the Hacker News guidelines</a> say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence, the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>and this is pretty much the story with what blog posts make the FP. </p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/blog-posts.png"></p>
<p>Of those corporate blog posts, about 40% of them are product announcements or launches; the rest are less promotional content formats like technical tutorials. A common question I get is “how do we get our product launch on the front page of HackerNews?” and the answer is that it’s statistically<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> highly unlikely (~4%) for that to happen. And of those product announcements that made the FP, a good deal of them are (a) from established companies and products like Apple, (b) posted organically by the community, and (c) about hardware and gaming. Not your software startup.</p>
<p>Personal blog posts, though, are highly popular on the FP. They span the gamut from tutorials to “how I built ___” type posts, and of course the perennial “I made a thing.” Here are a few examples of personal blog posts that made the FP:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tavianator.com/2023/futex.html">You could have invented Futexes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jingnanshi.com/blog/groebner_basis.html">Use Gröbner Bases To Solve Polynomial Equations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.milanvit.net/post/my-ultimate-shell-setup-with-fish-shell-and-tmux/">My ultimate shell setup with Fish shell and Tmux</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ariadne.space/2023/04/13/writing-portable-arm64-assembly/">Writing portable ARM64 assembly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The common thread is that they’re non-promotional, and typically focus on a personal pursuit of the author<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My personal experience writing for corporate entities says that useful tutorials and interesting stories do the best. The most recent post I wrote that made it to #1 was a tutorial for PlanetScale about how database sharding works (HN post <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35476518">here</a>). A few others I wrote that made the FP were all non-promotional:</p>
<ul>
<li>My two stories for Retool about why Accenture (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26969364">link</a>) and Oracle (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29004597">link</a>) are worth so much money</li>
<li>My blog post for WorkOS about best practices for building webhooks (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26401838">link</a>)</li>
<li>My “thought leadership” for PlanetScale about DBA experience (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28330297">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These successes live next door to a massive graveyard of blog posts I’ve written that <em>I</em> thought were really good, but Hacker News did not. Or perhaps randomness just reared its ugly head. </p>
<h2>What kinds of news gets to the front page?</h2>
<p>The second biggest category of posts that make the front page of Hacker News is (shocker) news, which I define here as a story or opinion piece published by a media organization. 36% of FP items are news, which is a lot!</p>
<p>While almost all of the news that makes the FP is STEM related, the majority of it (well, by a few percentage points) doesn’t relate to software or hardware. There are a lot of articles about space exploration and rockets, biology and chemistry, and physics, but fewer about code and SaaS and things like that. </p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/news.png"></p>
<p>It’s worth noting that I didn’t see a single article from TechCrunch in the entire dataset I gathered, despite there being plenty of articles for places like the Verge, Wired, etc. A cursory search using <a href="https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;query=techcrunch&amp;sort=byPopularity&amp;type=story">Algolia’s Search HackerNews tool</a>, ordered by number of upvotes, reveals that HackerNews really does not like TechCrunch very much.</p>
<p><img src="https://randomshit.dev/images/hacker-news/techcrunch.png"></p>
<h2>Miscellaneous findings and other things</h2>
<p>6% of items on the front page are academic papers, which is more than I thought.</p>
<p>ShowHN is very valuable, but is not likely to land your product on the front page.</p>
<p>Tweets and tweet threads sometimes make the front page.</p>
<p>It’s uncommon for hiring or launch posts - the two types of posts that are reserved for YC companies, and “artificially” promoted by moderators - to make the front page.</p>
<p>You can access the underlying dataset <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iUYmm4PRFbRi6KmDztRyCDiaHOLjsze4zT6Ts4-qbxk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>
<p>I want to thank <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir">Max Woolf</a> (who may recall interviewing me for a Data Science job at Buzzfeed that I thankfully did not take) for the excellent <a href="https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented">“Hacker News Undocumented”</a> resource. It was tremendously helpful. </p>

<p>This is a problem many people who love doing creative stuff (writing, music, programming, painting, pottery, calligraphy, anything creative and original) will face:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>“This is good, why don’t you make money from it?”</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>As if the only value anything has is by how much dollars it makes.</p>



<p>You could create the most beautiful painting, the most moving music, the most engaging novel, but if you don’t have the big dolla’s in your bank account, you are a failure.</p>



<p>And all of it is complicated by the fact that, yes, like most creatives, I <em>do want</em> to make money from my writing. Maybe not millions, but a little would help. Especially when the day job is going shit, and you know the fantasy that online entrepreneurs sell:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Quit the day job! Start your own business! Don’t depend on one person for all your income! Blah blah blah! Now buy my book/course, so at least one of us can get rich.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It doesn’t help with all these online “gurus” who claim you can make the big $$$ by selling anything (yes sir, ANYTHING!) online, if only you buy their expensive course.</p>



<p>One guru (and why name him, since they all do the same) says you can make money online (BIG MONEY!) even if you are selling things like crotchet kits or dog training. All you have to do is <em>(in thunderous manly voice)</em>:</p>



<p><strong>FOLLOW MY FORMULA!</strong></p>



<p>His formula was, in a nutshell: Create training courses and sell them to others, just as he was doing. And at least one of us made big money (<em>hint, it wasn’t me</em>).</p>



<p><strong>My story</strong></p>



<p>I loved writing fiction– novels, short stories, interactive fiction. At first, I would just self-publish them on Amazon, no care whether anyone bought them.</p>



<p>Then I joined a few writer groups, and they were all like “You need to market your work”.</p>



<p>And so I spent hours every week building my email list, running ads, asking for reviews (as you need them to sell books), blogs/podcasts.</p>



<p>I found the type of fiction that sells is in a few mainstream genres, and in series (so you write a dozen books, all with a hard-boiled detective, for example). That’s why every book nowadays is in a series because publishers (traditional and indie)have figured out this is the “formula” to success.</p>



<p>I like to experiment and play—one genre I love writing is comedy-horror. This is one of those super niche genres that have a few hardcore fans but isn’t mainstream. Think <em>Shaun of the Dead</em> in movies, or one of my favourite books <em>John Dies at the End.</em></p>



<p>Other books I wrote were supernatural detective series, a fantasy comedy (a teddy bear that solves crime). Now, there are books like these and sell (and where do you think I got ideas from?), but they are not mainstream.</p>



<p>If you want to make the big money, you at least have to try writing for the “market” or trying to write in a way that appeals to the mainstream, or at least a large number of people.</p>



<p>So that’s what I did. Why not? Everyone else was doing it. They were pasting screenshots of how much money they were making online in Facebook groups.</p>



<p>And while all the above I tried worked in the short term (and yes, it DOES work), soon I began to hate what I was doing and one day, I just couldn’t type anymore.</p>



<p>And one day, I couldn’t take it anymore. Couldn’t type one more word. Quit 2 years ago, after 7-8 years of writing.</p>



<p>Have tried to restart many times, but each time, I feel disgusted and quit.</p>



<p><strong>Trying to make money from your “passion” is hard</strong></p>



<p><em>Just follow your passion and you won’t have to work a day!</em></p>



<p>Sure, if your passion is online marketing or making WordPress sites for cash-rich, time-poor business owners.</p>



<p>When I was writing, I hit all the clichés about “passion”:</p>



<ul>
<li>I would be lost for hours in writing</li>



<li>I loved doing it</li>



<li>I did it for several years non-stop, including training to become better</li>
</ul>



<p>And yet, in spite of my passionate “passion”, I never made enough money to quit the day job. I followed my passion and all it gave my was wrist pain.</p>



<p>And it is a field where people make money— but like many other creative fields (music, sports, art), it’s a winner-take-all field. 5-10% of authors make 90% of the money. And that’s fine, I knew the statistics before I started.</p>



<p>But I was still hoping to make some money. To be honest, I do, but it’s never been more than a fancy night out each month.</p>



<p>I never cracked the Amazon algorithm; I never got 10,000 fans on Facebook; I never got a huge email list of people <em>Oh gosh! Just waiting to buy my book.</em></p>



<p>And in trying to hit these targets, I started hating what I was actually doing — writing.</p>



<p><strong>My advice is</strong>: If you love someone, do it for love, don’t always try to make money from it.</p>



<p>It all comes back to doing it for the love and accepting that perhaps this will always remain a hobby. Do it with a craftsman’s mindset, always improving for the sake of improving.</p>



<p>And don’t let anyone shame you if you don’t want to make money.</p>



<p><em>Note: I wrote this post 2–3 years ago, and it had been sitting on my hard drive since then.</em> <em>I have given up fiction writing, though my books are still online I don’t do anything to promote them, nor am I writing new ones. I wrote this post as a warning: If you love something, do it for the love and don’t let the Get-Rich-Types make you lose your focus.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <task-lists disabled="" sortable="">
    <div>
      


<h3 dir="auto">Motivation and Context</h3>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning allows to clone a file (or a subset of its blocks) into another (or the same) file by just creating additional references to the data blocks without copying the data itself. Block Cloning can be described as a fast, manual deduplication.</p>
<h3 dir="auto">Description</h3>
<p dir="auto">In many ways Block Cloning is similar to the existing deduplication, but there are some important differences:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Deduplication is automatic and Block Cloning is not - one has to use a dedicated system call(s) to clone the given file/blocks.</li>
<li>Deduplication keeps all data blocks in its table, even those referenced just ones. Block Cloning creates an entry in its tables only when there are at least two references to the given data block. If the block was never explicitly cloned or the second to last reference was dropped, there will be neither space nor performance overhead.</li>
<li>Deduplication needs data to work - one needs to pass real data to the write(2) syscall, so hash can be calculated. Block Cloning doesn't require data, just block pointers to the data, so it is extremely fast, as we pay neither the cost of reading the data, nor the cost of writing the data - we operate exclusively on metadata.</li>
<li>If the D (dedup) bit is not set in the block pointer, it means that the block is not in the dedup table (DDT) and we won't consult the DDT when we need to free the block. Block Cloning must be consulted on every free, because we cannot modify the source BP (eg. by setting something similar to the D bit), thus we have no hint if the block is in the Block Reference Table (BRT), so we need to look into the BRT. There is an optimization in place that allows to eliminate majority of BRT lookups that is described below in the "Minimizing free penalty" section.</li>
<li>The BRT entry is much smaller than the DDT entry - for BRT we only store 64bit offset and 64bit reference counter.</li>
<li>Dedup keys are cryptographic hashes, so two blocks that are close to each other on disk are most likely in totally different parts of the DDT.  The BRT entry keys are offsets into a single top-level VDEV, so data blocks from one file should have BRT entries close to each other.</li>
<li>Scrub will only do a single pass over a block that is referenced multiple times in the DDT. Unfortunately it is not currently (if at all) possible with Block Cloning and block referenced multiple times will be scrubbed multiple times.</li>
<li>Deduplication requires cryptographically strong hash as a checksum or additional data verification. Block Cloning works with any checksum algorithm or even with checksumming disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">As mentioned above, the BRT entries are much smaller than the DDT entries.  To uniquely identify a block we just need its vdevid and offset. We also need to maintain a reference counter. The vdevid will often repeat, as there is a small number of top-level VDEVs and a large number of blocks stored in each VDEV. We take advantage of that to reduce the BRT entry size further by maintaining one BRT for each top-level VDEV, so we can then have only offset and counter as the BRT entry.</p>
<p dir="auto">Minimizing free penalty.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning allows to clone any existing block. When we free a block there is no hint in the block pointer whether the block was cloned or not, so on each free we have to check if there is a corresponding entry in the BRT or not. If there is, we need to decrease the reference counter. Doing BRT lookup on every free can potentially be expensive by requiring additional I/Os if the BRT doesn't fit into memory. This is the main problem with deduplication, so we've learn our lesson and try not to repeat the same mistake here. How do we do that? We divide each top-level VDEV into 64MB regions. For each region we maintain a reference counter that is a sum of all reference counters of the cloned blocks that have offsets within the region. This creates the regions array of 64bit numbers for each top-level VDEV. The regions array is always kept in memory and updated on disk in the same transaction group as the BRT updates to keep everything in-sync. We can keep the array in memory, because it is very small. With 64MB regions and 1TB VDEV the array requires only 128kB of memory (we may decide to decrease the region size in the future). Now, when we want to free a block, we first consult the array. If the counter for the whole region is zero, there is no need to look for the BRT entry, as there isn't one for sure. If the counter for the region is greater than zero, only then we will do a BRT lookup and if an entry is found we will decrease the reference counters in the entry and in the regions array.</p>
<p dir="auto">The regions array is small, but can potentially be larger for very large VDEVs or smaller regions. In this case we don't want to rewrite entire array on every change. We then divide the regions array into 128kB chunks and keep a bitmap of dirty chunks within a transaction group. When we sync the transaction group we can only update the parts of the regions array that were modified. Note: Keeping track of the dirty parts of the regions array is implemented, but updating only parts of the regions array on disk is not yet implemented - for now we will update entire regions array if there was any change.</p>
<p dir="auto">The implementation tries to be economic: if BRT is not used, or no longer used, there will be no entries in the MOS and no additional memory used (eg.  the regions array is only allocated if needed).</p>
<p dir="auto">Interaction between Deduplication and Block Cloning.</p>
<p dir="auto">If both functionalities are in use, we could end up with a block that is referenced multiple times in both DDT and BRT. When we free one of the references we couldn't tell where it belongs, so we would have to decide what table takes the precedence: do we first clear DDT references or BRT references? To avoid this dilemma BRT cooperates with DDT - if a given block is being cloned using BRT and the BP has the D (dedup) bit set, BRT will lookup DDT entry and increase the counter there. No BRT entry will be created for a block that resides on a dataset with deduplication turned on.  BRT may be more efficient for manual deduplication, but if the block is already in the DDT, then creating additional BRT entry would be less efficient. This clever idea was proposed by Allan Jude.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning across datasets.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning is not limited to cloning blocks within the same dataset.  It is possible (and very useful) to clone blocks between different datasets.<br>
One use case is recovering files from snapshots. By cloning the files into dataset we need no additional storage. Without Block Cloning we would need additional space for those files.<br>
Another interesting use case is moving the files between datasets (copying the file content to the new dataset and removing the source file).  In that case Block Cloning will only be used briefly, because the BRT entries will be removed when the source is removed.<br>
Note: currently it is not possible to clone blocks between encrypted datasets, even if those datasets use the same encryption key (this includes snapshots of encrypted datasets). Cloning blocks between datasets that use the same keys should be possible and should be implemented in the future.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning flow through ZFS layers.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: Block Cloning can be used both for cloning file system blocks and ZVOL blocks. As of this writing no interface is implemented that allows for ZVOL blocks cloning.<br>
Depending on the operating system there might be different interfaces to clone blocks. On FreeBSD we have two syscalls:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content=" ssize_t fclonefile(int srcfd, int dstfd);
 ssize_t fclonerange(int srcfd, off_t srcoffset, size_t length, int dstfd, off_t dstoffset);"><pre><code> ssize_t fclonefile(int srcfd, int dstfd);
 ssize_t fclonerange(int srcfd, off_t srcoffset, size_t length, int dstfd, off_t dstoffset);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Even though fclonerange() takes byte offsets and length, they have to be block-aligned.<br>
Both syscalls call OS-independent zfs_clone_range() function. This function was implemented based on zfs_write(), but instead of writing the given data we first read block pointers using the new dmu_read_l0_bps() function from the source file. Once we have BPs from the source file we call the dmu_brt_addref() function on the destination file. This function allocates BPs for us. We iterate over all source BPs. If the given BP is a hole or an embedded block, we just copy BP. If it points to a real data we place this BP on a BRT pending list using the brt_pending_add() function.</p>
<p dir="auto">We use this pending list to keep track of all BPs that got new references within this transaction group.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some special cases to consider and how we address them:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The block we want to clone may have been created within the same transaction group as we are trying to clone. Such block has no BP allocated yet, so it is too early to clone it. In this case the dmu_read_l0_bps() function will return EAGAIN and in the zfs_clone_range() function we will wait for the transaction group to be synced to disks and retry.</li>
<li>The block we want to clone may have been modified within the same transaction group. We could potentially clone the previous version of the data, but that doesn't seem right. We handle it as the previous case.</li>
<li>A block may be cloned multiple times during one transaction group (that's why pending list is actually a tree and not an append-only list - this way we can figure out faster if this block is cloned for the first time in this txg or consecutive time).</li>
<li>A block may be cloned and freed within the same transaction group (see dbuf_undirty()).</li>
<li>A block may be cloned and within the same transaction group the clone can be cloned again (see dmu_read_l0_bps()).</li>
<li>A file might have been deleted, but the caller still has a file descriptor open to this file and clones it.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">When we free a block we have additional step in the ZIO pipeline where we call the zio_brt_free() function. We then call the brt_entry_decref() that loads the corresponding BRT entry (if one exists) and decreases reference counter. If this is not the last reference we will stop ZIO pipeline here. If this is the last reference or the block is not in the BRT, we continue the pipeline and free the block as usual.</p>
<p dir="auto">At the beginning of spa_sync() where there can be no more block cloning, but before issuing frees we call brt_pending_apply(). This function applies all the new clones to the BRT table - we load BRT entries and update reference counters. To sync new BRT entries to disk, we use brt_sync() function. This function will sync all dirty top-level-vdev BRTs, regions arrays, etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Block Cloning and ZIL.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every clone operation is divided into chunks (similar to write) and each chunk is cloned in a separate transaction. To keep ZIL entries small, each chunk clones at most 254 blocks, which makes ZIL entry to be 32kB.  Replaying clone operation is different from the regular clone operation, as when we log clone operation we cannot use the source object - it may reside on a different dataset, so we log BPs we want to clone.<br>
The ZIL is replayed when we mount the given dataset, not when the pool is imported. Taking this into account it is possible that the pool is imported without mounting datasets and the source dataset is destroy before the destination dataset is mounted and its ZIL replayed.<br>
To address this situation we leverage zil_claim() mechanism where ZFS will parse all the ZILs on pool import. When we come across TX_CLONE_RANGE entries, we will bump reference counters for their BPs in the BRT and then on mount and ZIL replay we will just attach BPs to the file without bumping reference counters.<br>
Note it is still possible that after zil_claim() we never mount the destination, so we never replay its ZIL and we destroy it. This way we would end up with leaked references in BRT. We address that too as ZFS gives as a chance to clean this up on dataset destroy (see zil_free_clone_range()).</p>

              <p><span data-jscall-id="27">Makie</span> is a modern plotting library for 
                <a href="https://julialang.org/" target="_blank" data-jscall-id="28">Julia</a>.
It is easy to use, fast and powerful. Packed with features,
it is a general-purpose tool that makes as few compromises for specialized use cases as possible.

                  <h2 data-jscall-id="55">Surgical updates &amp; high performance</h2><p>Makie uses Observables.jl to only update what's necessary at a given point in time.
This example animates hundreds of thousands of points just through a colormap update, modifying only a few bytes per frame directly on the GPU.
There's no faster way to animate large data. Combining the power of GPUs and Julia's high performance, Makie is fit for any task!

While Makie might not be the go-to for more complex games, using it to build a Minecraft-like game highlights its versatility for complex, interactive visualizations.
Many use cases, such as AI gyms or complex, interactive 3D simulations, greatly benefit from this.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-version="2" id="Blog1">
<article data-postid="2347375719013220143">

<div id="post-body-2347375719013220143"><p>In September 2006, the mayor of São Paulo passed the so-called “Clean City Law" that outlawed the use of all outdoor advertisements, including on billboards, transit, and in front of stores. Within a year, 15,000 billboards were taken down and store signs had to be shrunk so as not to violate the new law. Outdoor video screens and ads on buses were stripped. Even pamphleteering in public spaces has been made illegal. Nearly $8 million in fines were issued to cleanse São Paulo of the blight on its landscape. Seven years on, the world's fourth-largest metropolis and South America’s most important city remains free of visual clutter and eye sore that plagues the majority of cities around the world.</p>  <p>When the law was passed, it triggered wild alarm among city businesses and advertisement groups. Critics worried that the advertising ban would entail a revenue loss of $133 million and 20,000 people would lose jobs. Others predicted that the city would look like a bland concrete jungle with the ads removed. </p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-2" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-2" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-TYoPCASlqVo/UepisNtsvEI/AAAAAAAAqhk/elNkMuvwKDY/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-26.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="526"></p>  <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ndecam/6155859365/" rel="nofollow">Photo credit</a></p><p>"I think this city is going to become a sadder, duller place,” said Dalton Silvanom, the lone councilman to vote against the law, and who (unsurprisingly) is in the advertising business. “Advertising is both an art form and, when you're in your car or alone on foot, a form of entertainment that helps relieve solitude and boredom," Silvanom added.</p>  <p>Despite the forebodings, São Paulo’s economy didn’t run aground although the city did look alien and war-torn for a few months following the tear down. The breakneck speed at which the law was enacted caused the city to resemble a battlefield strewn with blank marquees, partially torn-down frames and hastily painted-over storefront facades.</p>  <p>In a survey conducted in 2011 among the city’s 11 million residents, 70 percent found the ban beneficial. Unexpectedly, the removal of logos and slogans exposed previously overlooked architecture, revealing a rich urban beauty that had been long hidden. “My old reference was a big Panasonic billboard,” said Vinicius Galvao, a reporter with Folha de São Paulo, Brazil’s largest newspaper, in an interview with NPR. “But now my reference is an art deco building that was covered [by the massive sign]. So you start getting new references in the city. The city’s now got new language, a new identity.”</p>  <p>Photographer <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonydemarco" rel="nofollow">Tony de Marco</a> documented the transformation the city underwent in 2007 in a sequence of images published on Flickr. </p>  <p>Sao Paulo isn’t the only city to have banned outdoor advertisements. Bans on billboards exist in other parts of the world, such as Vermont, Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine in the US, as well as some 1,500 towns. In Europe, the Norwegian city of Bergen does the same and many others have imposed severe restrictions on billboards or declared no-billboard zones within the city.</p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-4" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-4" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-ZM2pOpipWoU/Uepiu-a9viI/AAAAAAAAqhs/DXZ4oekG5K8/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-42.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-5" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-5" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/-OX_nt4ucheU/UepiybZdBdI/AAAAAAAAqh0/EeLcZCyq6go/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-52.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-6" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-6" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/-Qa4wXnNE_5w/Uepi1x86XZI/AAAAAAAAqh8/UaV1Tj-xkm8/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-62.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-7" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-7" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/-FX6vTTY1s7g/Uepi30VO9JI/AAAAAAAAqiE/A9rEu2PB-sM/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-72.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-8" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-8" src="https://lh4.ggpht.com/-DJg66H-KPDs/UepjMO-lkSI/AAAAAAAAqiU/tWK9RNK3DQo/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-82.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-9" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-9" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/-5VquaBRt4Vc/UepjQbTGZmI/AAAAAAAAqic/9ZulQL7gcMw/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-92.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-10" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-10" src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/-tzgz9EgoWMU/UepjTAWH4HI/AAAAAAAAqik/fXYFWJJp2po/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-102.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-11" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-11" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/-6O3y2DllMlc/Uepj3lswdMI/AAAAAAAAqi0/Fr9XmPNQXMA/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-112.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-12" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-12" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-Pxw2cBLrBKA/Uepj8h96N1I/AAAAAAAAqi8/S9bWMXwQzg4/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-122.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-13" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-13" src="https://lh5.ggpht.com/-_2PgvPxP1Cs/UepkAZPhNzI/AAAAAAAAqjE/XEwdMvJ_q6o/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-132.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p><img title="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-3" alt="sao-paulo-billboard-ban-3" src="https://lh3.ggpht.com/-8ylIbVYwavw/UepkDv9WeII/AAAAAAAAqjM/RC7mBOR6Np8/sao-paulo-billboard-ban-36.jpg?imgmax=800" width="790" height="592"></p>  <p>Sources: <a href="http://www.newdream.org/resources/sao-paolo-ad-ban">Newdream</a>, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-06-18/s-o-paulo-the-city-that-said-no-to-advertisingbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice">Businessweek</a>, <a href="https://www.adbusters.org/magazine/73/Sao_Paulo_A_City_Without_Ads.html">Adbusters</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/9963268">Economist</a></p>  </div>

<p><img alt="MOZILLA" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/mozilla.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Mozilla Firefox 115.0 official builds are now available for this notable update to this open-source web browser while also marking the new Extended Support Release (ESR) series.
</p><p>
Most prominent for Linux users of Firefox 115.0 is Intel graphics video decoding being enabled by default. Mozilla has finally blessed Intel graphics hardware with the open-source VA-API video decode stack to enable that hardware acceleration by default.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=intel-arc-nov&amp;image=intel_arc_0_med"></p>
<p>Also on the video acceleration front with Firefox 115 is now supporting Cisco's OpenH264 plug-in for platforms lacking H.264 video decoding otherwise.
</p><p>
Firefox 115 under Linux also now treats middle clicks on the new tab button as opening the xclipboard contents into the new tab.

</figure><p>Injecting ageing monkeys with a ‘longevity factor’ protein can improve their cognitive function, a study reveals.</p><p>The findings, published on 3 July in <i>Nature Aging</i><sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>, could lead to new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>It is the first time that restoring levels of klotho — a naturally occurring protein that declines in our bodies with age — has been shown to improve cognition in a primate. Previous research on mice had shown that injections of klotho can extend the animals’ lives and increases synaptic plasticity<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> — the capacity to control communication between neurons, at junctions called synapses.</p><p>“Given the close genetic and physiological parallels between primates and humans, this could suggest potential applications for treating human cognitive disorders,” says Marc Busche, a neurologist at the UK Dementia Research Institute group at University College London.</p><p>The protein is named after the Greek goddess Clotho, one of the Fates, who spins the thread of life.</p><h2>Monkey memory tests</h2><p>The study involved testing the cognitive abilities of old rhesus macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>), aged around 22 years on average, before and after a single injection of klotho. To do this, researchers used a behavioural experiment to test for spatial memory: the monkeys had to remember the location of an edible treat, placed in one of several wells by the investigator, after it was hidden from them.</p><p>Study co-author Dena Dubal, a physician-researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, compares the test to recalling where you left your car in a car park, or remembering a sequence of numbers a couple of minutes after hearing it. Such tasks become harder with age.</p><p>The monkeys performed significantly better in these tests after receiving klotho — before the injections they identified the correct wells around 45% of the time, compared with around 60% of the time after injection. The improvement was sustained for at least two weeks. Unlike in previous studies involving mice, relatively low doses of klotho were effective. This adds an element of complexity to the findings, which suggests a more nuanced mode of actions than was previously thought, Busche says.</p><h2>Unclear mechanism</h2><p>It is still unclear exactly how injecting klotho has this effect on cognition or why it lasts this long. Klotho itself cannot cross the barrier from blood to brain, and uncovering its mechanism is a matter of finding what intermediates are involved, explains Dubal. But this study “certainly gives us hope”, she says, “and there’s a very strong reason to jump into human clinical trials now”.</p><p>Gøril Rolfseng Grøntvedt, a neurologist at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim, agrees that further work is needed to answer such questions. Grøntvedt and her team previously found that people with Alzheimer’s who have naturally higher klotho levels tend to experience less cognitive impairment than do those with lower levels<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>.</p><p>This raises the possibility that artificially increasing klotho might have beneficial effects. A better understanding of the protein’s mode of action will be “crucial” for realizing its clinical potential, Grøntvedt says.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2662065692" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-programming" data-authors="Rina Diane Caballar" data-headline="How Coders Can Survive—and Thrive—in a ChatGPT World" data-page-title="How Coders Can Survive—and Thrive—in a ChatGPT World - IEEE Spectrum"><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/" target="_self">Artificial intelligence</a>, particularly generative AI powered by large language models (LLMs), <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-general-intelligence" target="_blank">could upend</a> many <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-code-generation-language-models" target="_self">coders’ livelihoods</a>. But some experts argue that AI won’t replace human programmers—not immediately, at least.</p><p>“You will have to worry about people who are using AI replacing you,” says <a href="https://www.tanishq.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tanishq Mathew Abraham</a>, a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/biomedical/">biomedical</a> engineering at the University of California, Davis and the CEO of medical AI research center <a href="https://medarc.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MedARC</a>.</p><p>So how can software developers make themselves more useful and relevant in what appears to be a coming age of LLM-centered coding? Here are some tips and techniques for coders to survive and thrive in a generative AI world.</p><h2>Stick to Basics and Best Practices</h2><p>While the myriad AI-based coding assistants could help with code completion and code generation, the fundamentals of programming remain: the ability to read and reason about your own and others’ code, and understanding how the code you write fits into a larger system.</p><p>“I believe AI can dramatically increase the productivity of software developers, but there is a lot more to software engineering than just generating code—from eliciting user requirements to debugging, testing, and more,” says <a href="https://hci.seas.harvard.edu/people/priyan-vaithilingam" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Priyan Vaithilingam</a>, a Ph.D. student working in the intersection of human-computer interaction and programming languages at Harvard University’s <a href="https://seas.harvard.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences</a>.</p><p>One of the most integral programming skills continues to be the domain of human coders: problem solving. Analyzing a problem and finding an elegant solution for it is still a highly regarded coding expertise.</p><p>“There’s a creative aspect to it, and a lot of those skills of approaching a problem are more important than the actual language or tools,” says <a href="https://ines.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Ines Montani</a>, a Fellow of the <a href="https://www.python.org/psf/fellows/" target="_blank">Python Software Foundation</a> and cofounder and CEO of <a href="https://explosion.ai/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Explosion</a>, a software company specializing in developer tools for AI and natural-language processing. “Don’t fall into the trap of comparing yourself to the AI, which is more or less a statistical output of a large model. There are differences in what a developer does versus what the model outputs—there’s more to being a developer than just writing arbitrary lines of code.”</p><p>Additionally, good software-engineering practices are proving even more valuable than before. These practices include planning out the system design and software architecture, which serves as a good context for AI-based tools to more effectively predict what code you need next.</p><p>“A human coder is still the one who has to figure out the structure of a piece of code, the right abstractions around which to organize it, and the requirements for different interfaces,” says <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/person/armando-solar-lezama" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Armando Solar-Lezama</a>, an associate director and chief operating officer of MIT’s <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, and who leads the lab’s computer-aided programming group. “All of those are central to software-engineering practice, and they’re not going to go away soon.”</p><h2>Find the Tool That Fits Your Needs</h2><p>Finding the right AI-based tool is essential. Each tool has its own ways to interact with it, and there are different ways to incorporate each tool into your development workflow—whether that’s automating the creation of unit tests, generating test data, or writing documentation.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/features/copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">GitHub Copilot</a> and other AI coding assistants, for instance, can augment programming, offering suggestions as you code. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">ChatGPT</a> and Google’s <a href="https://bard.google.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bard</a>, on the other hand, act more like conversational AI programmers and can be used to answer questions about APIs (application programming interfaces) or generate code snippets.</p><p>The trick is to experiment. Play around with the AI tool, get a feel for how it works, consider the quality of its outputs—but keep an open mind for other tools. “AI is such a fast-moving field. You don’t want to just settle on a tool and then use that for the rest of your life, so you’ll need to adapt quickly to new ones,” Abraham says.</p><p>Think about appropriate use cases as well. Generative AI tools can provide a swift route to learning new programming languages or frameworks, and they can also be a quicker way to kick off small projects and create prototypes.</p><h2>Clear and Precise Conversations Are Key</h2><p>When using AI coding assistants, be detailed about what you need and view it as an iterative process. Abraham proposes writing a comment that explains the code you want so the assistant can generate relevant suggestions that meet your requirements.</p><p>For conversational AI programmers, you’ll need to know the best way to frame your prompts. This is where <a href="https://learnprompting.org/docs/basics/prompting" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prompt engineering</a> comes in.</p><p>One approach Abraham suggests is <a href="https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/cot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">chain-of-thought prompting</a>. This involves a divide-and-conquer strategy where you break down a problem into multiple steps and tackle each one to solve the entire problem. “Asking the model to do too much at a given time can lead to disaster. You want it to be able to work with manageable chunks of information and produce manageable chunks of code,” he says.</p><p>Instead of asking an AI programmer to code an entire program from scratch, for example, consider the different tasks the program is trying to accomplish. Divide those tasks further and ask the model to write specific functions for each. You might need to reason with the model about the steps it needs to take to achieve a task, resulting in a back-and-forth conversation.</p><p>“Treat it almost like a smart intern who knows a lot about a subject but isn’t that experienced,” Abraham says.</p><p>Precision and clarity are vital with prompt engineering. “You need to ask the model very clearly what you want, be very precise about what you’re asking it to do, and make sure you’re following up,” Abraham says.</p><p>It can also be valuable to learn the basic concepts of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> and machine learning, as well as get a sense of how large language models work and their strengths and weaknesses. You don’t need to dive deep, but having some general knowledge can give you important context about the results.</p><p>To help you get started, Abraham recommends the <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAI Cookbook</a>, which has sections on prompting libraries and tools, prompting guides, and video courses, while Vaithilingam suggests reading up on <a href="http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Illustrated Transformer</a> to find out more about models and machine-learning basics.</p><h2>Be Critical and Understand the Risks</h2><p>Software engineers should be <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-software" target="_self">critical of the outputs of large language models</a>, as they tend to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-hallucination" target="_self">hallucinate</a> and produce inaccurate or incorrect code. “It’s easy to get stuck in a debugging rabbit hole when blindly using AI-generated code, and subtle bugs can be difficult to spot,” Vaithilingam says.</p><p>That’s why checking generated code is crucial, though it adds an extra step, which might harm more than help productivity. But Abraham argues that “it’s easier to verify the code than it is to write it from scratch in some cases, and it’s a faster approach to generate and then verify before incorporating into whatever codebase you have.”</p><p>It might be worth putting the outputs of these models into perspective, asking the following questions: What data was this model trained on? What was filtered out and not included in that data? How old is the training data, and what version of a programming language, software package, or library was the model trained on? The answers to these questions could impact the results and provide more context about them.</p><p>Developers should also be wary of entering proprietary code into these models. Some companies, such as <a href="https://www.tabnine.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Tabnine</a>, offer enterprise versions of their AI coding assistants, providing <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-and-data-privacy" target="_self">privacy</a> while still learning an organization’s coding patterns and style.</p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/generative-ai-ip-problem" target="_self">Copyright</a> is another factor to consider, though it’s less of a worry if you’re using these tools to complete a few lines of code or generate code for common or trivial tasks compared to producing bigger chunks of code.</p><p>“Programmers should have some sense of how original what they’re trying to do is and to what extent is it unique to their context,” Solar-Lezama says. “If the model is producing a somewhat original piece of code, it’s important to be suspicious and skeptical before putting that in a production codebase.”</p><p>An even larger issue is security, as these models may generate code containing vulnerabilities. According to Vaithilingam, software-development best practices such as code reviews and strong test pipelines can help safeguard against this risk.</p><p>“One of the things that more experienced software engineers bring to the table is the awareness of the most common vulnerabilities in code and the most common ways in which code can be made vulnerable,” says Solar-Lezama. “They build this intuition about what to pay attention to and what raises red flags. Moving forward, these kinds of techniques are going to become more important parts of the software engineering mix.”</p><p>For programmers to survive in a generative AI world, they’ll need to embrace AI as a tool and incorporate AI into their workflow while recognizing the opportunities and limitations of these tools—and still relying on their human coding capabilities to thrive.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Recently, a proposed class action lawsuit was <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/06/28/tech/openai-chatgpt-microsoft-data-sued/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:3;pos:1;itc:0">filed against OpenAI</a>, accusing it of scraping "massive amounts of personal data from the internet," including "stolen private information," to train its GPT models without prior consent. As <a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-updates-privacy-policy-to-collect-public-data-for-ai-training/490715/#close" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:4;pos:1;itc:0"><em>Search Engine Journal</em></a> notes, we'll likely see plenty of similar lawsuits in the future as more companies develop their own generative AI products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners of websites that could be considered public squares in the digital age have also taken steps to either prevent or profit from the generative AI boom. Reddit has started charging for access to its API, leading third-party clients to <a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/apollo-and-other-popular-third-party-reddit-apps-have-shut-down-123149140.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0">shut down</a> over the weekend. Meanwhile, Twitter <a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-puts-strict-cap-on-how-many-tweets-users-can-read-each-day-182623928.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0">put a restriction</a> on how many tweets a user sees per day to "address extreme levels of data scraping [and] system manipulation."</p></div></div>]]></description>

I’m an engineer and product manager, like many of you. In 2013, I landed my first job in Big Tech (at Google), and my career took off. Over the next 10 years, I moved into management and leadership roles, where I learned about how the sausage is made when it comes to interviews, offers, and talent assessments. Now, I’m a chief product officer, and&nbsp;I moonlight as a career coach to help people unlock outsized career opportunities.</p><p>My goal in sharing this Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP) process is to arm you with the employer and interviewer perspective so that you can build confidence in your job search. I’m passionate about helping people with job searching because I know how much the right role can set you up for success in your career and financial life.</p><p>First rounds are designed to filter out candidates who are unlikely to be a contender for an offer.</p><p><span>Interviews are</span><em> very</em><span> expensive for employers (time, coordination, resources, opportunity cost). The singular goal of a first-round interview (from the employer’s perspective) is to determine if they want to invest in additional interviews with that candidate.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png" width="1408" height="1056" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1056,&quot;width&quot;:1408,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:183898,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe24a39eb-70f0-4521-8536-7fc73f709c48_1408x1056.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>By the time you get to a first-round interview, you likely have already:</p><ul><li><p>Applied or been referred by an employee</p></li><li><p>Spoken to a recruiter or HR representative (phone screen)</p></li></ul><p>If you pass a first-round interview, the next step is often second rounds (another single interview), or even final-round interviews (three to six interviews back-to-back in one day or split over two days).</p><p><strong>Most first-round interviews in tech are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>30 minutes to 1 hour</p></li><li><p>on the phone or via video chat</p></li><li><p>with just one interviewer (not panel-style)</p></li><li><p>conducted by a hiring manager, peer, or another person familiar with the role</p></li></ul><p><strong>The standard time breakdown is typically:</strong></p><ul><li><p>10% intro</p></li><li><p>70% questions from the interviewer</p></li><li><p>20% questions from the candidate</p></li></ul><p><strong>For a 45-minute interview, this looks like:</strong></p><ul><li><p>3-5 minutes intros</p></li><li><p>35 minutes questions from the interviewer</p></li><li><p>5-7 minutes questions from the candidate</p></li></ul><p><strong>Most first-round interviews stick to behavioral questions</strong><span>, i.e. questions that ask you about your own experiences, like</span><em> “Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a colleague.”</em></p><p><strong>Generally, the first-round interview scope isn’t comprehensive.</strong><span> Employers aren’t going to be able to fully assess your fit for the role/team/company in less than 60 minutes!&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Note: It’s a bit of a hot take, but I advise people to run if a company gives you an offer at this stage. (Just imagine how undiscerning they will have been with your future peers as well!)&nbsp;</em></p><p>On-the-spot offers in tech are rare, but all of us who build products know that systems fail at the edge cases—few of you will get an offer in your first or second interview (and this is a good thing), but my advice is to walk away (or at least ask a lot of questions) if you get an offer on the spot.</p><p><strong>Common first-round interview question themes:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Your resume and online content (including expertise posts and thought leadership)</p></li><li><p>1-2 core competencies for the role (usually the P0s, not the P2s and P3s)</p></li><li><p><span>Culture fit (these can be direct questions, e.g. “</span><em>Describe your ideal team culture,” </em><span>or indirect assessments based on your behavior, mannerisms, or speech: what you say and how you say it)</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>Special cases</strong></p><p><em>Are you a software engineer or data scientist? </em><span>Your first-round interview will likely be a technical screen (coding or system design or experimental design). Note that the way you problem-solve and communicate are assessed, not just whether you arrive at a working solution!</span></p><p><em>Are you a PM?</em><span> Your first-round interview will likely focus more on product design, product sense/execution, and data analysis or estimation questions (PM core competencies).</span></p><p>It’s time to talk about tactics for interview preparation.&nbsp;</p><p>Now is a good time to introduce Minimum Viable Interview Prep (MVIP). Below is a quick summary of the approach, with links to dive deeper before your next interview.</p><p><strong>Know your digital footprint</strong></p><p>Anything and everything on the open web is fair game for an employer or interviewer to read and bring up in your interviews. This includes LinkedIn posts, Medium or Substack articles, GitHub, tweets, old blog posts, quotes in newspaper articles, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>A useful to-do list:</p><ol><li><p>Know what’s out there (about you or authored by you)</p></li><li><p>Assess whether it fits how you’d like to present yourself</p></li><li><p>Modify as needed to represent yourself as you’d prefer</p></li></ol><p>For example: If I were looking for a data science role, I’d want to spend a few hours organizing the Python code in my public machine learning GitHub repo. It was written under timeline duress (!) and needs some refactoring so I can put my best foot forward if someone skims the code.</p><p><strong>Know your (strategic and compelling) reasons for wanting this role</strong></p><p>When you go for an interview, you should assume the company is assessing at least two to four other people for the role. Like any competition, you want to get out front quickly and take the lead. One way to do this is to be clear and concise about why you want this job.</p><p>Generally, avoid reasons that revolve around work hygiene or professional conveniences, e.g. compensation, short commute, remote work. This advice may seem obvious, but yes, people bring these up often. Don’t be one of them.</p><p>Avoid reasons that sound like complaints about your current or past employer, e.g. “better company,” “smarter colleagues,” “kinder boss,” “escaping a toxic culture.”</p><p>Stick to reasons that:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><p>convey what you bring to the role (the compelling ones for the employer)</p></li><li><p>explain how this role will accelerate your career (the strategic reasons)</p></li></ol><p><span>You don’t need 10 reasons. One single, decisive reason will do: </span><em>“I’ve spent eight years building large-scale, distributed systems for products used by about 100 million users. An exciting and progressive step for me would be to build similar technologies for the billion-user scale.”</em></p><p><strong>Know the role (map it)</strong></p><p>One of the oldest sales tricks in the book is a tactic called “mirroring.” It’s a psychological concept that involves physically and verbally doing what the other person is doing. People are comfortable with their own mannerisms. When you mirror them, you make them comfortable and subconsciously make them feel you are like them.</p><p><span>You can use mirroring in your interview process. How? Use </span><em>their</em><span> language when describing </span><em>your</em><span> experiences.</span></p><p><strong>How to do this (interview pre-work)</strong></p><ol><li><p>Paste the job description into a doc, then highlight keywords and concepts.</p></li><li><p><span>Put the keywords into a table (one row per keyword or concept). Then add a column to the right. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16rMkstp5LsN99TEGALCBE4_bM7KqxpOW35swrIRzyD8/copy" rel="">Here’s a template to get you started</a><span>.</span></p></li><li><p>In the right column, write down parts of your experience that map to that concept.</p></li><li><p>Read this before your interview.</p></li><li><p>In the interview, when you talk about your experience (right column), use their language (left column) to explain what you did.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Example:</strong></p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Yet there’s more to it…</p><p>Behavioral interview questions were invented 50 years ago, in the 1970s. Studies quickly found that these questions were 55% more effective at predicting on-the-job performance than the prevailing interview questions at the time. They took the business world by storm and became the de facto interview technique. Today, they are used extensively in tech interviews (by my estimate, more than 60% of interview questions are behavioral). Amazon actually sends candidates a STAR primer before their interviews!</p><p><span>But it’s been half a century, and behavioral question formats </span><em>have</em><strong> </strong><span>evolved. Your approach to answering them needs to evolve too.</span></p><p>In tech, I see 3 main formats for behavioral questions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Pure </strong><span>— “Tell me about a time when…”&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Situational </strong><span>— “Put yourself in this situation; what would you do?”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Theoretical </strong><span>— “What’s your general approach to doing X?”</span></p></li></ol><p><span>All of them ask what you </span><strong>have done</strong><span> or what you </span><strong>would do </strong><span>(in a situation) or what you </span><strong>generally do</strong><span>, to extrapolate and predict on-the-job performance. To interview effectively in tech today, you need to know how to answer each of these questions.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Below is a primer you can use to answer each type of behavioral interview question.</p><p><strong>Why they ask: </strong><span>Understanding how you’ve behaved in the past can be used to extrapolate how you might perform in this role</span></p><p><strong>What they ask: </strong><span>Share a specific career experience from the past</span></p><p><strong>How to respond:</strong><span> Start with</span><strong> </strong><span>STAR, then add two improvements.

One of the TPMs on the team was chatty and often made other team members late to meetings or distracted with their work. Their intent was to build relationships at work, but the reality was that other team members got distracted, anxious, and even stressed by my team member’s chattiness.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Actions:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I came up with a plan, first by clearly identifying the behavior that needed to change. Because the problem was caused by a personality trait, it was important to isolate the specific problem being caused and the specific action that needed to change. In this case, it was having personal chats with colleagues during core work hours.</em></p><p><em>Next, I needed to plan the messaging, to avoid making the person feel attacked or defensive. I decided to express the problem in terms of how it impacted both their project success and their teammate’s stress levels. Then, I planned some alignment questions to ensure we were in agreement on the problem, the change that needed to happen, and how we were going to hold ourselves accountable to measure success and check in.</em></p><p><em>Then, I had the conversation with the team member.”</em></p></blockquote><p>Results:</p><blockquote><p><em>“The team member immediately acknowledged the issue, since they knew themselves to be chatty, and thanked me for bringing the impacts (to others) to their attention. We aligned quickly on a plan to check in monthly, and the team member agreed to let me periodically probe the team to ensure that the change was taking place.</em></p><p><em>Within two months, the issue was resolved. Team members felt less stressed, more focused, and more confident in the team dynamics. My team member continued to connect with colleagues at lunch and after work hours, to build meaningful relationships (which was their personality).

Half of the battle is preparing well and showing up to answer </span><em>the interviewer’s</em><strong> </strong><span>questions; the other half is asking </span><em>them</em><strong> </strong><span>questions that get them thinking (and make you stand out).</span></p><p>We all want to work with exceptional colleagues who work hard, get things done, and push us to greater heights.

You need to get them thinking (in a good way).</p><p>Formulate questions that are interesting and thoughtful, and you’ll end the interview on a high note and possibly put yourself in the lead.</p><p>3 steps to formulating great questions for interviewers:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Define the signals you need (to determine if you want the role). </strong><span>Bring questions whose answers are actually important to you. Anyone can grab a question from a listicle. Only you can ask questions that will answer your open questions about the role.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Do your research. </strong><span>On the industry, company, competitive landscape, team/product, and even the interviewers. Look for trends, competitive landscape changes, and news. You can find these on consulting firm dossiers, VC thought-leadership white papers, the company’s website, Yahoo Finance, and competitive landscape engines like G2 and Capterra.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Formulate questions</strong><span> that highlight that you’ve done your homework and that give you the signal you want.</span></p></li></ol><p>You can do this in an hour or two, and it’s well worth the investment. You can even reuse some of these “first-round” questions in later interviews to get diverse perspectives from the full panel.</p><p>An example of a high-signal question that one of my coaching clients

      <div><p>Children will soon be prevented from bringing mobile phones into Dutch classrooms. Sources close to the Cabinet confirmed that schools will have until October 1 figure out how they can arrange the restriction on their own. If that fails, national rules may be introduced to restrict the use of telephones in schools.</p>

<p>Unnamed sources also confirmed the story to ANP, after it was first reported by AD and RTL Nieuws.</p>

<p>Smartphones may still be used if they are needed for class, or if there is a medical need. One example of the latter is if a student with diabetes needs to measure sugar levels.</p>

<p>Schools and teachers have been asking for rules to restrict the use of mobile phones in the classroom for some time. The debate about this issue gained momentum at the end of last year when CDA Member of Parliament René Peters advocated on behalf of a ban. The largest opposition party in the Tweede Kamer, PVV, has been outspoken in favor of a ban for an extended period, and has joined forces with the CDA, a coalition party.</p>

<p>Initially, the plea from the CDA and PVV was warmly received in the Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Parliament, with a degree of support from two other coalition parties. These include Prime Minister Mark Rutte's VVD, and the smallest party in the coalition, ChristenUnie. However, former Education Minister Dennis Wiersma and the two parties thought it was better for the schools themselves to set limits in this regard.</p>

<p>Gradually, the number of supporters seemed to increase. A large group of teachers appeared to support the proposal, teachers union AOb announced after commissioning a poll.</p>

<p>Due to persistent signals from teachers that they are unable to keep smartphones out of the classroom on their own, Wiersma left the door open at the beginning of this year to examine the policy. He promised discuss the issue with schools and said he would be open to a ban if there was a great need for it.</p></div>

  6/23/2000 - <b>Lack of Updates</b><br>
  Sorry about the lack of updates since early May.  May and June have been extremely busy for me, and I haven't been able to give the site the attention it needs and deserves.  I am doing some minor list updates, and have been redesigning the site to make it a little easier to navigate.  This isn't my best design work, I promise.  I made the site like this as function over form to start.  I am gathering contact people for the first petition email.  I have been talking with the people at Sendmail, Inc, and that have been interested in seeing what you folks have to say about their decision to only support Red Hat.  I saw something funny yesterday... Dell's online ordering system will let you buy "Linux 6.2"...  I was thinking this must be some new distribution or maybe they got the kernel version wrong, but then a light went off... Silly me, they meant Red Hat 6.2!  Doh!<p>
  5/2/2000 - <b>Minor Updates</b><br>
  I have added a few companies to the various lists, made some spelling corrections, and added the Petition Distribution Breakdown.  Thanks to everyone who has sent emails concerning corrections, suggestions, opinions, etc... Keep them coming.  I will be doing some major updates in the near future.</p><p>
  4/28/2000 - <b>Update #2</b><br>
  Thanks to Tim Riker for pointing out that RPM is not RedHat Package Manager but rather RPM Package Manager.  Seems a bit recursive if you ask me ;-) But on the official <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://www.rpm.org/RPM-HOWTO/index.html#INTRO" target="_new">RPM FAQ</a> It does list it as such.  Seems like traffic is dying down a little.  I guess it's a good thing, in that we'll have less people trying to be distruptive.  I have about 5-10 vendors to update, and hope to do so this weekend.  Thanks for stopping by.</p><p>
  4/28/2000 - <b>Heavy Traffic and more</b><br> 
  As you can imagine with over 30,000 people visiting us in the last 12 hours, we have gotten a log of email.  If you have sent us mail, and you haven't gotten a reply, we will do our best to reply to all the emails sent.  From what we have read, there have been some very good suggestions, additions to our list, and outright anger to to what we're doing.  A lot of email has been sent about VA Linux, and our placing them on the Red Hat only list.  I know they support the development of Debian and run Debian on their web server, but when you buy something through their web site, currently you can only get Red Hat.  I have a call in to them to confirm that we're not just blind and not seeing other distributions.  Thank you for your zeal in response to our efforts.  On a more disappointing side, someone thought it would be cute to write a program to continually vote for their favourite distribution, which is why the poll went away.  Please check back often as we are updating the page through out the day.</p><p>
  4/27/2000 (5:00pm Update) - <b>We've been /.'ed</b><br>Well we have just been posted on Slashdot, and from the comments I am seeing, I only ask that you Read before you Roast, as it seems many don't understand the context of the domain name, and the name of our Effort.</p><p>
  4/27/2000 - <b>Linux.Com, Geeknews.org Report on RedHatIsNotLinux.org</b><br>Thanks to Linux.com and Geeknews.org for reporting on our efforts here.  I think it shows a true effort to show journalistic integrity on the part of Linux.com to list us, as VA is on our Red Hat Only List.  Kudos to them!</p><p>
  4/18/2000 - <b>redhatisnotlinux.org seeks volunteers</b><br>We are currently looking for volunteers to help compile our different lists.  If you are interested in helping us out, please let us know at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/mailto:info@redhatisnotlinux.org">info@redhatisnotlinux.org</a>.</p><p>
  4/16/2000 - <b>redhatisnotlinux.org goes live</b><br>In an attempt to gain support for other distributions of GNU/Linux, redhatisnotlinux.org is established.  We're currently filling out our database of products that support Linux, both distribution specific and distribution non-specific.  It is our hope to show the disproportionate amount of support for Red Hat over ALL other Distributions.  If you find any errors on this site, please report them to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/mailto:info@redhatisnotlinux.org">info@redhatisnotlinux.org</a>.  Please not our purpose is to point out commercial support.  We are well aware of the community activity focused around other distributions.

  <u><b><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></b></u></p><blockquote>
  <b>If this is not an Anti-Red Hat Linux site, what is it?</b><br>
  This is an attempt to call attention to the fact that companies who are writing commercial applications for Linux are ignoring part of the professional GNU/Linux community, which does not use Red Hat Linux.<p>
  <b>What do you mean "Red Hat Is Not Linux"</b><br>
  The easiest way to explain this is to create some definitions or premises, and then come up with a result:</p><p>
  Linux, as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://everything.slashdot.org/everything.pl?sid=&amp;lastnode=&amp;node=linux">defined</a> by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://cmdrtaco.net/">CmdrTaco</a> of Slashdot is: 
 "the GNU license operating system created by Linus Torvalds and the rest of the internet. Unix-like and free, it powers power systems maintained by power users."</p><p>  
  Linux as we define it is the kernel of the GNU/Linux OS and various Distributions.</p><p>
  A Distribution of the GNU/Linux OS, of which Red Hat is one (and the most popular in the media), is the packaging of the Linux kernel, utilities, and programs to make a usable operating system, which can be installed on any number of computers.</p><p>
  This is how we first of all derive that 1) Red Hat != GNU/Linux, and 2) Red Hat is a Distribution of GNU/Linux.</p><p>
  Because of the fragementation of commands, security methodologies, package management, and file layouts among distributions, we feel it is not in the best interest of GNU/Linux to consider one Distribution, and its way of doing things as "Linux."</p><p>
  <b>What do you hope to accomplish by this?</b><br>
  Better support by commercial vendors for GNU/Linux, not just Red Hat Linux and support for GNU/Linux hardware platforms other than Intel based chipsets (PPC, Alpha, etc).</p><p>
  <b>Why do you think that commercial vendors ignore GNU/Linux?</b><br>
  A majority of applications being written today are not distribution independent.  Not only are companies developing solely for Red Hat Linux, they are not aware that other distributions exist.</p><p>
  <b>I'm not convinced, but how do you expect your goals to be accomplished?</b><br>
  Our main goal is to point out incompatibilities between distributions, as well as to provide a petition facility for non-Red Hat users to voice their distress with the continued trend of software that only supports Red Hat.  By doing so, we hope that enough attention can be created for our cause that commercial vendors would consider support for Linux as a whole, not just Red Hat Linux, including all major distributions and binary platforms (x86, PPC, Alpha, etc).
  </p><p><b>What's With This GNU/Linux Stuff Anyway?</b><br>
  There is a political issue in the Linux community as to the relevance of GNU to Linux.  Our position is that without GNU and their tools such as GCC, Linux would not be a mainstream operating system.  We feel that indeed GNU has done more for Linux than Red Hat has, as I am sure Red Hat themselves would admit.  We refer to GNU/Linux in respect to the importance and impact GNU has on Linux.

 <li>Outsourcing Technical Support to Organizations like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://www.linuxcare.com/">LinuxCare</a></li>
 <li>Providing non-distribution specific binary releases (glibc-2.0, shadow passwords, glibc-2.1, shadow passwords, glibc-2.0 PAM, glibc-2.1 PAM) - C2Net does an excellent job of this with their distributions of Stronghold.
 </li><li>Provide RPM, DEB, and  Tarball distribution of Binary Applications.</li>
 <li>Create a Media Awareness kit to avoid sterotyping of different distributions as "LINUX."  We would be happy to spearhead this, but would love some help in creating it from professional writers and media people.</li>
 <li>VA Linux, or another company with the same ability, should setup a commercial server farm of different distributions, similar to VA's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000815063125/http://www.valinux.com/about/news/releases/030700.html" target="_new">SourceForge<sup>TM</sup> CompileFarm</a>, for comercial entities to build binary distributions for ALL MAJOR Linux distributions.</li>

Most modern concrete is a mix of Portland cement and aggregates—materials such as sand or crushed stone that are not intended to chemically react over time. Roman concrete was made from volcanic ash, lime (calcium oxide), and seawater. <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/learning-from-roman-concrete/">Previous ALS studies</a> showed that the lime, upon exposure to seawater, reacted with the volcanic ash to produce aluminous tobermorite (Al-tobermorite), a layered mineral that forms fine fibers and plates.</p>
<p>To better understand the longer-term chemical processes in the concrete, researchers studied samples from ancient pier and breakwater sites using a variety of techniques, including electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. At ALS <a href="https://als.lbl.gov/beamlines/12-3-2/">Beamline 12.3.2</a>, they used x-ray microdiffraction to trace the complex sequences of crystal growth at the micron scale. The results indicate that Al-tobermorite and a related zeolite mineral called phillipsite continue to form over millennia as seawater percolates through the massive structures, reinforcing the cementing matrix in a kind of regenerative process that strengthens the concrete.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest that a reformulated recipe for Roman concrete could be tested for applications such as seawalls and other ocean-facing structures, and may be useful for safeguarding hazardous wastes, since Al-tobermorite has special cation-exchange properties. The work ultimately could lead to a wider adoption of concrete manufacturing techniques with less environmental impact than modern cement manufacturing processes, which require high-temperature kilns. These are a significant contributor to industrial carbon dioxide emissions, which add to the buildup of greenhouse gases in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

</p>
<p>I've spent too much of my professional life trying to build a better means of authentication.</p>
<p>For a while I was fixated on Magic Links, then I built a few prototypes of authentication using a combination of token passing and TOTP. And finally, I built a storage-less password manager (another story for another day). When proposals for systems like WebAuthn or Apple Passkeys were published I got excited. To see the world move away from the dated and insecure email/password combo would have really made my day.</p>
<p>But after a while I lost my fervour. There was a lack of implementation of these strong password-less authentication methods across web-services and apps. There was no transition. Also, my opinions around authentication changed...somewhat.</p>
<p>I had an article pop up on my feed recently titled "<a href="https://sec.okta.com/articles/2020/04/webauthn-great-and-it-sucks" target="_blank">WebAuthn is great and it sucks</a>" which describes the problem succinctly. While the tech is great, the problem is that nothing supports these new-fangled methods of authentication. I've run into a few other problems as well:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multi-devicing for authentication is a poor user experience. Even having to go click a link in your mailbox sucks.</li>
<li>People don't have their phone on them all the time (and some don't even have a smartphone).</li>
<li>New users don't understand these methods of authentication.</li>
<li>They're generally much more complicated to implement than a basic email/password combo.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>As a side note, I'm not a fan of single sign-on using Twitter/Google/Facebook due to the inability to migrate to a different service if need be. If Twitter locks you out of your account you're locked out of all your connected services as well. This is a broader topic, but I just wanted to touch on it before continuing.</em></p>
<p>Passwords are simple and affordable. We were using them prior to computers ("Open sesame!") and their understandability transferred easily. "But wait!" you say. "Aren't passwords insecure and easy to compromise?". Well yes...if managed poorly.</p>
<h4 id="let-s-explore-the-common-pitfalls-of-passwords">Let's explore the common pitfalls of passwords:</h4>
<ol>
<li>People can't remember passwords for their dozens of services.</li>
<li>Due to #1 people tend to re-use passwords, which makes one compromised service a more wide-spread problem.</li>
<li>People can have their passwords stolen (generally also due to #1 since they write them down or store them insecurely).</li>
<li>Services can have their user's passwords stolen if not stored as a hash (this is a solved problem though, services need to do better).</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that all of these problems are solved by fairly simple password hygiene.</p>
<p>I personally have one obnoxiously long and complicated password for my password manager, but then all of my other passwords are random lengthly strings which are impossible to guess.</p>
<p>I don't ever see them.</p>
<p>The passwords also aren't re-used, which solves #2 and my login flow is a super convenient fingerprint scan on both my phone and my laptop. And if I have to manually enter my password on a different device (which is very rare) I can easily pull up my password on my password manager and type it in.</p>
<p>Not only does a good password manager make people safer, it makes logins much easier since you don't have to remember "which password I used for this service", then follow the "forgot password" flow.</p>
<p>I guess the point I'm trying to make here is that the problem with passwords is password hygiene, not with the method itself.</p>
<p>When ebola was wreaking havoc in Central Africa the most effective intervention was to implement a culture of hand-washing. The UN send healthcare workers out to cities, towns and villages armed with plastic basins and soap, but most importantly, knowledge. It was an effective intervention and the culture of hand-washing persists to this day.</p>
<p>Password hygiene is imperative for our digital world. Fact is that even if we create the perfect new authentication method, passwords will persist on the vast majority of services. If it ain't broke...</p>
<p>Finally, when sharing passwords, it is important to do so securely. Slack is not a secure channel for these kinds of things. I've <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/thinking-about-passwords/" target="_blank">written</a> about this before and built out a completely free <a href="https://horuspass.com/send/" target="_blank">service</a> to share passwords and API keys securely, but any good password manager should have similar functionality.</p>
<h4 id="recommendation-time">Recommendation time:</h4>
<p>If you're an Apple user, then the built in Apple password manager is probably the best solution for you. It's close to perfect since it allows biometric authentication, syncs between your devices, and is well integrated into their products.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are also a bunch of great apps that have similar functionality. <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a> is a good choice. So is <a href="https://www.dashlane.com/" target="_blank">Dashlane</a>. There are others.</p>
<p>Good passwords combined with an authentication app for 2FA like <a href="https://authy.com/" target="_blank">Authy</a> or Google Authenticator are great security. You'll probably never have an issue. On this note, SMS 2FA is bad. Not only are SIM-swap scams prevalent and fairly easy to execute, but it is also a fragile system and breaks easily ("Didn't receive the SMS? Click here to retry.").</p>
<p>On top of that, SMS isn't universal. My bank only supports SMS 2FA so while I'm travelling I'm effectively cut off from certain functionality. I hate it and have tried to change it, but banks move slowly.</p>
<p>It's important for us to get this right. If you have parents (or grandparents) who aren't particularly tech-savvy, sit them down for an afternoon and teach them about password hygiene. Let's create a better authentication culture. It will keep everyone safer.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Every week there seems to be another cynical implementation of AI that devalues the human experience so it is with a breath of fresh air that we report on a bedroom venture that uses GPT-4 technology to frustrate telemarketers.</p>
<p>"Fight back against annoying telemarketers and evil scammers!" the Jolly Roger Telephone Company rails on its <a target="_blank" href="https://jollyrogertelephone.com/">website</a>. "Our robots talk to telemarketers so humans don't have to!"</p>
<p>While no one can put a price on slamming the phone down on a call center worker, some among us might get a perverse joy out of listening to them squirm under the non sequiturs of AI. And it seems to be working for Jolly Roger, which has thousands of customers subscribed for $23.80 a year.</p>

    

<p>The company has a <a target="_blank" href="https://jollyrogertelephone.com/our-robots/">number of bots</a> at its disposal all with unique voices and quirks that makes them utterly infuriating to speak to from the original Jolly Roger, based on the voice of Californian founder Roger Anderson, to distracted mother Salty Sally, who keeps wanting to talk about a talent show she won, to feisty senior citizen Whitey Whitebeard and more. Samples of toe-curling conversations are all over Jolly Roger's website.</p>

        


        

<p>"Oh jeez, hang on, there's a bee on me, hang on," Jolly Roger tells one scammer. "There's a bee on my arm. OK, you know what? You keep talking, I'm not gonna talk, though. You keep talking, say that part again, and I'm just gonna stay quiet because of the bee."</p>

</ul>
<p>Sprinkle in gratuitous salvos of "Suuuure" and "Mhm" and "Sorry, I was having trouble concentrating because you're EXACTLY like somebody I went to high school with so, sorry, say that part again." Five minutes later you have a cold caller pulling their hair out and hanging up.</p>
<p>Here's Salty Sally in action:</p>

</p>

            <h2>Companies must stop using Google Analytics </h2>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has audited how four companies use Google Analytics for web statistics. IMY issues administrative fines against two of the companies. One of the companies has recently stopped using the statistics tool on its own initiative, while IMY orders the other three to also stop using it.
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>IMY has audited how four companies transfer personal data to the US via Google Analytics, which is a tool for measuring and analysing traffic on websites. The companies audited are CDON, Coop, Dagens Industri and Tele2. The audits concerns a version of Google Analytics from 14th of August 2020.</p>
<p>The audits are based on complaints from the organisation None of Your Business (NOYB) in the light of the Schrems II ruling by the European Court of Justice (CJEU). The complaints allege that the companies, in violation of the law, transfer personal data to the United States.</p>
<p>According to the data protection regulation, GDPR, personal data may be transferred to third countries, i.e. countries outside the EU/EEA, if the European Commission has decided that the country in question has an adequate level of protection for personal data that corresponds to that within the EU/EEA. However, the CJEU ruled through the Schrems II ruling that the United States could not be considered to have such an adequate level of protection at the time of the ruling.</p>
<p>In its audits, IMY considers that the data transferred to the US via Google's statistics tool is personal data because the data can be linked with other unique data that is transferred. The authority also concludes that the technical security measures that the companies have taken are not sufficient to ensure a level of protection that essentially corresponds to that guaranteed within the EU/EEA.</p>
<p>– By the fact that IMY has decided on these cases at the same time, it is made clear what requirements are placed on technical security measures and other measures when transferring personal data to a third country, in this case the United States, says legal advisor Sandra Arvidsson, who led the audits of the companies.</p>
<p>If there is no decision on an adequate level of protection by the European Commission, data may be transferred based on standard contractual clauses that the European Commission has decided on. However, according to the CJEU, such standard contractual clauses may need to be supplemented with additional safeguards if it is necessary for the protection that the clauses are intended to provide to be maintained in practice.</p>
<p>All four companies have based their decisions on the transfer of personal data via Google Analytics on standard contractual clauses. From IMY's audits, it appears that none of the companies' additional technical security measures are sufficient. IMY issues an administrative fine of 12 million SEK against Tele2 and 300,000 SEK against CDON, which has not taken the same extensive protective measures as Coop and Dagens Industri. Tele2 has recently stopped using the statistics tool on its own initiative. IMY orders the other three companies to stop using the tool.</p>
<p>– These decisions have implications not only for these four companies, but can also provide guidance for other organisations that use Google Analytics, says Sandra Arvidsson.</p>

Sorry for the delay, the reasons for which were expressed in previous

<br>(<a href="https://groups.google.com/g/libjpeg-turbo-announce/c/zXCK0qw1pIE/m/yMLo__OuAAAJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://groups.google.com/g/libjpeg-turbo-announce/c/zXCK0qw1pIE/m/yMLo__OuAAAJ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1688565604347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw27CfQu_N8aKruqGkcsHDTs">https://groups.google.com/g/libjpeg-turbo-announce/c/zXCK0qw1pIE/m/yMLo__OuAAAJ</a>). 
<br>  SignPath is still having issues with their upstream CA, so the Windows 
<br>installers for libjpeg-turbo 3.0.0 are temporarily unsigned until those 
<br>issues can be resolved.  Ultimately, however, the delay produced a more 
<br>stable 3.0.0 release, since most of the bug reports against 3.0 beta 
<br>were filed after the beta cycle was supposed to have ended.
</p><p>
On that subject, I want to remind everyone that, while I do my best to 
<br>maintain this project with the highest possible quality standards and 
<br>using industry best practices, I cannot test for every possible usage 
<br>scenario.  The three-month beta testing phase is intended to allow the 
<br>community ample time to thoroughly test a new release series.  *Please* 
<br>use that time to test the new release series rather than waiting until 
<br>after the .0 release!
</p><p>
Why there may never be a libjpeg-turbo 3.1
<br>------------------------------------------
</p><p>
I will continue to fix bugs in libjpeg-turbo and issue bug-fix releases 
<br>in the 3.0.x release series, but there will not be a libjpeg-turbo 3.1 
<br>release series *unless* this project can secure more general funding. 
<br>As it stands, libjpeg-turbo only has general funding for about 8-10 
<br>hours of labor per month.  Finishing the 3.0 beta release required 
<br>borrowing against all expected general funding for 2023, and fixing all 
<br>of the 3.0 post-beta bugs required borrowing against all expected 
<br>general funding through September of 2024.  If things continue apace, 
<br>then libjpeg-turbo is effectively in "maintenance mode".  That means 
<br>that no new features (even minor ones) can be considered, and tech 
<br>support will be limited, for at least the next 15 months.
</p><p>
I maintain three open source projects for a living.  Those projects have 
<br>saved companies many millions of dollars in labor and IT costs, but I 
<br>take home less pay than that of a typical starting teacher.  (For those 
<br>outside of the U.S., a starting teacher's salary is a rhetorical 
<br>benchmark for very low pay.  We criminally underfund education here just 
<br>like we criminally underfund open source development.)  What I earn 
<br>through independent open source development is about 20-25% of what my 
<br>skills would be worth to a corporate employer, and I have turned down 
<br>numerous offers from such employers over the years in order to continue 
<br>working on these OSS projects full-time.  I don't expect to get rich 
<br>from open source development, but it is also unfair for organizations to 
<br>profit handsomely from my work while I am expected to do that work for free.
</p><p>
Because the majority of my income is from VirtualGL and TurboVNC, 
<br>uncompensated labor on libjpeg-turbo forces me to steal time away from 
<br>those more lucrative projects.  Thus, I simply can't eat labor cost on 
<br>libjpeg-turbo anymore.  (I ate hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth 
<br>of it from 2010-2018, but when the libjpeg-turbo 2.0 release caused me 
<br>to go into debt in 2018, I had to stop.)  However, major releases still 
<br>require a lot of general labor.  Because the project is so high-profile 
<br>(used by literally billions of people every day through major web 
<br>browsers, operating systems, and image viewers/editors) and is an 
<br>ISO/ITU-T reference implementation, it undergoes intense scrutiny. 
<br>Unfortunately, that scrutiny typically lags the development of new 
<br>features by enough time that specific funding is no longer available to 
<br>fix unanticipated bugs in the new features.  Thus, it has become 
<br>increasingly difficult to estimate the labor costs of new features 
<br>upfront.  In order to adequately cushion against unforeseen bugs, I 
<br>would have to grossly overestimate every new feature to the point that 
<br>no one would be willing to fund the feature.  Instead, I have had to 
<br>accept the risk of unforeseen bugs in order to keep libjpeg-turbo moving 
<br>forward, and that has forced me to perform many hours of general labor 
<br>on the run-up to every new release series.  The companies that have 
<br>partially (but unfortunately not fully) funded each new release series 
<br>have pressured me to put out the .0 releases in a timely manner, so that 
<br>has left me with no choice but to borrow against expected future 
<br>funding.  Specific to 3.0, I had to spend more than 70 uncompensated 
<br>hours fixing bugs discovered in the beta release.  Most of those hours 
<br>were spent fixing bugs in the lossless JPEG feature, but I also spent a 
<br>significant amount of time fixing bugs in the partial image 
<br>decompression and RGB565 features (both of which were integrated to 
<br>support Android and both of which have required me to eat the cost of 
<br>bug fixes or beg for money a handful of times since they were integrated.)
</p><p>
This project has only been kept alive because of the libjpeg-turbo 
<br>General Fund, which is funded by Cendio AB and Crimson Vista and your ad 
<br>hoc donations, as well as a few large ad hoc donations from Google. 
<br>However, the current General Fund is only enough to pay for general 
<br>project maintenance and support.  To keep libjpeg-turbo moving forward 
<br>in any meaningful way, including providing community support, 
<br>integrating or implementing minor features, supporting popular new 
<br>platforms, etc. requires more general funding.  To keep libjpeg-turbo 
<br>moving forward in a more proactive/progressive way, including expanding 
<br>the coverage of the JPEG spec (3.0 essentially expands our coverage of 
<br>the JPEG spec by a factor of five), expanding SIMD coverage to new 
<br>algorithms or instruction sets or CPU architectures, supporting less 
<br>popular new platforms, improving the APIs, hardening security, improving 
<br>fuzzer coverage, enhancing the build system, improving automation, etc. 
<br>requires even more general funding.  Essentially I have been expected to 
<br>keep libjpeg-turbo moving forward in a proactive/progressive way, but 
<br>the amount of general funding only allows for maintenance mode.  In the 
<br>best case, that puts me in the position of begging for funding on a 
<br>regular basis, which distracts from meaningful open source development. 
<br>In the worst case (where we are now), that puts me in the position of 
<br>stalling the project for potentially more than a year until funding can 
<br>catch up to the labor I've already contributed.  It just isn't working, 
<br>and I don't know how to fix it.  It's ironic that the most 
<br>popular/ubiquitous open source project I maintain (by at least four or 
<br>five orders of magnitude) is much more difficult to fund than the 
<br>others.  Maybe a JPEG codec isn't "sexy" enough?  Maybe people take it 
<br>for granted because the complexity of it is hidden behind higher-level 
<br>interfaces and applications?  Still, though, the organizations that 
<br>develop those higher-level interfaces and applications should not be 
<br>taking libjpeg-turbo for granted, particularly when most of the recent 
<br>issues I was expected to fix for free were security-related.
</p><p>
I have expressed in the past that the business model necessitated by 
<br>independent open source development may not be the best fit for a 
<br>critical infrastructure project such as libjpeg-turbo.  Thus, I am open 
<br>to acquisition by a larger organization, if that organization is both 
<br>O/S-agnostic and CPU-agnostic and has a vested interest in both the 
<br>survival and the openness of libjpeg-turbo.  However, I also don't 
<br>expect such an offer to ever materialize.  I have built significant 
<br>value in libjpeg-turbo-- including its reputation, its ubiquity, and its 
<br>user community-- over the past 13 years, but it is obviously not a cash 
<br>cow.  Still, though, unless I can secure enough general funding to move 
<br>the project forward in a meaningful way, the only other options are 
<br>acquisition (however unlikely) or putting the project into maintenance 
<br>mode for the foreseeable future.  The latter is where we are now.
</p><p>
How can you help?  If every individual developer who used libjpeg-turbo 
<br>on a regular basis donated just $5-10/month to the project through 
<br>GitHub Sponsors (<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1688565604347000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jbm3wa_QqbfwzSb_bOlOU">https://github.com/sponsors/libjpeg-turbo</a>), we'd have a 
<br>healthy amount of general funding.  But that requires everyone to take 
<br>responsibility for the health of this project, not to rely on the few 
<br>corporate benefactors that have kept libjpeg-turbo on life support for 
<br>the past five years.

<blockquote>
<p>The subtle biases of LLM training are difficult to detect but can manifest themselves in unexpected places. I call this the ‘Lone Banana Problem’ of AI.</p>
<cite>Daniel Hook, CEO, Digital Science</cite></blockquote>



<p>Think of all the tools that the information age has brought us…</p>



<p>Think of all the people whose diseases have become manageable or which have been cured. Think of all the economic benefits that have been generated through increased productivity. Think of all the routes that we have to express ourselves and share our creativity. Think of all the skills that were needed to power that revolution – the hardware engineering, and the software engineering – the development of whole new fields of knowledge and understanding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then think of all the wealth disparity that has been introduced into our world.&nbsp; Think of the social anxiety of always being online.&nbsp; Think of the undermining of our democratic institutions.</p>



<p>The effects of new technology are seldom either solely positive or solely negative and, as such, there is a responsibility that sits with those that develop technology to consider how it will be used.&nbsp; Underlying that responsibility sits a need to deeply understand technology.&nbsp; The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and its rapid adoption begs many questions about whether we understand the technology and whether we understand how it will impact us at a cultural, societal, or economic level.</p>



<p>It is clear that the experience that we have of programming and existing technologies will give way to different skills with this new technology.&nbsp; The command of a programmer mindset and skill with languages such as C++ and Python will give way to the need to understand a dynamic meta language that is drawn from the patterns of online human interaction.&nbsp; The new skill for the present technology is “speaking” language in the way that AI determines that language to be spoken from the inputs that it has consumed.</p>



<p>In that context, knowing that LLMs are not producing something new or creative, but rather that they are producing (or reproducing) the statistical average of the inputs that they have consumed in the context of the question they have been asked is important. Understanding that AIs do not understand us the way that we think they do is an important step in taking responsibility for developing on top of these technologies when creating new tools.</p>



<p>What follows attempts to illustrate this point.</p>



<h3>Going Bananas</h3>



<p>When I have written before on this topic I have noted that it is not these large biases that are concerning to me, rather it is the subtle biases that are difficult to detect that I think should be of more concern. I found recently what I regard to be an excellent illustration of the phrase that I have chosen to describe the output of AI. I call this the ‘Lone Banana Problem’.</p>



<p>Bananas are attractive fruits, they have a jolly colour, and they taste great. I have had a running joke for several years with a friend of mine that due to his love of bananas he should use them more significantly in the branding of his business. When I signed up to <a href="https://midjourney-app.com/">Midjourney</a> I saw the perfect opportunity to generate an idealised banana image for him to use. I started with a simple prompt: “A single banana casting a shadow on a grey background”. The result is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<figcaption><em>1: Four initial outputs generated by Midjourney in response to the prompt “A single banana casting a shadow on a grey background”.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, the more astute amongst you may notice an issue with the outputs that Midjourney has produced in Figure 1. While the bananas are beautiful and look extremely tasty in their artistic pose casting their shadow on the grey background, you may notice that I asked for a single solitary banana, on its own, but none of the variants that I received contained just one banana. Of course, I thought, the error must be mine, I clearly must not have been sufficiently precise in my prompt. So, I tried variants – from “a perfect ripe banana on a pure grey background casting a light shadow, hyperrealistic”, to the more specific “a single perfect ripe banana alone on a pure grey background casting a light shadow, hyperrealistic photographic”, and even to the emphatic (even pleading) “ONE perfect banana alone on a uniform light grey surface, shot from above, hyperrealistic photographic”.</p>



<h3>The Invisible Monkey Problem?</h3>



<p>I mentioned this challenge to a friend of mine who has much more of a programmer’s brain than I. He asked me if I tried to get Midjourney to render a monkey with a banana and then asking Midjourney to imagine that the monkey was invisible. (You see what I mean about a programmer’s brain?) He (my friend, not the monkey) was surmising that the data around monkeys holding bananas, or bananas in a different context might yield different results. The depressing result is included in Figure 2.</p>

<figcaption><em>Figure 2: One of the outputs of&nbsp; the experimental prompt: “An invisible monkey with a single banana”.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You are quite right, that monkey (in Figure 2) should look sheepish! Firstly, he should be invisible and is conspicuous by well…his conspicuousness.&nbsp; Secondly, he is holding not <em>one</em> but <em>two</em> bananas!&nbsp; The results were the same with aliens holding bananas and other animals.&nbsp; Slightly bizarrely, several of the monkeys ended up wearing bananas or being banana-coloured.</p>



<p>Every image that I asked Midjourney to produce contained 2 (or more) bananas seemingly no matter how I asked.</p>



<p>I began to suspect that bananas, like quarks in the Standard Model of physics, might not naturally occur on their own as through some obscure binding principle they might only occur in pairs. I checked the kitchen. Experimental evidence suggested that bananas can definitely appear individually. Phew! But, the fact remained that I couldn’t get an individual banana as an output from the AI. So, what was going on?</p>



<h3>Bias Training</h3>



<p>One of the problems of generative AI is that understanding what is going on inside the machine’s brain is almost impossible. There are interesting approaches such as <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/been-kim-is-building-a-translator-for-artificial-intelligence-20190110/">TCAV</a> that attempt to give us more of an insight, but as with a human brain, we don’t fully understand the process that goes on inside a deep learning algorithm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Testing and understanding the outputs for a given input is critical when deciding how this type of technology can be applied in real-world applications. Anyone who has studied chaos theory or who has heard of the butterfly effect will know that naturally complex systems are often highly sensitive to initial conditions. The Large Language Models (LLMs) that we are building have highly complex inputs in the form of vast amounts of data that are used to train these intelligences. However, like the Mandelbrot set and other complex-looking fractals, the rules that are then applied to the data to do the training are deceptively simple.</p>



<p>The bias to two bananas in a picture is, I believe, an example of a subtle bias (OK, it’s not <em>that</em> subtle, but it is more subtle than many of the more concerning news-grabbing biases that we regularly read about). A naïve explanation may be that in the training dataset there have been many pictures of bananas added to Midjourney’s database that have been labelled “banana” but not labelled “two bananas”. It may also be that Midjourney has never seen an individual banana, so it doesn’t know that a single banana is possible.</p>



<p>The danger here is that due to the convincing nature of our interactions with AIs, we begin to believe that they understand the world in the way that we do.&nbsp; They don’t.&nbsp; AIs, at their current level of development, don’t perceive objects in the way that we do – they understand commonly occurring patterns.&nbsp; Their reality is fundamentally different to ours – it is not born in the physical world but in a logical world. Certainly, as successive generations of AI develop, it is easy for us to have interactions with them that suggest that they do understand. Some of the results of textual analysis that I’ve done with ChatGPT definitely give the impression of understanding. And yet, without a sense of the physical world, an AI has a problem with the concept of a single banana.</p>



<p>Of course, the point of this article is not to be vexed about the lack of individual bananas in the AI’s virtual world. It is to point out that even though this technology is developing rapidly and that the output is impressive, there are still gaps and, while they are not always immediately notable, they are not small. Ethical and responsible use of AI is easy to forget when faced with the speed of innovation and the constant press hype around AI. The lone banana problem is, in some sense, a less scary version of HAL the AI in Arthur C. Clarke’s 2001 where instead of killing the crew of the Odyssey, I have merely discovered a virtual universe in which bananas only appear in pairs.</p>



<p>While humans are amazing pattern matchers, that skill is augmented by common sense (in many but not all cases), context and an evolved and subtle understanding of the physical world around us. AIs don’t yet have those augmentations – they are pure pattern matching power. And hence, they are only as good as the data that we input into the training set and hence can be no more than the statistical average of those inputs. In the lone banana problem, the statistics suggested that bananas only appear in twos (or more) and so the AI could not imagine a single banana, because the data and parametric tuning that had gone on didn’t allow it to consider that approach, on average.</p>



<h3>Existential Questions</h3>



<p>But this line of thinking does beg certain uncomfortable questions such as, is human intelligence just the result of pattern matching in the context of an enriched relationship with a physical world? Is human morality simply the result of a pattern matching type feature with a sense of its own mortality? Or, is there something deeper going on? Is inspiration or intuition something that an AI will be able to master either through its learnt experiences or a richer relationship with the physical world? In a philosophical sense, what is creativity? And, does human creativity differ fundamentally from that of machine creativity?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Certainly human creativity has limits (and, perhaps paradoxically, appears to become more limited with age – precisely as we have been exposed to more experiences). Some of those limits are, for example, the amount of data that we can perceive and process. Others appear in the extent to which we can imagine beyond our everyday experiences. Machine creativity appears to have different limits – not ones of data processing, but rather limits on what can be perceived to be relevant or important, and similar to human experience, on imagining beyond experience. Despite the alluring implication of the command “\imagine” used to initiate a new prompt when getting Midjourney to create a set of images, to what extent is the AI able to imagine beyond the patterns that have been fed to it?</p>



<p>It also points to a deeper issue of the underlying nature of this technology. When programming became a more mainstream job in the 1980s and people started studying for computer science degrees, it was noted that programming required a certain way of thinking.&nbsp; It is the same for prompt engineering, but the type of thinking behind prompt engineering is not the same as for programming. Prompt engineering requires a deep understanding of language and not only that, a deep understanding of how a large language model understands language. In the same way that deep learning algorithms have a deep understanding of chess and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">Go</a> and consequently make surprising moves due to their perception of the game, the same will be true of large language models and their perception of the world. Their use of language and interpretation will be considerably more nuanced than ours, loaded with a myriad of cultural references that none of us can possibly have assimilated.</p>



<p>While I appreciate that AIs are a good deal more complex than my simple example shows, and indeed my example may even just be a facet of clumsy prompt engineering, it still demonstrates that you have to be incredibly careful about your assumptions when using AI. What it tells you may not be what you think it is telling you and it may not be for the reasons that you think either.</p>



<p>At Digital Science, we believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that the technologies that we release are well tested and well understood. The use cases where we deploy AI have to be appropriate for the level at which we know the AI can perform and any functionality needs to come with a “health warning” so that people know what they need to look for – when they can trust an AI and when they shouldn’t.</p>



<h3>Postlog</h3>



<p>After two weeks in despair of ever finding a lone banana, I tried a different style of prompt in Midjourney (either it has learnt some new tricks, or I might be getting better at “prompt thinking”). The prompt “A single banana on its own casting a shadow on a grey background” yielded Figure 3.</p>



<p>This shows two things: Firstly, that initial conditions, by which I mean the prompt given can be very sensitive – the difference between the phrases “A single banana casting a shadow on a grey background” and “A single banana on its own casting a shadow on a grey background” is not large, either in the semantics or the words used. However, the outcome is significantly different in its level of accuracy.&nbsp; Secondly, even with this improved prompt formulation coupled with whatever upgrades that may have been implemented by the Midjourney team in the prior two weeks, there is still one output that contains two bananas, and if you look closely, one attempted banana is trying to split itself in two!!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">array_alg.h</h2>
<p dir="auto">Unintrusive algorithms for C arrays OR a C implementation of &lt;algorithm&gt; from C++</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pitch</h2>
<p dir="auto">The C++ STL is one of the most complete and reusable algorithm libraries available.
This single header file brings 80% of that functionality to C99 in a non-intrusive way.
There are no new data structures. Just include the library and call functions on C arrays.</p>
<p dir="auto">Features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Sets (intersection, union, subset, etc)</li>
<li>Heaps (priority queues)</li>
<li>Binary search (lower bound, upper bound, etc)</li>
<li>Sorts (insertion sort, quick sort, merge/stable sort, heap sort, partial sort, etc)</li>
<li>Partitioning (partition, unique, etc)</li>
<li>Predicates (all of, any of, none of, etc)</li>
<li>Uniform random sampling and shuffling</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">This library uses the preprocessor to implement generic functions.
Each time you include the library, you will need to define the array element type and a function prefix:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include &quot;array_alg.h&quot;"><pre><code>#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include "array_alg.h"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The above will only generate the declarations.
In at least one C file, you will also need to generate implementations.
To generate implementations, define <code>ARRAY_ALG_IMPLEMENTATION</code> in a C file and include the library:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#define ARRAY_ALG_IMPLEMENTATION
#include &quot;array_alg.h&quot;"><pre><code>#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#define ARRAY_ALG_IMPLEMENTATION
#include "array_alg.h"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, add <code>#define ARRAY_ALG_STATIC</code> before the original declaration
to avoid the need for separate implementations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Repeat this process for each array type you want to use.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Examples</h2>
<p dir="auto">Remove duplicate entries:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include &quot;array_alg.h&quot;

int compare_int(const int *a, const int *b, void *ctx) {
    return *a - *b;
}

...

int nums[100] = ...;
intv_sort(nums, nums + 100, compare_int, NULL);
int* end = intv_unique(nums, nums + 100, compare_int, NULL);"><pre><code>#define ARRAY_ALG_TYPE int
#define ARRAY_ALG_PREFIX intv_
#include "array_alg.h"

int compare_int(const int *a, const int *b, void *ctx) {
    return *a - *b;
}

...

int nums[100] = ...;
intv_sort(nums, nums + 100, compare_int, NULL);
int* end = intv_unique(nums, nums + 100, compare_int, NULL);
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">1. Iterators and Arrays</h3>
<p dir="auto">The C++ STL is designed around the concept of iterators.
With iterators, one algorithm can be reused not just for multiple types, but also for many data structures.
This is an ingenious design.
However, in practice, this capability is rarely needed.
The vast majority of real world &lt;algorithm&gt; invocations are on contiguous arrays/vectors.</p>
<p dir="auto">For those cases where you do have a fancy data structure (graphs, trees, etc),
copy its contents to an array, perform the algorithm, and then copy the contents back.
This will often help it perform better anyway!</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">2. Bounds vs counted ranges</h3>
<p dir="auto">STL algorithms typically operate on half-open ranges bounded by iterators [first, last).
This convention is not used as often in C, but we think it offers some benefits.
Internally, the functions can maintain less state by simply incrementing pointers
rather than keeping track of pointers, indices, and counts.</p>
<p dir="auto">Operations also compose a little easier.
When a pointer is returned to an element of interest,
that same pointer can be used as an argument for another algorithm.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">3. What's left out</h3>
<p dir="auto">Because it's a bit verbose to define a C closure (function pointer and context), some STL algorithms are less useful in C.
If an algorithm can be written as a simple for loop with no additional state or control flow, this library doesn't implement it.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="transform -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = f(in[i])
fill -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = x;
iota -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = i;
generate -> for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) out[i] = f();"><pre><code>transform -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = f(in[i])
fill -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = x;
iota -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = i;
generate -&gt; for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) out[i] = f();
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The algorithms which rely on ordered types always require a comparison function.
We do not include any variants that operate on the <code>==</code> operator, as operators cannot be overloaded in C.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">4. Generics vs <code>void*</code></h3>
<p dir="auto">Including a header multiple times with various <code>#define</code>s is a little cumbersome.
However, we think it's a superior way to achieve C generics compared to the <code>void*</code> style used by <code>qsort</code> and <code>bsearch</code>.
The preprocessor approach provides:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Better type safety and avoids verbose casting logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Better peformance (as <code>void*</code> functions are difficult to optimize).</p>
<p dir="auto">Note: The C compiler can only create one non-inlined version of each function.
For example, it could not choose to use <code>int</code> instructions, even if it knew the type at compile time.
With the single header approach you get a new instance of each function optimized for each application.</p>
</li>
</ul>

SQLite requires no setup, no maintenance, and no scaling, and the result of that execution lies entirely in a single file that you could drop into your CI/CD for quick verification. What’s not to like?</p><p id="51db">But it’s not a common choice for production backends because of its lack of network accessibility for things like monitoring and backups. Most modern applications also need replicas for availability. And thanks to platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, and Cloudflare. applications are moving to the edge: they are now deployed <em>everywhere</em>, instead of <em>somewhere</em>.</p><p id="58a5">Historically, these situations have made SQLite an infeasible option. But no more!</p><h2 id="3947">SQLite gets network accessibility</h2><p id="f7e2">Aside from any technical consideration, the SQLite project is Open Source, but not Open Contribution, which prevents the creation of a community of people and organizations pushing the project in new directions.</p><p id="fc22">In October 2022, we <a href="https://medium.com/p/aedad19c9a1c" rel="noopener">announced a fork of SQLite</a> that is also Open Contribution and distributed under an Open Source License (MIT), indicating our intent to evolve the project into some new and spicy directions. We call it <a href="https://github.com/libsql" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">libSQL</a>.</p><p id="449b">The latest addition is called “server mode” (known as `<a href="https://github.com/libsql/sqld" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">sqld</a>`) that enables network access to libSQL, as well as replication to multiple instances.</p><figure></figure><p id="8923">With this first iteration, we support:</p><ul><li id="a864">The Postgres wire protocol</li><li id="84ed">The Postgres wire protocol over websocket</li><li id="ed68">HTTP</li></ul><h2 id="0376">sqld in action</h2><p id="9bee">To see how it works, we start the server and indicate we want to serve it over http and postgres. The <code>-d</code>switch specifies the database file.</p><pre><span id="2a46">$ sqld -d foo.db -p 127.0.0.1:5432 --http-listen-addr=127.0.0.1:8000</span></pre><p id="f6bb">Since sqld supports the Postgres wire protocol, standard Postgres tooling works, including the <code>psql</code>command shell. We’ll use it to create a table and insert a row. The commands use SQLite syntax and types:</p><pre><span id="0f7c">$ psql -q postgres://127.0.0.1<br>glaubercosta=&gt; create table databases (name text);<br> - <br>(0 rows)<br>glaubercosta=&gt; insert into databases (name) values ('libsql');<br> - <br>(0 rows)<br>glaubercosta=&gt; select * from databases;<br>name<br> - - - - <br>libsql<br>(1 row)</span></pre><p id="86a9">SQLite standard tooling also works, so we can use the <code>sqlite3</code>command shell to inspect the resulting file:</p><pre><span id="90c6">$ sqlite3 foo.db<br>SQLite version 3.37.0 2021–12–09 01:34:53<br>Enter ".help" for usage hints.<br>sqlite&gt; select * from databases;<br>libsql</span></pre><h2 id="d209">HTTP and a native client</h2><p id="cf84">Last, but not least, you can issue commands over HTTP, so you can just <code>curl</code>to it with a JSON payload, without managing connection pools or anything of the sort.</p><pre><span id="eec1">$ curl -s -d "{\"statements\": [\"SELECT * from databases;\"] }" \<br>  http://127.0.0.1:8000<br>[[{"name":"libsql"}]]</span></pre><p id="34a7">HTTP support was added to support restricted environments, such as edge functions, where very little besides HTTP is present. To make that even easier, we also provide a native TypeScript client that encapsulates the details of the protocol:</p><p id="33fc">Transpiling and executing the following code:</p><pre><span id="8190">import { connect } from "@libsql/client"<br>async function example() {<br>  const config = {<br>    url: process.env.DB_URI<br>  };<br>  const db = connect(config);<br>  const rs = await db.execute("SELECT * FROM databases");<br>  console.log(rs);<br>}<br>example()</span></pre><p id="941f">Will yield output similar to the prior examples:</p><pre><span id="7f06">$ DB_URI=http://127.0.0.1:8000 node index.js<br>{<br>  results: [ { name: 'libsql' } ],<br>  success: true,<br>  meta: { duration: 0 }<br>}</span></pre><h2 id="5261">Is a fork really needed?</h2><p id="098b">A fair question to ask is this: “There are other projects attempting to merge SQLite and networking, and they don’t fork SQLite. So is a fork really needed?”</p><p id="f220">A full explanation of how SQLite writes and reads data is out of the scope of this article. There are many <a href="https://www.compileralchemy.com/books/sqlite-internals/#rollback-wal" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">other sources</a> that go into great detail about that.</p><p id="6096">Suffice to say, there are two entities that are relevant when interacting with SQLite’s storage: the VFS, and the WAL (Write-Ahead Log).</p><h2 id="a5a6">WAL Virtualization</h2><p id="9e6a">While SQLite does offer a virtualized interface for the VFS, it does not allow for the virtualization of the WAL methods. The main work in the core of libSQL was to <a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql/pull/53" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">allow for WAL virtualization</a>.</p><p id="01b1">Once the WAL is virtualized, we can capture any new updates to the database as they happen. This gives us the flexibility of VFS, but with a log-structured API.</p><p id="c2f7">Log-structured APIs are easier to replicate, since it is a natural point for streaming changes. In WAL mode, a writer can work in parallel with readers, which provides better concurrency guarantees for mixed and read-intensive workloads, compared to the default rollback journal mode.</p><p id="b114">Moreover, SQLite has a very interesting feature that isn’t generally available yet — <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cgi/src/doc/begin-concurrent/doc/begin_concurrent.md" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">BEGIN CONCURRENT</a> transactions, which use the power of optimistic concurrency control to allow multiple writers to work in parallel. This feature is built on top of WAL mode only.</p><h2 id="25c8">For us, it’s more than sqld</h2><p id="2809">This is as good a time as any to remember the primary reason for our fork: our goals with libSQL go beyond server mode. Many projects extend SQLite, making it hard to unify these efforts.</p><p id="9d69">As an example, before server-mode, we had already integrated <a href="https://blog.chiselstrike.com/webassembly-functions-for-your-sqlite-compatible-database-7e1ad95a2aa7" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">WASM user-defined functions</a>, allowing users to to write close-to-the-data functions and <a href="https://blog.chiselstrike.com/webassembly-triggers-in-libsql-b5eb62cc1c6" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">triggers</a> in WASM. libSQL also allows for <a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql/pull/56" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">randomized row ids</a>, among other features, <a href="https://github.com/libsql/libsql/issues" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">with even more planned in the future</a>.</p><h2 id="9256">What next?</h2><p id="13ae">We would love to hear how you might like to use libSQL’s server mode in your next project.
