<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
    
<p>Dear FreeBSD,</p>
<p>I’m still the new person here, learning your ways, stumbling over the occasional quirk, smiling when I
find the small touches that make you different. You remind me of what computing felt like before the
noise. Before hype cycles and performance theatre. Before every tool needed a plugin system and a logo.
You are coherent. You are deliberate. You are the kind of system that doesn’t have to shout to belong.</p>
<p>You carry the quiet strength of the greats, like a mainframe humming in a locked room, not chasing
attention, just doing its work, year after year. Your base system feels like it was built by people who
cared about the whole picture, not just the pieces. Your boot environments are like an old IBM i’s “side
A / side B” IPL, a built-in escape hatch that says, we’ve thought ahead for you. You could be, you
should be, the open-source mainframe: aligned with hardware lifecycles of three to five years or more,
built for long-term trust, a platform people bet their uptime on. Your core design reminds me of Solaris
in its best days: a stable base that commercial and community software could rely on without fear of
shifting foundations.</p>
<p>And make uptime a design goal: a thousand-day uptime shouldn’t be folklore, it should be normal. Not a
party trick, not a screenshot to boast about, but simply the natural consequence of a system built to
endure. Mainframes never apologised for uptime measured in years, and neither should you. Apply updates
without fear, reboot only when the kernel truly demands it, and let administrators see longevity as a
feature, not a gamble.</p>
<p>I know you are reaching further into the desktop now. I understand why, and I can see how it might widen
your reach. But here I find myself wondering: how do you keep the heartbeat of a rock-solid server while
also embracing the quicker pulse of a modern desktop? I don’t pretend to have all the answers, I’m too
new to you for that, but my first instinct is to lean on what you already have: the natural separation
between CURRENT and RELEASE. Let those worlds move at their own pace, without asking one to carry the
other’s compromises.</p>
<p>And now, with pkgbase in play, the stability of packages matters as much as the base system itself. The
base must remain untouchable in its reliability, but I dream of a world where the package ecosystem is
available in clear stability channels: from a rock-solid “production tier” you can stake a business on,
to faster-moving streams where new features can flow without fear of breaking mission-critical systems.
Too many times in the past, packages vanished or broke unexpectedly. I understand the core is sacred,
but I wouldn’t mind if some of the wider ecosystem inherited that same level of care.</p>
<p>Culture matters too. One reason I stepped away from Linux was the noise, the debates that drowned out
the joy of building. Please keep FreeBSD the kind of place where thoughtful engineering is welcome
without ego battles, where enterprise focus and technical curiosity can sit at the same table. That
spirit, the calm, shared purpose that carried Unix from the PDP-11 labs to the backbone of the Internet,
is worth protecting.</p>
<p>There’s also the practical side: keep the doors open with hardware vendors like Dell and HPE, so FreeBSD
remains a first-class citizen. Give me the tools to flash firmware without having to borrow Linux or
Windows. Make hardware lifecycle alignment part of your story, major releases paced with the real world,
point releases treated as refinement rather than disruption.</p>
<p>My hope is simple: that you stay different. Not in the way that shouts for attention, but in the way
that earns trust. If someone wants hype or the latest shiny thing every month, they have Linux. If they
want a platform that feels like it could simply run, and keep running, the way the best of Unix always
did, they should know they can find it here. And I still dream of a future where a purpose-built
“open-source mainframe” exists: a modern, reliable hardware system running FreeBSD with the same quiet
presence as Sun’s Enterprise 10k once did.</p>
<p>And maybe, one day, someone will walk past a rack of servers, hear the steady, unhurried rhythm of a
FreeBSD system still running, and smile, knowing that in a world that burns through trends, there is
still something built to last.</p>
<p>With gratitude,<br>
and with the wish to stay for the long run,<br>
A newcomer who finally feels at home.</p>

Sounds like some of you have been listening.</p><p>The proof of the pudding comes from various sources. First, with Windows 10 nearing the end of its supported life, we told you to consider <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-switch-your-windows-10-pc-to-linux-mint-for-free/">switching from Windows to Linux Mint</a> or another <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-most-windows-like-linux-distros-if-youre-ready-to-ditch-microsoft/">Windows-like Linux</a> distribution. What do we find now?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-most-beautiful-linux-distributions-for-2025/"><strong>The most beautiful Linux distributions for 2025</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://zorin.com/os/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zorin OS</a>, an <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-zorinos-18-might-be-the-new-best-linux-distro-and-ive-tried-them-all/">excellent Linux desktop</a>, reports that its latest release, "<a href="https://blog.zorin.com/2025/11/18/test-the-upgrade-from-zorin-os-17-to-18-and-celebrating-1-million-downloads-of-zorin-os-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zorin OS 18 has amassed 1 million downloads</a> in just over a month since its release." What makes it especially interesting is that over "78% of these downloads came from Windows" users.</p><p>Now, that's got my attention... 780,000 Windows users don't download a 3.5 Gigabyte Linux desktop distribution if they're not giving it serious consideration. Linux desktop fans download different distros all the time. For them, it's a hobby.&nbsp;</p><p>For Windows users? You have to think they are considering making the Linux switch. </p><h2>The real top dog operating system</h2><p>Many have already been making the leap. By May 2025, <a href="https://statcounter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">StatCounter</a> data showed the Linux desktop had grown from a minute 1.5% global desktop share in 2020 to above 4% in 2024, and was at a new American high of above 5% by 2025.</p><p>In <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/united-states-of-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">StatCounter's latest US numbers</a>, which cover through October, Linux shows up as only 3.49%. But if you look closer, "unknown" accounts for 4.21%. Allow me to make an educated guess here: I suspect those unknown desktops are actually running Linux. What else could it be? FreeBSD? Unix? OS/2? Unlikely.</p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-linus-torvalds-really-thinks-about-ai-and-software-development-might-surprise-you/"><strong>What Linus Torvalds really thinks about AI and software development might surprise you</strong></a></p><p>In addition, ChromeOS comes in at 3.67%, which strikes me as much too low. Leaving that aside, ChromeOS is a Linux variant. It just uses the Chrome web browser for its interface rather than KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, or another <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-linux-desktop-environments-that-make-ditching-windows-10-easy-including-my-top-pick/">Linux desktop</a> environment. Put all these together, and you get a Linux desktop market share of 11.37%. Now we're talking.</p><p>If you want to look at the broader world of end-user operating systems, including phones and tablets, Linux comes out even better. In the US, where we love our Apple iPhones, Android -- yes, another Linux distro -- boasts 41.71% of the market share, according to StatCounter's latest numbers. Globally, however, Android rules with 72.55% of the market. </p><p>Yes, that's right, if you widen the Linux end-user operating system metric to include PC, tablets, and smartphones, you can make a reasonable argument that Linux, and not Windows, is already the top dog operating system. Take that, Redmond! </p><h2>The view from DAP</h2><p>Now, of course, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/statcounters-windows-market-share-data-is-not-accurate-or-reliable-and-i-can-prove-it/">StatCounter's numbers, as Ed Bott has pointed out</a>, have their problems. So I also looked at my preferred data source for operating system numbers: the US federal government's <a href="https://www.digitalgov.gov/services/dap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Analytics Program (DAP)</a>. </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/inside-canonicals-plan-to-make-ubuntu-26-04-the-linux-desktop-that-finally-goes-mainstream/"><strong>Inside Canonical's plan to make Ubuntu 26.04 the Linux desktop that finally goes mainstream</strong></a></p><p>This site gives a <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">running count of US government website visits</a> and an analysis. On average, there are 1.6 billion sessions over the last 30 days, with millions of users per day. In short, DAP gives a detailed view of what people use without massaging the data.&nbsp;</p><p>DAP gets its raw data from a Google Analytics account. DAP has <a href="https://github.com/GSA/analytics.usa.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open-sourced the code, which displays the data on the web</a>, and its <a href="https://github.com/18F/analytics-reporter" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data-collection code</a>. You can download its data in <a href="http://json.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</a> format so you can analyze the raw numbers yourself. </p><p>By DAP's count, the Linux desktop now has a 5.8% market share. That may not sound impressive, but when I started looking at DAP's numbers a decade ago, the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-federal-government-on-what-are-the-most-popular-us-end-user-operating-systems/">Linux desktop had a mere 0.67% share</a>. We've come a long way. </p><p>If you add Chrome OS (1.7%) and Android (15.8%), 23.3% of all people accessing the US government's websites are Linux users. The Linux kernel's user-facing footprint is much larger than the "desktop Linux" label suggests. </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-factors-steadily-fueling-linuxs-desktop-rise/"><strong>5 factors steadily fueling Linux's desktop rise</strong></a></p><p>I'll also note that although Windows 10 should be heading into retirement by now, DAP numbers show it's still the most popular version of Windows, with 16.9% compared to Windows 11's 13.5%. StatCounter, however, has Windows 11 leading in the US, with 64.83% of all Windows users, while Windows 10 is well behind with 31.92%.&nbsp;</p><p>That's still way too many Windows 10 users taking chances with their security. </p><p>But wait, there's more data. According to <a href="https://www.lansweeper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lansweeper</a>, an IT asset discovery and inventory company, in its analysis of over 15 million identified consumer desktop operating systems, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/think-linux-desktop-market-share-isnt-over-6-this-15-million-system-scan-says-otherwise/">Linux desktops currently account for just over 6% of PC market share</a>.</p><h2>Why is Linux growing?&nbsp;</h2><p>Earlier this year, I identified <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-factors-steadily-fueling-linuxs-desktop-rise/">five drivers for people switching from Windows</a> to Linux. These are: Microsoft's shift of focus from Windows as a product to Microsoft 365 and cloud services, the increased viability of gaming via Steam and Proton, drastically improved ease of use in mainstream distros, broader hardware support, and rising concern about privacy and data control. </p><p>Three others have emerged since then. One is that many companies and users still have perfectly good Windows 10 machines that can't "upgrade" to Windows 11. ControlUp, a company that would love to help you move to Windows 11, has found that <a href="https://www.controlup.com/windows-11-readiness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">about 25% of consumer and business Windows 10 PCs can't be moved to Windows 11</a>. </p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-upgrade-your-incompatible-windows-10-pc-to-windows-11-for-free-today/">How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 for free - today</a></strong></p><p>This hardware lockout is a key reason many users plan to ride Windows 10 beyond the end of support instead of paying for a new machine just to meet Microsoft's specs.</p><p>Another is that many people really, really don't want to move to Windows 11. A UK survey by consumer group Which? in September 2025 found that <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/policy-and-insight/article/as-windows-10-updates-end-which-survey-reveals-millions-of-users-plan-to-continue-using-their-computer-without-security-support-a4plo0D3B6Y3" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">26% of respondents intended to keep using Windows 10</a> even after updates stopped. Interestingly, 6% plan to go to an alternative operating system such as Linux. </p><p>Why so stubborn? Well, besides wanting to save money, surveys and vendor analyses consistently mention three main reasons users hesitate: Windows 10 is "good enough," Windows 11 is not seen as meaningfully better, and they don't like the forced interface changes (e.g., the centered Start menu, context menus, default app behavior, and Copilot integration). </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linuxs-remarkable-journey-from-one-devs-hobby-to-40-million-lines-of-code-and-counting/"><strong>Linux's remarkable journey from one dev's hobby to 40 million lines of code - and counting</strong></a></p><p>Gaming users are also afraid that Windows 11 will slow down their games or come with compatibility bugs. For example, Windows 11's October update came with a bug that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/the-latest-windows-11-update-tanked-pc-gaming-performance-but-nvidia-has-already-issued-a-fix" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hurt gaming performance on some NVIDIA-equipped gaming PCs</a>. </p><p>Finally, not everyone is thrilled with <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-packing-more-ai-into-windows-ready-or-not-heres-whats-new/">Windows 11 being turned into an AI-agentic operating system</a>. Despite all the AI hype, some people don't want AI second-guessing their every move or reporting on their work to Microsoft. </p><p>After Microsoft president Pavan Davulur <a href="https://x.com/pavandavuluri/status/1987942909635854336" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweeted on Nov. 10</a> that "Windows is evolving into an agentic OS, connecting devices, cloud, and AI to unlock intelligent productivity and secure work anywhere," he probably expected Windows users to be happy with this vision. They weren't. </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cant-upgrade-to-windows-11-this-linux-distro-is-the-best-alternative-for-your-windows-10-pc/"><strong>Can't upgrade to Windows 11? This Linux distro is the best alternative for your Windows 10 PC</strong></a></p><p>Instead, the top response from one person on X was "It's evolving into a product that's <a href="https://x.com/ReiTVT/status/1987986236976333298" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">driving people to Mac and Linux</a>." Exactly so. If you want a traditional desktop where you control what's what on your PC without an AI Big Brother looking over your shoulder, Linux will be almost your only choice going forward. </p><h2>Don't forget digital sovereignty</h2><p>My last reason for people looking to Linux from Windows doesn't matter much to users in the US, but it matters a lot to people outside the US. You see, the European Union (EU) governments don't trust Microsoft to deliver on its service promises under potential US political pressure. </p><p>This has resulted in the rise of Digital Sovereignty initiatives, where EU companies and not American tech giants are seen as much more trustworthy. As a result, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/german-state-replaces-microsoft-exchange-and-outlook-with-open-source-email/">many EU states have dropped Microsoft programs</a> and have switched to open-source software. </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-german-state-schleswig-holstein-uninstalls-windows/"><strong>Yet another European government is ditching Microsoft for Linux - here's why</strong></a></p><p>That includes the desktop. Indeed, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/eu-os-takes-a-layered-approach-to-its-new-linux-distro-for-the-public-sector/">one EU group has created EU OS</a>. This is a proof-of-concept Linux desktop for a Fedora-based distro that uses the KDE Plasma desktop environment. </p><p>It's not just the EU. The UK also no longer trusts Microsoft with its data. A <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366589468/UK-governments-M365-use-under-scrutiny-after-Microsofts-no-guarantee-of-sovereignty-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2024 Computer Weekly report</a> revealed that Microsoft told Scottish police it could not guarantee that data in Microsoft 365 and Azure would remain in the UK. </p><p>Nicky Stewart, former UK Cabinet Office ICT chief, told Computer Weekly at the time: "You've got Microsoft touting what they describe as sovereign cloud, but what do they mean by sovereign...because truly sovereign data would not be offshored under any circumstances."&nbsp;</p><p>With Windows 11 data potentially being sent back and forth to US data centers, more and more governments will be wary about trusting Windows. </p><p><strong>Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/another-european-agency-ditches-big-tech-as-digital-sovereignty-movement-gains-steam/"><strong>Another European agency shifts off Big Tech, as digital sovereignty movement gains steam</strong></a></p><p>Taken together, all these shifts make Linux less of a tinker's special and more of a pragmatic option for people who want out of the Windows upgrade treadmill or subscription model. </p><p>Desktop Linux is moving from perennial underdog to a small but meaningful slice of everyday computing, especially among technically inclined users, non-American public-sector agencies, and ordinary consumer and business users who want a cheaper, more trustworthy desktop. </p><div id="pinbox-0282f2ad-bbd1-4e4e-bda5-364f527b92e3"><h4>Linux</h4> <!---->  </div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Hey everyone, we are <a href="https://github.com/jopejoe1">jopejoe1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/leona-ya">Leona Maroni</a>, the release managers of the newest release of NixOS. We are very proud to announce the public availability of NixOS 25.11 “Xantusia”.</p>
<p>NixOS is a Linux distribution. Its underlying package repository Nixpkgs can also be used on other Linux systems and macOS with the Nix package manager.</p>
<p>This release will receive bugfixes and security updates for seven months (up until 2026-06-30).
The old release 25.05 “Warbler” is now officially deprecated and will reach its end-of-life and stop receiving security updates after 2025-12-31.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md">https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46098838">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note: this post is also applicable to <code>AGENTS.md</code></em>, the open-source equivalent of <code>CLAUDE.md</code> for agents and harnesses like OpenCode, Zed, Cursor and Codex.</p>
<h2>## <!-- -->Principle: LLMs are (mostly) stateless</h2>
<p>LLMs are stateless functions. Their weights are frozen by the time they're used for inference, so they don't learn over time. The only thing that the model knows about your codebase is the tokens you put into it.</p>
<p>Similarly, coding agent harnesses such as Claude Code usually require you to manage agents' memory explicitly. <code>CLAUDE.md</code> (or <code>AGENTS.md</code>) is the only file that by default goes into <em>every single conversation</em> you have with the agent.</p>
<p><strong>This has three important implications:</strong></p>
<div><ol>
<li>Coding agents know absolutely nothing about your codebase at the beginning of each session.</li>
<li>The agent must be told anything that's important to know about your codebase each time you start a session.</li>
<li><code>CLAUDE.md</code> is the preferred way of doing this.</li>
</ol></div>
<h2>## <code>CLAUDE.md</code> onboards Claude to your codebase</h2>
<p>Since Claude doesn't know anything about your codebase at the beginning of each session, you should use <code>CLAUDE.md</code> to onboard Claude into your codebase. At a high level, this means it should cover:</p>
<div><ul>
<li><strong>WHAT</strong>: tell Claude about the tech, your stack, the project structure. Give Claude a map of the codebase. This is especially important in monorepos! Tell Claude what the apps are, what the shared packages are, and what everything is for so that it knows where to look for things</li>
<li><strong>WHY</strong>: tell Claude the <em>purpose</em> of the project and what everything is doing in the repository. What are the purpose and function of the different parts of the project?</li>
<li><strong>HOW</strong>: tell Claude how it should work on the project. For example, do you use <code>bun</code> instead of <code>node</code>? You want to include all the information it needs to actually do meaningful work on the project. How can Claude verify Claude's changes? How can it run tests, typechecks, and compilation steps?</li>
</ul></div>
<p>But the way you do this is important! Don't try to stuff every command Claude could possibly need to run in your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file - you will get sub-optimal results.</p>
<h2>## <!-- -->Claude often ignores <code>CLAUDE.md</code></h2>
<p>Regardless of which model you're using, you may notice that Claude frequently ignores your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file's contents.</p>
<p>You can investigate this yourself by putting a logging proxy between the claude code CLI and the Anthropic API using <code>ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL</code>. Claude code injects the following system reminder with your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file in the user message to the agent:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>&lt;system-reminder&gt;
</span>      IMPORTANT: this context may or may not be relevant to your tasks. 
<!-- -->      You should not respond to this context unless it is highly relevant to your task.
<!-- -->&lt;/system-reminder&gt;</code></pre></pre>
<p>As a result, Claude will ignore the contents of your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> if it decides that it is not relevant to its current task. The more information you have in the file that's not <strong>universally applicable</strong> to the tasks you have it working on, the more likely it is that Claude will ignore your instructions in the file.</p>
<p><em>Why did Anthropic add this?</em> It's hard to say for sure, but we can speculate a bit. Most <code>CLAUDE.md</code> files we come across include a bunch of instructions in the file that <em>aren't</em> broadly applicable. Many users treat the file as a way to add "hotfixes" to behavior they didn't like by appending lots of instructions that weren't necessarily broadly applicable.</p>
<p>We can only assume that the Claude Code team found that by telling Claude to ignore the bad instructions, the harness actually produced better results.</p>
<h2>## <!-- -->Creating a good <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file</h2>
<p>The following section provides a number of recommendations on how to write a good <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file following <a href="https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/d20c728368bf9c189d6d7aab704744decb6ec0cc/content/factor-03-own-your-context-window.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">context engineering best practices</a>.</p>
<p><em>Your mileage may vary.</em> Not all of these rules are necessarily optimal for every setup. Like anything else, feel free to break the rules once...</p>
<div><ol>
<li>you understand when &amp; why it's okay to break them</li>
<li>you have a good reason to do so</li>
</ol></div>
<h3>### <!-- -->Less (instructions) is more</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to try and stuff every single command that claude could possibly need to run, as well as your code standards and style guidelines into <code>CLAUDE.md</code>. <strong>We recommend against this.</strong></p>
<p>Though the topic hasn't been investigated in an incredibly rigorous manner, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some research</a> has been done which indicates the following:</p>
<div><ol>
<li><strong>Frontier thinking LLMs can follow ~ 150-200 instructions with reasonable consistency.</strong> Smaller models can attend to fewer instructions than larger models, and non-thinking models can attend to fewer instructions than thinking models.</li>
<li><strong>Smaller models get MUCH worse, MUCH more quickly</strong>. Specifically, smaller models tend to exhibit an expotential decay in instruction-following performance as the number of instructions increase, whereas larger frontier thinking models exhibit a linear decay (see below). For this reason, we recommend against using smaller models for multi-step tasks or complicated implementation plans.</li>
<li><strong>LLMs bias towards instructions that are on the peripheries of the prompt</strong>: at the very beginning (the Claude Code system message and <code>CLAUDE.md</code>), and at the very end (the most-recent user messages)</li>
<li><strong>As instruction count increases, instruction-following quality decreases uniformly</strong>. This means that as you give the LLM more instructions, it doesn't simply ignore the newer ("further down in the file") instructions - it begins to <strong>ignore all of them uniformly</strong></li>
</ol></div>
<p><img src="https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md/instructionfollowing.png" alt="Instruction following"></p>
<p>Our analysis of the Claude Code harness indicates that <strong>Claude Code's system prompt contains ~50 individual instructions</strong>.
Depending on the model you're using, that's nearly a third of the instructions your agent can reliably follow already - and that's before rules, plugins, skills, or user messages.</p>
<p>This implies that your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file should contain as few instructions as possible - ideally only ones which are universally applicable to your task.</p>
<h3>### <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file length &amp; applicability</h3>
<p>All else being equal, <strong>an LLM will perform better on a task when its' context window is full of focused, relevant context</strong> including examples, related files, tool calls, and tool results compared to when its context window has a lot of irrelevant context.</p>
<p>Since <code>CLAUDE.md</code> goes into <em>every single session</em>, you should ensure that its contents are as universally applicable as possible.</p>
<p>For example, avoid including instructions about (for example) how to structure a new database schema - this won't matter and will distract the model when you're working on something else that's unrelated!</p>
<p>Length-wise, the <em>less is more</em> principle applies as well. While Anthropic does not have an official recommendation on how long your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file should be, general consensus is that &lt; 300 lines is best, and shorter is even better.</p>
<p>At HumanLayer, our root <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file is <em>less than sixty lines</em>.</p>
<h3>### <!-- -->Progressive Disclosure</h3>
<p>Writing a concise <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file that covers everything you want Claude to know can be challenging, especially in larger projects.</p>
<p>To address this, we can leverage the principle of <strong>Progressive Disclosure</strong> to ensure that claude only sees task- or project-specific instructions when it needs them.</p>
<p>Instead of including all your different instructions about building your project, running tests, code conventions, or other important context in your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file, we recommend keeping task-specific instructions in <em>separate markdown files</em> with self-descriptive names somewhere in your project.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><pre><code><span>agent_docs/
</span>  |- building_the_project.md
<!-- -->  |- running_tests.md 
<!-- -->  |- code_conventions.md
<!-- -->  |- service_architecture.md
<!-- -->  |- database_schema.md
<!-- -->  |- service_communication_patterns.md</code></pre></pre>
<p>Then, in your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file, you can include a list of these files with a brief description of each, and instruct Claude to decide which (if any) are relevant and to read them before it starts working. Or, ask Claude to present you with the files it wants to read for aproval first before reading them.</p>
<p><strong>Prefer pointers to copies</strong>. Don't include code snippets in these files if possible - they will become out-of-date quickly. Instead, include <code>file:line</code> references to point Claude to the authoritative context.</p>
<p>Conceptually, this is very similar to how <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Skills</a> are intended to work, although skills are more focused on tool use than instructions.</p>
<h3>### <!-- -->Claude is (not) an expensive linter</h3>
<p>One of the most common things that we see people put in their <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file is code style guidelines. <strong>Never send an LLM to do a linter's job</strong>. LLMs are comparably expensive and <em>incredibly</em> slow compared to traditional linters and formatters. We think you should <em>always use deterministic tools whenever you can</em>.</p>
<p>Code style guidelines will inevitably add a bunch of instructions and mostly-irrelevant code snippets into your context window, degrading your LLM's performance and instruction-following and eating up your context window.</p>
<p><strong>LLMs are in-context learners</strong>! If your code follows a certain set of style guidelines or patterns, you should find that armed with a few searches of your codebase (or a good research document!) your agent should tend to follow existing code patterns and conventions without being told to.</p>
<p>If you feel very stronly about this, you might even consider setting up a <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Code <code>Stop</code> hook</a> that runs your formatter &amp; linter and presents errors to Claude for it to fix. Don't make Claude find the formatting issues itself.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus points</strong>: use a linter that can automatically fix issues (we like Biome), and carefully tune your rules about what can safely be auto-fixed for maximum (safe) coverage.</p>
<p>You could also create a <a href="https://code.claude.com/docs/en/slash-commands" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slash Command</a> that includes your code guidelines and which points claude at the changes in version control, or at your <code>git status</code>, or similar. This way, you can handle implementation and formatting separately. <strong>You will see better results with both as a result</strong>.</p>
<h3>### <!-- -->Don't use <code>/init</code> or auto-generate your <code>CLAUDE.md</code></h3>
<p>Both Claude Code and other harnesses with OpenCode come with ways to auto-generate your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file (or <code>AGENTS.md</code>).</p>
<p>Because <code>CLAUDE.md</code> goes into <em>every single session</em> with Claude code, it is one of <strong>the highest leverage points of the harness</strong> - for better or for worse, depending on how you use it.</p>
<p>A bad line of code is a bad line of code. A bad line of an implementation plan has the potential to create a <strong>lot</strong> of bad lines of code. A bad line of a research that misunderstands how the system works has the potential to result in a lot of bad lines in the plan, and therefore a <strong>lot more</strong> bad lines of code as a result.</p>
<p>But the <code>CLAUDE.md</code> file affects <strong>every single phase of your workflow</strong> and every single artifact produced by it. As a result, we think you should spend some time thinking very carefully about every single line that goes into it:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/writing-a-good-claude-md/leverage.png" alt="Leverage"></p>
<h2>## <!-- -->In Conclusion</h2>
<div><ol>
<li><code>CLAUDE.md</code> is for onboarding Claude into your codebase. It should define your project's <strong>WHY</strong>, <strong>WHAT</strong>, and <strong>HOW</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Less (instructions) is more</strong>. While you shouldn't omit necessary instructions, you should include as few instructions as reasonably possible in the file.</li>
<li>Keep the contents of your <code>CLAUDE.md</code> <strong>concise and universally applicable</strong>.</li>
<li>Use <strong>Progressive Disclosure</strong> - don't tell Claude all the information you could possibly want it to know. Rather, tell it <em>how to find</em> important information so that it can find and use it, but only when it needs to to avoid bloating your context window or instruction count.</li>
<li>Claude is not a linter.

<p>
Welcome to the wiki for Digital Design and Computer Architecture for Spring 2025
</p>

<h2 id="announcements">Announcements</h2>


<h2 id="course_information">Course Information</h2>


<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>
The class provides a first introduction to the design of digital circuits and computer architecture. It covers technical foundations of how a computing platform is designed from the bottom up. It introduces various execution paradigms, hardware description languages, and principles in digital design and computer architecture. 
The focus is on fundamental techniques employed in the design of modern microprocessors and their hardware/software interface.
</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<div>

<p>
This class provides a first approach to Computer Architecture. The students learn the design of digital circuits in order to:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> understand the basics, <br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> understand the principles (of design), <br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> understand the precedents (in computer architecture). <br>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Based on such understanding, the students are expected to:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p> learn how a modern computer works underneath, from the bottom up, <br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> evaluate tradeoffs of different designs and ideas, <br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> implement a principled design (a simple microprocessor), <br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> learn to systematically debug increasingly complex systems, <br>
</p>
</li>
<li><p> hopefully be prepared to develop novel, out-of-the-box designs.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The focus is on basics, principles, precedents, and how to use them to create/implement good designs.
</p>

At this point, I’d call my migration successful. But it took more than clicking a single button, so let’s talk about the steps involved, at least for me. I’m hoping that it can <a href="https://eldred.fr/blog/codeberg/#isso-8">help be an example for other people</a>, and show that it’s actually not that complicated.</p><h2 id="my-migration-process">(My) migration process</h2><p>First, I took an hour or so to set up my profile picture, email address(es), SSH keys…</p><h3 id="step-1-migrating-the-repos">Step 1: migrating the repos</h3><p>This wasn’t difficult, because <a href="https://forgejo.org/">Forgejo</a> (the forge software that powers Codeberg) offers a “migrate from GitHub” functionality. You need to <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic">generate a PAT on GitHub</a> to import things like issues (which is awesome!), and as a bonus it also speeds up the process.</p><p>It <em>was</em>, however, tedious, because the process was entirely manual (perhaps there’s a way to automate it, like by using some <a href="https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/delightful-forgejo#command-line">Forgejo CLI tool</a>, but I didn’t bother looking into that). And, due to GitHub API rate limits, whenever I tried importing two repos at the same time, one or both would fail. (It wasn’t <em>too</em> bad, though, since I could fill out the migration page for the next while one was in progress; and generally, it took me roughly as long to fill it out as it took Codeberg to perform the import.)</p><p>I’m really happy that issues, PRs, wikis, and releases can be imported flawlessly: this makes it possible to not have to refer to GitHub anymore!</p><h3 id="step-2-repointing-links-to-codeberg">Step 2: repointing links to Codeberg</h3><p>Of course I don’t control all links that point to my stuff, but I could at least run <code>rg -F github.com/ISSOtm</code> in my home directory, to catch those within my own repos. It’s possible to automate the replacing process:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>$</span></span><span> sed<span><span> --</span>in-place</span><span><span> --</span>regexp-extended</span> <span><span>'</span>s,github.com/ISSOtm,codeberg.org/ISSOtm,<span>'</span></span> <span>&lt;</span>files...<span>&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p>…and if you’re feeling like bulk-replacing all files in a directory:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>$</span></span><span> find <span>&lt;</span>directory<span>&gt;</span> <span>-</span>type f<span><span> -</span>exec</span> sed<span><span> -</span>Ei</span> <span><span>'</span>s,github.com/ISSOtm,codeberg.org/ISSOtm<span>'</span></span> <span><span>{</span><span>}</span></span> +</span>
</span></code></pre><p>Repositories, however, may still be pointing to GitHub:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>$</span></span><span> git remote<span><span> -</span>v</span></span>
</span><span><span><span>origin</span></span><span>	git@github.com:ISSOtm/rsgbds.git (fetch</span><span></span>)
</span><span><span><span>origin</span></span><span>	git@github.com:ISSOtm/rsgbds.git (push</span><span></span>)
</span></code></pre><p>You can either manually <code>git remote set-url origin git@codeberg.org:ISSOtm/rsgbds.git</code> (or the equivalent if you’re using HTTPS), or use one of the replace commands above, since remote URLs are stored textually:</p><pre data-lang="bash"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>#</span></span><span> Within a single repo:</span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>$</span></span><span> find .git<span><span> -</span>name</span> config<span><span> -</span>exec</span> sed<span><span> -</span>Ei</span> <span><span>'</span>s,github.com:ISSOtm,codeberg.org:ISSOtm,<span>'</span></span> <span><span>{</span><span>}</span></span> + <span><span>#</span></span><span> Replace the colons with slashes if you're using HTTPS!</span><span>

</span></span></code></pre><p>The automation made it not painful, so this went pretty well.</p><h3 id="step-4-porting-ci">Step 4: porting CI</h3><p>Now, onto the harder stuff :)</p><p>The first interesting thing that I noticed is this section of <a href="https://codeberg.org/actions/meta/#rules-and-conditions">Codeberg’s CI documentation</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Running CI/CD pipelines can use significant amounts of energy. As much as it is tempting to have green checkmarks everywhere, running the jobs costs real money and has environmental costs.</p><p>Unlike other giant platforms, we do not encourage you to write “heavy” pipelines and charge you for the cost later. We expect you to carefully consider the costs and benefits from your pipelines and reduce CI/CD usage to a minimum amount necessary to guarantee consistent quality for your projects.</p></blockquote><p>That got me to think about which projects of mine really need CI, and ultimately, I decided that I would only need CI for publishing my website, and the documentation of <a href="https://codeberg.org/ISSOtm/gb-starter-kit/src/branch/doc">gb-starter-kit</a> and <a href="https://codeberg.org/ISSOtm/fortISSimO/src/branch/master/manual">fortISSimO</a>; the rest of my projects don’t get contributions anyway, so I can live without CI on them, at least for now.</p><p>Anyway, Codeberg actually has two different CI solutions: <a href="https://docs.codeberg.org/ci/#using-codeberg's-instance-of-woodpecker-ci">Woodpecker</a>, and <a href="https://docs.codeberg.org/ci/actions">Forgejo Actions</a>; the former seems to be more powerful, but you need to apply for access, and the latter is very close to GitHub Actions, which should facilitate the migration. So I picked Forgejo Actions, even though it’s marked as being in beta.</p><p>It’s not very difficult to port a YAML file from GHA to Forgejo Actions; for example, look at <a href="https://codeberg.org/ISSOtm/gb-starter-kit/commit/93a455d01b62e7c8aa64e7d357029102ebce54fb">the commit porting gb-starter-kit’s publishing CI</a>. (This doesn’t really appear as a diff, since I’ve moved the file; but it’s small, so it’s easy to compare manually.)</p><p>Here are some salient points:</p><ul><li>Actions are normally just referred to as <code>owner/repo</code>, but Forgejo supports cloning <em>any</em> Git repo, especially across forges. It’s actually recommended to use full URLs always, so you don’t rely on the default prefix, which is configurable by the instance admin and thus not necessarily portable.</li><li>I could have kept the files in <code>.github/workflows</code>, since Forgejo <a href="https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/actions/overview/#workflows">picks up that directory automatically</a> if <code>.forgejo/workflows</code> doesn’t exist; however, I think it’s more convenient to keep un-migrated scripts in <code>.github</code> and migrated ones in <code>.forgejo</code>.</li><li>Most Actions (the individual steps, not the workflow files) actually work out of the box on Forgejo Actions. Nice!</li><li>Codeberg’s runners differ from GitHub’s significantly: they have <em>way</em> less software installed by default, fewer resources, and only Linux runners are provided (Ubuntu by default, but you can use <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">any Docker container image</a>). macOS and Windows being non-free OSes, Codeberg has no plans to offer either of those! For both philosophical and financial reasons. If this is a deal-breaker for you, consider cross-compiling, or bringing your own runner.</li><li>Unless low latency is crucial, consider using <a href="https://codeberg.org/actions/meta/#lazy-runners">the lazy runners</a> for better load balancing and possibly greener energy consumption. In practice I haven’t seen delays beyond a few minutes, which is acceptable to me.</li></ul><p>I actually spent some extra time trying to use less compute to perform my CI jobs, somewhat motivated by the small size of the runners, and because I’m guessing that the smaller the runner you’re picking, the faster your job will be able to be scheduled. <a href="https://codeberg.org/ISSOtm/gb-starter-kit/commit/fe48963">Here is one such commit</a>; note in particular line 50, where I tried<sup><a href="#latex_fail">1</a></sup> using a Docker image with LaTeX preinstalled, which saves the time taken by <code>apt install</code> and requires fewer writes to the filesystem, <a href="https://codeberg.org/actions/meta/#available-runners">freeing up RAM</a>.</p><h3 id="step-5-re-hosting-my-website">Step 5: re-hosting my website</h3><p>All of the previous steps were done within the span of a few days; however, since my website (this very website) was hosted using GitHub Pages, I couldn’t migrate its repos (yes, plural: you can configure individual repos to be published separately, which is how e.g. <a href="https://eldred.fr/fortISSimO">https://eldred.fr/fortISSimO</a> is published, despite not being in the website’s main repo).</p><p>Nominally, Codeberg has an equivalent, <a href="https://codeberg.page/">Codeberg Pages</a>; however, as mentioned on that page, <q>the software behind this feature is currently in maintenance mode</q>, because of complexity and performance issues<sup><a href="#pages_whitequark">2</a></sup>. So I left it at that for roughly a month, hoping there’ll eventually be an update. Also, subprojects are published as subdomains instead of subdirectories, which would have broken links (e.g. <code>http://eldred.fr/fortISSimO</code> would have become <code>http://fortISSimO.eldred.fr</code>). Meh…</p><p>And then (by chance lol) I discovered <a href="https://codeberg.org/git-pages/git-pages">git-pages</a> and its public instance <a href="https://grebedoc.dev/">Grebedoc</a><sup><a href="#bird">3</a></sup>! It functions much like GitHub Pages, though with a bit more setup since it’s not integrated within the forge itself.</p><p>git-pages actually has several niceties:</p><ul><li>My website had zero downtime during the entire migration, as git-pages <a href="https://grebedoc.dev/#zero-downtime">supports</a> uploading your website before updating your DNS records!</li><li>It <a href="https://grebedoc.dev/#redirects">also supports</a> server-side redirects, which lets me redirect people who still go to http://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial/* to its new home, for example. People have been getting 404s because of incomplete client-side coverage on my side, but no more!</li><li>It <a href="https://grebedoc.dev/#headers">also also supports</a> custom headers; I’m not particularly interested in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a>, but I’ve used that file to <a href="https://codeberg.org/ISSOtm/eldred.fr/commit/51a1718ea6f017520dfac27855c3f2cb032a09b4">pay my respects</a><sup><a href="#clacks_overhead">4</a></sup>.</li></ul><p>Oh, and also, <a href="https://blog.codeberg.org/letter-from-codeberg-onwards-and-upwards.html">Codeberg’s November 2025 newsletter</a> mentions that <q>Codeberg is planning to gradually migrate to [git-pages]</q>. Exciting!</p><p>I’m actually much happier using this than GitHub Pages; so, I’ve joined <a href="https://www.patreon.com/whitequark">Catherine’s Patreon</a>, because I want to see this go far.</p><div id="pages_whitequark"><p><sup>2</sup></p><p>To quote Catherine’s motivation for creating git-pages: <q>I started out wanting to just use Codeberg Pages and then I found out that Codeberg Pages is in maintenance mode and has such poor architecture that not only does it have rather low uptime but it also regularly crashes Codeberg’s Forgejo instance itself.</q></p></div><h3 id="time-tracking">Time tracking</h3><p>Steps 1 through 3 (migrating the repos) took me the better part of an afternoon; step 4 (porting CI) took me another afternoon, mostly to learn the new CI system; and step 5 (the website) took me… well, it should have taken an afternoon, but I used the opportunity to also pay down some tech debt (merging my slides repo into my main website), which took a few days due to required rearchitecting.</p><p>All in all, even with 45 repos migrated, this basically took a weekend. And I didn’t find it annoying!</p><p>Since the task seemed really daunting, <a href="https://ncase.me/anxiety">my anxiety</a> caused me to procrastinate this a lot, but in the end it was little work. One of the reasons I’m writing this is to let other people know that, so they can overcome their own anxiety. Maybe. :P</p><h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2><p>All in all, I’m very happy with this migration! As far as I can tell, nothing on this website has broken, and I’ve tried reasonably containing the breakage over on GitHub: I have truncated the <code>master</code> branches, but all other branches and tags remain in place (mostly due to laziness lol), permalinks (e.g. <code>https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-bootroms/blob/c8ed9e106e0ab1193a57071820e46358006c79d0/src/dmg.asm</code>) still work, only non-perma links (e.g. <code>https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-bootroms/blob/master/src/dmg.asm</code>) are broken, but those are unreliable in the first place anyway.</p><p>Since that means that all of my code <em>is</em> still on GitHub, I <em>want</em> to delete my repos; but that would be a bad idea at this point, due to leaving no redirects or anything. I’ll consider that again in… idk, a year or something. I would also like to delete my GitHub account (like I have deleted my Twitter account when… *gestures vaguely*), but not only do I need my repos to be up, I also need my account to contribute to projects that are still on GitHub.</p><p>One downside of this migration is that since I’m moving off of The Main Forge, my projects are likely to get fewer contributions… But I wasn’t getting many in the first place, and some people have already made accounts on Codeberg to keep contributing to my stuff. Likewise, I’m not really worried about discoverability. We’ll see I guess lol 🤷‍♂️</p><p>Lastly, I’m writing this after the migration, and I haven’t really taken notes during it; so, if I’ve forgotten any steps, feel free to let me know in the comments below or by <a href="https://codeberg.org/ISSOtm/eldred.fr/issues/new">opening an issue</a>, and I’ll edit this article.</p><p>Cheers!</p><h2 id="special-thanks">Special thanks</h2><ul><li><a href="https://mastodon.social/@whitequark">Catherine ‘whitequark’</a> for her work on git-pages and for being part of the ops team for Grebedoc</li><li><a href="https://servfail.network/">SERVFAIL network</a> (<a href="https://sdomi.pl/">domi</a>, <a href="https://scholz.ruhr/">Merlin</a>, <a href="https://famfo.xyz/">famfo</a>, <a href="https://donotsta.re/aprl">aprl</a>, and all of #servfail) for being my awesome DNS providers</li><li>Codeberg team and Forgejo contributors for making all of this possible in the first place</li></ul><hr><nav><ul></ul><ul><li>Earlier post: <a href="https://eldred.fr/blog/codeberg/">Migrating my code to Codeberg</a></li></ul></nav><hr></div></div>]]></description>

Onboard cameras constantly track your face and eye movements. When another car veers into your path, forcing you to slam on the brakes, sensors are assisting and recording. Waiting at a stoplight, the car notices when you unbuckle your seat belt to grab your sunglasses in the backseat. </p><p>Modern cars are computers on wheels that are becoming increasingly connected, enabling innovative new features that make driving safer and more convenient. But these systems are also collecting reams of data on our driving habits and other personal information, raising concerns about data privacy. </p><p>Here is what to know about how your car spies on you and how you can minimize it: </p>

<p>Vehicle telematics systems started to become commonplace about a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/carmakers-unite-around-privacy-protections-8b512b438b3b41be98bf5d9bfecfc249">decade ago</a></span>, and the practice of automotive data collection took off about five years ago. </p>
    
    
    
<p>The problem is not just that data is being collected but who it’s provided to, including insurers, marketing companies and shadowy data brokers. The issue surfaced earlier this year when <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/ftc-gm-driving-data-insurers-a555abb56a0d5f31afa9b73c3eb48287">General Motors</a></span> was banned for five years from disclosing data collected from drivers to consumer reporting agencies. </p><p>The Federal Trade Commission accused GM of not getting consent before sharing the data, which included every instance when a driver was speeding or driving late at night. It was ultimately provided to insurance companies that used it to set their rates. </p>
    
<h2>Be aware</h2><p>The first thing drivers should do is be aware of what data their car is collecting, said Andrea Amico, founder of Privacy4Cars, an automotive privacy company. </p><p>In an ideal world, drivers would read through the instruction manuals and documentation that comes with their cars, and quiz the dealership about what’s being collected. </p><p>But it’s not always practical to do this, and manufacturers don’t always make it easy to find out, while dealership staff aren’t always the best informed, Amico said. </p><p>Privacy4Cars offers a free auto privacy labeling service at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://vehicleprivacyreport.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vehicleprivacyreport.com</a></span> that can summarize what your car could be tracking. </p><p>Owners can punch in their car’s Vehicle Identification Number, which then pulls up the automaker’s data privacy practices, such as whether the car collects location data and whether it’s given to insurers, data brokers or law enforcement. </p>
    
<h2>Tweak your settings </h2><p>Data collection and tracking start as soon as you drive a new car off the dealership lot, with drivers unwittingly consenting when they’re confronted with warning menus on dashboard touch screens.</p><p>Experts say that some of the data collection is baked into the system, you can revoke your consent by going back into the menus. </p><p>“There are permissions in your settings that you can make choices about,” said Lauren Hendry Parsons of Mozilla. “Go through on a granular level and look at those settings where you can.” </p><p>For example, Toyota says on its website that drivers can <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.toyota.com/privacyvts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decline</a></span> what it calls “Master Data Consent” through the Toyota app. Ford says owners can opt to stop sharing vehicle data with the company by going through the dashboard <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ford.com/support/how-tos/sync/sync-4a/how-do-i-turn-off-data-sharing-in-my-vehicle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settings</a></span> menu or on the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.ford.co.uk/support/how-tos/fordpass/manage-my-fordpass-account/how-do-i-manage-my-fordpass-data-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FordPass</a></span> app. </p><p>BMW says <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bmwgroup.com/en/innovation/connected-car/data-ecosystem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">privacy settings</a></span> can be adjusted through the infotainment system, “on a spectrum between” allowing all services including analysis data and none at all. </p><h2>You can opt out</h2><h2> ...</h2><p>Drivers in the U.S. can ask carmakers to restrict what they do with their data. </p><p>Under state privacy laws, some carmakers allow owners across the United States to submit requests to limit the use of their personal data, opt out of sharing it, or delete it, Consumer Reports says. Other auto companies limit the requests to people in states with applicable privacy laws, the publication says. </p>
    
<p>You can file a request either through an online form or the carmaker’s mobile app. </p><p>You can also go through Privacy4Cars, which provides a free online service that streamlines the process. It can either point car owners to their automaker’s request portal or file a submission on behalf of owners in the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Britain and Australia. </p>
    
<h2>... but there will be trade-offs</h2><p>Experts warn that there’s usually a trade-off if you decide to switch off data collection. </p><p>Most people, for example, have switched to satellite navigation systems over paper maps because it’s “worth the convenience of being able to get from point A to point B really easily,” said Hendry Parsons. </p><p>Turning off location tracking could also halt features like roadside assistance or disable smartphone app features like remote door locking, Consumer Reports says. </p><p>BMW advises that if an owner opts to have no data shared at all, “their vehicle will behave like a smartphone in flight mode and will not transmit any data to the BMW back end.”</p><h2>When selling your car</h2><p>When the time comes to sell your car or trade it in for a newer model, it’s no longer as simple as handing over the keys and signing over some paperwork. </p><p>If you’ve got a newer car, experts say you should always do a factory reset to wipe all the data, which will also include removing any smartphone connections. </p><p>And don’t forget to notify the manufacturer about the change of ownership. </p><p>Amico said that’s important because if you trade in your vehicle, you don’t want insurers to associate it with your profile if the dealer is letting customers take it for test drives.</p><p>“Now your record may be affected by somebody else’s driving — a complete stranger that you have no relationship with.” </p><p>____ </p><p>Is there a tech topic that you think needs explaining?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Two weeks ago, by inserting what must be the most notorious asterisk in modern public health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention caveated its long-standing position that vaccines do not cause autism. Under the direction of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, a C.D.C. web page now contends that this is “not an evidence-based claim” and that research linking vaccines to autism has been “ignored by health authorities.” The fact that the original statement remains at all is due to an agreement with Senator Bill Cassidy, a physician and the chair of the Senate health committee, who disregarded decades of Kennedy’s vaccine skepticism to advance his confirmation after extracting a set of flimsy commitments that Kennedy is now betraying. The Autism Science Foundation said that it is “appalled” by the C.D.C.’s new stance; the American Medical Association warned of “dangerous consequences.”</p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services maintains that it is hewing to “gold standard, evidence-based science”—a piece of doublespeak so thick that it might unsettle Orwell. Discounting dozens of rigorous studies that have analyzed millions of patients and failed to connect vaccines to autism, the C.D.C. website claims that about half of parents of children with autism believe vaccines contributed to that autism. It cited a decades-old paper that surveyed a few dozen parents who strongly embraced alternative medicine, at two private practices in the Northeast. The web page points out that autism rates have risen in recent decades and so has the number of infant vaccinations—an observation that might also be made about prestige TV shows and pumpkin-spice lattes. The H.H.S. will now provide “appropriate funding” for studies on vaccines and autism, and last week it appointed a physician with a history of vaccine skepticism as the second-in-command at the C.D.C. The episode puts to rest any doubts about whether Americans can still trust information from the nation’s top health agency.</p><p>At stake is a question of the quality of information that should be taken seriously in public discourse and how that information should be communicated. Science may be the most powerful engine for grasping reality, but it suffers a rhetorical disadvantage. In science, the burden of proof falls on the one aiming to overturn the “null hypothesis”—the default position that one thing doesn’t cause another. But conspiratorial thinking is fuelled by the inverse: self-assured conjecture that demands a level of refutation no amount of evidence can offer. Proving the absence of a connection will always be harder than speculating about its existence. The language of science is measured and provisional; the language of politics is declarative and bombastic. In September, President Donald Trump told pregnant women to “fight like hell” not to take Tylenol, because of a potentially increased risk of autism in children; his Food and Drug Administration clarified that “a causal relationship has not been established and there are contrary studies in the scientific literature.” Tylenol, the agency wrote, remains “the safest over-the-counter” option for treating fever or pain.</p><p>The privilege that American scientists have taken for granted—one that is now being trampled—is the ability to go about their work free of political interference. With few exceptions, both Republicans and Democrats have supported independent science, understanding that the nation benefits from research that promotes health, innovation, and economic growth. But since Trump returned to office his Administration has fired or muzzled government scientists with disfavored views on nutrition and climate change; cancelled funding for long-running surveys on food insecurity and global health; dismissed independent committees focussed on air pollution, health-care disparities, and hospital infections; and pulled support for research into vaccines. This month, leading members of the National Institutes of Health, who ascended to their roles in large part based on their criticism of <em>COVID</em>-era mandates, published an article arguing that we should plan for the next pandemic not by trying to identify dangerous pathogens or by developing vaccines and medications to mitigate their damage but by encouraging people to be healthier: by abstaining from smoking, by eating nutritious food, and by “getting up and walking more.”</p><p>“The best pandemic preparedness playbook,” the authors wrote, unironically, “is making America healthy again.” Leaving aside that mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives during the <em>covid</em> pandemic, and that a society might like to prepare both by promoting healthy habits and by investing in biotechnology, this ignores the fact that, in some outbreaks, young and healthy people have had among the highest rates of death, and that with any infectious disease many people will remain vulnerable no matter what they do. (This year, a variant of the H3N2 influenza virus, known as subclade K, has caused a surge in cases in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Japan, and appears to be most perilous for children and older adults.) The unpredictability of pathogens is precisely why a broad-based strategy is needed. Pushups won’t save you from Ebola.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In the nineteen-thirties, a Soviet biologist named Trofim Lysenko gained the patronage of Joseph Stalin. Lysenko, who was tapped to guide the country’s agricultural reforms, had a range of pseudoscientific ideas, including that the environment, not genes, primarily determined an organism’s traits and that members of the same species don’t compete. He oversaw a series of biologically wrongheaded programs that contributed to famine, misery, and death for millions of people. (A British botanist once said that talking to Lysenko “was like trying to explain differential calculus to a man who didn’t know his twelve times table.”) With Stalin’s backing, Lysenko purged scientists who disagreed with him and set the country’s once preëminent genetics research back by decades.</p><p>A reason that the U.S. became the world’s biomedical leader—indeed, a reason that it emerged from the Cold War victorious—is that democratic governance allows for a level of self-correction that authoritarianism does not. Bad ideas can be beaten back at the ballot box, in the public square, and through the halls of Congress. The country is under no obligation to tolerate institutionalized quackery or elected officials who, through feckless appeals and half measures, have become complicit in it. Truly making America healthy will involve more than removing an asterisk. It will require turning the page.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<i>Written on 2025-11-30 by Rodrigo Arias Mallo</i>
<p>I would like to migrate the Dillo project away from
<a href="https://github.com/dillo-browser/">GitHub</a>
into a new home which is more friendly to be used with Dillo and solves some of
its problems. This page summarizes the current situation with GitHub and why I
decided to move away from it into a self-hosted server with multiple mirrors in
other forges.
</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the details, I would like to briefly mention what
happened with the old site. The original Dillo website was at dillo.org,
which also had the source code of Dillo in a mercurial repository at
hg.dillo.org. But it also included the mail server used to reach the developers,
a bug tracker and archives for the mailing list. However, in 2022
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/dillo.org.html">the domain was lost</a> and someone else decided to
buy it to put a similar site but plaged with AI generated ads. The original
developers are no longer active, but luckily I had a copy of the mercurial
repository and with some help I was able to recover a lot of material from the
original server (some parts are still missing to this day).
</p><p>
I want to avoid this situation as much as possible, so we cannot rely on a
single site that can go down and the whole project become lost. Initially, I
uploaded the Dillo source and website to git repositories on GitHub, but I no
longer think this is a good idea.
</p><h2>The situation with GitHub</h2>
<p>GitHub has been useful to store all repositories of the Dillo project, as
well as to run the CI workflows for platforms in which I don't have a machine
available (like Windows, Mac OS or some BSDs).

</p><p>However, it has several problems that make it less suitable to develop Dillo
anymore. The most annoying problem is that the frontend barely works without
JavaScript, so we cannot open issues, pull requests, source code or CI logs in
Dillo itself, despite them being mostly plain HTML, which I don't think is
acceptable. In the past, it used to gracefully degrade without enforcing
JavaScript, but now it doesn't. Additionally, the page is very resource hungry,
which I don't think is needed to render mostly static text.

</p><p>Another big problem is that it is a single point of failure. I don't mean
that GitHub is stored in a single machine, but it is controlled by a single
entity which can unilateraly ban our repository or account and we would lose the
ability to notify in that URL what happened. This can cause data loss if we
don't have a local copy of all the data.

</p><p>On the usability side, the platform has become more and more slow over
time, which is affecting the development process. It also requires you to have
a fast Internet connection at all times, which is not the case for me
sometimes. Additionally, GitHub seems to encourage a "push model" in which you
are notified when a new event occurs in your project(s), but I don't want to
work with that model. Instead, I prefer it to work as a "pull model", so I only
get updates when I specifically look for them. This model would also allow me to
easily work offline. Unfortunately, I see that the same push model has been
copied to alternative forges.

</p><p>On the social side, I feel that it doesn't have the right tools to moderate
users, specially for projects where the ratio of non-technical users to
developers is high. This is specially problematic when active issues with
developer notes begin to be filled with comments from users that have never
contributed to the project and usually do more harm than good. This situation
ends up causing burnout in developers.

</p><p>Lastly, GitHub seem to follow the current trend of over-focusing on LLMs and
generative AI, which are destroying the open web (or what remains of it) among
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence#Concerns">other
problems</a>. It has a direct impact on us because sites protect themseves with
a JavaScript wall (or worse, browser fingerprinting) to prevent aggresive LLM
crawler bots from overloading the site, but they also leave Dillo users out. So
I would prefer not to encourage this trend. Despite my intentions, moving Dillo
away won't change much their capability to train their model with our code, but
at least I won't be actively helping.

</p><h2>Self-hosting Dillo</h2>
<p>After researching the available options, it seems that none of the current
forges would allow us to have a redundant system that can prevent the forge from
becoming a single point of failure and solve the rest of the problems with
GitHub. Therefore, I decided to self-host Dillo myself, move all important data
to git repositories and keep them synchronized in multiple git mirrors.

</p><p>I decided to buy the dillo-browser.org domain name and setup a very small
VPS. Initially, I was very skeptical that it would be able to survive on
today's web, but it seems to be doing an acceptable job at handling it (mostly
AI bot traffic masquerading as users). The Dillo website is available here:
</p><p>
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/">https://dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>I researched which git frontends may suit our needs, and I discovered that
most options are very complicated to self-host and require a lot of server
resources and JavaScript on the frontend. I ended up testing cgit, which is
written in C and it seems to be very lightweight both on RAM and CPU usage.
Furthermore, the web frontend doesn't require JS, so I can use it from Dillo (I
modified cgit CSS slightly to work well on Dillo). It is available on this URL:
</p><p>
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/">https://git.dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>Regarding the bug tracker, I also took a look at the available options. They
are all too complicated for what I would like to have and they seem to
centralize the data into a database that can get lost. This is precisely the
case that happened with the old dillo bug tracker and we are still unable to
recover the original bug entries.

</p><p>To avoid this problem, I created my own bug tracker software,
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/buggy/">buggy</a>, which
is a very simple C tool that parses plain Markdown files and creates a
single HTML page for each bug. All bugs are stored in a
<a href="https://git.dillo-browser.org/bugtracker/">git repository</a>
and a git hook regenerates the bug pages and the index on each new commit. As it
is simply plain text, I can edit the bugs locally and only push them to the
remote when I have Internet back, so it works nice offline. Also, as the output
is just an static HTML site, I don't need to worry about having any
vulnerabilities in my code, as it will only run at build time. You can see it
live here, with the exported issues from GitHub:
</p><p>
<a href="https://bug.dillo-browser.org/">https://bug.dillo-browser.org/</a>

</p><p>The mailing list archives are stored by three independent external services,
but I might include a copy with our own archives in the future.

</p><h2>Setting up mirrors</h2>
<p>As all the important data is now stored in git repositories, we can mirror
them in any forge, without having to rely on their custom storage format for the
issues or other data. If a forge goes down (or goes rogue) we can simply switch
to another site with low switching cost. To this end, I have created git mirrors
in Codeberg and Sourcehut that are synced with our git server:
</p><ul>
  <li><strong>Codeberg</strong>:
    <a href="https://codeberg.org/dillo/">https://codeberg.org/dillo/</a>
  </li><li><strong>Sourcehut</strong>:
    <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/">https://git.sr.ht/~dillo/</a>
</li></ul>
<p>
However, we still have a single point of failure: the DNS entry of the
dillo-browser.org domain. If we lose the DNS entry (like with dillo.org) it
would cause a problem as all services will be unreachable. We could recover from
such situation by relying on alternative ways to reach users, by the mailing
list, fediverse or IRC, as well as updating the mirrors to reflect the current
situation. It is not ideal, but I don't think it would cause a catastrophic data
loss (like it happened before) as all the data is now stored in git and
replicated across independent locations.

</p><h2>OpenPGP signature</h2>
<p>In order for this page to have some authority, the HTML file is signed with
my <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/rodarima.asc">GPG key</a>
(32E65EC501A1B6FDF8190D293EE6BA977EB2A253), which is the
same that I use to sign the <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/release">last releases</a> of Dillo and is
also listed in <a href="https://github.com/rodarima.gpg">my GitHub user</a>. The
signature <a href="https://dillo-browser.org/news/migration-from-github/index.html.asc">is available here</a> and is linked to the
page with the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag using the <code>rel=signature</code>
relation. You can find more information and how to verify the signature in the
<a href="https://dillo-browser.org/rfc/006-signatures-html/">Dillo RFC-006</a>.

</p><p>Using OpenPGP signatures is robust against losing the DNS entry, as the
authority is not given by the TLS certificate chain but by the trust in the
OpenPGP signature, so we could move the site elsewhere and still claim that is
owned by us. Additionally, as we can store the signatures inside all git
mirrors, they are also resilient against data loss.

</p><h2>Closing remarks</h2>

<p>Keep in mind that the migration process requires several moving parts and it
will take a while for it to stabilize (switching costs). <strong>The GitHub
  repositories won't be removed at any point in time and they will continue to
  be updated until we finish the migration</strong>. When the migration process
is completed, I will mark the Dillo repositories as archived and properly
comunicate it in our site. It is important that we don't remove any commit or
tarball release to avoid breaking downstream builds that still rely on the

self-hosted site with relatively low expenses and very little energy cost (which
is good for the environment, but probably not even noticeable at large scale).
With the current DNS and server costs and our current donations I consider that
it is likely that we can continue covering the expenses for at least the next 3
years in the worst case scenario. If you are interested in keeping us afloat,

He has been using computers for 20 years --- tinkering with everything from the UI to the Windows registry to device firmware. Before How-To Geek, he used Python and C++ as a freelance programmer. In college, Nick made extensive use of Fortran while pursuing a physics degree.</p><p>

Nick's love of tinkering with computers extends beyond work. He has been running video game servers from home for more than 10 years using Windows, Ubuntu, or Raspberry Pi OS. He also uses Proxmox to self-host a variety of services, including a Jellyfin Media Server, an Airsonic music server, a handful of game servers, NextCloud, and two Windows virtual machines.</p><p>

He enjoys DIY projects, especially if they involve technology. He regularly repairs and repurposes old computers and hardware for whatever new project is at hand. He has designed crossovers for homemade speakers all the way from the basic design to the PCB.</p><p>

&nbsp;Nick enjoys the outdoors. When he isn't working on a computer or DIY project, he is most likely to be found camping, backpacking, or canoeing. </p></div>

               </h2><p>Despite how much off-the-shelf NAS units cost, you don't actually need particularly powerful hardware to do almost anything you might want. Any computer made in the last ten years will do the job. An old Dell Optiplex is a popular starting device because you can often get them for next to nothing or free. I repurposed an old gaming PC with a Ryzen 1600x, 24GB of RAM, and an old GTX 1060 for my NAS since I had most of the parts already.</p>    <p>If you already have a PC on hand, then just stick with that for your NAS. If you're on the used market, I'd recommend trying to pick up something with an Intel processor rather than AMD. Intel processors have a technology called QuickSync, which enables them to very <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/750701/why-hardware-transcoding-is-important-on-a-nas/" target="_blank">efficiently transcode video files</a>.</p>    <p>If you're planning on streaming video using your NAS, then QuickSync is definitely a feature you want.</p>    <p>If you have an AMD processor, you can always add an inexpensive GPU to your PC that will handle any kind of video transcoding that you might need to do.</p>    <h3 id="add-an-ssd-for-the-boot-drive">

<p>If you pick up a used PC from Facebook Marketplace or elsewhere, it may not come with a hard drive—a lot of people remove them before selling or getting rid of a PC to ensure their data is secure.</p>    <p>In general, you want to get the fastest boot drive you can. If you search for the motherboard model of the PC you're working with, the manual will specify what kind of NVMe drive you can use, if it supports one at all.</p>

<p> If it doesn't, that isn't a huge problem. SATA SSDs are still plenty fast enough for a NAS setup. My NAS still uses a SATA SSD because I found one for cheap. I haven't needed to replace it.</p>    
<p>I'd recommend TrueNAS or Unraid as operating systems for your NAS. Both need 8GB of RAM as a starting point. If you want to run virtual machines or containers (like with Docker) on your NAS, I'd aim for 16GB or more. The system I'm using started with 16GB of RAM, but I added another 8GB (2x4GB) for about $10 by buying some used RAM from Facebook marketplace.</p>

<p> If you've picked up a PC you don't know much about, you can always search for the motherboard make and model on the internet to find out the type of RAM it takes, or pull out one of the current RAM sticks. There is usually a sticker on the side that tells you the make, type, and speed.</p>    <p>If you do buy used RAM, make sure you're getting at least a 50% discount, and be sure to give the RAM a once-over physically to make sure that there aren't any obvious signs of damage.</p>    <h3 id="buy-hard-drives-cheap">
            Buy hard drives cheap
    </h3>
<p>Keeping with the theme of buying used old computer parts to save, I built my NAS with refurbished drives from <a href="https://serverpartdeals.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ServerPartDeals</a>, but you can also sometimes find good deals on Amazon.</p>    <p>In general, you can save about 50% off the normal sale price if you <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/how-to-get-hard-drives-for-cheap/" target="_blank">buy a drive manufacturer recertified or refurbished</a>.</p>    <p>I now have a total of four recertified hard drives running in my system, the oldest of which have been in nearly continuous use in 2019. So far, none of them have shown any signs of problems.</p>    <p>If you aren't comfortable with that, you can always buy them new.</p>    <p>Whatever you buy, I'd weigh the benefits of buying specialized NAS drives instead of regular drives. In theory, they should last longer. Ultimately, I didn't because my NAS sees only light use, but if you plan on putting a lot of miles on your system, it may be worth it.</p>

Just make note of your admin password, you'll need it later.</p>    <p>Once it is installed, you'll be able to access the NAS through the web browser of any device on your network by typing in the IP address, which is always displayed on your TrueNAS server. Alternatively, you could log in to your router to find your NAS's IP address.</p>

<p>From the web interface, you can manage your storage pools, add and remove containers or virtual machines, add apps, and do most anything else. For the most part, TrueNAS does a good job making everything approachable.</p>    

                            
            
    
<p>I'd recommend starting with creating an SMB share so your NAS is accessible from any Windows device on the network. That is the option I use most frequently myself.</p>    <p>I'd also strongly recommend one of the backup apps (like Duplicati) that comes with TrueNAS, too. Proper backups are essential in the digital era, and a cobbled-together NAS can be one part of a robust backup solution for your PC.</p>    <hr><p>When you first create your NAS, make sure you figure out how to create a backup of your data <em>before </em>you upload everything to it and cancel your Google Photos subscription. Remember, a NAS is only part of <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/the-biggest-backup-mistake-everybody-makes-and-how-to-avoid-it/" target="_blank">a comprehensive backup plan</a>, and it won't do you any good if you don't take the proper steps to ensure the data on your NAS is properly backed up, too.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

 - <a href="https://www.ryanliptak.com/blog/categories/programming">Programming</a>
 - <a href="https://www.ryanliptak.com/blog/categories/windows">Windows</a></p><p>On its own, the title of this post is just a true piece of trivia, verifiable with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/subst">the built-in <code>subst</code> tool</a> (among other methods).</p>
<p>Here's an example creating the drive <code>+:\</code> as an alias for a directory at <code>C:\foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>subst +: C:\foo
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+:\</code> drive then works as normal (at least in cmd.exe, this will be discussed more later):</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd /D +:\

+:\&gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 00000001 12AB:23BC
+:\
└───bar
</code></pre>
<p>However, understanding <em>why</em> it's true elucidates a lot about how Windows works under the hood, and turns up a few curious behaviors.</p>
<h2>What is a drive letter, anyway?<a id="what-is-a-drive-letter-anyway" href="#what-is-a-drive-letter-anyway">🔗</a></h2>
<p>The paths that most people are familiar with are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#namespaces">Win32 namespace paths</a>, e.g. something like <code>C:\foo</code> which is a drive-absolute Win32 path. However, the high-level APIs that take Win32 paths like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew"><code>CreateFileW</code></a> ultimately will convert a path like <code>C:\foo</code> into a NT namespace path before calling into a lower level API within <code>ntdll.dll</code> like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntcreatefile"><code>NtCreateFile</code></a>.</p>
<p>This can be confirmed with <a href="https://github.com/rogerorr/NtTrace">NtTrace</a>, where a call to <code>CreateFileW</code> with <code>C:\foo</code> ultimately leads to a call of <code>NtCreateFile</code> with <code>\??\C:\foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>NtCreateFile( FileHandle=0x40c07ff640 [0xb8], DesiredAccess=SYNCHRONIZE|GENERIC_READ|0x80, ObjectAttributes="\??\C:\foo", IoStatusBlock=0x40c07ff648 [0/1], AllocationSize=null, FileAttributes=0, ShareAccess=7, CreateDisposition=1, CreateOptions=0x4000, EaBuffer=null, EaLength=0 ) =&gt; 0
NtClose( Handle=0xb8 ) =&gt; 0

</span></code></pre>
<p>Built with:</p>
<pre><code>zig build-exe createfilew.zig
</code></pre>
<p>To run with NtTrace:</p>
<pre><code>nttrace createfilew.exe &gt; createfilew.log
</code></pre>
</details>
<p>That <code>\??\C:\foo</code> is a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#nt-namespaces">NT namespace path</a>, which is what <code>NtCreateFile</code> expects. To understand this path, though, we need to talk about the Object Manager, which is responsible for handling NT paths.</p>
<h3>The Object Manager<a id="the-object-manager" href="#the-object-manager">🔗</a></h3>

<p>The Object Manager is responsible for keeping track of named objects, which we can explore using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/winobj">the WinObj tool</a>. The <code>\??</code> part of the <code>\??\C:\foo</code> path is actually a special virtual folder within the Object Manager that combines the <code>\GLOBAL??</code> folder and a per-user <code>DosDevices</code> folder together.</p>
<p>For me, the object <code>C:</code> is within <code>\GLOBAL??</code>, and is actually a symbolic link to <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ryanliptak.com/images/windows-drive-letters-are-not-limited-to-a-z/cdrive.png">
</p>
<p>So, <code>\??\C:\foo</code> ultimately resolves to <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo</code>, and then it's up to the actual device to deal with the <code>foo</code> part of the path.</p>
<p>The important thing here, though, is that <code>\??\C:\foo</code> is just <em>one way</em> of referring to the device path <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4\foo</code>. For example, volumes will also get a named object created using their GUID with the format <code>Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}</code> that is also a symlink to something like <code>\Device\HarddiskVolume4</code>, so a path like <code>\??\Volume{18123456-abcd-efab-cdef-1234abcdabcd}\foo</code> is effectively equivalent to <code>\??\C:\foo</code>.</p>

<p>All this is to say that there's nothing innately special about the named object <code>C:</code>; the Object Manager treats it just like any other symbolic link and resolves it accordingly.</p>
<h3>So, what <em>is</em> a drive letter, really?<a id="so-what-is-a-drive-letter-really" href="#so-what-is-a-drive-letter-really">🔗</a></h3>
<p>How I see it, drive letters are essentially just a convention borne out of the conversion of a Win32 path into a NT path. In particular, that would be down to the implementation of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/rtldospathnametontpathname_u_withstatus"><code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code></a>.</p>
<p>In other words, since <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> converts <code>C:\foo</code> to <code>\??\C:\foo</code>, then an object named <code>C:</code> will behave like a drive letter. To give an example of what I mean by that: in an alternate universe, <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> could convert the path <code>FOO:\bar</code> to <code>\??\FOO:\bar</code> and then <code>FOO:</code> could behave like a drive letter.</p>
<p>So, getting back to the title, how does <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> treat something like <code>+:\foo</code>? Well, exactly the same as <code>C:\foo</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; paths.exe C:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\C:\foo

&gt; paths.exe +:\foo
path type: .DriveAbsolute
  nt path: \??\+:\foo

<p>Therefore, if an object with the name <code>+:</code> is within the virtual folder <code>\??</code>, we can expect the Win32 path <code>+:\</code> to behave like any other drive-absolute path, which is exactly what we see.</p>

<p>This section only focuses on a few things that were relevant to what I was working on. I encourage others to investigate the implications of this further if they feel so inclined.</p>
<h3><code>explorer.exe</code> doesn't play ball<a id="explorer-exe-doesn-t-play-ball" href="#explorer-exe-doesn-t-play-ball">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Drives with a drive-letter other than A-Z do not appear in File Explorer, and cannot be navigated to in File Explorer.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ryanliptak.com/images/windows-drive-letters-are-not-limited-to-a-z/explorer.png">
<i>Error when attempting to navigate to <code>+:\</code> in File Explorer</i>
</p>
<p>For the "do not appear" part, my guess as to what's happening is that <code>explorer.exe</code> is walking <code>\??</code> and looking specifically for objects named <code>A:</code> through <code>Z:</code>. For the "cannot be navigated to" part, that's a bit more mysterious, but my guess is that <code>explorer.exe</code> has a lot of special logic around handling paths typed into the location bar, and part of that restricts drive letters to <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> (i.e. it's short-circuiting before it ever tries to actually open the path).</p>
<h3>PowerShell doesn't, either<a id="powershell-doesn-t-either" href="#powershell-doesn-t-either">🔗</a></h3>
<p>PowerShell seems to reject non-<code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drives as well:</p>
<pre><code>PS C:\&gt; cd +:\
cd : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name '+' does not exist.
At line:1 char:1
+ cd +:\
+ ~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (+:String) [Set-Location], DriveNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DriveNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand
</code></pre>
<h3>Non-ASCII drive letters<a id="non-ascii-drive-letters" href="#non-ascii-drive-letters">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Drive letters don't have to be within the ASCII range at all; they can also be non-ASCII characters.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; subst €: C:\foo

&gt; cd /D €:\

€:\&gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
€:\
└───bar
</code></pre>
<p>Non-ASCII drive letters are even case-insensitive like <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> are:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; subst Λ: C:\foo

&gt; cd /D λ:\

λ:\&gt; tree .
Folder PATH listing
Volume serial number is 000000DE 12AB:23BC
λ:\
└───bar
</code></pre>
<p>However, drive-letters cannot be <em>arbitrary</em> Unicode graphemes or even arbitrary code points; they are restricted to a single <a href="https://wtf-8.codeberg.page/#motivation">WTF-16</a> code unit (a <code>u16</code>, so &lt;= <code>U+FFFF</code>). The tool that we've been using so far (<code>subst.exe</code>) errors with <code>Invalid parameter</code> if you try to use a drive letter with a code point larger than <code>U+FFFF</code>, but you can get around that by going through the <code>MountPointManager</code> directly:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>(the compiled executable must be run as administrator)</p>
</details>
<p>However, having the symlink in place doesn't solve anything on its own:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; cd /D 𤭢:\
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.
</code></pre>
<p>This is because there's no way to get the drive-absolute Win32 path <code>𤭢:\</code> to end up as the relevant NT path. As mentioned earlier, the behavior of <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> is what matters, and we can verify that it will not convert a drive-absolute path with a drive letter bigger than <code>U+FFFF</code> to the relevant NT path:</p>
<pre><code>C:\foo&gt; paths.exe 𤭢:\foo
path type: .Relative
  nt path: \??\C:\foo\𤭢:\foo
</code></pre>

<h3>Path classification mismatch<a id="path-classification-mismatch" href="#path-classification-mismatch">🔗</a></h3>
<p>It's very common for path-related functions to be written without the use of system-specific APIs, which means that there's high potential for a mismatch between how <code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> treats a file path and how something like a particular implementation of <code>path.isAbsolute</code> treats a file path.</p>
<p>As a random example, Rust only considers paths with <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drive letters as absolute:</p>
<pre><code><span>use</span><span> </span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>path</span><span>::</span><span>Path</span><span>;</span><span>

</span><span>fn</span><span> </span><span>main</span><span>()</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"C:\\ {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"C:\\foo"</span><span>).</span><span>is_absolute</span><span>());</span><span>
    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"+:\\ {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"+:\\foo"</span><span>).</span><span>is_absolute</span><span>());</span><span>
    </span><span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"€:\\ {}"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>Path</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"€:\\foo"</span><span>).</span><span>is_absolute</span><span>());</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<pre><code>&gt; rustc test.rs

&gt; test.exe
C:\ true
+:\ false
€:\ false
</code></pre>
<p>Whether or not this represents a problem worth fixing is left as an exercise for the reader (I genuinely don't know if it is a problem), but there's a second wrinkle (hinted at previously) involving text encoding that can make something like an <code>isAbsolute</code> implementation return different results for the same path. This wrinkle is the reason I looked into this whole thing in the first place, as when I was doing <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/25993">some work on Zig's path-related functions recently</a> I realized that looking at <code>path[0]</code>, <code>path[1]</code>, and <code>path[2]</code> for a pattern like <code>C:\</code> will look at different parts of the path depending on the encoding. That is, for something like <code>€:\</code> (which is made up of the code points <code>&lt;U+20AC&gt;&lt;U+003A&gt;&lt;U+005C&gt;</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Encoded as WTF-16 where <code>U+20AC</code> can be encoded as the single <code>u16</code> code unit <code>0x20AC</code>, that'd mean <code>path[0]</code> will be <code>0x20AC</code>, <code>path[1]</code> will be <code>0x3A</code> (<code>:</code>), and <code>path[2]</code> will be <code>0x5C</code> (<code>\</code>), which looks like a drive-absolute path</li>
<li>Encoded as <a href="https://wtf-8.codeberg.page/">WTF-8</a> where <code>U+20AC</code> is encoded as three <code>u8</code> code units (<code>0xE2 0x82 0xAC</code>), that'd mean <code>path[0]</code> will be <code>0xE2</code>, <code>path[1]</code> will be <code>0x82</code>, and <code>path[2]</code> will be <code>0xAC</code>, meaning it will look nothing like a drive-absolute path</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to write an implementation that treats paths the same regardless of encoding, <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/zig/src/commit/bfe3317059131ab552f7583b88d6bc82609d198c/lib/std/os/windows.zig#L2564-L2585"><em>some</em> decision has to be made</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If strict compatibility with <code>RtlDetermineDosPathNameType_U</code>/<code>RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U</code> is desired, decode the first code point and check for <code>&lt;= 0xFFFF</code> when dealing with WTF-8 (this is the option I went with for the Zig standard library, but I'm not super happy about it)</li>
<li>If you want to be able to always check <code>path[0]</code>/<code>path[1]</code>/<code>path[2]</code> and don't care about non-ASCII drive letters, check for <code>path[0] &lt;= 0x7F</code> regardless of encoding</li>
<li>If you don't care about anything other than the standard <code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drive letters, then check for that explicitly (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/3ff30e7eafc1da7104c3960187d17939172428ed/library/std/src/sys/path/windows_prefix.rs#L132-L134">this is what Rust does</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>That's NOT the EURO drive<a id="that-s-not-the-euro-drive" href="#that-s-not-the-euro-drive">🔗</a></h3>
<p>Something bizarre that I found with this whole thing is that the <code>kernel32.dll</code> API <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setvolumemountpointw"><code>SetVolumeMountPointW</code></a> has it's own unique quirk when dealing with non-ASCII drive letters.

</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>However, when we look at the Object Manager, the <code>€:</code> symlink won't exist... but <code>¬:</code> will:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.ryanliptak.com/images/windows-drive-letters-are-not-limited-to-a-z/notdrive.png">
</p>
<p>My time <a href="https://www.ryanliptak.com/blog/every-rc-exe-bug-quirk-probably/">dealing extensively with Windows quirks</a> made me recognize what might be happening here: <code>0x20AC</code> is likely being truncated to <code>0xAC</code> by <code>SetVolumeMountPointW</code>, and <code>U+00AC</code> happens to be <code>¬</code>. If that is indeed what's going on, it seems pretty strange to truncate the drive letter instead of reject the path, but it also makes sense that non-ASCII drive letters are an edge case that no one has really thought about at all.</p>
<h2>Wrapping up<a id="wrapping-up" href="#wrapping-up">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I have no idea if anything I wrote about here is novel, although my cursory searches didn't turn up much. The only mention of non-<code>A</code>-<code>Z</code> drive letters I'm currently aware of is from the article <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html">The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion</a> which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it's natural to assume that drive "letters" can only be A through Z. It turns out the <code>RtlGetFullPathName_U</code> API does not enforce this requirement, although the Explorer shell and command prompt almost certainly do. Therefore as long as the second character of a path is a colon, the conversion will treat it as a Drive Absolute or Drive Relative path. Of course if the DosDevices object directory doesn't have an appropriate symbolic link it's not going to do you much good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, it turns out that the command prompt also doesn't enforce the requirement, and I'd guess that there's at least some more weirdness around this quirk that's waiting to be discovered.</p>

<article>
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="https://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also make <a href="https://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  I'm on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/was.tl" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/topaz" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calendar</a> of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, a speed contest, or to <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&amp;restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others or directly via <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2025/support">AoC++</a>.</p>
<h2>--- General Tips ---</h2>
<p>If you get stuck, try your solution against the <em>examples</em> given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe <em>ask a friend</em> for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<h2>--- Frequently Asked Questions ---</h2>
<p id="faq_codeselect"><em>Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks?</em> You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled.</p><pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env perl
use warnings;
use strict;

print "You can test it out by ";
print "triple-clicking this code.\n";
</code></pre>
<p id="faq_auth"><em>How does authentication work?</em> Advent of Code uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from <a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/reddit/about" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://api.github.com/users/octocat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.</p>
<p id="faq_difficulty"><em>Why was this puzzle so easy / hard?</em> The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">tricky</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_unlocktime"><em>Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5?</em> Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; if you want to race, many people use <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private">private leaderboards</a> to compete with people in their area.</p>
<p id="faq_highcontrast"><em>I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode?</em> There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&gt; Page Style -&gt; High Contrast).</p>
<p id="faq_puzzleideas"><em>I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?</em> Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.</p>
<p id="faq_puzzlebugs"><em>Did I find a bug with a puzzle?</em> Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_speed"><em>Should I try to get a fast solution time?</em> Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but trying for a fast time also requires <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard">many</a> <a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/">additional</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661">skills</a> and a lot of practice; speed-solves often look nothing like code that would pass a code review. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/">an approach that meets your goals</a> and ignore speed entirely.</p>
<p id="faq_num_days"><em>Why did the number of days per event change?</em> It takes a ton of my free time every year to run Advent of Code, and building the puzzles accounts for the majority of that time. After keeping a consistent schedule for ten years(!), I needed a change. The puzzles still start on December 1st so that the day numbers make sense <span title="Oct 31 = Dec 25">(Day 1 = Dec 1)</span>, and puzzles come out every day (ending mid-December).</p>
<p id="faq_leaderboard"><em>What happened to the global leaderboard?</em> The global leaderboard was one of the largest sources of stress for me, for the infrastructure, and for many users. People took things too seriously, going way outside the spirit of the contest; some people even resorted to things like DDoS attacks. Many people incorrectly concluded that they were somehow worse programmers because their own times didn't compare. What started as a fun feature in 2015 became an ever-growing problem, and so, after ten years of Advent of Code, I removed the global leaderboard. (However, I've made it so you can share a read-only view of your private leaderboard. Please don't use this feature or data to create a "new" global leaderboard.)</p>
<p id="faq_private_leaderboard_rules"><em>While trying to get a fast time on a private leaderboard, may I use AI / watch streamers / check the solution threads / ask a friend for help / etc?</em> If you are a member of any private leaderboards, you should ask the people that run them what their expectations are of their members. If you don't agree with those expectations, you should find a new private leaderboard or start your own! Private leaderboards might have rules like maximum runtime, allowed programming language, what time you can first open the puzzle, what tools you can use, or whether you have to wear a silly hat while working.</p>
<p id="faq_ai"><em>Should I use AI to solve Advent of Code puzzles?</em> No. If you send a friend to the gym on your behalf, would you expect to get stronger? Advent of Code puzzles are designed to be interesting for humans to solve - no consideration is made for whether AI can or cannot solve a puzzle. If you want practice prompting an AI, there are almost certainly better exercises elsewhere designed with that in mind.</p>
<p id="faq_copying"><em>Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?</em> Please don't. Advent of Code is free to <em>use</em>, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://github.com/SuperAuguste" target="_blank">Auguste Rame</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Techatrix" target="_blank">Techatrix</a> — 30 November 2025</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>For those unfamiliar, Zigtools was founded to support the <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">Zig</a> community, especially newcomers, by creating editor tooling such as <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/zls" target="_blank">ZLS</a>, providing building blocks for language servers written in Zig with <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/lsp-kit" target="_blank">lsp-kit</a>, working on tools like the <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground" target="_blank">Zigtools Playground</a>, and contributing to Zig editor extensions like <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglang/vscode-zig" target="_blank">vscode-zig</a>.</p><h2>The Plagiarism</h2><p>A couple weeks ago, a Zig resource called Zigbook was released with a bold claim of “zero AI” and an original “project-based” structure.</p><p>Unfortunately, even a cursory look at the nonsense chapter structure, book content, examples, generic website, or post-backlash issue-disabled repo reveals that the book is wholly LLM slop and the project itself is structured like some sort of sycophantic psy-op, with botted accounts and fake reactions.</p><p>We’re leaving out all direct links to Zigbook to not give them any more SEO traction.</p><p>We thought that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45947810" target="_blank">broad community backlash</a> would be the end of the project, but Zigbook persevered, releasing just last week a brand new feature, a “high-voltage beta” Zig playground.</p><p>As we at Zigtools have our own Zig playground (<a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground" target="_blank">repo</a>, <a href="https://playground.zigtools.org/" target="_blank">website</a>), our interest was immediately piqued. The form and functionality looked pretty similar and Zigbook even integrated (in a non-functional manner) ZLS into their playground to provide all the fancy editor bells-and-whistles, like code completions and goto definition.</p><p>Knowing Zigbook’s history of deception, we immediately investigated the WASM blobs. Unfortunately, the WASM blobs are byte-for-byte identical to ours. This cannot be a coincidence given the two blobs (<code>zig.wasm</code>, a lightly modified version of the Zig compiler, and <code>zls.wasm</code>, ZLS with a modified entry point for WASI) are entirely custom-made for the Zigtools Playground.</p><p>We archived the WASM files for your convenience, courtesy of the great Internet Archive:</p><ul><li><code>zls.wasm</code> (<code>sha256sum</code>: <code>3a63e5092e8f90172716977af5c88b4f49e546f730f25e9bafb47f4ac9a2ee1d</code>)<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251129224054/https://playground.zigtools.org/assets/zls-Dxe5uroE.wasm" target="_blank">Original</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251128234504/https://www.zigbook.net/zig/zls.wasm" target="_blank">Plagiarized</a></li></ul></li><li><code>zig.wasm</code> (<code>sha256sum</code>: <code>d3fe6b8a6b1db84a914eaa1f4a80ca5dcfd3b0948a35f2b1e78432a392eace96</code>)<ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251129224210/https://playground.zigtools.org/assets/zig-n5fT0I4M.wasm" target="_blank">Original</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251128234607/https://www.zigbook.net/zig/zig.wasm" target="_blank">Plagiarized</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>We proceeded to look at the JavaScript code, which we quickly determined was similarly copied, but with LLM distortions, likely to prevent the code from being completely identical. Still, certain sections were copied one-to-one, like the JavaScript worker data-passing structure and logging (<a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground/blob/0ae8aa03fa38e8ce38e95f57cccfcf9aa4db610a/src/workers/runner.ts#L12-L41" target="_blank">original ZLS playground code</a>, <a href="https://archive.ph/4LZ2X" target="_blank">plagiarized Zigbook code</a>).</p><p>The following code from both files is identical:</p><pre><code>    <span>try</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// @ts-ignore</span>
        <span>const</span> <span>exitCode</span> <span>=</span> <span>wasi</span><span>.</span><span>start</span><span>(</span><span>instance</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>\n\n---\nexit with exit code ${exitCode}\n---\n</code> is perhaps the most obviously copied string.</p><p>Funnily enough, despite copying many parts of our code, Zigbook didn’t copy the most important part of the ZLS integration code, the JavaScript ZLS API designed to work with the <a href="https://github.com/zigtools/playground/blob/227bcd3775baeb60cbf2f1ffb1ad0566516a64fc/src/zls.zig" target="_blank">ZLS WASM binary’s API</a>. That JavaScript code is absolutely required to interact with the ZLS binary which they <em>did</em> plagiarize. Zigbook either avoided copying that JavaScript code because they knew it would be too glaringly obvious, because they fundamentally do not understand how the Zigtools Playground works, or because they plan to copy more of our code.</p><p>To be clear, copying our code and WASM blobs is entirely permissible given that the playground and Zig are MIT licensed. Unfortunately, Zigbook has not complied with the terms of the MIT license at all, and seemingly claims the code and blobs as their own without correctly reproducing the license.</p><p>We sent Zigbook a neutral <a href="https://github.com/zigbook/zigbook/pull/43" target="_blank">PR correcting the license violations</a>, but they quickly closed it and deleted the description, seemingly to hide their misdeeds.</p><p>The original description (also available in the “edits” dropdown of the original PR comment) is reproduced below:</p><blockquote><p>We (@zigtools) noticed you were using code from the Zigtools Playground, including byte-by-byte copies of our WASM blobs and excerpts of our JavaScript source code.</p><p>This is a violation of the MIT license that the Zigtools Playground is licensed under alongside a violation of the Zig MIT license (for the zig.wasm blob).</p><p>As the MIT license states:</p><pre><code>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
</code></pre><p>We’ve fixed this by adding the licenses in question to your repository. As your repository does not include a direct link to the *.wasm dependencies, we’ve added a license disclaimer on the playground page as well that mentions the licenses.</p></blockquote><p>Zigbook’s aforementioned bad behavior and their continued violation of our license and unwillingness to fix the violation motivated us to write this blog post.</p><h2>Our Vision for the Zigtools Playground</h2><p>It’s sad that our first blog post is about the plagiarism of our coolest subproject. We challenged ourselves by creating a WASM-based client-side playground to enable offline usage, code privacy, and no server costs.</p><p>This incident has motivated us to invest more time into our playground and has generated a couple of ideas:</p><ul><li>We’d like to enable multifile support to allow more complex Zig projects to be run in the browser</li><li>We’d like to collaborate with fellow Ziguanas to integrate the playground into their excellent Zig tutorials, books, and blogposts<ul><li>A perfect example usecase would be enabling folks to hop into <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises" target="_blank">Ziglings</a> online with the playground</li><li>The Zig website itself would be a great target as well!</li></ul></li><li>We’d like to support stack traces using DWARF debug info which is not yet emitted by the self-hosted Zig compiler</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As Zig community members, <strong>we advise all other members of the Zig community to steer clear of Zigbook</strong>.</p><p>If you’re looking to learn Zig, we strongly recommend looking at the excellent official <a href="https://ziglang.org/learn/" target="_blank">Zig learn page</a> which contains excellent resources from the previously mentioned <a href="https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises" target="_blank">Ziglings</a> to <a href="https://www.openmymind.net/learning_zig/" target="_blank">Karl Seguin’s Learning Zig</a>.</p><p>We’re also using this opportunity to mention that we’re fundraising to keep ZLS sustainable for our only full-time maintainer, Techatrix. We’d be thrilled if you’d be willing to give just $5 a month. You can check out our <a href="https://opencollective.com/zigtools" target="_blank">OpenCollective</a> or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/zigtools" target="_blank">GitHub Sponsors</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading! \(^-^)/</p></div></div>]]></description>

I'd like to impart some lessons.</p><p>1. A small number of accomplishments really mean something, but you often won't know which ones. I started three companies and two were successes, and even though they comprised more than two decades of my life, I feel like I remember a grand total of six important hours between them. Meanwhile, I still remember the shed I built for my father in the first summer after college. Whatever seems unimportant, you will care about the most.</p><p>2. The thing you do today, you will probably do tomorrow. I've wasted a lot of time, but most people I know have wasted lots of time, and it's because of the tendency to make an exception of the present day, which either excuses laziness or pathological busyness, which is a form of the same thing. "I'll do it tomorrow." But tomorrow it will be today. It's always today.</p><p>3. Ethics matter. I don't believe there's any life after this one, but I find myself ruminating on what I've done. In 2015, I had a lot of interaction with a startup incubator you know well, and ended up sitting in the discussions and planning around banning and erasing a young programmer we considered a threat to our financial interests, due to his concerns about authoritarianism in technology. In retrospect, he was harmless, but an example had to be made. The decision was made to ban him here, try to get him fired though I don't know if we succeeded, and attack him with sockpuppets on Reddit, and it seems to have worked because you don't hear his name much.</p><p>Ten years later, I'm still stuck thinking about this. Am I the kind of person who does shitty things? I was. Am I still? How would I even know?</p><p>I don't believe that faith is an out, or that you can apologize or donate your way out of past behaviors. You will always be the person who has done what you have done.</p><p>4. Be kind to animals. There are few joys like having a dog. I always refused when my ex-wife wanted one, and she got one after we separated. For her, it was probably an upgrade.</p><p>5. I developed a knack for founding companies, but I never learned how to build communities. They aren't the same thing. You might have three hundred people at your company and you truly feel like they are your village, but they're not. Circumstances will change, and people will move, and in five years, most of them will not remember your name.</p><p>That's probably enough for now. My mind goes between periods of racing and long spells of languid acceptance. All humans end up in the place where I am, and I hope you reach it with fewer regrets than I have.</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
