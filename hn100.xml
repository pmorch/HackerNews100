<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current State</h2><a id="user-content-current-state" aria-label="Permalink: Current State" href="#current-state"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I started working on this on 2025-04-01, April Fool's Day, after having created another experimental MCP service, <a href="https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-go/blob/main/cmd/dbn-go-mcp/README.md"><code>dbn-go</code> for financial market data</a>, the day prior.  So it is fresh meat and was intended as a quick, fun educational project.</p>
<p dir="auto">While it does work, I found the underlying <a href="https://github.com/diamondburned/go-buttplug"><code>go-buttplug</code> library</a> to be unstable in connection handling.   I could ask Claude for my devices, but my specific device wouldn't vibrate even just with just Intiface Central -- it was like in read-only mode!    I also wish I had a virtual buttplug.io device for testing, rather than relying on a physical device.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, it has not truly been tested "end-to-end" 😉</p>
<p dir="auto">I will dig more into the <code>go-buttplug</code> library and see why connections are unstable.  I also need to understand the MCP protocol current state of MCP hosts -- it seems they focus on Tools rather than Resources and Resoure Templates.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installing the binary</h2><a id="user-content-installing-the-binary" aria-label="Permalink: Installing the binary" href="#installing-the-binary"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Binaries for multiple platforms are <a href="https://github.com/conacademy/buttplug-mcp/releases">released on GitHub</a> through <a href="https://github.com/conacademy/buttplug-mcp/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also install for various platforms with <a href="https://brew.sh/" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> from <a href="https://github.com/conacademy/homebrew-tap"><code>conacademy/homebrew-tap</code></a>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="brew tap conacademy/homebrew-tap

<p dir="auto">Download the <a href="https://intiface.com/central/" rel="nofollow">Intiface Central</a> hub application to manage your devices.  Start it and note the server port (default seems to be <code>12345</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">To use this the <code>buttplug-mcp</code> MCP server, you must configure your host program to use it.  We will illustrate with <a href="https://claude.ai/download" rel="nofollow">Claude Desktop</a>.  We must find the <code>buttplug-mcp</code> program on our system; the example below shows where <code>buttplug-mcp</code> is installed with MacOS Homebrew (perhaps build your own and point at that).</p>
<p dir="auto">The following <a href="https://github.com/ConAcademy/buttplug-mcp/blob/main/claude_desktop_config.json">configuration JSON</a> sets this up:</p>

<p dir="auto">Using Claude Desktop, you can follow <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user" rel="nofollow">their configuration tutorial</a> but substitute the configuration above.

		<p><em><strong>Faster addition and subtraction on modern CPUs</strong></em></p>

<p>Do you remember how to do long addition on paper?</p>

<pre><code> ¹¹ ¹
  6876
+ 3406
------
 10282
</code></pre>

<p>Starting from the “ones” position, we add 6 + 6 = 12, write down a 2 and carry a 1.
We proceed to the left, one position at a time, until there are no more digits
to add.</p>

<p>When implementing addition for large integers (e.g. 2<sup>64</sup> and above), it’s common to write
code that looks quite similar to this algorithm.
Interestingly, there’s a straightforward trick that can speed up this
process enormously on modern CPUs.</p>

<p>But first, a question: why do we start long addition with the “ones”?
Why not start on the left?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is the carries.
We can’t figure out for sure what a given digit of the answer will be
until we’ve completed all of the additions to the right of that digit.</p>

<p>Imagine if we tried to add left-to-right instead:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6 + 3 = 9. So the first digit is 9.<br>
8 + 4 = 12. OK, the second digit is 2… but carry a 1, so the first digit
was actually 9 + 1 = 10… now carry back <em>that</em> 1…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For mental math, this isn’t too bad (and some people actually prefer it
when working with small enough numbers).
As an algorithm, however, this approach has some fundamental limitations that
become clear when working with larger numbers.
Most importantly, because the later parts of the computation rely on
information from the earlier parts of the computation,
it’s hard to split up and parallelize the work.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-computers">What about computers?</h2>

<p>Computers don’t work in base 10, of course.
Instead, modern desktop and server CPUs expose an interface for operating on
(for the most part) 64-bit integers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; Add the 64-bit value in B to the 64-bit value in A</span>
<span>add</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span>
<span>; Note: I'll use letters instead of real register names to keep things simple</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As long as our numbers fit within a single 64-bit value, things are easy.
But what if we want to add, say, two 256-bit integers, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>?</p>

<p>The obvious solution would be to break up each 256-bit number into four 64-bit
pieces (commonly referred to as “limbs”).
Place the highest 64 bits of <code>x</code> into register A,
the next 64 bits into register B,
and so on for registers C and D.
Do the same for <code>y</code> with registers E, F, G, H.</p>

<p>Now we can add <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> by adding the corresponding parts:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; Equivalent to x += y</span>
<span>add</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span>
<span>add</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span>
<span>add</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span>
<span>add</span> <span>D</span><span>,</span> <span>H</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But wait, this might give us the wrong result!
If one of the last three additions overflow,
then we need to “carry” that extra 1 up to the next 64-bit piece.
Oh hey, does that sound familiar?</p>

<p>Fortunately, x86 has a dedicated instruction for this called “add with carry”.
<code>adc</code> will automatically check if the previous operation overflowed, adding 1
if needed.
Here’s how the proper code would look:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>add</span> <span>D</span><span>,</span> <span>H</span>
<span>adc</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span> <span>; include carry from previous op</span>
<span>adc</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span> <span>; include carry from previous op</span>
<span>adc</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span> <span>; include carry from previous op</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Just like with long addition in base 10,
we start with the least-significant “digits” (D and H)
and work our way up to the most-significant “digits” (A and E),
carrying 1s as needed along the way.</p>

<h2 id="but-now-its-slow">But now it’s slow</h2>

<p>Interestingly, our fixed code is slower than the original (incorrect) code.
Much slower.  Why is this?</p>

<p>The first reason is that <code>adc</code> is just slower to execute than a normal <code>add</code> on
most popular x86 CPUs.
Since <code>adc</code> has a third input (the carry flag),
it’s a more complex instruction than <code>add</code>.
It’s also used less often than <code>add</code>,
so there is less incentive for CPU designers to spend chip area on optimizing
<code>adc</code> performance.</p>

<p>The second reason is more interesting.
Let’s look at the Intel Haswell microarchitecture as an example.</p>

<p>On a Haswell CPU, a single <code>add</code> instruction takes 1 cycle to execute.
However, in ideal conditions, Haswell CPUs can execute up to 4 <code>add</code>
instructions in a single cycle.
How is this possible? Parallelism.
Modern processors look ahead at what instructions are coming up and try to
schedule them so that they can be executed in parallel whenever possible.
Since Haswell CPUs have 8 execution ports, and 4 of those ports can execute an
integer <code>add</code> instruction, a Haswell processor can execute up to 4 <code>add</code>
instructions at once.</p>

<p>In our original adding code, all 4 <code>add</code> instructions were independent of one
another, so it was straightforward for the processor to run them in parallel.
<strong>Now, with <code>adc</code>, each instruction depends on an output from the previous
instruction.</strong>
The processor has no choice but to execute the instructions serially, one after
the other, instead of in parallel.</p>

<p>The performance difference is even more dramatic if we use SIMD (Single
Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions.
For example, a single <code>vpaddq</code> (Vector Packed Add Quadword) instruction does
four 64-bit adds simultaneously.
Combine that with the fact that Haswell processors can execute two <code>vpaddq</code>s
per cycle, and you can see that we’re taking a serious performance hit
in order to handle carries properly.</p>

<h2 id="eliminating-carries-part-1-on-paper">Eliminating carries, part 1: on paper</h2>

<p>Back to base 10 for a minute.
How can we eliminate the need for carries?</p>

<p>Let’s make some changes to how the number system works.
First, we’ll extend the range of digits available.
Instead of 0-9, we will use 0-9, A-Z, and *:</p>

<pre><code>0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ*
</code></pre>

<p>(Yeah, I needed an extra character to make the numbers work out nicely. Bear
with me.)</p>

<p>Although we have 37 digits, we are <em>not</em> using base 37.
Numbers will still have “ones”, “tens”, and “hundreds” positions,
just like a normal base 10 system.
29 still means 29, and 29 + 1 is still 30.
The only difference is that
digits happen to be capable of counting past 9:
29 + 1 could also be written as 2A, 1K, or even U.</p>

<p>With this new, more flexible number system,
we can add without needing any carries!</p>

<pre><code>  672415
+ 736606
--------
  DA8A1B
</code></pre>

<p>This trick won’t work for all numbers in our number system (e.g. 9 + W will
need a carry),
but it will work if the numbers we are adding are
<em>normalized</em>, i.e. all of their digits are 9 or below.
In fact, we can add up to four normalized numbers in this notation before any
carries are possible:</p>

<pre><code>  999   &lt;-- largest possible normalized 3-digit number
  999
  999
+ 999
-----
  ***   &lt;-- valid 3-digit result, no carries
            (recall that * is the highest digit)
</code></pre>

<p>So, with some clever tweaks to the number system, we’ve cheated our way out of
some carries.
Of course, at some point, we will need to convert from the
37-digit base 10 system back to normal base 10.
We can do that by <em>normalizing</em> a number such that each of its digits is
between 0 and 9:</p>

<pre><code>  ¹¹ ¹ ¹
   DA8A1B
= 1409021

note:
D = 10 + 3
A = 10 + 0
B = 10 + 1
</code></pre>

<p>We normalize a number starting at the right,
determining how many “tens” are in each digit,
subtracting those “tens”,
and carrying them to the next digit.
672415 and 736606 do in fact sum to 1409021, so the system works!</p>

<p>The key insight here is that we can use this technique to delay carry
propagation until the end.
We can’t avoid carry propagation altogether, but we can avoid it temporarily.
If we save up the carries that occur during the intermediate additions,
we can propagate them all in one go at the end.</p>

<h2 id="eliminating-carries-part-2-computers">Eliminating carries, part 2: computers</h2>

<p>Carry propagation was at the heart of the performance problems we encountered earlier.
As you’ve probably anticipated by now, we can use this technique to help speed
up big number arithmetic!</p>

<p>Previously, we split a 256-bit number into four 64-bit pieces,
since x86_64 processors operate on 64-bit integers.
One way to understand this is to view the pieces as “digits”
in base 2<sup>64</sup>, since each digit has a value
between 0 and 2<sup>64</sup> - 1 (inclusive).</p>

<p>In base 10, we kept the same base, but extended the range of digits that were
allowed in order to prevent carries from occurring.
Unfortunately, we can’t do that here – a 64-bit integer only has so many
possible values, and we can’t change the hardware.
Instead, we can get the same effect by reducing the size of the base.</p>

<p>Instead of splitting 256 bits into four base 2<sup>64</sup> digits,
we’ll split 256 bits into five base 2<sup>51</sup> digits.
Each digit can still range from 0 to 2<sup>64</sup> - 1,
but the smaller base gives us the flexibility needed to prevent digits from
needing a carry.
This technique is generally referred to as “radix 2<sup>51</sup>
representation” in the cryptography literature.</p>

<p>Here’s how it will look when we split 256 bits across five limbs (i.e.
digits):</p>

<pre><code>|            [--------------------- 52 bits --------------------]|
|             [-------------------- 51 bits --------------------]|
|             [-------------------- 51 bits --------------------]|
|             [-------------------- 51 bits --------------------]|
|             [-------------------- 51 bits --------------------]|
</code></pre>

<p>Each limb has 51 (or 52) bits of the original 256-bit number.
The remaining 12 or 13 bits give us the extra “digits” we need for preventing
carries.
Effectively, the highest bits of each limb are reserved as storage for any
carries that occur during the computation.</p>

<p>In our base 10 example,
37 digits allowed us to add up to four normalized numbers before needing to
propagate carries.
In radix 2<sup>51</sup> representation,
2<sup>64</sup> digits allow us to add up to 2<sup>13</sup> normalized
numbers before we need to worry about the high 13 bits overflowing.</p>

<p><em>Aside: Why 13 bits instead of 12?
For our purposes, we’re going to ignore the carries in the most significant limb,
allowing numbers to wrap when they overflow past 2<sup>256</sup> - 1 (just like
how unsigned addition works in C with normal size integer types).
As a result, we can assign 52 bits to the most significant limb and ignore the
fact that it will run out of room for carries before the other limbs do.</em></p>

<p>With this new representation, our addition code now looks like:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; Assume x is split across A, B, C, D, E (A = most significant)</span>
<span>; and assume y is split across F, G, H, I, J (F = most significant)</span>
<span>add</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>F</span>
<span>add</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>G</span>
<span>add</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>H</span>
<span>add</span> <span>D</span><span>,</span> <span>I</span>
<span>add</span> <span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>J</span>
<span>; Parallel goodness, yay!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Despite the fact that we now need 5 <code>add</code>s instead of 4,
addition is much faster due to the lack of carries.</p>

<p>Of course, we also need code to normalize a number by propagating carries.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nasm"><span>; Assume x is split across A, B, C, D, E (A = most significant)</span>
<span>; Register T is for temporary storage</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span> <span>; Copy E into T</span>
<span>shr</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>51</span> <span>; Shift out everything except the carries</span>
<span>add</span> <span>D</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span> <span>; Add carries from E into D</span>
<span>and</span> <span>E</span><span>,</span> <span>0x0007FFFFFFFFFFFF</span> <span>; Zero out the carries in E</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>D</span> <span>; Copy D into T</span>
<span>shr</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>51</span> <span>; Shift out everything except the carries</span>
<span>add</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span> <span>; Add carries from D into C</span>
<span>and</span> <span>D</span><span>,</span> <span>0x0007FFFFFFFFFFFF</span> <span>; Zero the carries in D</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>C</span> <span>; Copy C into T</span>
<span>shr</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>51</span> <span>; Shift out everything except the carries</span>
<span>add</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span> <span>; Add carries from C into B</span>
<span>and</span> <span>C</span><span>,</span> <span>0x0007FFFFFFFFFFFF</span> <span>; Zero the carries in C</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>B</span> <span>; Copy B into T</span>
<span>shr</span> <span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>51</span> <span>; Shift out everything except the carries</span>
<span>add</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>T</span> <span>; Add carries from B into A</span>
<span>and</span> <span>B</span><span>,</span> <span>0x0007FFFFFFFFFFFF</span> <span>; Zero the carries in B</span>

<span>and</span> <span>A</span><span>,</span> <span>0x000FFFFFFFFFFFFF</span> <span>; Zero the carries in A</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Amazingly, some quick and dirty benchmarks show that
<strong>radix 2<sup>51</sup> addition already outperforms radix 2<sup>64</sup>
addition on my Haswell CPU for as few as three additions – and that’s
including the cost of converting to and from
radix 2<sup>51</sup> representation</strong>.
The performance savings scale up appropriately as the number of additions
increases.</p>

<h2 id="subtraction">Subtraction</h2>

<p>So far we’ve only looked at addition.
It’s straightforward though to extend this technique to subtraction.
The main difference between addition and subtraction is that subtraction has
<em>negative</em> carries.</p>

<p>Previously, we treated all limbs (and their carries) as unsigned
integers.
To support subtraction, we can treat limbs as <em>signed</em> integers,
allowing individual digits to be either positive or negative.
With this change, each limb can store either a positive or negative carry.</p>

<p>A side effect of this is that the most significant bit of each limb is now
reserved as a sign bit.
This lowers the number of operations we can perform between normalizations from
2<sup>13</sup> to 2<sup>12</sup> – a small sacrifice in most cases.</p>

<p>I find this technique rather fascinating because of how counterintuitive it is:
by spreading data across more registers and using more operations, performance
is actually improved.
I hope you found it as interesting as I did!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/news/airlines/airlines-charging-solo-travelers-higher-fares/">https://thriftytraveler.com/news/airlines/airlines-charging-solo-travelers-higher-fares/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44128901">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Yesterday, we discovered that <a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/news/airlines/delta-pricing-quirk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta was charging solo and business travelers higher fares</a> per ticket than when booking for two or more passengers. But it turns out that pricing quirk goes far beyond just Delta.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we published that story, we've searched through hundreds of fares and found plenty of examples that prove it: <strong>All three of the country's largest carriers (American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta) are penalizing solo travelers with higher ticket prices than you can book when traveling with a group – sometimes, significantly higher.</strong></p>
<p>Our&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/premium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://thriftytraveler.com/premium/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Thrifty Traveler Premium</a></strong> team of flight deal analysts search hundreds of routes each day and confirms it's not exactly widespread – you won't see it on each and every route – but it's undeniable. And while it's unclear how long this pricing tactic has been utilized, it doesn't really matter: Whether it's been just days, months, or even years, it's something that few everyday travelers may realize is happening … or how much it might be costing them.</p>
<p>For example, a search for one passenger flying United from its Chicago-O'Hare (ORD) hub to nearby Peoria (PIA) next month yields a $269 one-way fare.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax.jpg" alt="united flight from chicago to peoria for $269" width="750" height="389" title="Exclusive: US Airlines Are Quietly Hitting Solo &amp; Biz Travelers with Higher Fares 1" srcset="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax.jpg 1872w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-300x156.jpg 300w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-768x399.jpg 768w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-1536x798.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20750%20389'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax.jpg 1872w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-300x156.jpg 300w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-1024x532.jpg 1024w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-768x399.jpg 768w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax-1536x798.jpg 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ord-pia-1-pax.jpg"></p>

<p>But bump that up to two (or three or even four) passengers, and the price drops by almost a third: <strong>Just $181 apiece for that exact same standard economy ticket.</strong> Plus, a <a href="https://thriftytraveler.com/guides/airlines/united-basic-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United basic economy</a> fare suddenly appears that's even cheaper – something that wasn't even an option when searching for just one passenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img decoding="async" src="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax.jpg" alt="united flights from chicago to peoria for $151" width="750" height="384" title="Exclusive: US Airlines Are Quietly Hitting Solo &amp; Biz Travelers with Higher Fares 2" srcset="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax.jpg 1886w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-300x154.jpg 300w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-1024x524.jpg 1024w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-768x393.jpg 768w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-1536x787.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20750%20384'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax.jpg 1886w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-300x154.jpg 300w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-1024x524.jpg 1024w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-768x393.jpg 768w, https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax-1536x787.jpg 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://thriftytraveler.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/united-ord-pia-2-pax.jpg"></p>

<p>You can see in the fine print below each fare exactly how United is doing this: by opening up different fare buckets based upon how many passengers you're booking for. When searching for one passenger, the lowest economy price is a Q economy fare – United's “discount coach” fare. But by searching for multiple travelers, you can pull in (even cheaper) S class fares, which United considers a “deep discount coach” ticket.</p>
<p>And much like Delta, this isn't a glitch. United spells it all out in the fare rules for these cheaper tickets, which are publicly accessible using an advanced airfare search engine like <a href="https://oldmatrix.itasoftware.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ITA Matrix</a>. It plainly states: “Must be accompanied on all sectors in same compartment by at least 1 adult 15 or older.”</p>

<p>There's no such “accompaniment restriction” on United's higher-priced single traveler fares.</p>
<p>Whether you'll run into pricier fares searching for one passenger instead of two is hit-or-miss, at least for now. So far, we've seen this pricing dynamic mainly on one-way domestic tickets – not roundtrip fares or long-haul international routes. And we haven't seen it on other major U.S. carriers like Alaska, JetBlue, or Southwest.</p>
<p>Airlines are notoriously secretive about the inner workings of how they price their fares and why. Case in point: <strong>No one from American, Delta, or United responded to requests for comment from Thrifty Traveler on this pricing strategy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In this case, the rationale for charging solo travelers more is fairly clear: It's just another way for airlines to continue “segmenting” their customers, charging business travelers paying with a corporate card more while offering a better deal to families on the exact same flight.</p>
<p>And it's even more egregious on this American Airlines flight from Charlotte (CLT) to Fort Myers (RSW) this fall. Traveling solo, you'll pay at least $422 fare for this one-way flight in economy on Oct. 13.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One last example shows airlines know what their competitors are up to.

<p>Yet the <strong>total price</strong> for two passengers is $215, or just $108 per passenger. Importantly, Google Flights always displays the total price for all passengers – not the cost per ticket. And while that cheapest fare is a basic economy ticket on both carriers, standard economy fares are still considerably cheaper when booking for two instead of just one.</p>

<p>Whenever this pricing strategy began, this is a massive change in how airlines set prices – and one that will likely catch many travelers off guard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike shopping at retail stores or Costco, bulk discounts are unusual for airlines – at least not just for booking just two passengers instead of one. And these higher fares for one passenger are&nbsp;the opposite of what we typically see, where travelers booking for two passengers or more wind up getting charged more per person than a single passenger.</p>
<p>That comes down to the mechanics of how airlines actually sell tickets: Carriers aren't just selling economy, extra legroom, and first class tickets but an alphabet soup of different fare classes, each at a different price. If there's only one fare available at the cheapest $118, searching for two would only yield fares at a higher, $199 price point.</p>
<p>This is a complete reversal. And solo travelers will be the ones who pay the price.&nbsp;</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 16:41:04 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://antirez.com/news/153">https://antirez.com/news/153</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44127739">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article data-comment-id="153-" id="153-"><span><span><a href="https://antirez.com/user/antirez">antirez</a></span> 1 hour ago. 17444 views.  </span><pre>This is a short story of how humans are still so much more capable of LLMs. Note that I'm not anti-AI or alike, you know it if you know me / follow me somewhere. I use LLMs routinely, like I did today, when I want to test my ideas, for code reviews, to understand if there are better approaches than what I had in mind, to explore stuff at the limit of my expertise, and so forth (I wrote a blog post about coding with LLMs almost two years, when it was not exactly cool: I was already using LLMs for coding and never stopped, I'll have to write an update, but that's not the topic of this post).

But, still: the current level of AI is useful, great too, but so incredibly behind human intelligence, and I want to remark this as lately it is impossible to have balanced conversations.

So, today I was working to Vector Sets for Redis, to fix a complicated bug: during the time I stopped working at Redis my colleagues introduced resistance against corruption RDB and RESTORE payloads, even when the checksum of the data passes. This feature is disabled by default, but provides an enhanced layer of safety for people wanting it.

But… there is a but as big as an elephant: In order to make HNSWs fast to save into Redis RDBs and to load back, I serialized the *graph* representation, and not the element-vector pairs, otherwise I would have to re-insert back data into HNSWs, and that would be, like, 100 times slower (!). So I store all the links the nodes have with other nodes, as integers, and then I resolve them into pointers, it’s a nice trick and works great. But if you mix this and random corruptions of the representation, and the fact that my own twist on HNSWs enforce reciprocal links between nodes (I wrote my own implementation of HNSWs with many useful features, but reciprocal links are needed to enable many of them) then this could happen:

1. We load corrupted data that says A links to B, but B no longer links to A (corrupted node IDs).
2. We delete node B: since the reciprocity is violated, we don’t clear the link from A to B.
3. Then we scan the graph and once we are at B we access A: use-after-free :-D :-) :-|

So after loading data, I need to check that every link is reciprocal, and in the vanilla case this is going to be O(N^2), for each node we need to scan all the levels, for each level all the neighbors of the node, and check that it also links to this node by scanning its links at that level. Not good.

# Human vs LLM

To start, I implemented the vanilla approach, to see if the fuzzer could no longer find the bug, and it worked indeed, but loading times for a big vector set with 20 million vectors went from 45 seconds to 90 or something. WTF. So I opened a Gemini 2.5 PRO chat and told the LLM, hey, what we can do here? Is there a super fast way to do so?

The best solution that Gemini could find was to say: order the pointers of the neighbors links, so you can use binary search. Oh, well, sure, I know this, I’m not really sure if in arrays of 16/32 pointers this is going to be faster or slower. So I asked, anything else? Nope, no better solution.

So I told it: look, what about when we see A linking B at level X we store in a hash table A:B:X (but we sort A and B always so that A&gt;B, and links are the same whatever the direction), and when we see the link again we clean it, this time we just scan the whole thing as we are already doing when resolving IDs to pointers in the links, and if at the end the hash table is not empty, we know there is some link that must be non-reciprocal?

Gemini told me it was a nice idea, but there was the snprintf() to create the key and the hashing time and so forth, but yep, it was better than what my original approach (even sorting pointers). I made it notice that snprintf() was not needed. We could just memcpy() pointers in a fixed sized key. It recognized that it was possible to do so, then I realized something…

Hey, I told Gemini, what about using a fixed accumulator for A:B:X? No hash table at all. Each time we see a link (A:B:X, so 8+8+4 bytes) we xor it in the current accumulator of 12 bytes. If we store it twice, it cancels out, so at the end if the register is non-zero, we know something is odd! However I anticipated Gemini that this system was potentially subject to collisions, and to evaluate them. Even if this feature is normally turned off in Redis, when users enable such extra checks they also often expect some more protection against an attacker deliberately crafting bad payloads.

Gemini was quite impressed about the idea, but still told that pointers are… you know, similar in structure, change of a few bits, so if there were three spurious links L1, L2, L3 it could happen that the xor between L1 and L2 was the same as the L3 bits, and we could have a false negative (zero register). I also noticed that allocators tend to be very predictable and externally guessable.

I asked Gemini for ways to improve upon this: it got no great ideas. Then I thought, wait, we can actually hash this with a good enough hash function that is still fast, murmur-128 or alike (we don’t need it to have cryptographic properties for this task), and proposed the following schema to Gemini:

1. Take the link A:B:X, but use a seed obtained via /dev/urandom to prefix all the keys with it, so we actually have S:A:B:X.
2. We just xor the output of murmur-128(S:A:B:X) into the 128 bit register.
3. At the end, we check if the register is 0 (all links reciprocal).

I asked Gemini to do an analysis of that, and it was finally happy, saying that this makes it a lot harder both to casually find orphaned links that happen to xor to 0 together, and even that an external attacker could ever use this in a useful way, since “S” is not known, there is to control the pointers too, and all that it is really hard to put together. Also, this feature is a best effort extra protection that you need to enable, it is normally off and to be practical it should not pose a too big performance penalty.

Well, all this to say: I just finished the analysis and stopped to write this blog post, I’m not sure if I’m going to use this system (but likely yes), but, the creativity of humans still have an edge, we are capable of really thinking out of the box, envisioning strange and imprecise solutions that can work better than others. This is something that is extremely hard for LLMs. Still, to verify all my ideas, Gemini was very useful, and maybe I started to think at the problem in such terms because I had a “smart duck” to talk with.</pre></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Opera Mini was first released in 2005 as a web browser for mobile phones, with the ability to load full websites by sending most of the work to an external server. It was a massive hit, but it started to fade out of relevance once smartphones entered mainstream use.</p><p>Opera Mini still exists today as a web browser for iPhone and Android—it's now just a tweaked version of the regular Opera mobile browser, and <a href="https://www.spacebar.news/stop-using-opera-browser/">you shouldn't use Opera browsers</a>. However, the original Java ME-based version is still functional, and you can even use it on modern computers.</p><h2 id="how-opera-mini-works">How Opera Mini works</h2><p>In the 1990s and 2000s, most mobile phones didn't have the processing power to load full desktop websites. Instead, an alternative <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol" rel="noreferrer">Wireless Application Protocol</a> (WAP, but not <em>that</em> WAP) was created for simple websites that could work over a 1G/2G connection on a typical mobile phone. For example, the BBC had a regular website for users on desktop computers, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/mobile/">a simpler WAP site</a> for users on mobile phones and PDAs. The WAP versions of websites usually didn't have all the functionality and pages as the regular sites.</p><p>Opera Mini used a clever workaround <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060618035344/http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2005/08/10/">when it arrived in 2005</a>. When you loaded a website in the browser, the request was sent to one of Opera's cloud servers, which rendered the page and sent the result back to the phone. Images and other data were also compressed along the way to minimize cellular data usage.</p><p>Here's part of the initial pitch for Opera Mini, with 'operators' referring to mobile network carriers:</p><blockquote>Because Opera Mini™ enables Web access on low- and mid-tier phones, operators can now dramatically increase the average revenue per user (ARPU) across their entire customer base by stimulating the usage of compelling mobile Web services. Opera offers full customization of Opera Mini™ to companies, for example operators, broadcasters, mobile content providers and the Internet industry, that would like to include their own version of Opera Mini™ as part of their mobile content offerings.<p>The first company to take advantage of Opera Mini™ is Norway's leading commercial television station, TV2. It has bundled Opera Mini™ with its mobile services in Norway to offer its viewers a complete mobile content package that includes a branded and advanced Web browser.</p></blockquote><p>Opera Mini was built as a standard Java Micro Edition (Java ME) application, so it worked on everything from the Motorola RAZR series to the Nokia 8800. It had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/opera-mini-now-has-169-million-users-56-of-them-only-use-the-mobile-web/">169 million users by 2012</a>, and Opera also built the browser for other platforms. I remember using Opera Mini on my iPhone 3G at one point—it was one of the first third-party browsers allowed on Apple's App Store, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2010/02/17/opera-mini-browser-for-iphone-being-demoed-at-mobile-world-congress/">because it wasn't actually running code on the phone</a>.</p><p>Eventually, smartphones with the ability to render full web pages became widespread, so fewer people had to turn to Opera Mini to get a usable mobile web experience. It still hasn't completely shut down, though.</p><h2 id="downloading-opera-mini-in-2025">Downloading Opera Mini in 2025</h2><p>Opera still advertises "Opera Mini for mobile phones" on <a href="https://www.opera.com/mobile/basic-phones">its website</a>, and asks you to visit <code>m.opera.com</code> to download the application file. On modern devices and browsers, that site redirects you to the current iPhone and Android browsers. You need to change <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent">your browser's user agent string</a> to an old phone to see the full list of downloads. I added a <a href="https://devtoolstips.org/tips/en/add-new-devices/">custom device in Firefox's developer tools</a> with the user agent string <code>Mozilla/5.0 (SymbianOS/9.1; U; [en]; Series60/3.0 NokiaE60/4.06.0) AppleWebKit/413 (KHTML, like Gecko) Safari/413</code> from a Nokia E60.</p><p>The 'Other download options' link on the page reveals all versions of Opera Mini and Mobile. This includes the regular Opera Mini Java ME browser, the Windows Mobile versions of Opera Mini and Mobile, Opera Mini for BlackBerry, and the Symbian OS versions of Opera Mini and Mobile. The Android and iPhone links just go to the app stores for each platform.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1298" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-2.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-2.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w2400/2025/02/image-2.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I unfortunately don't have a Java, Windows, or Symbian phone right now, but it is possible to run the Java ME version on a desktop computer. You need two tools for this: a Java runtime like OpenJDK or <a href="https://www.java.com/download/" rel="noreferrer">Oracle's Java</a>, and <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/microemulator/" rel="noreferrer">MicroEmulator</a> for running MIDlet-based apps like Opera Mini.</p><p>I installed <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/openjdk">Microsoft OpenJDK</a> on my Mac through the Homebrew cask, then opened MicroEmulator like this:</p><pre><code>java -jar /Users/corbin/Downloads/microemulator-2.0.4/microemulator.jar</code></pre><p>Finally, in MicroEmulator, I selected File &gt; Open MIDlet File and picked Opera Mini's .jad file. Opera Mini then appears in the application list, and clicking it starts the browser.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/Untitled-1.png" alt="MicroEmulator with a virtual phone keypad and Opera Mini on the main screen." loading="lazy" width="1298" height="1298" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/Untitled-1.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/Untitled-1.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/Untitled-1.png 1298w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Opera Mini works with regular mouse and keyboard input, so I turned off the virtual keypad interface and switched to a larger virtual screen. You can do this in MicroEmulator by navigating to Options &gt; Select device, selecting 'Resizable device' and clicking the OK button, then clicking the 'Resize' button in the main window. I chose a resolution of 854x480 to have a roughly 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><h2 id="the-opera-mini-experience">The Opera Mini experience</h2><p>Opera Mini starts up with a welcome page, explaining the features available in Opera Mini 8 like private browsing, data savings reports, browser tabs, long-click menus, and the classic Speed Dial bookmarks. Opera Mini 8 was the last major version for Java ME, <a href="https://forums.opera.com/topic/1256/opera-mini-8-for-java-and-blackberry">released in March 2014</a>. The version I downloaded is build 8.0.35626, and doesn't list a specific release date.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-8.png" alt="Opera Mini welcome page" loading="lazy" width="1932" height="1342" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-8.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-8.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-8.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-8.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After clicking Accept, we're greeted with the main browser interface and Speed Dial. The top of the screen has separate address and search bars, though you can also do a web search from the address bar.</p><p>The bottom section has back and forward navigation buttons, a shortcut to the Speed Dial, and a button for switching between tabs. There's also an Opera button that opens a menu with bookmarks, history, data usage, settings, finding text in the current page, sharing the current page, and closing the browser.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-9.png" alt="Opera Mini Speed Dial page with shortcuts to Google, Breaking News, Sports, and other links" loading="lazy" width="1932" height="1342" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-9.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-9.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-9.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-9.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>From here, you can start browsing the web like you would with any other web browser. I visited a bunch of sites, and all of them had at least some issues with the page layout and broken embeds. For example, a BBC news article had missing images but the text looked fine, while a review on <em>The Verge</em> had working images with broken text layouts. These are the same issues you get with any old browser, as support for modern CSS styles and other web features are missing and can't be rendered properly.</p><p>Opera Mini does seem to avoid the SSL certificate issues that are present on older web browsers and operating systems, because Opera's servers are acting as a proxy for all web content. I couldn't find a website that Opera Mini outright refused to load.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-10.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="Google homepage" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-10.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-10.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-10.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-10.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-12.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="BBC article with images not loading" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-12.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-12.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-12.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-12.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-13.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="The Spacebar home page, with some padding layout issues" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-13.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-13.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-13.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-13.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div><div><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-16.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="The Verge review with broken text and image alignment" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-16.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-16.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-16.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-16.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-17.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="MacRumors home page with no major layout issues" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-17.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-17.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-17.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-17.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-18.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="YouTube with blank area in video player" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-18.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-18.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-18.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-18.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>Many outdated or 'lite' websites do work perfectly in Opera Mini.

Clicking the ads didn't actually do anything. I'm not sure if that's an issue with MicroEmulator, or if this infrastructure simply broke a long time ago and Opera hasn't bothered to fix it.</p><figure><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-14.png" alt="TurboTax ad in Opera Mini." loading="lazy" width="1932" height="1342" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-14.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-14.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-14.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-14.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The settings page for Opera Mini contains a toggle for loading images, a 'Night Mode' that dims the interface, settings for the touch keyboard, and some image quality and font options. There's also a 'Network test' that just opens a blank page with a <code>server:setup</code> URL. I'm not sure if it's supposed to do something else.</p><p>There's a toggle for Private browsing as well, which wipes the history and other related browser data when you turn it off, and switches the browser to a dark theme. Of course, Opera's servers still sees (and renders) the full contents of all the web pages you visit, so calling this 'Private browsing' is even more of a stretch than the private browsing and incognito modes in other browsers.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-23.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="General settings page with checkboxes for Load Images, Single column view, Private browsing, and Night mode." srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-23.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-23.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-23.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-23.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-24.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="General settings page with options for Image quality, font size, and landscape mode." srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-24.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-24.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-24.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-24.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-25.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="Private browsing enabled with black browser interface" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-25.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-25.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-25.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-25.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><p>There is one cool feature here that most modern browsers are lacking: RSS feed integration. When you visit a website with an RSS feed, Opera Mini adds a link to it at the top of the page. Clicking it opens the feed in a reader interface, with the full text content of each feed item.</p><p>It seems like images are fully broken in the RSS reader, which is a shame, because otherwise this tends to work better than reading pages in the normal websites. You can subscribe to each feed, which adds it to the list in the bookmarks menu.</p><figure><div><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-27.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="Bing blog RSS feed in Opera Mini" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-27.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-27.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-27.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-27.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-28.png" width="1932" height="1342" loading="lazy" alt="List of feeds in Opera Mini" srcset="https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w600/2025/02/image-28.png 600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1000/2025/02/image-28.png 1000w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/size/w1600/2025/02/image-28.png 1600w, https://www.spacebar.news/content/images/2025/02/image-28.png 1932w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></figure><p>Many old web browsers had excellent RSS integration and built-in readers, like Safari and Internet Explorer, and I'd love to see that functionality make a comeback. In the meantime, I'll stick to Inoreader and Feedly.</p><h2 id="under-the-hood">Under the hood</h2><p>Opera Mini uses a modified version of the Presto engine, which was used in the full-featured desktop and mobile versions of Opera until the company <a href="https://press.opera.com/2013/02/13/opera-gears-up-at-300-million-users/">switched to a Chromium codebase in 2013</a>, but the rendering is happening on cloud servers instead of the local device. A quick visit to a user agent checker website reveals the below string.</p><pre><code>Opera/9.80 (J2ME/MIDP; Opera Mini/8.0.35626/191.376; U; en) Presto/2.12.423 Version/12.16</code></pre><p>Opera Mini is reporting itself to websites as Opera 12.16 with Presto engine 2.12.423, with "Opera Mini" and "J2ME/MIDP" also present so websites can detect the exact browser. Opera 12.16 was one of the last versions before the switch to Chromium—the "Opera 9.8" string was <a href="https://ztoe.net/2009/06/opera-98/">a hack used in Opera 10 and later</a> to avoid breaking websites that only checked the first digit of the user agent. The wild west of web development.</p><p>I was also curious where Opera Mini's servers are currently located. The <a href="https://showmyip.com/">showmyip.com</a> site reports a location of Amsterdam in The Netherlands, with IP addresses including <code>82.145.211.123</code> and <code>82.145.212.87</code>.

Notably, JavaScript code is only executed if it's part of the initial page load—after the page is rendered and sent to the device, nothing else can run.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>SAN FRANCISCO, CA — May 29, 2025</em> — ClickHouse, Inc., a leader in real-time analytics, data warehousing, observability, and AI/ML, today announced it has raised $350 million in Series C financing. The round was led by Khosla Ventures, with participation from new investors BOND, IVP, Battery Ventures, and Bessemer Venture Partners, as well as existing investors including Index Ventures, Lightspeed, GIC, Benchmark, Coatue, FirstMark, and Nebius. Today’s round follows earlier investments of over $300 million, bringing total funding to over $650 million.</p>
<p>This combined funding will be used to scale product development, support global expansion, and deepen partnerships with customers and technology providers building the next wave of AI-native applications. In addition to this financing, ClickHouse has secured a $100 million credit facility led by Stifel and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>The momentum behind ClickHouse is accelerating: the company grew over 300% during the past year and now serves over 2,000 customers across a range of industries from fintech and transportation to consumer and healthcare. New customers include Anthropic, Tesla, and Argentina’s Mercado Libre, among others. They join companies such as Sony, Meta, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Lyft, and Instacart, as well as AI innovators Sierra, Poolside, Weights &amp; Bases, Langchain, and more.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement was made at ClickHouse’s inaugural user conference, showcasing how enterprises are building data products to meet the demands of the agentic era.</p>
<p>“As AI agents proliferate across data-driven applications, observability, data infrastructure, and beyond, the demand for agent-facing databases like ClickHouse has reached an inflection point. The future of analytics isn’t just dashboards. It’s intelligent agents that interpret data, trigger workflows, and power real-time decisions,” said Aaron Katz, CEO of ClickHouse. “But AI is just one driver. We designed and built ClickHouse from day one to support a broad spectrum of real-time data applications across industries, and our momentum reflects that enterprises are hungry for a platform that can keep up with their scaling ambitions.”</p>
<p>“We invested in ClickHouse because they’re solving one of the most important infrastructure challenges of this era of AI and agents: enabling real-time data platforms that can support both traditional analytics and the growing demands of AI-native workloads,” said Ethan Choi, Partner at Khosla Ventures. “As AI reshapes every industry, the ability to deliver fast, scalable, and cost-efficient analytics is becoming foundational, ClickHouse is poised to become the default engine for next-generation intelligent data products.”</p>

<p>The market traction around ClickHouse is rooted in a fundamental shift: enterprises are no longer just building dashboards or batch reports—they are building real-time, intelligent data platforms that must serve both human and AI agents. Since AI agents can generate queries much faster and at a higher rate than human analysts, agent-facing databases must support low-latency, interactive analytical queries at an increasingly high throughput.</p>
<p>ClickHouse was designed from the ground up to meet this demand. Its high-performance, columnar storage engine enables interactive, analytical queries across massive datasets with minimal latency—perfect for powering AI and ML applications, real-time analytics, cloud data warehousing, and observability workloads.</p>

<p>Traditional databases and warehouses are struggling to keep up with this demand. Transactional databases don’t scale for analytical workloads. Meanwhile, traditional data warehouses are optimized for internal, batch-heavy use cases with limited concurrency and slow performance. Finally, search-oriented technologies become prohibitively expensive for structured analytics—using 10x more in storage and compute and limiting the practical range of applications due to cost.</p>
<p>By contrast, ClickHouse offers a purpose-built solution that bridges the gap—combining high-performance analytics with the scalability and concurrency that today’s intelligent, data-driven applications require.</p>

<p>ClickHouse is a fast, open-source columnar database management system built for real-time data processing and analytics at scale. Engineered for high performance, ClickHouse Cloud delivers exceptional query speed and concurrency, making it ideal for applications that demand instant insight from massive volumes of data. As AI agents become increasingly embedded in software and are generating far more frequent and complex queries, ClickHouse brings a high-throughput, low-latency engine, purpose-built to meet this challenge. Trusted by leading companies like Sony, Tesla, Anthropic, Memorial Sloan Kettering, Lyft, and Instacart, ClickHouse helps teams unlock insights and drive smarter decisions with a scalable, efficient, and modern data platform.

          <h2>The command line is for everyone</h2>
          <p>
            Software developers, sysadmins, tech workers, and regular Linux/macOS
            users all use the modern Unix/Linux command-line shells to get things
            done. What about you?
          </p>
          <h2>You don't have to read the entire shell manual</h2>
          <p>
            You don't have to read the entire shell manual or study bulky Linux
            bibles to get going. Understand the most common concepts and commands
            quickly instead with this short handbook.
          </p>
          <h2>It's not just about the shell</h2>
          <p>
            Terminals, shells, command-line applications, and shell scripting.
            Don't learn things separately when you can learn them together. Tips and tricks included.
          </p>
          <h2>Run commands with confidence</h2>
          <p>More than one hundred annotated shell sessions and code examples to explore and follow along. If this
            doesn't change your approach to the command line, nothing will.
          </p>
          <h2>Fresh out of press</h2>
          <p>This handbook is a culmination of 4 years of learning, writing, and rewriting. Updated in 2025 to
            be the best guidebook that you can get this year.
          </p>
          <h2>
            5700+ readers
          </h2>
          <p>
            You are in good company. Join more than five thousand others
            sharpening their command line skills with this handbook.

          <h2>From the author</h2>
          <p>
            I have been a long-time Linux and command-line user, but I didn't always use the command line to its full potential.
            Partially because I didn't know what I was missing and partially because the world of shells and terminals has evolved so much over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I designed this book to showcase the most essential things in the shortest possible time. The book will introduce you to the efficient usage of the command line, shells like Bash and Zsh, scripting, and many classic and modern programs that are available for the terminal today.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will get a beautiful, carefully curated PDF with almost 100 syntax-highlighted and annotated shell sessions and other examples. My hope
            is that you will be able to get that satisfying feeling of using the command line to its full potential.

        <div id="introduction">
            <h2> 2025-05-29 # Learning C3 </h2>
            <p>
                In this article, I describe my experience learning the <a href="https://c3-lang.org/" target="_blank">C3</a> programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've always been an avid computer programmer. I would say that I am most familiar with low level systems
                languages, though I have dipped into other programming languages from time to time. My journey here is
                motivated by curiosity. I am always curious to try new programming languages, which has resulted in
                learning a dozen or so within the past few years.
            </p>
            <p>
                With each new programming language I learn, I encounter a never-before-seen paradigm. Each language has
                it's own method of expressing ideas, and it's own status-quo for solving problems. I hope to learn what
                this means for C3, and what projects I would be likely to use it for.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's the disclaimer: I'm writing this article in "real-time", which is to say I am typing it up as I
                am learning C3. This means that I may have added insights about pain points and neat features that get
                glossed over or forgotten in other articles, yet it may also mean that my explanations and conceptual
                grasp of the language is reduced or faulty compared to other sources.

            <h2> What is C3? </h2>
            <p>
                According to the C3 website, C3 aims to build on and with C. It offers ergonomics, optimizations, and
                features. Some of these features may be difficult or impossible to express in standard C. These features
                include a module system, operator overloading, generics, compile time execution, semantic macros,
                an integrated build system, error handling, <code>defer</code>, value methods, associated enum data,
                distinct types &amp; subtypes, gradual contracts, built-in slices, <code>foreach</code>, dynamic calls &amp;
                types, <a href="https://c3-lang.org/getting-started/" target="_blank">and more</a>.
            </p>
            <p> Here are two other perspectives on what C3 is: </p>

        </div>

        <div id="language_overview">
            <h2> Language Overview: </h2>
            <p>
                It's hard for me to picture what the language is like without clear examples. For this section I will
                review the language reference online and share my thoughts on the language features C3 offers. I will
                not cover each and every feature of C3, as this isn't meant to be an introduction to C3.
            </p>

            <h3 id="hello_world"> Hello World: </h3>
            <pre><code>import std::io;

fn void main()
{
    io::printn("Hello, World!");
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                Hello world seems pretty straightforward. I can immediately see this reminds me of C, although I
                personally prefer having the opening brackets on the same line as the function declaration. In any case,
                it's best to follow the status-quo here as it helps you understand other C3 code, and helps other C3
                developers understand your code.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something to note about importing modules - According to the <a href="https://c3-lang.org/language-fundamentals/modules/#importing-modules" target="_blank">modules
                    page</a>, imports will recursively import submodules. C of course would do the same, and you might
                end up needing to deal with name collisions by renaming things deep down the <code>#include</code>
                chain. C3 fixes the name collision issue by requiring you to use a more full case to resolve collisions.
                For example, you would use <code>abc::Context</code> instead of <code>Context</code> if both imported
                modules <code>abc</code> and <code>de</code> have a structure named <code>Context</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I find it curious that the language requires the <code>fn</code> keyword to define the function here. I
                would think that the language could get away with avoiding that keyword like C does. On further thought,
                perhaps it is better to be more explicit that this is a function. Some reasons this may be is that the
                function declaration syntax could be used elsewhere, or C3 could allow nested function declarations. The
                first possibility seems more likely than the second, given that C3 is an evolution of C.

                The <a href="https://c3-lang.org/standard-library/#void-printx-void-printnx-" target="_blank">standard
                    print function</a> will print most types that are passed to it. That seems pretty nice! Definitely a
                step-up from C here. I can imagine that <code>print</code> debugging works great in this language.

                Taking a look at <a href="https://c3-lang.org/standard-library/#usz-printfstring-format-args-maydiscard" target="_blank">formatted printing</a>, it seems that C3 resembles C quite a bit here. For the
                <code>printf</code> function, <code>%s</code> is still used for strings, <code>%d</code> is still used
                for decimals, <code>%f</code> is still used for floats. Truly C3 is easing the transition for C
                programmers. Something unique to note here - it seems that the string formatter (<code>%s</code>) can be
                used to format certain non-string types as well - so an enum of type <code>Heat</code> with a value of
                <code>REALLY_WARM</code> would format itself as <code>REALLY_WARM</code> when you use the
                <code>%s</code> formatter.

                and <code>continue</code> work as you would expect. Iteration by reference is accomplished by prepending
                a <code>&amp;</code> (ampersand) to the variable name, as shown in the second example above. To me, foreach
                feels higher level than normal <code>for</code>. Don't misunderstand me - I love using foreach in other
                languages; the added syntax better expresses your intent, reducing logic errors. It did jump out at me
                as "this isn't C" though.

                Before C99, you had to declare the <code>for</code> loop variable outside of the <code>for</code> loop.
                As far as I know, you cannot declare variables inside of the <code>while</code> loop condition in C. It
                is nice to see the change here.

                C3 resembles C a lot here. I appreciate the implicit <code>break</code> that it offers. I'll have to see
                when I install the compiler, but I feel I would frequently confuse myself here with these implicit /
                explicit <code>break</code> rules. Perhaps C3 would benefit from polarizing itself a bit more. It would
                make more sense to me if all breaks were implicit (requiring <code>nextcase</code> for all multi-case
                scopes), or explicit. That being said, my initial view will surely adapt to fit the language when I
                start writing it for myself.

                Yes, that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff's_device" target="_blank">duff's device</a> in
                C3! No ugly hacks here, the <code>nextcase</code> keyword supports a (possibly runtime) case, as if
                <code>switch</code> were a jump table. Additionally, the <code>@jump</code> attribute will force the
                optimizing compiler to turn the switch into a jump table, if it did not already do that. I'm pleased to
                note that C3 had this capability *before* Zig. I wish that more languages had this "jump table" view of
                switch statements.

                Ahh, the <a href="https://c3-lang.org/language-overview/examples/#defer" target="_blank">defer</a>
                keyword. I've enjoyed this feature immensely in <a href="https://ziglang.org/" target="_blank">other
                    languages</a>. If you have never worked with <code>defer</code> before, then you are missing out!
                The feature allows for some amazing control flow capabilities. Essentially, all defer statements are
                invoked in reverse order on scope exit. They are primarily used to clean up resources that you have. I
                find the keyword is much easier to remember, as you always put a <code>defer</code> after claiming a
                resource that is only used in the current scope. Without the keyword, you are stuck remembering to clean
                up your resources at every possible scope exit point. In C, this frequently meant that there was a block
                at the end of the function with a <code>goto</code> label for cleaning up function resources. 10x better
                than C here.
            </p>
            <p>
                On further investigation, it seems like the common constructs <code>errdefer</code> and
                <code>okdefer</code> can be represented with <code>defer catch</code> and <code>defer try</code>
                respectively. This will be pleasant to use.

            <p>
                After a minute or two, it seems more obvious how this works. It appears that the "sub structs" aren't
                types, but an expression for how the data is stored / accessed with the structure. The anonymous
                <code>union</code> inside of the structure is of particular note; it seems to me that they offer a
                really clean way of implenting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union" target="_blank">tagged union</a>. You would only need to have an <code>enum</code> and anonymous

            <p>
                The <a href="https://c3-lang.org/language-common/optionals-essential" target="_blank">error handling
                    page</a> of the C3 website is very thorough. Below I have summarized what I have learned in a
                collection of C3 code snippets:
            </p>
            <pre><code>// Optional types are suffxed with a ?
int? a = 1; // Set the Optional to a result</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// When an Optional is empty it has an Excuse explaining what happened.
int? b = io::FILE_NOT_FOUND?; // Set the Optional to an Excuse type of "fault"</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// Faults are defined using the faultdef keyword
faultdef OOPS, LOTS_OF_OOPS, USER_ERROR;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// This function returns an Optional integer
fn int? get_value();</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// Return an Excuse by adding '?' after the fault.
return io::FILE_NOT_FOUND?;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// Check if an Optional is empty with "catch"
if (catch excuse = get_value()) // ...</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// If the scope is escaped after checking an Optional, the variable is
// automatically unwrapped for the remainder of the scope.
int? foo = unreliable_function();
if (catch excuse = foo) return excuse?; // Return excuse with the '?' operator
io::printfn("foo: %s", foo); // foo is guaranteed to be of type "int" here</code></pre>
            <pre><code>int foo = maybe_function()!;
// The rethrow operator "!" above is equivalent to the following:
int? foo = maybe_function();
if (catch excuse = foo) return excuse?;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// Optionals in expressions produce optionals
int? first_optional = 7;
// "int?" is required for the type below, unless unwrapped (maybe implicitly)
int? second_optional = first_optional + 1;</code></pre>
            <pre><code>// Optionals affect function return types
fn int test(int input) // ... omitted for brevity ...
int? optional_argument = 7;
int? returned_optional = test(optional_argument);
// The fuction is shortcut if any of it's non-Optional arguments can't be so</code></pre>
            <p>
                There's a lot to unpack here. It took me a while to understand how these optional types work. C3 seems
                to combine the roles of "error unions" and "optional types". In Zig this would be
                <code>error{SomeError}!i32</code> and <code>?i32</code>, while in Rust this would be
                <code>Result&lt;i32, SomeError&gt;</code> and <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This language decision will impact the way I think about error handling. I typically imagine "optional
                types" in these scenarios:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> A function can sometimes return a value. (eg. polling for some data)</li>
                <li> A stateful iterator function needs to mark when it is empty / completed. </li>
                <li> A lookup function fails to find a match. (eg. <code>hashmap.get()</code>) </li>
            </ol>
            <p> I likewise imagine "error unions" in these scenarios: </p>
            <ol>
                <li> A function is expected to return, but can fail. (eg. memory allocation) </li>
                <li> A function requires certain specified input, and reports invalid inputs. </li>
                <li> A property that is assumed to be true is false. (eg. runtime assertions) </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                With the roles combined, It seems harder to differentiate functions that are *expected* to return a
                value, versus functions that *can* return a value. While this is certainly a con, I would say that one
                pro of this approach is that you can avoid worrying about the distinction of the two split types when
                you are handling the return values of functions.

                website, this is a type of comment which is parsed. I have mixed feelings here. I personally think that
                a language only needs some well-placed (possibly runtime) asserts to handle inputs &amp; outputs. As noted
                on the website, these contracts allow for more than just runtime assertions. C3 will propagate these
                conditions up the call chain, and analyze them during compile time folding. C3 does not currently
                perform static analysis *beyond* compile-time folding though.

            <p>
                It feels a bit strange to me that the language has this third method of comments, given that many
                programming languages have only one or two comment types. This is trivial though, I expect that I will
                easily adapt.

                Macros are a bag of worms. Sure, they can be a great source of protein, but will you really see me
                eating them? I might use worms when I'm fishing, but I don't see much use for them around the home. To
                express my opinion outside of a metaphor: macros have niche use cases, are good at what they do, but
                shouldn't be abused. One example of this abuse would be making a turing-complete domain-specific
                language inside of some macro-supporting programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't dive too far into <a href="https://c3-lang.org/generic-programming/macros/" target="_blank">the
                    complexities</a> of C3's macros, but here's a brief overview of what I learned:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li> C3 macros act similar to C macros; they can be evaluated at compile-time. </li>
                <li> Macros can look like functions, but use <code>macro</code> instead of <code>fn</code>. </li>
                <li> Macros can't act in their caller's scope, so no declaring variables. </li>
                <li> Macros avoid the nasty <code>\</code> used for trailing macro lines in C. </li>
                <li> Macro parameters can be prefixed with <code>$</code>, meaning they are compile-time known. </li>
                <li>
                    Macro parameters can be prefixed with <code>#</code>, meaning the expression isn't yet evaluated.
                    When a variable is passed to a macro this way, it is evaluated once, then used directly where the
                    parameter is referenced. Pretty smart!
                </li>
                <li>
                    User-defined macros which use <code>$</code> or <code>#</code> parameters must be prefixed with
                    <code>@</code>. I like this - it means I can be confident whether a macro will screw up my AST.

                    Macros with only compile-time variables are completely evaluated at compile-time. This guarantee is
                    solid. As far as I know, C doesn't ensure this itself. Yes, it will expand all of your macros, but
                    the evaluation of the parts is up to the specific compiler you are using. As an extension to this,
                    type reflection and compile-time execution in the language is handled exclusively via macros.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Ok, that actually wasn't too bad. I guess I still have some stress from handling cursed macros in other
                language, such as Rust. Too much power and someone is bound to misuse it. C3 macros don't have quite the
                AST manipulation power of C, but they do have some really nice features in terms of compile-time
                evaluation. In my opinion, the macros in C3 are a good fit.

            <h3 id="type_properties"> Type Properties: </h3>
            <p>
                C3 <a href="https://c3-lang.org/language-overview/types/#compile-time-properties" target="_blank">has
                    built-in properties</a> for all types. These properties are avaliable through <code>.method</code>
                syntax. Some types have their own specific properties, yet there are a baker's dozen that all types
                share. Here they are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> <code>alignof</code> - The standard alignment of the type in bytes. </li>
                <li>
                    <code>kindof</code> - The category of type, e.g. <code>TypeKind.POINTER</code> /
                    <code>TypeKind.STRUCT</code>.
                </li>
                <li> <code>extnameof</code> - Returns a string with the extern name of the type, rarely used. </li>
                <li> <code>nameof</code> - Returns a string with the unqualified name of the type. </li>
                <li> <code>qnameof</code> - Returns a string with the qualified name of the type. </li>
                <li> <code>sizeof</code> - Returns the storage size of the type in bytes. </li>
                <li> <code>typeid</code> - Returns a runtime typeid for the type. </li>
                <li> <code>methodsof</code> - Retuns the methods implemented for a type. </li>
                <li> <code>has_tagof(tagname)</code> - Returns true if the type has a particular tag. </li>
                <li> <code>tagof(tagname)</code> - Retrieves the tag defined on the type. </li>
                <li> <code>is_eq</code> - True if the type implements <code>==</code>. </li>
                <li> <code>is_ordered</code> - True if the type implements comparisons. </li>
                <li> <code>is_substruct</code> - True if the type has an inline member. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                These properties appear to be very helpful for metaprogramming. In the Zig language, one would need to
                use <code>@typeInfo</code> on the type to get this information. I imagine that it would be harder for me
                to realize that type reflection is occuring in the code, however alluring the ease of access.

            <p>
                C3 supports <a href="https://c3-lang.org/language-overview/types/#base64-and-hex-data-literals" target="_blank">base64 and hex data literals</a>. Personally I don't see the appeal, as <a href="https://c3-lang.org/generic-programming/compiletime/#embed" target="_blank">the
                    <code>$embed</code> macro</a> would fulfill my common use-case for this. I imagine that a macro
                could accomplish the same thing as these types of literals. Honestly not too happy about this feature, I
                think it's trying to add language sugar for something that isn't often used.
            </p>
            <pre><code>char[*] hello_world_base64 = b64"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh";
char[*] hello_world_hex = x"4865 6c6c 6f20 776f 726c 6421";</code></pre>
            <p>
                While not quite as bad as Rust, I do feel hesitant about the string situation overall in C3. I agree a
                lot with the C &amp; Zig approach that "all strings are just bytes", rather than different syntaxes and
                types for representing the encoding or capability of a string type.
            </p>

            <h3 id="primitives"> Primitives: </h3>
            <p>
                C3 has several primitive types. These include integers, booleans, and floats. The types are essentially
                equal to C, except <code>char</code> is defined to be unsigned. That's a big pro, considering C leaves
                char signedness up to the compiler. There are additionally 128 bit integers <code>int128</code> and
                <code>uint128</code>, which are also pleasant to see. It's not often that you reach for a 128 bit
                integer, but when you do, you appreciate it.
            </p>
            <p>
                C3 has the types <code>iptr</code>, <code>uptr</code>, <code>isz</code>, and <code>usz</code>. They are
                signed respectively according to the letter prefix, whether it be <code>i</code> or <code>u</code>. I
                feel these types are a bit shorter than they should be. The keystrokes that are saved by typing two or
                three fewer letters don't quite outweigh the cost of reading the code, at least for someone who is
                unfamiliar with the notation.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do appreciate that the bit size of the other primitive types are well defined - it offers another
                improvement over C, where your <code>int</code> could be as small as 16 bits.
            </p>

                not many people use it yet. I couldn't find any package for it on gentoo, so I'll probably build it from

            <h3 id="new_project"> Creating a new project: </h3>
            <p>
                C3's compiler reminds me a lot of Zig's compiler. Both allow initializing projects
                (<code>c3c init</code> / <code>zig init</code>), building their respective projects
                (<code>c3c build</code> / <code>zig build</code>), and of course, compiling source files that don't
                belong to a project (<code>c3c compile</code> / <code>zig build-exe</code>). I'll use a project here.
            </p>
            <pre><code>retrodev@lime ~/repos/C3 $ c3c init hello_world
Project 'hello_world' created.</code></pre>
            <p>
                From the <code>c3c init</code> command, we can see that a directory for the project is created,
                including a lot of files that would otherwise be boilerplate. Both <code>LICENSE</code> and
                <code>README.md</code> are empty. <code>project.json</code> contains the project configuration,
                including source files, targets to build, optimization and target settings, and more.

                Yep. That's kinda what I was expecting. Overall I agree that the folder structure is helpful here - it
                establishes a status-quo for new users of C3. I do find it strange that C3 would create an empty
                <code>LICENSE</code> file though. I initially expected to find a general permissive licence, and was
                surprised when <code>ls</code> displayed the file as 0 bytes. That might have bitten me if I didn't
                notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at the generated main.c3 file:
            </p>
            <pre><code>module hello_world;
import std::io;

fn int main(String[] args)
{
    io::printn("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                Oh! this is pleasant. The conciceness reminds me of the default <code>main.rs</code> file from
                <code>cargo new</code>. I'd consider this an improvement on Zig, which by default will create a template
                stuffed to the brim with comments and example code. Zig's template is useful for beginners, but
                painfully verbose. I also hadn't realized that C3's <code>String</code> is title case. I'm not sure how
                I feel about that - it makes <code>String</code> feel more abstract than an <code>int</code>, which I
                suppose it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's compile and run this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>retrodev@lime ~/repos/C3/hello_world $ c3c run
Program linked to executable 'build/hello_world'.

            <p>
                To better document this learning experience, I'll attempt to make a basic calculator in C3. I expect it
                to handle addition <code>+</code>, subtraction <code>-</code>, multiplication <code>*</code>, division
                <code>/</code>, negation (also <code>-</code>), exponentiation <code>^</code>, and parenthesis

                Writing this form of calculator will test my knowlege of C3. I will need to know how to make and call
                functions (especially for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser" target="_blank">recursive descent parser</a>), how to get user input, how to do basic math with
                floats, and how to print to the terminal. I have a rough idea of how I want the code to look like, but
                the point here is to find and document what I find amazing - and not so amazing - about my experience
                learning C3. The internet is too full of armchair experts. Only my hands-on experience will provide me
                with an opinion worth sharing.

                As with any language, you trip when you transition from *reading* the language to actually *using* the
                language. In this case, I had neglected to read much of the "memory management" documentation for C3, so
                I needed to learn how allocators are currently used in C3:
            </p>
            <pre><code>module calculator;
import std::io;

fn int main()
{
    @pool()
    {
        io::printf("Enter an equation: ");
        String? equation = io::treadline();
        if (catch equation) return 1;
        io::printfn("Your equation: %s", equation);
    };
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                There are currently <a href="https://discord.com/channels/650345951868747808/927010276128202762/1377463685416616036" target="_blank">two default</a> allocators used in code. (This isn't a link to the language
                reference, because it is updated by hand and this section is currently out of date.) These allocators
                are <code>tmem</code> and <code>mem</code>. <code>tmem</code> is a "temporary" allocator, acting as an
                <a href="https://www.rfleury.com/p/untangling-lifetimes-the-arena-allocator" target="_blank">arena
                    allocator</a>. The context for the temporary allocations is marked by the macro <code>@pool</code>.
                This macro will free items allocated with <code>tmem</code> at the end of the defined scope. Several
                functions in the C3 standard library are prefixed with "t", representing that they use the temporary
                allocator under the hood. These functions are alternatives to non-prefixed functions, which take an
                allocator parameter.
            </p>
            <p>
                C3 feels like a balance of Zig and C in this instance. It is common practice in Zig to pass allocators
                to every function, so you can know what function may allocate memory, and pick the most effective
                allocator for the job. It is common in C to use only one allocator - namely the standard library
                allocator - through <code>malloc</code>, <code>calloc</code>, and <code>free</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                One more thing to note here are the return values of functions. Many C compilers will allow you to
                create the standard <code>int main()</code> function, then allow you to omit returning a value from it.
                The compilers I am talking about will implicitly return <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> (0 on all systems I
                know of) for you. C3 mandates returning a value from this function. It will give me an error if I fail
                to return a value:
            </p>
            <pre><code> 1: module calculator;
 2: import std::io;
 3: 
 4: fn int main()
           ^^^^
(/home/retrodev/repos/C3/calculator/src/main.c3:4:8) Error: Missing return statement at the end of the function.</code></pre>
            <p>
                C3 will also allow me to mark the main function as <code>void</code>, so this isn't bothersome. While
                it's not standard according to ISO C, some C compilers also allow you to define the main function as
                <code>void</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Referencing the C3 code again, the <code>io::printf</code> and <code>io::printfn</code> functions return
                a value that the compiler does not require me to handle. C3 allows it's users to skip checking the
                return value here. This may introduce points of (admittedly very unlikely) failure into a program that
                are hard to identify, for the benefit of ease-of-programming. This is normal C behavior here. Also like
                in C, C3 will allow you to explicitly discard function return values by prefixing the function call with
                <code>(void)</code>. <code>EDIT: The functions here can be implicitly discarded because they have been annotated with @maydiscard. On the flip side, there is also @nodiscard.</code>

            <h3 id="tokenizer"> The tokenizer: </h3>
            <p>
                So we are making a calculator? That's quite a bit to do. Let's take a bigger leap this time. Here's my
                code for tokenizing the input:
            </p>
            <pre><code>module calculator;
import std::io;
import std::collections::list;

enum TokenTag: char
{
    // Final Token
    DELIMITER,
    // Operators
    ADD,
    SUBTRACT,
    MULTIPLY,
    DIVIDE,
    POWER,
    // Operator precedence
    LEFT_PAREN,
    RIGHT_PAREN,
    // Number literal
    NUMBER,
}

struct Token
{
    TokenTag tag;
    float number;
}

faultdef INVALID_TOKEN; 

// Convert an input string into a list of tokens that define our equation
fn Token[]? tokenize(Allocator allocator, String equation)
{
    List {Token} token_list;
    token_list.tinit();
    defer token_list.free();
    
    // Scan through the string; most bytes should be one token.
    for (usz idx = 0; idx &lt; equation.len; idx += 1)
    {
        switch (equation[idx])
        {
            case ' ': continue; // Skip whitespace
            case '+': token_list.push({.tag = ADD});
            case '-': token_list.push({.tag = SUBTRACT});
            case '*': token_list.push({.tag = MULTIPLY});
            case '/': token_list.push({.tag = DIVIDE});
            case '^': token_list.push({.tag = POWER});
            case '(': token_list.push({.tag = LEFT_PAREN});
            case ')': token_list.push({.tag = RIGHT_PAREN});
                
            default:
                // We probably have a number - parse it:
                usz start = idx;
                usz end = idx;

                // Scan digits and radix points from this position
                for (; end &lt; equation.len; end += 1)
                {
                    char x = equation[end];
                    if (x != '.' &amp;&amp; (x &lt; '0' || x &gt; '9')) break;
                }

                // This is true if we didn't parse a number
                if (start == end) return INVALID_TOKEN?;

                // Slicing indexes are inclusive on both ends
                float? number = equation[start..end - 1].to_float();
                if (catch number) return INVALID_TOKEN?;
                token_list.push({NUMBER, number});

                // Update the index so we don't re-parse the number
                idx = end - 1;
        }
    }

    token_list.push({DELIMITER, {}});
    return token_list.to_array(allocator);
}

fn int main()
{
    @pool()
    {
        io::printf("Enter an equation: ");
        String? equation = io::treadline();
        if (catch equation) return 1;

        Token[]? tokens = tokenize(tmem, equation);
        if (catch tokens) return 1;

        io::printn("[");
        foreach (Token t : tokens)
        {
            io::printf("    %s", t.tag);
            if (t.tag == NUMBER) io::printf(": %f", t.number);
            io::printn(",");
        }
        io::printn("]");
    };
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                Ok bear with me - This was a lot of code all at once. This code essentially gets the equation from the
                user, splits that into a list of "tokens" (parts of the equation), then prints out those tokens. Here is
                an example program output:
            </p>
            <pre><code>Enter an equation: 2+3 * (-7/-4) ^ 3.14
[
    NUMBER: 2.000000,
    ADD,
    NUMBER: 3.000000,
    MULTIPLY,
    LEFT_PAREN,
    SUBTRACT,
    NUMBER: 7.000000,
    DIVIDE,
    SUBTRACT,
    NUMBER: 4.000000,
    RIGHT_PAREN,
    POWER,
    NUMBER: 3.140000,
    DELIMITER,
]</code></pre>
            <p> This representation of the math equation will be perfect for the parser. </p>
            <p>
                I'm sorry to say that I struggled quite a bit while writing this code. A lot of my struggles were not
                due to the language itself, but the lack of features that the language server offers. Code completion
                and jumping to definitions (in the standard library) just doesn't work. This should improve as the
                language matures.
            </p>
            <p>
                One more confusing aspect of C3 is it's slicing. The syntax is of the form
                <code>some_string[start..end]</code>, where both the start and end indexes are inclusive. This isn't
                consistent with most of the other programming languages I know, and it requires that I take the end
                index (exclusive) and subtract one for the slice. It also means I have to make sure I don't accidentally
                form a slice of negative length (the check above it). One other side effect of this language design
                choice is that I can't create a slice of length 0 this way. This confuses me.
                <code>EDIT: C3 has built-in slice-by-length syntax of the form some_string[start:length], which is status-quo here.</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                To list the positives though, it is nice how convenient the <code>List</code> type is, which is supplied
                by C3's standard library. In C I normally use a prebuilt library of mine for this purpose, or I need to
                manually track my allocations, which isn't fun.
            </p>
            <p>
                The familiar C <code>for</code> loops formed the meat of the tokenizer
                algorithm, and the <code>foreach</code> loop worked great for printing out the token types! In more
                complex tokenizers I may have been able to use the advanced <code>nextcase</code> statement (my
                tokenizers / parsers seem to turn into a FSM after a while). The control flow in this language is really
                nice to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was one more thing I really didn't expect to find - the temporary allocator (<code>tmem</code>)
                could be used at the same time as the passed allocator for the <code>tokenize</code> function. This is
                interesting because you can use it for code that you need allocator assurances for. If I were to make
                this in Zig, I would either have to request a single allocator that worked both for the tokenization and
                return value, or request two allocators, and hope that the user would supply an efficient allocator for
                the intermediate process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Side note: I really wouldn't use Rust for it's allocator flexibility - it wasn't designed to have any
                flexibility in this area, making it hard to use with custom allocators. C3 does very well here.
            </p>
            <p> Let's finish this. </p>

            <h3 id="parser"> The parser: </h3>
            <p>
                Compared with the tokenizer, the parser was much easier to write. This is likely because I overcame the
                initial hurdle of writing code in the language. I'm pretty pleased with how simple it is! Here's the
                complete program (minus the tokenizer):

                Earlier in this article, I expressed some concern about the error system. With this small example, I
                found that it worked out well. I was able to write the code nearly the same as if an error would never
                occur, trusting that it would get "bubbled-out" in the case that someone goofed up. 100% an improvement
                on C, yet again.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also found that the <code>nextcase</code> keyword worked very well in both the <code>expression</code>
                and <code>term</code> functions. The same can be accomplished with a normal while loop with the switch,
                but this way it seems cleaner to me :)

        <div id="conclusion">
            <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
            <p>
                C3 reminds me of C. The flavor lingers in my mouth, yet I don't sense the same aftertaste. It isn't
                perfect though, I cut myself a few times. It is fun to work with. This language is simpler than C++ and
                Rust. This language is faster to develop in than Rust, C++, and Zig. This language is safer and more
                expressive than C.
            </p>
            <p>
                Would I use this language daily? I don't think so. It is a good alternative to C, where projects that
                would otherwise be written in C could be written here. I think personally I prefer working with Zig, and
                that's alright. Zig holds a special place in my heart, and it won't give up easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                C3 has loads of potential. Already I've seen this in my very short time using it. Yes, I will continue
                to use it. I haven't even tried to (ab)use the macro system yet, nor have messed with some of the more
                complex features that C3 has, such as it's dynamic interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                The C3 source code is very readable. While in the making of this article, I was able to read the source
                code of many parts of the standard library with ease. Lots of languages with macros seem like
                navigating a non-euclidean labrynth, where the entrance and exit keep running away from you. The C3
                macro system is well built, kindof feeling like a hybrid of Zig's comptime system and C's macros. I
                prefer it to other macro systems, hands down.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some things which I would rather not have in this language. These include inclusive slicing
                syntax, and the error system still doesn't quite sit right with me. Perhaps these will be fixed in the
                next update!
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you to <code>is_human_ (1075947477913567294 on discord)</code> for all the wonderful answers you
                supplied to me while I was trying this language out. Thank you to Christoffer for making this language,
                you are certainly more talented than I am: the compiler source code shows it.
            </p>

    <h2>I started a little math club in Bangalore.</h2>
    <h3>Why</h3>
    <p>
      Since finishing college a few years ago, studying math has been a mostly solitary pursuit for me.
      While I enjoy exploring new concepts and solving problems on my own, I often miss the collaborative spirit of my
      academic days.
      Back then, my friends and I would gather to discuss homework problems, share insights, and learn from each other.
      There was a unique joy in exploring ideas together, something that’s hard to replicate alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d love to bring back that sense of community, where math isn’t just an isolated exercise but a shared
      experience.
    </p>
