<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="canvas">
  <p>The proposal of the European Commission for <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM%3A2022%3A209%3AFIN">a
  regulation on preventing and combatting the sexual abuse and sexual
  exploitation of children</a> is <a href="https://www.tweedekamer.nl/debat_en_vergadering/uitgelicht/rondetafelgesprek-over-technieken-om-online-kindermisbruik-te">currently
  discussed</a> in Dutch parliament. I recently wrote <a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2023/08/26/end-to-end-encryptie-en-risico-s-client-side-scanning/index.html">about
  some concerns</a> and <a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2023/10/04/ddos-ing-client-side-scanning/index.html">the
  risk of a DDoS attack</a>. It turns out it is also possible to taint
  the database of images of known child sexual abuse material (CSAM),
  allowing an adversary to trick the client-side scanning system to also
  trigger an alarm for other, non CSAM, material. Client side scanning
  could thus be vulnerable to <em>undetectable</em> function creep.</p>
  <p>Client-side scanning works by matching images on a user device
  against the fingerprints stored in this central database. There is no
  independent way for the service providers or the devices to verify
  that the fingerprints in this data actual correspond to CSAM.
  Therefore the devices have to fully trust this database that this is
  indeed the case. As such the proposal already suffers from a
  significant risk of <em>function creep</em>, as the scope of the
  fingerprints contained in the database could be extended to allow the
  detection of other material, like those propagating terrorism or other
  hateful or abusive content. To be clear this is absolutely out of
  scope of the current proposal for a regulation that is strictly
  limited to the prevention of the spread of CSAM. But other legislation
  could be enacted in the future to broaden the scope, without any need
  to change anything to the detection system already in place to detect
  CSAM. This significantly lowers the barrier to enact such legislation.
  Hence the risk of function creep. But at least any push for such
  function creep will happen in plain sight.</p>
  <p>I am more concerned about an <em>surreptitious</em> form of
  function creep that appears to crop up with client-side scanning.</p>
  <p>Clearly, as new CSAM is being discovered, its spread needs to be
  prevented by adding the fingerprints of this newly discovered CSAM to
  the database. Strict procedures are (purportedly) in place to
  guarantee that only fingerprints of known CSAM are added to this
  database. (Otherwise, fingerprints of other offensive content could
  easily be added.)</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it is <em>impossible</em> to guarantee this.</p>
  <p>Consider an entity that is allowed to propose new entries to the
  CSAM database. A <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity23/presentation/prokos">recent
  paper</a> by Jonathan Prokos <em>et. al.</em>, shows that it is
  possible for an attacker to create a variant of some arbitrary source
  image that matches some target fingerprint. A <em>malicious</em>
  entity could <em>surreptitiously</em> taint the database with other
  offensive content using these techniques as follows:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>It takes an image <span><em>A</em></span> of
  some offensive content, not being CSAM, for which it wants to add a
  fingerprint to the database. The entity keeps <span><em>A</em></span> secret.</li>
  <li>It computes its fingerprint <span><em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>. (Although the
  algorithms to compute this are proprietary, researchers have reversed
  engineered the commonly used PhotoDNA algorithm, and a binary
  implementation of PhotoDNA is available to compute the
  fingerprint.)</li>
  <li>It creates a convincingly looking synthetic variant of CSAM using
  recent AI techniques (or waits until it discovers a new image as being
  CSAM). Call this image <span><em>B</em></span>.</li>
  <li>Using the techniques from Prokos <em>et. al.</em>, it subtly
  modifies this source image <span><em>B</em></span>
  to create another image <span><em>B</em>′</span>
  whose fingerprint <span><em>F</em>(<em>B</em>′)</span> matches the target
  fingerprint <span><em>F</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>.
  In other words <span><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>′) = <em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>.
  Note that the modifications to <span><em>B</em></span> do <em>not visibly alter</em>
  the image, so <span><em>B</em>′</span> will still
  pass as CSAM.</li>
  <li>The malicious entity submits the altered image <span><em>B</em>′</span> to the database.</li>
  <li>Because <span><em>B</em>′</span> is visibly
  indistinguishable from <span><em>B</em></span>,
  which was constructed or selected to be CSAM, the fingerprint <span><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>′)</span> of <span><em>B</em>′</span> is accepted for inclusion in
  the database.</li>
  <li>But as by construction <span><em>f</em>(<em>B</em>′) = <em>f</em>(<em>A</em>)</span>,
  the malicious entity has now successfully ensured that the client-side
  scanning algorithm will also report any occurrence of <span><em>A</em></span> (the non-CSAM but otherwise
  deemed offensive image) to the abuse centre.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This shows that the database can be tainted with non-CSAM material
  by an entity that can submit entries to it. In the case of the
  proposed European regulation these are the Coordinating Authorities
  set up by each of the member states. Some of the member states
  (Hungary and Poland, for example) have shown certain authoritarian
  streaks, and should perhaps be less trusted with this new detection
  capability…</p>
  <p>The above attack is theoretical. The real question is of course
  whether this Would be an issue in practice?</p>
  <p>Suppose the database is tainted with image <span><em>A</em></span> (deemed offensive, but
  <em>not</em> being CSAM) as above. Then any person about to send this
  image will be notified that the scanner detected a possible case of
  CSAM, and that a report has been filed with the central reporting EU
  centre. Even though the EU Centre will quickly determine this is
  <em>not</em> a case of actual CSAM, this could still lead to chilling
  effects, as people may feel reluctant to use messaging apps to discuss
  anything sensitive as there is a (perceived) risk of being reported to
  the central EU Abuse centre. Even if this happens only
  occasionally.</p>
  <p>To really judge the impact of this attack in practice, it is
  important to also look at what happens when such a report is filed
  with the abuse centre. The report contains the image <span><em>A</em></span> (offensive perhaps, but not
  CSAM) and the fingerprint against which it matched. The abuse centre
  will look op the image <span><em>B</em>′</span>
  corresponding to the fingerprint (constructed by the malicious entity
  which looks like CSAM) and immediately conclude that <span><em>A</em></span> does not look at all like <span><em>B</em>′</span> and also is not CSAM. One could
  conclude that the abuse centre could thus easily spot the malicious
  entry in its database after a few of these reports all concerned with
  the same image, and delete the corresponding fingerprint from the
  database. If that were the case, this avenue of attack would not be a
  problem in practice. This assumes, however, that the abuse centre
  keeps track of such false positives over time to detect such
  maliciously uploaded fingerprints. This may or may not be the
  case.</p>
  <p>Moreover, we cannot consider this particular attack and its
  potential mitigation in isolation: we also need to consider other
  avenues of attack, and whether the mitigation proposed above perhaps
  <em>enables</em> other forms of attack. This brings us back to the
  DDoS attack on client-side scanning that <a href="https://blog.xot.nl/2023/10/04/ddos-ing-client-side-scanning/index.html">I
  wrote about earlier</a>. Because that attack essentially uses the
  possibility to find fingerprint collisions in the opposite direction:
  it creates an innocent image whose fingerprint matches the fingerprint
  of known CSAM in the database. As discussed</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Removing these fingerprints from the database is clearly not an
  option, as this would prevent the detection of <em>actual</em> CSAM
  that matches these fingerprints.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So here we find the EU abuse centre confronted with an image that
  is clearly not CSAM, but perhaps could be considered offensive to
  certain governments. How does it determine whether the fingerprint
  being matched belongs to actual CSAM (uploaded in good faith) or
  synthesised (uploaded maliciously)? The judgement would be highly
  contextual and be wrong ever so often. The mere fact that a particular
  fingerprint is or is not the target of a DDoS attack (the number of
  matches could give at least that away) does not necessarily offer any
  resolution. And even a non-CSAM image that is uploaded only
  occasionally but that triggers the client-side detection system could
  just as well be an image constructed to match the fingerprint of
  actual CSAM, just to try to trick the abuse centre into removing the
  fingerprint from the database.</p>
  <p>Also note that if the client-side scanning system would be
  structured slightly differently, with reports of possible CSAM only
  being forwarded to certain authorities (e.g.&nbsp;when reports concerning a
  Hungarian user would only be forwarded to the Hungarian authorities),
  this form of function creep <em>would not</em> necessarily be
  detected. This shows that the overall design of the full client-side
  scanning system, including the way reports are handled, matters a
  lot.</p>

Companies see their idiot friends creating AI and they want a piece of that hype hype yum yum so they do it too. For example:</p><p><span>Here’s </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/ai-boom-full-copycats-trying-ride-viral-trend-thats-not-bad-business.html" rel="">some article about it</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>Jason Corsello, CEO and general partner of Acadian Ventures, a venture firm focused on the future of work startups, explained that A.I. remains tantalizing for investors, even amid the </span><a href="https://www.inc.com/sam-blum/the-vc-market-has-never-been-worse-that-doesnt-mean-you-cant-get-startup-funding.html" rel="">historic downturn</a><span>. That may not be a good thing for startups, he cautions. "This area of A.I. is somewhat overhyped. It's over-invested, it's overvalued. When you're seeing seed-stage companies raise between $100 million and $150 million with nothing more than a pitch deck, that's a bit concerning."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the froth isn't unfamiliar. The A.I. boom, and the crush of startups now competing for success, could be a product of </span><strong>copycat logic</strong><span>. </span><strong>As money is pumped into new firms, nobody wants to be left out</strong><span>, Oded Shenkar, a professor of management and human resources at Ohio State University, explains. "It's a common error to think of startups always as innovators," he says, "when you have a gold rush, of course, you're going to have more imitation."</span></p></blockquote><p>Ah ok great so basically all the companies are playing copycat with Daddy Andreesen's Money Slush until something dumb happens and one of them gets super rich? </p><p>Cool. </p><p>Meanwhile, the people must endure

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>YC seems like a reasonable proposition. They give you some money to help you start your business, and they promise you access to a community of people that can help you along the way. In exchange, they only ask for a small amount of equity. Doesn’t sound that bad, no?</p><p>But by the end of this post I will convince you that it’s actually a terrible idea.</p><p>First, you have to understand a very important concept: in some systems, what’s best for a group is not necessarily what’s best for the individuals who make up the group. In other words, the total wealth of a group of people could be increasing, while almost everyone making up that group could be seeing their wealth diminish. When this happens, we say we have a non-ergodic system. If the system was ergodic, what’s happening to the collective would also translate to all individuals.</p><p><span>Silicon Valley is a non-ergodic industry (like Hollywood, book publishing, the music industry, and even your country’s economy unless you’re under full-blown communism.) A non-ergodic system is not necessarily bad, but if you’re not cognizant of the system you’re in, you’re going to be played like a fiddle. Those who benefit from the collective will take advantage of you, while you (as the individual) lose out. This is what YC will try to do to you. In fact, this is what YC </span><em>has</em><span> to do; otherwise it won’t survive. Let me explain. </span></p><p>Imagine you’re told there’s a bunch of hidden treasures within a 100 acre area. What’s the best strategy for finding some of these treasures?</p><p>One way is to pick a spot, and dedicate your entire life digging as far down as possible on that one spot. You might reason that the deeper the treasure, the bigger the loot. You don’t want to settle for a measly small treasure box. You want the full chest of diamonds buried near the end of the earth’s crust. This is your shot at glory.</p><p>Another way is to use a search method employed by search and rescue teams. You divide the area into small squares, and do a “reasonable search” in each one. You use probabilities and some common sense to help guide you how deep to dig, and then you move to the next square. If you encounter undisturbed compacted dirt, chances are there’s no treasure beneath. If you run into bedrock, it’s almost certain there’s nothing below. So you use that information and move on. Your goal is to search the entire area where there’s probable treasure as quickly as possible. Ideally within your lifetime.</p><p>I’m sure you agree with me that the first way is a dumb strategy. Almost every digger employing this strategy will die treasure-less. But actually, it’s only dumb for that individual treasure hunter. For a gold mining company, this is the optimal strategy.&nbsp;The company only needs one miner to hit jackpot, and all the other miners can die penniless. If the cost of sacrificing an individual treasure hunter is low, the most optimal strategy is to get tens of thousands of treasure hunters, allocate hundreds of them per acre, and make them dig all the way down to the earth’s core. The treasure hunting economy would grow much bigger than if all the individual treasure hunters were optimizing for their own self-interest.</p><p>So, digging in one spot is a dumb strategy for the economy of the individual, but a very wise strategy for the collective economy of all individuals.</p><p>This is what happens in a non-ergodic system. We often hear politicians claim that the GDP is growing, but all the gains are going to the 1%. This is the same thing. The wealth of a country could be growing, but almost all the citizens could be getting poorer. There’s nothing inconsistent with this. The average is simply being dragged up by the freak outliers.</p><p>The same thing happens in venture capital. The owners of the portfolio maximize their returns when the system is non-ergodic, because while the individual treasure hunter has one lifetime to strike gold, the VC portfolio has access to thousands of lifetimes: those of all the treasure hunters.</p><p>YC will proudly tell you that you are more likely to end up with a billion dollar business if you join them. That may be true. What they’re more reluctant to tell you is that only about 50 companies met that expectation out of the 4,000 or so that went through their program. That’s 1.25%. To be fair, that’s actually quite impressive, but let’s say you have the stamina and willpower to go through YC three times in your lifetime. You’d need approximately 26 lifetimes to hit the jackpot! Aha! See the problem now?</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I want to be successful in this lifetime. I can't afford to rely on 26 lifetimes. But maybe you think you’re special. You’re not like those 3,950 dummies who failed. Maybe you are in fact special, but I wouldn’t rely too much on that. Business is much more random than it seems. If business was predictable, YC wouldn't have a measly 1.25% success rate, or thereabouts.</p><p>You might think that those who failed might still have gotten something. Maybe. But failure is a very expensive way to learn those things. You don’t need to crash a plane to learn how to fly one. And whatever lessons are learned from going through YC are probably not very useful anyway, but more on that later.</p><p>One of the bad learnings you get from YC is that there’s a formula for success, and it looks like this: First you do some brainstorming. Then you come up with a good idea that can scale to a billion dollars (otherwise what’s the point of getting out of bed in the morning?) Then you work hard until you find “product-market-fit.” And then if the noises from investors indicate you won’t be getting a next round of funding, you start looking for a “pivot.”</p><p>This so-called formula is nonsense. First, good ideas rarely come to us from a brainstorming session. They come from wandering about with an open mind until we stumble on an opportunity worth pursuing. Most of your ideas will be bad ideas, because unfortunately you’re not a genius visionary. So the best way to find good ideas is to have many ideas, try them out, take what works, and throw away the rest. But this is not what YC wants you to do. YC wants you to pick an idea that has market pull (or the potential for it), and to then dig a hole in the same spot until you reach the boiling magma. Because what if you stop digging just before you strike gold? When you’re cheap and expandable, that’s not an optimal strategy for the YC fund. You must go all in. Diversification is for your YC overlords, not for you.</p><p>If you reach the magma layer and you still have nothing, then you’d be encouraged to pivot. But that’s not how you find business opportunities in the real world. You can’t just say I’m going to pivot, and suddenly a good opportunity lands on your lap from heaven. You get good ideas by embracing randomness for a long time, until something looks like it has a fighting chance of paying off. The pivot idea you were forced to come up with is extremely unlikely to be one. Your imagination is overrated. The YC execs didn’t imagine Stripe or Dropbox or AirBnb. Random things come to them during demo days. The YC folks are smart because they know their imagination is limited. And so should you. You can’t just pivot a business idea. And if you’re going to cherry pick some pivot that worked out of the thousands attempted, you should stop reading now. Just go join YC.</p><p><span>The second bad lesson from YC is the focus on the upside. But </span><em>if</em><span> there’s any formula for success in business, it’s to focus relentlessly on staying in the game rather than on hitting it big. Focus on the downside, and let the upside take care of itself. To thrive, you must first survive. To win the race, you must finish the race. And so on. But this is in tension with what YC wants you to do. They want you to dig deep to the middle of the earth, and if you don’t come back alive, tough luck. You were a brave soldier, but now it’s time for them to focus on the other 999 soldiers. YC is still alive, but you’re not.</span></p><p>Don’t be a dummy. Don’t be a bet in somebody else’s portfolio.</p><p>Ahahaha, you caught me! It’s true. I do have something to sell you. I run a community for small-time entrepreneurs who are satisfied with reliably attainable mediocre success. The YC folks feel sorry for our joy with mediocrity while they’re out there changing the world. And we reciprocate the emotion.</p><p>So yes, I am promoting something that goes against everything YC stands for. But if you think YC is not also selling you something, I have a bridge to sell you. But maybe I’m being a bit too harsh. Because what is it that YC is selling you exactly?</p><p>Me, I charge you a one-time payment of $245, and you get access to my community, which includes live workshops, recorded classes, a group chat, and a few other things. It’s very clear what I’m doing. I ask for some money in exchange for access, and those who give me the money get access. Even my 6 year old kid understands it.</p><p>But YC is not asking you for money. They actually give you money! It looks like you’re the one selling to them. You’re technically selling them a piece of your business, no?</p><p>No, no, no, hold on. The easiest way to see what YC is selling is to look at military recruitment. The military sells the narrative that serving your country is a noble endeavor. You’ll get a shot at glory, and at the very least you gain some important life skills. You’ll also get paid enough to feed yourself and cover your basic needs, but barely. The military wants to recruit expendable soldiers who will go out to the battlefield risking their lives and limb for the collective, while the generals with all the medals sit in an air conditioned room giving orders.</p><p>YC is no different. It wants to recruit wide-eyed young founders to pick a spot on the treasure map and dig all the way down through the earth’s crust. Most of them will spend years or decades digging, and all they end up with it is a ramen lifestyle. Usually bunched up with 4 roommates in a damp San Francisco basement living on take-out ramen noodles every single day. But hey, they’re young. They’ll have time to do adult things later, like starting family or making decent money. And at the very least, they’ll gain some important life lessons and make some good connections.</p><p>Think about this for a second: The most successful business owners are typically in their 40s and 50s. Why is YC full of 22 year olds? Why aren’t the 40 year old entrepreneurs taking up this incredible deal that YC is offering? YC will tell you it’s because only the 22 year old kids can be true visionaries. BULL. SHIT. You’re not a visionary. All those 4,000 kids who went into YC also thought they were visionaries, and where are they now? They’re all in the startup cemetery, except for a dozen or so who despite the low odds managed to flip 10 heads in a row. The biggest indicator YC is a bad deal is that only people who are easily duped take up these deals. </p><p>The best thing I learned about business is to avoid trying to predict what will work and what won’t. YC knows this. That's why they only make small bets in thousands of businesses. But YC will try to teach you the exact opposite.</p><p>Business is a lot more random than it seems. You can’t treat it like a predictable project. You need to treat it like a financial investment. Instead of investing your money, you’re investing your time and energy, which is as scarce and as precious as money (if not more). Tell me, how do you invest your money? Do you pick one amazing stock and put all your life savings on it? Of course not. You understand that finance is uncertain. What’s good today might not be good tomorrow. There are hidden risks everywhere. And even if your stock pick doesn’t go bust, the biggest gains are likely to happen elsewhere and you won’t benefit from them if you’re only exposed to one piece of equity.</p><p>YC teaches you to try to be a visionary. When you fail… Oopsie! Tough luck. The fund benefits from the non-ergodic nature of the system, but you’re out years of your time. But that’s not even the worst of it. You would have been taught things that not only won’t work in the real world of business, but are counterproductive. You will have to unlearn almost everything.</p><p>If you want to succeed in the real world (and within this lifetime), you need to try many small things, experiment, tinker, and build a portfolio of multiple income streams. You need to treat your time the same way you treat your brokerage account. You basically need to become a VC, but for your own ideas. To make the system ergodic, you must un-leverage yourself from going all in on one thing, and get access to many diverse income streams. The same way it’s wise to invest in a broad ETF, you should be doing the same things with your projects. YC will teach you to do the opposite, but you’ll have to unlearn all of it. And unfortunately unlearning is much harder than learning.</p></div></div>]]></description>

			<h3>CV</h3>
			<p><a id="Truong97" name="Truong97"></a><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Krause">Kai Krause</a></strong> [today: <a href="http://kai.sub.blue/">kai.sub.blue</a>]was born 1957 in Dortmund. He came to California in 1976 with two friends. He worked as a musician for <em>Disney Sound Effects</em>; <strike>the sound track for “Star Trek: The Movie” was created on his synthesizers</strike>*. <span>* In fact Kai won a Clio Award for his sound effects in a Star Wars radio spot.</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson,_Lake_&amp;_Powell">Emerson, Lake &amp; Powell</a> bought sound systems from him and he is still working with <a href="https://petergabriel.com/">Peter Gabriel</a> today in order to fulfill his vision of visualized music as 3D sculptures. [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTruong97">Truong97</a>]</p>
			<p>He was running a forum for several years on AOL: <a href="https://mprove.de/script/90/KPT/index.html"><em>Kai’s Power Tips &amp; Tricks</em></a>. He gave people tips and little pieces of code on line, simply because they shared his passion for computer graphics. This became an extensive and valuable collection of practical information how to get special effects with <em>Adobe Photoshop</em>. It can still be downloaded from several web sites. [<a id="KaiTT" name="KaiTT" href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKaiTT">KaiTT</a>]</p>
			<h3>The Company</h3>
			<p><img src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/history.jpg" height="441" width="803"></p>
			<p>Fig. 1 Timeline with companies and products</p>
			<p><em>Harward Systems Corporation</em> (HSC Software Corp.) [also <em>Happy Software Company</em>] was founded by John Wilczak. Ben Weiss and Kai joined him in 1991 at HSC and created the first version of <em>Kai’s Power Tools</em>. KPT is a set of plug-ins that use the Adobe Photoshop programing interface for 3rd party filters. Many ideas from <a href="https://mprove.de/script/90/KPT/index.html">Kai’s Power Tips &amp; Tricks</a> get implemented as simple and easy to use pieces of software. KPT evolved until version 3 in 1995. This release contains the <em>Texture Explorer</em>, the <em>Spheroid Designer</em> and <em>KPT Lens f/x</em> among others. <em>Convolver</em> came out as a separate product. HSC was renamed to <em>MetaTools, Inc.</em> the same year.</p>
			<p>Eric Wenger and Phil Clevenger came into the team to develop a landscape-simulating product called <em>Bryce</em> (named after the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm">Bryce Canyon</a>). They started creating other kinds of software starting with <em>Kai’s Power GOO</em>, <em>Kai’s Photo Soap</em> and <em>Kai’s Power Show</em>. Before GOO, Kai was well known only by computer artists as a creator of creative tools. With GOO, Kai became noticed by a much broader audience. People played with GOO. The complex and difficult algorithms are well hidden by the interface. Even children can change images of their classmates or teachers to funny caricatures. Kai himself calls this sort of computer programs <em>funware</em>.</p>
			<p>In 1998 Phil Clevenger and Kai managed to transfer the main interface concepts from Bryce to <em>Poser3</em>. Poser was originally created by <em>Fractal Design</em>. The companies MetaTools and Fractal Design merged in 1997. The new company was named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaCreations"><em>MetaCreations Corp</em>.</a> In 1998 it had about 300 employees. The main office is in Santa Barbara, CA, but several other facilities e.g. in San Francisco, are part of MetaCreations. <a id="MCRE" name="MCRE"></a>[<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refMCRE">MCRE</a>]</p>

			<h3>Maximize the Interface</h3>
			<h4>Full Screen Mode</h4>
			<p><a id="Kai95-1" name="Kai95-1"></a>Kai describes how it came to the large dialogs in KPT3: <span><a href="https://docplayer.org/33181705-Kai-s-power-tools-forscher-handbuch-macintosh-power-macintosh-windows-95-version-von-steven-frank.html">Vorwort zu KPT 3.0 von Kai (S.10ff)</a>  </span> </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»I would love to interact with the image in the way that Levels or Curves does, but the plug-in interface as of today simply will not allow it. What that leads to is simply that the plug-in gets a rectangle and is supposed to do something with the pixels in some other room and then give them back.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKai95">Kai95</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Many of the filters in KPT3 like <em>KPT Texture Explorer</em>, <em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em> and <em>KPT Convolver</em> use a rectangular area that fits on a 14" monitor. All other elements get blacked out – no menu bar, no Photoshop image window and no desktop. The user experience is really like coming into a room with a special suited environment for one specific task.</p>
			<p><a name="Fig2 KPT Texture"></a><img src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/KPT3TextureExplorer.jpg" height="460" width="640"></p>
			<p>Fig. 2 KPT Texture Explorer 3.0</p>
			<p>KPT Texture Explorer is a modal dialog, that is especially prepared to create textures and nothing else.</p>

			<p>Fig. 3 KPT Spheroid Designer 3.0</p>
			<p>KPT Spheroid Designer is meant to create collections of special looking orbs. Different controls allow the definition of light or to select a special surface structure for the orbs. The KPT users manual notes that Spheroid Designer may seem to resemble glass balls dropped into mud, but actually it’s meant to be glass balls embedded in an “old stale brownie”.

					<a id="kansei" name="kansei"></a></p>
			<p><a name="Fig4 KPT Convolver"></a><img id="convolver" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/KPTConvolver.jpg" name="convolver"></p>
			<p>Fig. 4 KPT Convolver</p>
			<p><a id="Tog96" name="Tog96"></a><a href="http://asktog.com/">Bruce “Tog” Tognazzini</a> writes about <em>Kansei Engineering</em>:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»Since the year A.D. 618 the Japanese have been creating beautiful Zen gardens, environments of harmony designed to instill in their users a sense of serenity and peace. […] Every rock and tree is thoughtfully placed in patterns that are at once random and yet teeming with order. Rocks are not just strewn about; they are carefully arranged in odd-numbered groupings and sunk into the ground to give the illusion of age and stability. Waterfalls are not simply lined with interesting rocks; they are tuned to create just the right burble and plop. […]<br>
					
					Kansei speakes to a totality of experience: colors, sounds, shapes, tactile sensations, and kinesthesia, as well as the personality and consistency of interactions.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTog96">Tog96</a>, pp. 171]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Then Tog comes to software design:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»Where does kansei start? Not with the hardware. Not with the software either. Kansei starts with attitude, as does quality. The original <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.6_xeroxstar.html">Xerox Star</a> team had it. So did the <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.8_lisa.html">Lisa</a> team, and the <a href="https://mprove.de/visionreality/text/3.1.9_macintosh.html">Mac</a> team after. All were dedicated to building a single, tightly integrated environment – a totality of experience. […]<br>
					KPT Convolver […] is a marvelous example of kansei design. It replaces the extensive lineup of filters that graphic designers traditionally grapple with when using such tools as Photoshop with a simple, integrated, harmonious environment.<br>
					In the past, designers have followed a process of picturing their desired end result in their mind, then applying a series of filters sequentially, without benefit of undo beyond the last-applied filter. Convolver lets users play, trying any combination of filters at will, either on their own or with the computer’s aid and advice. […] Both time and space lie at the user’s complete control.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refTog96">Tog96</a>, pp. 174]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Many of the interface ideas evolved from <em>KPT</em> into <em>Bryce</em>. It is a whole environment that covers the complete screen. It overcomes the limitation of a fixed 14" rectangle, because the interface scales itself to the according screen dimensions. The same holds for <em>Poser3</em> and <em>KPT5</em> as they were shipped late in 1998.</p>

			<h4><a id="rooms" name="rooms"></a><a name="Lombreglia97"></a>Rooms</h4>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»The writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Updike">John Updike</a> is said to have several different writing rooms in his home, each used for a different kind of work -- a fiction room, a poetry room, a room for writing essays and book reviews. All writers want a special room for working (with door, without telephone), but why would any writer -- even such a deservedly successful and prosperous one as John Updike -- need entirely different rooms for different kinds of writing?<br>
					Actually, I know exactly why. Mr. Updike’s arrangement sounded great to me the first time I heard about it. I’m sure working in those rooms is his way of staying inspired, fighting boredom and distraction, getting creative work done by being in a space that’s not only set aside for work but that also somehow provokes that work, probably in quite subtle ways.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refLombreglia97">Lombreglia97</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><a name="Fig6 GOO"></a><img id="goo" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/GOO.jpg" name="goo"></p>
			<p>Fig. 6 Kai’s Power GOO</p>
			<p>The <em>GOO room</em> is a specialized environment for shifting pixels around. But because Kai’s Power GOO is one of the first stand-alone applications from MetaTools some operating systems tasks like opening and closing images need to be accessible within the application. In order not to clutter the room that is special suited to edit the image, other rooms become part of the application. <span><a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3005783/software-graphics/an-ode-to-kais-power-goo.html"><span>cf. An ode to Kai’s Power Goo, Macworld 11/2015</span></a></span> E.g. <em>Kai’s Photo Soap</em> (Fig. 7) initially presents you with a series of seven “rooms” – In, Prep, Tone, Color, Detail, Finishing and Out – which one can enter to perform particular tasks.</p>
			<p><img id="soap-rooms" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/SoapRooms.jpg" name="soap-rooms"></p>
			<p>Fig. 7 Plan-Room in Kai’s Photo Soap</p>
			<h3><a id="Bier93" name="Bier93"></a>Minimize the Interface</h3>
			<p>The concept of Magic Lenses was introduced by [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refBier93">Bier et al. 93</a>]. Two years later Kai designed a tool for KPT3 that can be dragged on top of an image. A circled look-through area shows a preview of the selected filter attributes.</p>
			<p><img id="lens" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/KPTLens.jpg" name="lens"></p>
			<p>Fig. 8 KPT Lens f/x 3.0 on top of a Photoshop image window</p>
			<p><a name="Kai95-2"></a>Kai himself describes the design concept that lead to the lens tool in KPT3:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>»What is called the “lenses” was in alpha known as the Dragon, as in “drag-on-the-image” and its design concept was so simple: make a precision instrument, like a little Swiss Army knife or a watch or microscope (it was also known as the fx Scope…) which has just a few very tiny controls around a center window. In this window a number of effects could be shown exactly as they would appear, over the real image, and updated in realtime.<br>
					It’s a lovely idea to keep all kinds of options hidden inside little wheels and dials that pop out to set and hide themselves during use… I think we have barely begun to use all the possibilities of that. And the actual interaction with the screen image is still a little clunky, hampered by the very illegality of bypassing the plug-in interface altogether.« [<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/index.html#refKai95">Kai95</a>]</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Soap is the consequent next step into this direction. The tools no longer need to be modal like the KPT lens; they can be used in a very natural modeless manner. Pens, brushes and erasers are distributed all over the workspace. They are large, they cast <strike>real</strike> virtual shadows, and the tips of the tools get pressed down while they are in use.</p>
			<p><img id="soap" src="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/_media/high/Soap.jpg" name="soap" height="500" width="776"></p>
			<p>Fig. 9 Kai’s Photo Soap, the Color Room</p>
			<h3>The Desktop</h3>
			<p>The In rooms from <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> are an attempt to deal with a large amount of image files. Large previews – compared to normal icons in Finder – can be distributed on a desktop area. They can be scaled and they can overlap each other. Selections of them can be stored into scrapbooks (Soap) or treated as pile objects (Show). The latter is a proposal to avoid the classical “file in folder in folder in folder” method. The stack of white images to the upper right in Fig. 10 is an example for a pile.</p>

			<h4>Update 2015</h4>
			<p>In retrospect many of Kai's user interface designs make perfect sense as iPad apps. Just imagine <em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em> or <em>Kai’s Power Goo</em> as an app!</p>
			<p><a href="http://www.benweiss.com/">Ben Weiss</a>, <a href="http://kai.subblue.com/">Kai Krause</a>, together with <a href="http://subblue.com/">Tom Beddard</a> have created <a href="http://app-design-critique.tumblr.com/post/134043897648/frax">frax HD</a> that was launched in October 2013.</p>

			<p>Fig. 11: frax HD</p>
			<h2><a name="interfacelanguage" id="interfacelanguage"></a>Kai’s Interface Language</h2>
			<h3>Unfolding functionality</h3>
			<p>Interface widgets become visible on demand. <em>KPT Convolver</em> has three modes: Explore, Design and Tweak. The controls that are not used for a specific mode are dimmed. (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig4Convolver.html">Fig. 4 KPT Convolver</a>)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>A rearrangement of widgets on mode changes is not necessary. The view remains familiar.</p>
				<p>The user becomes curious to explore the interface.</p>
				<p>Everything is accessible at once, because the mode changes if one clicks onto a faded item.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MouseOver</h3>
			<p>Tools fade out if they are not in use. If the mouse cursor is moved over these items they wake up. All the tools to the right and below the main view in the Bryce interface are normally invisible (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig5Bryce.html">Fig. 5 Bryce 2</a>). The film strip, the camera and all other elements on the border of the <em>GOO</em> room increase in contrast when the mouse moves over (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig6Goo.html">Fig. 6 Kai’s Power GOO</a>).</p>
			<p>Interface widgets get an explanation when the mouse gets moved over these items. (KPT, Bryce, Poser)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The view gets focused to the task. Distracting items are out of sight.</p>
				<p>The Cockpit problem gets solved, because one can handle the numerous controls in larger chunks.</p>
				<p>The user becomes curious to explore the interface.</p>
				<p>Better spatial arrangement of widgets, because the label is omitted. (Bryce’ toolbar)</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MouseDragging instead of Value-Slider</h3>
			<p>Classical sliders and scrollbars use a thumb, that can be dragged to a specific value. <em>KPT3</em> or <em>KPT Convolver</em> use simple orbs that serve as origin of a mouse drag action. (e.g. Hue, Saturation, etc. in <a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig2Texture.html">Fig. 2 KPT Texture Explorer 3.0</a>)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>An orb and a referring label is less space consuming than a value slider.</p>
				<p>Kai’s sliders provide real time feedback for the edited object, because the control does not display any feedback by itself.</p>
				<p>The value space can be 2-dimensional, because the x- and y-direction can have a different meaning</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>It is very difficult to enter exact numerical values.</p>
				<p>The control displays no feedback about the selected value.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Memory Dots / Five Favorites</h3>
			<p><em>KPT Spheroid Designer</em>, <em>KPT Convolver</em> and <em>KPT5</em> use 3x3 fields of memory dots. These dots can store different settings of other interface widgets. <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> usefive dots for the same task.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The user can customize tools, store control values and can flip between different interface arrangements.</p>
				<p>The access time is very short.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Memory Dots provide no visual feedback. One has to activate the dot to recognize its content. An icon or MouseOver-Preview might be helpful. The film strip at <em>GOO</em> provides such feedback already.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Transparency &amp; Shadows (KPT Lens f/x, Poser)</h3>
			<p><span>Note, this is years before Mac OS X Aqua. </span>Nearly every item in Kai’s interfaces drops a smooth shadow. This is part of the kansei attitude of building harmonic environments.</p>
			<p>Modal dialog windows from <em>GOO</em>, the menus from <em>Show</em> and the information palette from <em>Soap</em> are translucent.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>The object underneath the pane remains visible.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Full Screen Mode, Rooms Metaphor</h3>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Design in every respect – Kansei Design</p>
				<p>Special suited environments for special tasks support that task perfectly.</p>
				<p>No window clutter</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Only one room at a time can be active.</p>
				<p>There is hardly any interaction with other programs. They are not visible; therefore drag and drop is not possible. One is no longer aware of other “rooms” on the machine.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>Workspace – Desktop</h3>
			<p><em>GOO</em> has only a gallery in a grid for images. <em>Soap</em> and <em>Show</em> (<a href="https://mprove.de/script/99/kai/zoom/Fig10Show.html">Fig. 10 The Sort-Room of Kai’s Power SHOW</a>) use a more drawn out version of a desktop to display collections of media files.</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Better implementation of a real life desktop.</p>
				<p>Previews are very useful to recognize imagefiles.</p>
			</ul>
			<h4>Cons</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>Very limited for hierarchical structures</p>
				<p>Arrangements cannot be stored for later use.</p>
			</ul>
			<h3>MetaWindow</h3>
			<p>Windows without classical borders and handles (Poser3)</p>
			<p>Drawers, that reveal assets or functionalities on demand (Soap, Poser3)</p>
			<p>Scrapbooks, that store objects (Soap)</p>
			<h4>Pro</h4>
			<ul>
				<p>This is an obvious way to get a hierarchical level into the interface.</p>
				<p>Things, that are not needed every time, are only two clicks away.</p>
			</ul>
			<h2>And they are living happily ever after…</h2>
			<p>Quite so. Kai Krause left MetaCreations in 1999. The same year the company was renamed into  <em>Viewpoint Corporation</em> to focus on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewpoint_Media_Player">MetaStreams</a>, a 3D-Web technology.</p>
			<p>Some people consulted with Apple to make a huge impact on the new Aqua design of Mac OS X.</p>
			<p><em>google Picasa</em> was designed and developed by meta folks. And <em>Adobe Lightroom</em> is a powerful product for digital photography.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="content"><article lang="en-US"><header></header><div><p>Users want web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with. Therefore, a developer should strive to achieve these two goals.</p>
<p>To understand how to improve performance and perceived performance, it helps to understand how the browser works.</p></div><section aria-labelledby="overview"><h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h2><div><p>Fast sites provide better user experiences. Users want and expect web experiences with content that is fast to load and smooth to interact with.</p>
<p>Two major issues in web performance are issues having to do with latency and issues having to do with the fact that for the most part, browsers are single-threaded.</p>
<p>Latency is the biggest threat to our ability to ensure a fast-loading page. It is the developers' goal to make the site load as fast as possible — or at least <em>appear</em> to load super fast — so the user gets the requested information as quickly as possible. Network latency is the time it takes to transmit bytes over the air to computers. Web performance is what we have to do to make the page load as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>For the most part, browsers are considered single-threaded. That is, they execute a task from beginning to end before taking up another task. For smooth interactions, the developer's goal is to ensure performant site interactions, from smooth scrolling to being responsive to touch. Render time is key, ensuring the main thread can complete all the work we throw at it and still always be available to handle user interactions. Web performance can be improved by understanding the single-threaded nature of the browser and minimizing the main thread's responsibilities, where possible and appropriate, to ensure rendering is smooth and responses to interactions are immediate.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="navigation"><h2 id="navigation"><a href="#navigation">Navigation</a></h2><div><p><em>Navigation</em> is the first step in loading a web page. It occurs whenever a user requests a page by entering a URL into the address bar, clicking a link, submitting a form, as well as other actions.</p>
<p>One of the goals of web performance is to minimize the amount of time navigation takes to complete. In ideal conditions, this usually doesn't take too long, but latency and bandwidth are foes that can cause delays.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="dns_lookup"><h3 id="dns_lookup"><a href="#dns_lookup">DNS lookup</a></h3><div><p>The first step of navigating to a web page is finding where the assets for that page are located. If you navigate to <code>https://example.com</code>, the HTML page is located on the server with IP address of <code>93.184.216.34</code>. If you've never visited this site, a DNS lookup must happen.</p>
<p>Your browser requests a DNS lookup, which is eventually fielded by a name server, which in turn responds with an IP address. After this initial request, the IP will likely be cached for a time, which speeds up subsequent requests by retrieving the IP address from the cache instead of contacting a name server again.</p>
<p>DNS lookups usually only need to be done once per hostname for a page load. However, DNS lookups must be done for each unique hostname the requested page references. If your fonts, images, scripts, ads, and metrics all have different hostnames, a DNS lookup will have to be made for each one.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/latency.jpg" alt="Mobile requests go first to the cell tower, then to a central phone company computer before being sent to the internet" width="792" height="281" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>This can be problematic for performance, particularly on mobile networks. When a user is on a mobile network, each DNS lookup has to go from the phone to the cell tower to reach an authoritative DNS server. The distance between a phone, a cell tower, and the name server can add significant latency.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="tcp_handshake"><h3 id="tcp_handshake"><a href="#tcp_handshake">TCP handshake</a></h3><div><p>Once the IP address is known, the browser sets up a connection to the server via a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake">TCP three-way handshake</a>. This mechanism is designed so that two entities attempting to communicate — in this case the browser and web server — can negotiate the parameters of the network TCP socket connection before transmitting data, often over <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS">HTTPS</a>.</p>
<p>TCP's three-way handshaking technique is often referred to as "SYN-SYN-ACK" — or more accurately SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK — because there are three messages transmitted by TCP to negotiate and start a TCP session between two computers. Yes, this means three more messages back and forth between each server, and the request has yet to be made.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="tls_negotiation"><h3 id="tls_negotiation"><a href="#tls_negotiation">TLS negotiation</a></h3><div><p>For secure connections established over HTTPS, another "handshake" is required. This handshake, or rather the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS">TLS</a> negotiation, determines which cipher will be used to encrypt the communication, verifies the server, and establishes that a secure connection is in place before beginning the actual transfer of data. This requires five more round trips to the server before the request for content is actually sent.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/ssl.jpg" alt="The DNS lookup, the TCP handshake, and 5 steps of the TLS handshake including clienthello, serverhello and certificate, clientkey and finished for both server and client." width="729" height="412" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>While making the connection secure adds time to the page load, a secure connection is worth the latency expense, as the data transmitted between the browser and the web server cannot be decrypted by a third party.</p>
<p>After the eight round trips to the server, the browser is finally able to make the request.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="response"><h2 id="response"><a href="#response">Response</a></h2><div><p>Once we have an established connection to a web server, the browser sends an initial <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">HTTP <code>GET</code> request</a> on behalf of the user, which for websites is most often an HTML file. Once the server receives the request, it will reply with relevant response headers and the contents of the HTML.</p>

<p>This response for this initial request contains the first byte of data received. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_first_byte">Time to First Byte</a> (TTFB) is the time between when the user made the request — say by clicking on a link — and the receipt of this first packet of HTML. The first chunk of content is usually 14KB of data.</p>
<p>In our example above, the request is definitely less than 14KB, but the linked resources aren't requested until the browser encounters the links during parsing, described below.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="congestion_control_tcp_slow_start"><h3 id="congestion_control_tcp_slow_start"><a href="#congestion_control_tcp_slow_start">Congestion control / TCP slow start</a></h3><div><p>TCP packets are split into segments during transmission. Because TCP guarantees the sequence of packets, the server must receive an acknowledgment from the client in the form of an ACK packet after sending a certain number of segments.</p>
<p>If the server waits for an ACK after each segment, that will result in frequent ACKs from the client and may increase transmission time, even in the case of a low-load network.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sending too many segments at once can lead to the problem that in a busy network the client will not be able to receive the segments and will just keep responding with ACKs for a long time, and the server will have to keep re-sending the segments.</p>
<p>In order to balance the number of transmitted segments, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_slow_start">TCP slow start</a> algorithm is used to gradually increase the amount of transmitted data until the maximum network bandwidth can be determined, and to reduce the amount of transmitted data in case of high network load.</p>
<p>The number of segments to be transmitted is controlled by the value of the congestion window (CWND), which can be initialized to 1, 2, 4, or 10 MSS (MSS is 1500 bytes over the Ethernet protocol). That value is the number of bytes to send, upon receipt of which the client must send an ACK.</p>
<p>If an ACK is received, then the CWND value will be doubled, and so the server will be able to send more segments the next time. If instead no ACK is received, then the CWND value will be halved. That mechanism thus achieves a balance between sending too many segments, and sending too few.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="parsing"><h2 id="parsing"><a href="#parsing">Parsing</a></h2><div><p>Once the browser receives the first chunk of data, it can begin parsing the information received. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Parse">Parsing</a> is the step the browser takes to turn the data it receives over the network into the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM">DOM</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSSOM">CSSOM</a>, which is used by the renderer to paint a page to the screen.</p>
<p>The DOM is the internal representation of the markup for the browser. The DOM is also exposed and can be manipulated through various APIs in JavaScript.</p>
<p>Even if the requested page's HTML is larger than the initial 14KB packet, the browser will begin parsing and attempting to render an experience based on the data it has. This is why it's important for web performance optimization to include everything the browser needs to start rendering a page, or at least a template of the page — the CSS and HTML needed for the first render — in the first 14KB. But before anything is rendered to the screen, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have to be parsed.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="building_the_dom_tree"><h3 id="building_the_dom_tree"><a href="#building_the_dom_tree">Building the DOM tree</a></h3><div><p>We describe five steps in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Critical_rendering_path">critical rendering path</a>.</p>
<p>The first step is processing the HTML markup and building the DOM tree. HTML parsing involves <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList">tokenization</a> and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster. The parser parses tokenized input into the document, building up the document tree.</p>
<p>The DOM tree describes the content of the document. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></a> element is the first element and root node of the document tree. The tree reflects the relationships and hierarchies between different elements. Elements nested within other elements are child nodes. The greater the number of DOM nodes, the longer it takes to construct the DOM tree.</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/dom.gif" alt="The DOM tree for our sample code, showing all the nodes, including text nodes." width="754" height="689" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>When the parser finds non-blocking resources, such as an image, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements — particularly those without an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function"><code>async</code></a> or <code>defer</code> attribute — block rendering, and pause the parsing of HTML. Though the browser's preload scanner hastens this process, excessive scripts can still be a significant bottleneck.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="preload_scanner"><h3 id="preload_scanner"><a href="#preload_scanner">Preload scanner</a></h3><div><p>While the browser builds the DOM tree, this process occupies the main thread. As this happens, the <em>preload scanner</em> will parse through the content available and request high-priority resources like CSS, JavaScript, and web fonts. Thanks to the preload scanner, we don't have to wait until the parser finds a reference to an external resource to request it. It will retrieve resources in the background so that by the time the main HTML parser reaches the requested assets, they may already be in flight or have been downloaded. The optimizations the preload scanner provides reduce blockages.</p>
<div><pre data-signature="7i2pOGLEWk9zRizsF65+Y7TiIADbAa3ECiZF6ZUCWpA="><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>link</span> <span>rel</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>stylesheet<span>"</span></span> <span>href</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>styles.css<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>script</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>myscript.js<span>"</span></span> <span>async</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>script</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span><span>&lt;</span>img</span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>myimage.jpg<span>"</span></span> <span>alt</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>image description<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example, while the main thread is parsing the HTML and CSS, the preload scanner will find the scripts and image, and start downloading them as well. To ensure the script doesn't block the process, add the <code>async</code> attribute, or the <code>defer</code> attribute if JavaScript parsing and execution order is important.</p>
<p>Waiting to obtain CSS doesn't block HTML parsing or downloading, but it does block JavaScript because JavaScript is often used to query CSS properties' impact on elements.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="building_the_cssom_tree"><h3 id="building_the_cssom_tree"><a href="#building_the_cssom_tree">Building the CSSOM tree</a></h3><div><p>The second step in the critical rendering path is processing CSS and building the CSSOM tree. The CSS object model is similar to the DOM. The DOM and CSSOM are both trees. They are independent data structures. The browser converts the CSS rules into a map of styles it can understand and work with. The browser goes through each rule set in the CSS, creating a tree of nodes with parent, child, and sibling relationships based on the CSS selectors.</p>
<p>As with HTML, the browser needs to convert the received CSS rules into something it can work with. Hence, it repeats the HTML-to-object process, but for the CSS.</p>
<p>The CSSOM tree includes styles from the user agent style sheet. The browser begins with the most general rule applicable to a node and recursively refines the computed styles by applying more specific rules. In other words, it cascades the property values.</p>
<p>Building the CSSOM is very, very fast and is not displayed in a unique color in current developer tools. Rather, the "Recalculate Style" in developer tools shows the total time it takes to parse CSS, construct the CSSOM tree, and recursively calculate computed styles. In terms of web performance optimization, there are lower hanging fruit, as the total time to create the CSSOM is generally less than the time it takes for one DNS lookup.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="other_processes"><h3 id="other_processes"><a href="#other_processes">Other processes</a></h3><div><h4 id="javascript_compilation">JavaScript compilation</h4>
<p>While the CSS is being parsed and the CSSOM created, other assets, including JavaScript files, are downloading (thanks to the preload scanner). JavaScript is parsed, compiled, and interpreted. The scripts are parsed into abstract syntax trees. Some browser engines take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Tree" target="_blank">abstract syntax trees</a> and pass them into a compiler, outputting bytecode. This is known as JavaScript compilation. Most of the code is interpreted on the main thread, but there are exceptions such as code run in <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>.</p>
<h4 id="building_the_accessibility_tree">Building the accessibility tree</h4>
<p>The browser also builds an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">accessibility</a> tree that assistive devices use to parse and interpret content. The accessibility object model (AOM) is like a semantic version of the DOM. The browser updates the accessibility tree when the DOM is updated. The accessibility tree is not modifiable by assistive technologies themselves.</p>
<p>Until the AOM is built, the content is not accessible to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Screen_Reader_Implementors_Guide">screen readers</a>.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="render"><h2 id="render"><a href="#render">Render</a></h2><p>Rendering steps include style, layout, paint, and in some cases compositing. The CSSOM and DOM trees created in the parsing step are combined into a render tree which is then used to compute the layout of every visible element, which is then painted to the screen. In some cases, content can be promoted to its own layer and composited, improving performance by painting portions of the screen on the GPU instead of the CPU, freeing up the main thread.</p></section><section aria-labelledby="style"><h3 id="style"><a href="#style">Style</a></h3><div><p>The third step in the critical rendering path is combining the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree. The computed style tree, or render tree, construction starts with the root of the DOM tree, traversing each visible node.</p>
<p>Elements that aren't going to be displayed, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/head"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></a> element and its children and any nodes with <code>display: none</code>, such as the <code>script { display: none; }</code> you will find in user agent stylesheets, are not included in the render tree as they will not appear in the rendered output. Nodes with <code>visibility: hidden</code> applied are included in the render tree, as they do take up space. As we have not given any directives to override the user agent default, the <code>script</code> node in our code example above will not be included in the render tree.</p>
<p>Each visible node has its CSSOM rules applied to it. The render tree holds all the visible nodes with content and computed styles — matching up all the relevant styles to every visible node in the DOM tree, and determining, based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade">CSS cascade</a>, what the computed styles are for each node.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="layout"><h3 id="layout"><a href="#layout">Layout</a></h3><div><p>The fourth step in the critical rendering path is running layout on the render tree to compute the geometry of each node. <em>Layout</em> is the process by which the dimensions and location of all the nodes in the render tree are determined, plus the determination of the size and position of each object on the page. <em>Reflow</em> is any subsequent size and position determination of any part of the page or the entire document.</p>
<p>Once the render tree is built, layout commences. The render tree identified which nodes are displayed (even if invisible) along with their computed styles, but not the dimensions or location of each node. To determine the exact size and position of each object, the browser starts at the root of the render tree and traverses it.</p>
<p>On the web page, almost everything is a box. Different devices and different desktop preferences mean an unlimited number of differing viewport sizes. In this phase, taking the viewport size into consideration, the browser determines what the sizes of all the different boxes are going to be on the screen. Taking the size of the viewport as its base, layout generally starts with the body, laying out the sizes of all the body's descendants, with each element's box model properties, providing placeholder space for replaced elements it doesn't know the dimensions of, such as our image.</p>
<p>The first time the size and position of each node is determined is called <em>layout</em>. Subsequent recalculations of are called <em>reflows</em>. In our example, suppose the initial layout occurs before the image is returned. Since we didn't declare the dimensions of our image, there will be a reflow once the image dimensions are known.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="paint"><h3 id="paint"><a href="#paint">Paint</a></h3><div><p>The last step in the critical rendering path is painting the individual nodes to the screen, the first occurrence of which is called the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_meaningful_paint">first meaningful paint</a>. In the painting or rasterization phase, the browser converts each box calculated in the layout phase to actual pixels on the screen. Painting involves drawing every visual part of an element to the screen, including text, colors, borders, shadows, and replaced elements like buttons and images. The browser needs to do this super quickly.</p>
<p>To ensure smooth scrolling and animation, everything occupying the main thread, including calculating styles, along with reflow and paint, must take the browser less than 16.67ms to accomplish. At 2048 x 1536, the iPad has over 3,145,000 pixels to be painted to the screen. That is a lot of pixels that have to be painted very quickly. To ensure repainting can be done even faster than the initial paint, the drawing to the screen is generally broken down into several layers. If this occurs, then compositing is necessary.</p>
<p>Painting can break the elements in the layout tree into layers. Promoting content into layers on the GPU (instead of the main thread on the CPU) improves paint and repaint performance. There are specific properties and elements that instantiate a layer, including <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video"><code>&lt;video&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas"><code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code></a>, and any element which has the CSS properties of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity"><code>opacity</code></a>, a 3D <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform"><code>transform</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change"><code>will-change</code></a>, and a few others. These nodes will be painted onto their own layer, along with their descendants, unless a descendant necessitates its own layer for one (or more) of the above reasons.</p>
<p>Layers do improve performance but are expensive when it comes to memory management, so should not be overused as part of web performance optimization strategies.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="compositing"><h3 id="compositing"><a href="#compositing">Compositing</a></h3><div><p>When sections of the document are drawn in different layers, overlapping each other, compositing is necessary to ensure they are drawn to the screen in the right order and the content is rendered correctly.</p>
<p>As the page continues to load assets, reflows can happen (recall our example image that arrived late). A reflow sparks a repaint and a re-composite. Had we defined the dimensions of our image, no reflow would have been necessary, and only the layer that needed to be repainted would be repainted, and composited if necessary. But we didn't include the image dimensions! When the image is obtained from the server, the rendering process goes back to the layout steps and restarts from there.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="interactivity"><h2 id="interactivity"><a href="#interactivity">Interactivity</a></h2><div><p>Once the main thread is done painting the page, you would think we would be "all set." That isn't necessarily the case. If the load includes JavaScript, that was correctly deferred, and only executed after the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event"><code>onload</code></a> event fires, the main thread might be busy, and not available for scrolling, touch, and other interactions.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive">Time to Interactive</a> (TTI) is the measurement of how long it took from that first request which led to the DNS lookup and TCP connection to when the page is interactive — interactive being the point in time after the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_contentful_paint">First Contentful Paint</a> when the page responds to user interactions within 50ms. If the main thread is occupied parsing, compiling, and executing JavaScript, it is not available and therefore not able to respond to user interactions in a timely (less than 50ms) fashion.</p>
<p>In our example, maybe the image loaded quickly, but perhaps the <code>anotherscript.js</code> file was 2MB and our user's network connection was slow. In this case, the user would see the page super quickly, but wouldn't be able to scroll without jank until the script was downloaded, parsed, and executed. That is not a good user experience. Avoid occupying the main thread, as demonstrated in this WebPageTest example:</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work/visa_network.png" alt="The main thread is occupied by the downloading, parsing and execution of a JavaScript file - over a fast connection" width="1200" height="699" loading="lazy">
</p>
<p>In this example, JavaScript execution took over 1.5 seconds, and the main thread was fully occupied that entire time, unresponsive to click events or screen taps.</p></div></section><section aria-labelledby="see_also"><h2 id="see_also"><a href="#see_also">See also</a></h2></section></article></main></div></div>]]></description>

As a rule, "sophisticated" progrmming is pretty boring - optimizing
the unnecessary to speed up the
uninteresting. Here, however, is an
incredibly sophisticated package
intended for fun and games. The
more you know about software, the
more astounded you will become as
you read this.

Imagine yourself sitting down at your favorite personal computer,
inserting a diskette, turning on the power, and seeing what follows. Your

West of House
     You are standing in an open field
west of a white house, with a boarded
front door.
     A rubber mat saying 'Welcome to
Zork!' lies by the door.
     There is a small mailbox here.
&gt;OPEN THE SMALL MAILBOX
    Opening the mailbox reveals a
leaflet.
&gt;READ THE LEAFLET
(Taken)
  Welcome to Zork: The Great Under-
ground Empire
    Zork: The Great Underground Em-
pire is a game of adventvre, danger,
and low cunning. In it you will explore
some of the most amazing territory
ever seen by mortals.
    No computer should be without
one!
    The original ZORK was created by
Tim Anderson. Marc Blank, Bruce
Daniels, and Dave Lebling. It was
inspired by the ADVENTURE game of
Crowther and Woods. This version was
created by Marc Blank, Dave Lebling,
Joel Berez, and Scott Cutler.
&gt;WALK AROUND THE HOUSE
North of House
    You are facing the north side of a
white house. There is no door here,
and all the windows are boarded up. To
the north a narrow path winds through
the trees.
&gt;AGAIN
Behind House
    You are behind the white house. A
path leads into the forest to the east. In
one corner of the house there is a small
window which is slightly ajar.
&gt;LOOK IN THE WINDOW
    You can see what appears to be a
kitchen.
&gt;GO IN
    The kitchen window is closed.
&gt;OPEN IT
    With great effort, you open the
window far enough to allow entry.
&gt;GO IN
Kitchen
      You are in the kitchen of the white
house. A table seems to have been
used recently for the preparation of
food. A passage leads to the west and a
dark staircase can be seen leading
upward. A dark chimney leads down
and to the east is a small window which
is open.
      On the table is an elongated brown
sack, smelling of hot peppers. A bottle
is sitting on the table.
     The glass bottle contains:
A quantity of water
&gt;PICK UP
pick up what?
&gt;ALL BUT THE SACK
kitchen table: An interesting idea . . .
glass bottle: Taken.
quantity of water: I can't reach that.
&gt;GO WEST
Living Room
     You are in the living room. There is
a door to the east, a wooden door with
strange gothic lettering to the west,
which appears to be nailed shut, and a
large oriental rug in the center of the
room.
     There is a trophy case here. A
battery-powered brass lantern is on
the trophy case. Above the trophy case
hangs an elvish sword of great
antiquity.

<p>
    This transcript shows the beginning of an adventure into a land of
Zork. Zork was originally a single "computerized fantasy simulation"
game in which the object is to explore a labyrinth, called the Great
Underground Empire, comprising a variety of interesting caves or rooms, and
to find hidden treasures and return safely with
them. We now say that Zork is a computer-game environment in which
different games, with different scenarios and different puzzles to solve,
can be written. A Zork player converses with a Zork program by typing
commands in a kind of restricted English and reading the program's
English responses. A longer description of the original game and program
can be found in <a href="https://mud.co.uk/richard/zork.htm">"Zork: A Computerized Fantasy Simulation Game"</a>
by Lebling, Blank, and Anderson (IEEE Computer, April 1979, pp. 51-59).
</p><p>
    The original Zork game was
implemented on a DECsystem-10 at
the MIT Laboratory for Computer
Science in a local Lisp-like language
called MDL. This Zork game was later
translated into a Fortran version for
DEC PSP-11 Computers and made
available through the DECUS program
library. In both versions the program is
large: it occupies most of a process's
virtual storage on a 10, and it requires a
large disk for secondary storage on an
11. In converting Zork to run on
personal computers, the designers
needed some way to shrink it in order
to fit it into the relatively small available
storage.
</p><p>
    One shrinking tactic was to remove the features of MDL that are not
needed in Zork, such as coroutines,
associative storage, and fancy input/output. The stripped-down version of
MDL that resulted was named Zork Implementation Language (ZIL).
However, that was not enough: a straight-forward compilation of
a ZIL version of the original Zork game into the
machine language of any known
personal computer would still have
produced an executable program too
large to fit.
</p><p>
    The solution was to invent a
"virtual machine," specifically designed
to execute Zork programs; the
virtual "Z-machine" has a machine
language called "Z-code", in which
Zork programs can be expressed very
compactly. Then all that was needed
was a Zork Interpretive Program (ZIP),
written in the machine language of any
given target personal computer, that
would imitate a Z-machine in carrying
out the Z-code operations. (A compiler
that translates from ZIL to Z-code is
also needed, of course, but the highly-structured
nature of MDL, and hence
ZIL, makes that a relatively simple
task.) A good benchmark for the
storage saved by rewriting Zork in ZIL
is the Zork parser, which analyzes a
player's English input: the parser for
the PDP-10 occupies 1OK 36-bit words,
while the Z-code parser, which is
actually better functionally, occupies
only 3K 8-bit bytes.
</p><p>
    This Z-code approach is similar to
that of compiling a Pascal program
into "P-code," (although there are now
P-code machines, like Western Digital's Pascal Microengine<sup>TM</sup>,
that are real and not just virtual). In effect, Z-code is
like P-code: a string of subprogram
calls, with the bodies of the subprograms executed by a Z-machine or
ZIP. Any often-used sequence of
pperations in Zork programs could, in
principle, be compressed into a Z-code
instruction, thereby moving the sequence of operations into the
Z-machine or ZIP, where it needs to
appear only once. The Z-machine
designer just has to be judicious in
choosing Z-code bit patterns and
subprogram parametrizations to get
the most benefit from this virtual-machine method.
</p><p>
    Besides compressing the space
needed by Zork programs, the Z-code
approach also makes conversion to
another (real) computer easier, because, assuming that the design of
Z-code is reasonably machine-independent, all one needs to do is to
implement ZIP on the new machine.
</p><h2>Z-code obiects:</h2>
<p>
    Z-code is an object-oriented
language (as are Lisp and MDL and
ZIL). In this section the various kinds of
objects and the possible operations on
them are described. Excerpts from a
transcript of a game are used to
illustrate the uses of these objects.
</p><p>
    All Z-code objects occupy one or
two bytes in storage, and exactly two
bytes while they are being processed.
Like MDL, ZIL uses "type codes" to
distinguish among the different types
of objects, but Z-code does not, to save
space: the ZIL compiler checks for
proper use of types, but ZIP doesn't
bother. A Z-code operation that yields
a truth-value (integer 0 or 1) is called
(as in Lisp) a "predicate"; the Z-code
operation-codes for all predicates
include a bit for inverting the sense of
the test, another space-saving
measure.
</p><pre>Dam Lobby
    This room appears to have been
the waiting room for groups touring
the dam. There are exits here to the
north and east marked 'Private,'
though the doors are open, and an exit
to the south.
    Some guidebooks entitled 'Flood
Control Dam #3' are on the reception
desk. There is a matchbook whose
cover says 'Visit Beautiful FCD#3' here.
&gt;COUNT MATCHES
You have 5 matches.
&gt;COUNT NOSES
I don't know the word 'noses.'
</pre>
<h2>Integer:</h2>
<p>
An integer, such as the number of
matches left in a matchbook, is stored
in two bytes, according to the normal
bit-level representation used by the
hardware. Operations on integers
include the four normal arithmetic
functions, remainder or modular
reduction, and generation of a random
integer in the range 1-N. (Modular
reduction - calculating the remainder
in a division - is useful for stepping
through a set of English responses
cyclically. Random-integer generation
is useful for choosing a response at
random from a set of similar responses.)
Predicates test for one
integer being less than, greater than, or
equal to another integer, and for an
integer being zero. (Since the sense of
a test can be reversed using one of the
bits in its operation code, this means
implicitly that there are also predicates
to test for greater-than-or-equal,
less-than-or-equal, not-equal, and not-zero.)
Testing for zero may seem
redundant, given an equality test, but it
is used often enough that the cost of
using another operation code is
outweighed by the value of eliminating
the byte that would be used to hold a
zero in every instance. Naturally, there
is an operation to "print&amp;uot; an integer in
the output stream - though, of course
most personal computers display
characters on a CRT rather than
printing them on paper.
</p><p>
    In some situations an integer is
treated as a string of 16 independent
bits; for this case there are operations
for Boolean "and" and "or" and "not,"
and for testing individual bits. The
characters in the player's input are also
stored as integers, using the ASCII
code; for this case there is an output
operation to print a single character, as
shown in the last response above.
</p><pre>The Troll Room
    This is a small room with passages
to the east and south and a forbidding
hole leading west. Bloodstains and
deep scratches (perhaps made by an
axe) mar the walls.
    A nasty-looking troll, brandishing
a bloody axe, blocks all passages out
of the room.
    Your sword has begun to glow
very brightly.
&gt;KILL TROLL WITH KNIFE
    The blow lands, making a shallow
gash in the troll's arm! The troll swings
his axe, and it nicks your arm as you
dodge.
&gt;AGAIN
    The quickness of your thrust
knocks the troll back, stunned. The
troll slowly regains his feet.
&gt;AGAIN
    A quick stroke, but the troll is on
guard. The troll swings his axe, but it
misses.
&gt;AGAIN
    A good slash, but it misses the troll
by a mile. The axe crashes against the
rock, throwing sparks!
&gt;AGAIN
    The troll is disarmed by a subtle
feint past his guard. The troll, now
worried about this encounter, recovers
his bloody axe.
</pre>
<h2>String:</h2>
<p>
    As you can see, Zork programs
tend to be wordy, so strings of
characters need to be stored as
compactly as possible. Three characters can fit in two bytes, if each
character uses only five bits. But five
bits can encode only 32 characters
directly, and that is obviously not
enough. The solutlon is to use different
"contexts" and to reserve one or more
"characters" for switching among
contexts. (This technique is similar to
the five-bit Baudot code, which was
used by early Teletypes before ASCII
was invented.) Z-code strings use
three contexts - lower case, upper
case, and digits/punctuation - and
several characters for switching
among the contexts, either "permanently"
or only for the next character,
the latter in order to capitalize a word
or use a single punctuation mark.
Because of the extra characters used
to switch contexts, Z-code strings
work out to about five and a half bits
per visible character, which is still
significantly more compact than eight
bits.
</p><p>
    The only operation on strings is to
print them, i.e., show them to the
player. There is no need to manipulate
them, except to print strings sequentially so that they form sentences for
the player. (Actually, simply because it
occurs so often, there is also an
operation for printing a string and then
returning from a function call.) Most
strings are stored without "new-line"
characters, and ZlP takes care of
"folding" the output into lines of a size
convenient for the particular display
being used; a few rigidly-formatted
strings do use new-lines in order to
draw a crude picture with the characters.

A valiant attempt.

An Interesting idea...
</pre>
<h2>Table:</h2>
<p>
    A table is used to keep a set of
related objects (like the responses
above) together, as a list is used in Lisp
or a record is used in Pascal. A table is
stored as a number of two-byte (or
sometimes one-byte) objects one after
another. The length of a table is sometimes stored in its first elemcnt - to be
used by parts of a program thst need to
step through all the elements - and
sometimes not - if the program itself
knows how long the table is. Operations on a table can get a word (two
bytes) out of it and put a word into it;
get a single byte out, and put one in;
and move the pointer along to another
element (like CDR in Lisp) or backwards to a previous one (like BACK in
MDL); (Actually; since a pointer to a
table is just a plain address, ordinary
addition and subtraction are used to
move a pointer forward and backward
in a table.)
</p><h2>Thing:</h2>
<p>
    "Things" are probably the most
interesting objects, since they represent the player, rooms, enemies,
weapons, treasures and so on - the
stuff of which a game is made. To avoid
confusion, "Thing" will always be
written with a capital "T" when it refers
to this kind of Z-code object. Since
there are relatively few Things used in
a Zork game, but they are used very
frequently, each Thing is designated
by a one-byte number rather than, say,
its two-byte address in storage. This
design decision limits the number of
possible Things in one game to 255,
with the number zero reserved to mean
"no Thing." (There are also "pseudo-Things", whose names the parser will
recognize as significant but which
have no interesting properties.)
</p><p>
    A Thing's number can be easily
translated into its address in storage
where its parts are found: status bits,
contents, and properties. These parts
are stored sequentially, as in a table, in
a very strict format: four bytes for
status, three bytes for contents, and
two bytes holding the address of the
property table - so ZlP needs to know
only the address of the first Thing in
order to translate a Thing number into
its address.
</p><p>
    Each Thing has 32 status bits,
which can be turned off or on or tested
individually by Z-code operations.
Status bits represent qualities of a
Thing, both permanent (edible, burnable, fightable "room," etc.) and
temporary ("lit," "open," etc.).

Done.
&gt;LOOK IN SACK
The brown sack contains:
A glass bottle
The glass bottle contains:
  A quantity of water
</pre>
<p>
    A Thing's <em>contents</em> part relates it
spatially to other Things in three ways:
as a parent ("container") as a chlld
("containee"), and as a sibling ("inmate").
For example, if the knife and
the bottle are in the kitchen, then the
kitchen's "child" slot would hold the
number of the knife, the knife's "sibling" slot would hold the number of
the bottle, and the knife's (and bottle's)
"parent" slot would hold the number of
the kitchen. (Of course, depending on
how they got there, the knife and the
bottle might be interchanged in this
data structure.) Such a data structure
is commonly called a list: Things can
be added to or removed from a list
simply by moving the appropriate
numbers into the slots. Manipulating
list structures of this kind - the reason
Lisp was invented - is essential in
Zork games, as Things get moved here
and there by the player. For convenience,
"contents" has a more general
meaning in ZIL: for example, the
player's baggage is "contained in" the
player Thing. The operations on
contents are
</p><ul>
<li>"move X into Y,"
</li><li>"remove X from everything" (e.g., if
  it is eaten or otherwise destroyed),
</li><li>"is X in Y?" and "what is X in (if anything)?"
(using X's parent slot),
</li><li>"what is the first Thing (if any) in X?"
  (using X's child slot), and
</li><li>"what is the next Thing (if any) in the
  same Thing that X is in?" (using X's
sibling slot).
</li></ul>
<pre>     This is the attic. The only exit is a
stairwey leading down. On a table is a
nasty-looking knife. A large coil of

&gt;TAKE NASTY KNIFE

     This is part ot a maze of twisty little

     A skeleton, probably the remains
of a luckless adventurer, lies here.
Beside the skeleton is a rusty knife.
     The deceased adventurers use-
less lantern is here. There is a skeleton
key here. An old leather bag, bulging
with coins, is here.
&gt;TAKE RUSTY KNIFE
     As you pick up the rusty knife,
your sword gives a single pulse of
blinding blue light.
</pre>
<p>
    Finally, each Thing has a table (in
the format described previously) of its
properties, such as name, size, capacity, score value, verbose description,
north neighbor, synonyms, and action
routines; the last can be seen in the
transcript above involving the two
knives. (The name of a Thing identifies
it uniquely to the player throughout the
whole game, e.g., "kitchen," "bottle,"
"thief." There is a special Z-code
operation for printing a Thing's name.)
Since there are a limited number of
properties a Thing can have, and not all
of them require the same smount of
storage, a special format is used to
store them in this table: the first byte of
each property has a five-bit property
number (allowing 32 different properties) and a three-bit count of the
number of immediately following bytes
used to store the property. The
operations on properties are "get
property Y of Thing X," "store Z as
property Y of Thing X," "get the storage
address of property Y of Thing X," and
"get the next property of Thing X following this property."
</p><pre>&gt;SCORE
    Your score would be 10 (total of
375 points), in 9 moves. This score
gives you the rank of Beginner.
</pre>
<h2>Variable:</h2>
<p>
    Variables are used to keep track of
the situation all through the game.
(Parts of Things are used also.) For
example, the player's current score is a
variable, called a "global" variable
because it is the same no matter what
functions have been called. Like
Things, variables are identified by a
one-byte number. A special number is
used to identify the top of the "stack,"
and fifteen more numbers identify
"local" variables used by the function
currently executing. (The stack is
described later.) The remaining 240
numbers identify global variables.
Operations on variables store and
retrieve the current value, increment or
decrement an integer value by one and
optionally test it for crossing a given
threshold, push a value onto the stack,
pop a value of the stack, and print the
value.
</p><h2>Other operations:</h2>
<p>
    The remaining Z-code operations
do not deal directly with objects. These
operations include the null operation,
go-to (jump, branch), call a function,
return a value to the calling function,
and return "true" or "false" or whatever
is on top of the stack to the calling
function. Also there are special operations
to input a line from the player and
find the significant words in it using a
vocabulary table, save the game
situation on a disk or tape, restore a
situation saved previously, quit playing
or start afresh.
</p><h2>Z-code format:</h2>
<p>
    Each Z-code instruction begins
with a byte containing the operation
code, which includes bits describing
how the operands (or arguments) are
addressed. Some operations always
use a certain number of operands, and
some operations use an unpredictable
number of operands, from zero to four.
Each operand that is used can be either
a "small" (8-bit) integer, a "large"
(16-bit) integer, or a variable (8 bits) . (A
string is an operand for only one
operation code, the print routine.)
Following the operation-code byte are
the operands. An operation that
returns a value has another byte
following the operands that tells in
what variable to store the value. A
predicate operation has another byte
or two that tells where to go to, relative
to this current instruction, if the
predicate is true.
</p><p>
    A sub-program is called with a
special "call" operation code, whose
operands are the address of the
sub-program and the (zero to three)
arguments or parameters for this call.
</p><p>
    Z-code uses a single stack to store
both temporary values and return
addresses for pending function calls.
Z-code doesn't distinguish between
addresses and other kinds of data but
- because ZIL is a "structured"
programming language - the ZIL
compiler produces Z-code that uses
the stack in a disciplined way,
"pushing" and "popping" words in the
correct order and not confusing one
datum for another.
</p><h2>Storage management:</h2>
<p>
    The address space of a personal
computer running ZIP is divided into
three parts: impure storage, resident
pure storage, and non-resident pure
storage. "Impure" means that the data
in storage can be modified; impure
storage is where all the Things,
variables, stack, and so on live. To
"save" the game situation just requires
writing this part of storage onto a disk
or tape, and to "restore" is the
opposite; all other parts of the program
are pure and unchanging, so they don't
need to be saved.
</p><p>
    Resident pure storage holds ZIP
itself. "Resident" means that the code
is loaded from disk at the start of
execution and resides in primary
memory throughout the game. Non-resident pure storage is paged
(physical storage divided into page
frames and Z-code program divided
into pages, typically with 256 bytes
each) and swapped (program pages
are kept on disk until needed and then
read in to a suitable page frame for
interpretation). It may be necessary to
swap in a page to read the next
sequential byte (if the next byte lies on
the next page) or during a go-to, call,
return, or print-string Z-code instruction (if the target address lies on
another page). Fortunately. the first
situation is easy to test for, since the
first byte of any page always has zeros
for the least significant bits of the
address; the second situation occurs
infrequently and is easily handled by
the parts of ZIP that interpret those
instructions. ZIP keeps track of which
pages are currently in which frames by
using a page table, which holds the
first virtual address of each page that is
currently swapped in. ZIP must also
translate addresses accordlng to
which frame currently holds which
page.
</p><p>
    All the objects used by a Z-code
program are set up in their proper
locations and formats by the ZIL
compiler. There is no need to create
new objects while the Z-code program
runs, and so there is no need to reclaim
storage used by old objects with a
Lisp-like garbage collector.
</p><p>
    With ZIP needs to know to start
running a game are the first address of
the three parts of the address space;
the first address of Thing storage,
global-variable storage, and the
vocabulary table used by the "input" Z-code instruction (whence it can find
the number and size of vocabulary
entries); and the address of the first
executable instruction in the game.
</p><h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>
    We have described how a large
program can be squeezed into a small
machine by using a "virtual-machine"
approach to encoding the program.
Essentially, the designers identified
sub-programs within the large program (and within a whole series of
similar programs) and chose ways to
encode invocations of those sub-programs as compactly as possible.
Then duplicate copies of those sub-programs couid be removed, and the
whole program could be encoded in
the "machine language" of a virtual
Z-machine. This technique follows a
long line of tradition in computer
programming that encourages identifying sub-programs and making them
modular and easy to use.
</p><p>
    Using this technique, versions of
Zork games for personal computers
such as Radio Shack TRS-80 and
Apple have been developed by

<p>A prominent cryptography expert has told New Scientist that a US spy agency could be weakening a new generation of algorithms designed to protect against hackers equipped with quantum computers.</p>
<p><a href="https://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Daniel Bernstein</a> at the University of Illinois Chicago says that the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is deliberately obscuring the level of involvement the US National Security Agency (NSA) has in developing new encryption standards for “post-quantum cryptography” (PQC). He also believes that NIST has made errors&nbsp;– either accidental or deliberate&nbsp;– in calculations describing the security of the new standards. NIST denies the claims.</p>
<p>“NIST isn’t following procedures designed to stop NSA from weakening PQC,” says Bernstein. “People choosing cryptographic standards should be transparently and verifiably following clear public rules so that we don’t need&nbsp;to worry about their motivations. NIST promised transparency and then claimed it&nbsp;had shown all its work, but that&nbsp;claim simply isn’t true.”</p>
<p>The mathematical problems we use to protect data are practically impossible for even the largest supercomputers to crack today. But when quantum computers become <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2379347-which-quantum-computer-is-the-most-powerful-ever-its-complicated/">reliable and powerful enough</a>, they will be able to break them in moments.</p>

    
<p>Although it is <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2370022-cryptographers-bet-cash-on-when-quantum-computers-will-beat-encryption/">unclear when such computers will emerge</a>, NIST&nbsp;has been running a project <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Presentations/Let-s-Get-Ready-to-Rumble-The-NIST-PQC-Competiti/images-media/PQCrypto-April2018_Moody.pdf">since 2012</a> to standardise a new generation of algorithms that <span></span> resist their attacks. Bernstein, who <a href="https://archive.ph/BHGOM">coined the term post-quantum cryptography</a> in 2003 to refer to these kinds of algorithms, says the&nbsp;NSA is actively engaged in putting secret weaknesses into new encryption standards that will allow them to be more easily cracked with the right knowledge. NIST’s standards are used globally, so flaws could have a large impact.</p>
<p>Bernstein alleges that NIST’s calculations for one of the upcoming PQC standards, Kyber512, are “glaringly wrong”, making it appear more secure than it really is. He says that NIST multiplied two numbers together when it would have been more correct to add them, resulting in an artificially high assessment of Kyber512’s robustness to attack.</p>
<p>“We disagree with his analysis,” says <a href="https://www.nist.gov/people/dustin-moody">Dustin Moody</a> at NIST. “It’s a&nbsp;question for which there isn’t scientific certainty and intelligent people can have different views. We respect Dan’s opinion, but don’t agree with what he says.”</p>
<p>Moody says that Kyber512 meets NIST’s “level one” security criteria, which makes it at least as hard to&nbsp;break as a commonly used existing algorithm, AES-128. That&nbsp;said, NIST recommends that, in practice, people should use a stronger version, Kyber768, which Moody says was a suggestion from&nbsp;the algorithm’s developers.</p>

    
<p>NIST is currently in a period of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2327054-us-chooses-encryption-tools-to-protect-us-from-quantum-computers/">public consultation</a> and hopes to reveal the final standards for PQC algorithms next year so that organisations can begin to adopt them. The Kyber algorithm seems likely to make the cut as it has already progressed through several layers of selection.</p>
<p>Given its secretive nature, it is difficult to say for sure whether or&nbsp;not the NSA has influenced the&nbsp;PQC standards, but there have&nbsp;long been suggestions and&nbsp;rumours that the agency deliberately weakens encryption algorithms. In 2013, The New York Times reported that the agency <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html">had a budget of $250&nbsp;million for the task</a>, and intelligence agency documents leaked by Edward Snowden in the same year contained references to the NSA deliberately placing a backdoor in&nbsp;a cryptography algorithm, although that algorithm was <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announces-steps-to-restore-confidence-on-encryption-standards/">later dropped from official standards</a>.</p>
<p>Moody denies that NIST would ever agree to deliberately weaken a&nbsp;standard at the behest of the NSA and says that any secret weakness would have had to be inserted without its knowledge. He also says that in the wake of the Snowden revelations, NIST has tightened guidelines to ensure transparency and security and to&nbsp;rebuild confidence with cryptographic experts.</p>
<p>“We wouldn’t have ever intentionally done anything like&nbsp;that,” says Moody, but he acknowledges the Snowden leaks&nbsp;caused a backlash. “Anytime the NSA gets brought up, there’s a&nbsp;number of cryptographers that are&nbsp;concerned and we’ve tried to be open and transparent about our interactions.”</p>

    
<p>Moody says that the NSA has&nbsp;also – as far as a secretive intelligence agency can – tried to&nbsp;be more open. But the agency declined to comment when approached by <em>New Scientist</em>.</p>
<p>“All we can do is tell people that&nbsp;NIST are the ones in the room&nbsp;making the decisions, but if&nbsp;you don’t believe us, there’s no way you could verify that without being inside NIST,” says Moody.</p>
<p>However, Bernstein alleges that&nbsp;NIST hasn’t been open about the level of input by the NSA, “stonewalling” him when he has&nbsp;asked for information. As a result, he has made freedom of information requests and taken NIST to court, <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20231003-countcorrectly.html">forcing it to reveal details of the NSA’s involvement</a>.</p>
<p>Documents released to Bernstein indicate that a group described as the “Post Quantum Cryptography Team, National Institute of Standards and Technology” included many NSA&nbsp;members and that NIST had met with someone from the UK’s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the UK&nbsp;equivalent of the NSA.</p>

    
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Woodward_(computer_scientist)">Alan Woodward</a> at the University of Surrey, UK, says there are reasons to be wary of encryption algorithms. For example, the GEA-1 code used in mobile phone networks during the 1990s and 2000s was found to have a flaw that made it <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2281423-flaw-in-old-mobile-phone-encryption-code-could-be-used-for-snooping/">millions of times less computationally intensive than it&nbsp;should have been to crack</a>&nbsp;– although a culprit who put it there&nbsp;has never been identified.</p>
<p>But Woodward says that the current PQC candidates have been heavily scrutinised by academics and industry and haven’t yet been&nbsp;found lacking, while other algorithms that featured in earlier stages of the competition have been <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2310369-encryption-meant-to-protect-against-quantum-hackers-is-easily-cracked/">demonstrated to be flawed and were eliminated.</a></p>
<p>“Intelligence agencies have a history of weakening encryption, but there’s been such a lot of security analysis done on these candidates that I would be surprised if Kyber were somehow booby-trapped,” he says.</p>

One CEO, for instance, said publicly he was “</span><a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/09/28/inflation-prices-investors-iron-mountain/" rel="">praying for inflation</a><span>” so he could raise prices.

One mind-blowing </span><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/yieldstar-rent-increase-realpage-rent" rel="">story</a><span> from ProPublica that came out in 2022 was about landlord software sold by a firm called RealPage, which essentially told big landlords to raise rents by showing them “data RealPage gathers from clients, including private information on what nearby competitors charge.” There’s a quasi-consulting arrangement here too, as “RealPage discourages bargaining with renters and has even recommended that landlords in some cases accept a lower occupancy rate in order to raise rents and make more money.”</span></p><p><span>RealPage is now facing at least </span><a href="https://therealdeal.com/texas/2022/11/22/realpage-could-face-real-trouble-with-antitrust-suits/" rel="">seven private antitrust class action</a><span> suits, as lower output and higher prices are classic signs of monopoly power. What’s fascinating is that here again, an economist would look at these markets and see competition and multiple rivals renting out apartments, but they would miss that there’s a cartel, or rather a set of regional cartels coordinated by a software platform, operating to boost prices and margins.</span></p><p>Sometimes the price-fixing is done through software and data exchange, and sometimes it’s done through signaling in concentrated markets. In its recently filed complaint against Amazon, for instance, the Federal Trade Commission touched on something called Project Nessie, an internal algorithm “to test how much it could raise prices in a way that competitors would follow.” Amazon would raise a price to see if competitors followed, and then keep the price high if they did, or drop it back down if they didn’t. </p><p>Basically, Amazon wasn’t just hiking its own prices, it was signaling to rivals that they should hike their prices as well. I spoke with a former Amazon retail division official, who told me about how much they hated Project Nessie internally, because it was a collusive mechanism imposed upon the retail division which drove up prices to consumers. </p><p>From a legal perspective, it’s interesting the Federal Trade Commission didn’t make a monopolization claim on Project Nessie, but an argument that this kind of algorithmic collusion is what is known as an unfair method of competition, which is a more expansive claim that allows for a looser market definition. In certain areas, like selling expensive cameras, people do comparison-shop. But even though there is competition, Amazon has market power, and Project Nessie is an unfair exploitation of that market power to drive up prices everywhere. It’s a cartel done via algorithm. </p><p><span>I suspect these forms of coordination are far more common than we assume. You might think the restaurant industry is competitive, and it is. But the </span><em>payment </em><span>software for restaurants is much less so, and when consumers are presented with a bill at a restaurant, the screen regularly offers not the traditional 15% tip, but the choice of tipping 20%, 22%, or 25%. Is that collusion? No. But’s a loosely coordinated form of a price hike to allow firms to pay employees less than they would ordinarily have to. And tipping is now being baked into all sorts of firms, </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tipping-businesses-cant-stop-asking-cc1aca6c" rel="">from</a><span> juice shops to appliance-repair firms to plant stores to locksmiths. 16% of small businesses now ask customers to leave a tip, up from 6% in 2019. Again, this change is almost certainly a shift in the software firms use to accept payments, and it’s a price hike and form of coordination you won’t see in concentration statistics.</span></p><p>That said, even if you think forms of price fixing are systemic, there’s another important question. Did this kind of coordination increase during the pandemic and drive inflation? And there, the answer is we just don’t know. Project Nessie ended in 2019, when the House Antitrust Subcommittee began investigating Amazon. Agri Stats changed some of its practices in 2019 as well, after there were class action suit filings. I find it hard to believe Amazon and meatpackers aren’t continuing these practices in some form or fashion. Moreover, competition is cumulative, and so is collusion. If a bunch of firms have collectively held back on supply for years, they can’t suddenly build a bunch of factories to expand production. In other words, if an industry is historically concentrated, collusive and genteel, then prices won’t move very much for a while, even if formal agreements stop.</p><p><span>Indeed, Mike Konczal and Niko Lusiani, in a paper titled “</span><a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/RI_PricesProfitsPower_202206.pdf" rel="">Prices, Profits, and Power</a><span>,” showed how markups exploded during the pandemic, and that the increases in 2021 were “both the highest level on record and the largest one-year increase—over 2.5 times the increase of the next several largest annual increases.” Was that a function of more single firms operating as monopolies, or more concentrated industries colluding to act as cartels? The answer is likely, yes.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png" width="1194" height="588" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:588,&quot;width&quot;:1194,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc67e5ba4-da03-4cad-8faa-ae7c569c356e_1194x588.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>More broadly, price-fixing isn’t always about driving prices up, it can also be about driving wages and supplier prices down. Meat processors weren’t just colluding in jacking up prices to consumers, but </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/hormel-other-meat-processors-must-face-workers-wage-antitrust-claims-us-judge-2023-09-28/" rel="">lowering</a><span> wages to workers. And in a non-inflationary environment, prior to 2021, it was easier to reduce prices to suppliers than increase prices on consumers. Indeed, the decade of the 2010s was one in which there was remarkably slow wage growth, which is consistent with a story of heavy concentration on the labor side (which economists have now </span><a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w24147" rel="">realized is pervasive</a><span>.)</span></p><p>It was only when there was a broad narrative shift towards inflation that businesses began increasing prices dramatically, and that’s when price-fixing turns from pressing down prices from workers and sellers and towards raising prices on consumers. It isn’t ironclad that profits drove inflation, but these cases do suggest that statistics about concentration are at best incomplete. </p><p>One of the core political dynamics in American politics is that our economic and political elites see the world almost entirely differently than normal people, and there’s no better case study for this than inflation. It’s something I’ve written about extensively - why do Americans think inflation is up and the economy is bad when all the dials and data policymakers use show that these are boom times?</p><p><span>I’ve answered part of this question by showing that the dials themselves </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/strikes-and-bidenomics" rel="">are broken</a><span>, that the cost of interest charges isn’t included in inflation metrics. But I also have a suspicion that the increase of tips and </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/whos-to-blame-for-all-those-hidden-fees-we-are-95d42f6" rel="">junk fees</a><span> - which are exploding in usage by businesses - is causing people to say inflation is too high, not just because everything is so costly but because the prices are also </span><em>unfair</em><span>. </span></p><p>Buying a ticket to a game or concert and seeing a crazy fee, or being presented with a tip screen for a locksmith and having to choose between social awkwardness and paying a higher price, feels crappy. Being cheated is not only frustrating, it’s also scary, because it can recur without warning and cause unexpected costs. Being cheated thus imposes a real extra cost beyond the amount someone has to pay, which is to say, increasing uncertainty about future prices.</p><p>So this is another part of the answer about why sentiments on the economy are negative despite evidence of less inflation and more jobs. Pollsters are asking about inflation by framing it in terms that economists understand, which is to say the level or the rate of increase. But ordinary people not only want to pay good prices, they also want to feel like they are being treated fairly. If people feel increasingly cheated, and the only questions they are asked by pollsters are whether the economy is good or whether inflation is up, they will give an answer that reflects their anger and fear of being taken advantage of, and not reflect the ‘objective’ statistics policymakers expect.</p><p>This too is not a new problem. For thousands of years, political philosophers have wrestled with the problem of the ‘just price’ for goods, and every society regulated prices to get close to fairness. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission, and many other areas of government, have statutes that bar “unfair” methods of competition or “unfair” consumer pricing practices, because fairness, not just the level, is something that makes a society function. These kinds of laws seem quaint today, and antitrust lawyers and economists regularly mock the very concept of fairness. But by airbrushing out the human element of commerce, and narrowing the only moral question to efficiency and price level, economists have destroyed the ability of policymakers to see commerce and understand the economy the way the rest of us do.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

I am able to turn off the keyboard light, enable dark mode, yet this fingerprint sensor has a bright light that cannot be turned off. </p><p>I reached out in the forums about this and it seems there should be a way, but it’s not supported on AMD devices as of this writing: https://community.frame.work/t/amd-turn-off-fingerprint-reader-light/37753/4</p><p>If I am on an airplane at night I don’t want to be distracted by light coming from my keyboard area.</p><p>Last thing I tried, was a speed test… Then I realized, this laptop isn’t using the 6ghz band on my router.

Framework support requested that I send them proof and some other stuff, but I honestly wonder if any of them have had a chance to test the 6ghz band in linux.</p><p>Don’t really have time after my exhaustion of all the other issues to send them a detailed report on that just yet, haha.</p><p>Update: Turns out, this was due to having band steering on in my router.</p><p>Pixel devices, iPhone 15’s, etc, all can use 6ghz with this setting on, but not the framework, it seems to… steer itself, to 5ghz haha.</p><p>After turning it off, it likes to go onto 2.4GHZ even when I’m close to the router… very frustrating to have such crappy speeds because the wifi firmware is so bad.</p><p>When band steering is off and you are 1 inch from the router, it will sometimes negotiate a 6ghz connection, even when it manages to, the speeds are absolute crap, for some reason this wifi card really sucks in linux. A small pixel 6a right next to it can do 1gigabit in a speed test while this laptop is lucky to get 300 down.</p><p>Disconnect and reconnect, and sometimes you will get 5 ghz, or 2.4, when every other device I have from this next test location has a -60dbm 5ghz connection. Very weird and I hope AMD is working on it.</p><p>1Password has official support for fingerprint readers in Linux, however it doesn’t work and I am working with them to find out why.</p><p><span>Update: The framework team made a </span><a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/ubuntu-fingerprint-troubleshooting-r1_DA0TMn" rel="">new fingerprint guide</a><span> and at the bottom is a command you must run to enable the fingerprint reader for these other tasks. NOW it works with 1Password!</span></p><p>I have a project running in a VS Code dev container. I noticed that a local app started hanging, loads forever in the browser through the forwarded port.</p><p>This seems to happen after leaving the lid closed for a while and then coming back. Simply re-opening the dev container seems to solve it, and the http requests go through again.</p><p>A known problem in the current kernel, sometimes the system freezes for 1-15s at a time, but it seems to be happening less often the longer you have kept the device on since a restart, and a new kernel is on the way with fixes I hope.</p><p>It can run games, but woah, do the fans spin up. I was able to briefly run Rocket League on windows at the native resolution of the display, it quickly dropped to around 30fps with a lot of drops, so you would definitely want to use AMD FSR compatible games, or drop the render resolution to 1080p or lower.</p><p>Update:</p><p>I found a setting in the bios about game mode on the GPU and enabled it. Starting rocket league again, it’s able to nearly lock 60fps at the screen’s native resolution.</p><p>I also went and connected it via hdmi while on battery to a 1080p display, and it runs games great at this resolution, the fans aren’t even that loud!</p><p>Overall performance seems on par with Apple Silicon. I only have an M1 machine to compare, but the fan stays off most of the time, if I do an intense compile or package installation, it barely spins up. In games at high resolution, it is full blast though.</p><p>The first night as I am writing this, I did some coding work, had it on performance mode, had it sitting with the lid closed during the day, and started out with a 90% charge limit that I set in the BIOS.</p><p>I closed the lid at 16% and in the morning I opened it at….</p><p>8% (after around 10 hours)</p><p>Not bad! I think this is close to Mac level but not quite all the way there.</p><p>Definitely solid enough that you can leave the laptop unplugged and closed during the day between breaks and other things and it is going to save most of the power!</p><p><span>You need to </span><a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/expansion-card-functionality-on-framework-laptop-13-amd-ryzen-7040-series-SkrVx7gAh" rel="">make sure certain ports are not in the rear slots</a><span> for sleep to work well.</span></p><p>As for usage when it’s on:</p><p>Running on ubuntu power saver, it does last longer, but I’ll give you an example of how much performance is being lost.</p><p>I ran a yarn install (packages for an app)</p><p>It took 45s on power saver, and the battery estimates were closer to 10 hours at full.</p><p>Put it back on performance, ran this again,</p><p>15s to run this command.</p><p>Which is the speed I was hoping to get out of a 10 hour battery life, but it is estimating about half that on performance with my workload.</p><p>I feel for people running performance stuff on the older frameworks with the smaller battery!</p><p>I actually like the device, I promise. It just has a lot of issues, some of them are to be expected, but also there’s a bit more than I was expecting, considering how long the wait for this was, and how some small things like a fingerprint light can’t be turned off.</p><p><strong>The repair-ability and durability feel amazing</strong><span> though. You can’t understand just how solid it is until you hold it, and just how easy it is to take it apart to clean or upgrade things.</span></p><p><strong>It’s also very light for how modular it is.</strong></p><p>I just wish the software support for stuff like trackpad gestures could match the Mac one day, it just kills my wrist and fingers to have to do things in a less efficient way than I am used to doing on a Mac.</p><p>One reason I use a Magic Trackpad on the max tracking speed setting, is due to how I can move anywhere on screen, swipe back and forth, with minimal wrist movement.</p><p>I have high hopes for Framework’s future and will be using it as a secondary device on side projects for the time being.</p><p>I also want to be clear, I love being on the bleeding edge and working through problems, it’s how I learn more stuff even though it can be frustrating at times. I will try to help the framework team by testing stuff fast and often as this system matures.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>Scrollbars. Ever heard of them? They’re pretty cool. Click and drag on a scrollbar and you can move content around in a scrollable content pane. I love that shit. Every day I am scrolling on my computer, all day long. But the scrollbars are getting smaller and this is increasingly becoming a problem. I would show you screenshots but they’re so small that even screenshotting them is hard to do. And people keep making them even smaller, hiding them away, its like they don’t want you to scroll! “Ah”, they say, “that’s what the scroll wheel is for”. My friend, not everyone can use a scroll wheel or a swipe up touch screen. And me, a happy scroll-wheeler, even I would like to quickly jump around some time.</p>

<h2 id="why-it-matters">Why it matters</h2>

<p>Ok so a lot of folks have fine motor control problems. Others use somewhat inaccurate pointing devices like eye-trackers (they’re very impressive, but not good enough for your 8 pixel wide scrollbar!!). And these people, they wanna scroll! When my friend is voice/sound controlling their computer (<a href="https://talonvoice.com/">with Talon Voice which is really good btw you should try it</a>), they don’t wanna say “scroll down” over and over again or start auto scrolling and try to land in the right spot. They wanna just look at the scrollbar and click on the spot they wanna be looking at. You click on the spot and the content goes there! It’s THE GOOD STUFF!!!</p>

<p>I am not the first to notice this. See <a href="https://www.remembertheusers.com/2015/10/0014-gtk3-scroll-bar-widths.html">this post too in <strong>2015</strong> discussing this problem</a>. I’d hate to go back in time only to tell them nothing has improved.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The simple fact that these skinny scroll bars exist are evidence that designers do not sit with non technical users to conduct usability testing. Because if they did that they would immediately discover the problem.</p>

  <p>People with dexterity and hand control challenges have a difficult time with these skinny scroll bars.</p>

  <p>People with eye sight challenges suffer with these skinny scroll bars.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>

<p>People keep making the bar smaller! Or trying to get rid of it! I’m naming names of software I use day to day, but it’s not just them, people are doing this even outside the world of Linux.</p>

<p>In some of the cases the problem is actually that the bar is precisely the same size it always has been (in pixels), but monitor resolutions are much higher than when that bar width was first chosen, and bars haven’t started scaling to keep up, but in other cases the bars are actually getting smaller. Gods, remember the needle-bar Ubuntu tried to introduce for a bit? lmao.</p>

<p>And while the bars were shrinking, another feature silently disappeared: buttons to click and hold down to scroll left/right in increments. Arrow-keys largely hold this functionality now, but are dependent on what content is in focus. Buttons were not dependent on this. Actually, some of you might not even know what I’m talking about. These:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/barbuttons-fs8.png" alt="OS X screenshot with the scroll buttons highlighted"></p>

<p>I don’t use these! But I added it into this post on request of someone who does, and wants them back.</p>

<p>By and large the trend that persists is, the bars get less usable, and either there are no user-configurable ways to fix them, or the ability to configure the options are buried so deep into the tech stack that no normal user can find them. I’m extremely technical. Many of my friends are not, and it’s their troubles that have driven me to write this post.</p>

<h3 id="gtk">GTK</h3>

<p>In GTK2, you could modify scrollbar widths directly in your gtkrc, and GUI programs existed to do this. In GTK3, this is CSS. Which, OK I guess, but there hasn’t really been a good user-friendly way to set it unless you understand theming. I found <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/13i6l2n/custom_application_to_change_scrollbarslider_width/">this reddit thread</a> with a good script for it, which I’ll reproduce here in the likely event that reddit dies. Put this in a <code>.sh</code> file and run it if you need.</p>

<div><pre><code>#!/bin/bash

echo "NEW SCROLLBAR WIDTH(px) OR TYPE 'r' TO RESET"
while true; do
    read uin
    uin=$(echo "$uin" | xargs) # trim
    uin=$(echo "${uin,,}") # lower case

    if [[ "$uin" =~ ^[1-9][0-9]?$ || "$uin" == "r" ]]; then

        # RESET

</code></pre></div>

<p>Naturally the script has to override flatpak separately because heaven forbid my flatpak applications look the way I themed my system. They’ve also started hiding the scrollbar entirely by default until you hover over where it’s supposed to be, what is that???? You can get it back in GTK 3 if you know the right command line command to type in. (the script above does this too btw)</p>

<div><pre><code>gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface overlay-scrolling false
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or you can find it in the GUI if you know how to navigate the Dconf Editor, I guess. lol. Though in GTK 4, you can’t even set this setting globally. See <a href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=790677#c6">this thread right here</a>, which to the best of my knowledge is still true as of writing.</p>

<div><pre><code>&gt; &gt; Who ever said they were going to "go"? The API to make an application use
&gt; &gt; them is still there. Programs used frequently on tablets or such can take
&gt; &gt; feature requests to have their own options to use non-overlay scrollbars.
&gt; 
&gt; So I just need to file a feature request against every gtk application that I
&gt; use?
&gt; And when I install GNOME I'll need to go into each application and enable it.
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="qt">Qt</h3>

<p>To quote <code>/u/cfeck_kde</code> on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/qmb1kp/how_to_change_scrollbar_width_in_kde_qt_apps/">/r/kde</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The width of Qt scrollbars is determined by the Qt widget style plugin you are using. As far as I know, only the Skulpture style allows configurable sizes. For other styles like Breeze, you would need to change the C++ source and recompile.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the one paw, <em>recompile my GUI theme?</em> - but hey I’m a gentoo user I do that every friday anyway, I could just drop a patch in I guess… <strong>RECOMPILE MY GUI THEME??</strong></p>

<p>I repeat,</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/fault-tolerance-crop-crop-fs8.png" alt="One person asks another 'did you just tell me to go fuck myself'? The other person replies 'I believe I did, bob!'"></p>

<p>But on the other paw, because Qt style plugins are <em>real code</em> they do get to have a lot more power here if you find one that lets you change what you want. I use <a href="https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum">Kvantum</a> personally. I can’t seem to find a setting in its configuration to change scrollbar width, but I <em>can</em> disable scrollbar disappearing (which it calls “Transient scrollbars”) so that’s nice.</p>

<p>Anyways, I tried out <a href="https://github.com/atolstoy/skulpture">Skulpture</a> like the reddit person recommended and it seems kinda cool, give it a try! I can’t figure out a way to configure it with a GUI though without using KDE Plasma though. No shade on Plasma, I just don’t have it installed right now to try it out, but maybe if you’re a plasma user it’ll be good for you.</p>

<p>Still, if our only hope is this one theme engine that may or may not keep working as Qt development continues, I can’t help but feel like the war is being lost.</p>

<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>

<p>Firefox has also joined the war on scrollbars it seems, with an incredibly tiny scrollbar on the side of my screen. Thankfully, Firefox is at least fixable (for now…), but you have to go into <code>about:config</code> to do it which is never a great sign. HOWEVER, you CAN do it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Type in <code>about:config</code> in your address bar</li>
  <li>Search for <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.size.override</code></li>
  <li>Edit it to whatever number you want</li>
  <li>You can also edit <code>widget.non-native-theme.scrollbar.style</code> to change the shape of it, set it to <code>4</code> for a nice chonk rectangle</li>
  <li>Finally, turn on “Always show scrollbars” in the normal settings window <code>about:settings</code> if you want them always on.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here, I set the size to 50. I don’t want it this big myself but by goly am I glad I can make it this big anyway. Behold, scrollbar glory:</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/glory-fs8.png" alt="the scrollbar is HUGE"></p>

<h3 id="chrome">Chrome</h3>

<p>Imagine being able to configure anything useful in chrome ever.</p>

<h3 id="electron">Electron</h3>

<p>For that matter, imagine configuring an <strong>Electron app</strong>. Couldn’t be me. Or anyone else, for that matter. Maybe you can inject some custom CSS into the electron app to fix things up? Honestly if you have solutions for Chrome or Electron please tell me because I have no idea.</p>

<h3 id="there-are-more">THERE ARE MORE</h3>

<p>Look these are just the ones I encounter regularly, but all of these so-called “modern design principles” seem to be in a war against scrollbars and everyone that uses computers slightly different from the people implementing this are suffering as a consequence. Shit sucks yo!</p>

<h2 id="the-best">The Best</h2>

<p>OK you know what rules though? You know what I love, what my friend who uses eye trackers loves, what my friends who use tablet pens love? MINIMAPS</p>

<p><img src="https://artemis.sh/assets/posts/2023-10-12/minimap-fs8.png" alt="big rectangle with content"></p>

<p>YEAH!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I can <em>see the content</em>. I can <em>click the content</em>. I can <em>go to the content</em>. And the hit target is <em>massive</em>. What more could a girl want?</p>

<p>Pricing across all retailers, both online only or offline + online, is instantly available. The only way to compete is on your listed value adds. </p>

<p>They have already trained much of their customer base that they <em>will</em> try to compete on price by having constant sales. </p>

<p>But adding the above benefits costs money and will cut into profit margins that online only stores don't have to deal with. So you have to then compete on volume, by building loyalty via those above means and doing it really well... it seems like they are trying to nickel and dime their way out of providing that level of quality, putting them into a tough spot.</p>

<p>Unions are about giving employees a seat at the table. The absolute only reason companies don't want their employees to organize is because very few will actually stand up for themselves. The ones that do are easily eliminated. It's much more difficult for them to do that to a whole bargaining unit.</p>

<p>Don't let them fool you into believing they can't afford to pay employees better or give them better benefits. They absolutely can. They just want to see those profits increase more and more.</p>

<p>Ha ha! I had a man come in with a return of an osprey exos… he had the large/extra large and his torso was a 17… strike one… Then I asked him as I fit him into other packs, (after measuring him) what was his base weight. I was specific and said, no food or water, just the stuff you normally bring. He said 35lbs… strike 2 for the Exos… and lastly he was a large man around. A 46 inch waist and the osprey was never designed for that body type… 5’6” 300 lbs and a 17 inch torso… strike 3. </p>

<p>He said he came in, but when I did the exchange it was an online order… almost all of his purchases were online and he was buying all sorts of stuff not suitable for where he says he had hiked.</p>

<p>by the time he left, we had him sorted out and he kept saying… I should have come in first! (Remember he told me that he had been in and fit for this pack)</p>

<p>my guess is that the return policy will become even stricter and mostly member based. That old timers like me will stick around because we are still conditioned to the old ways and like the customer interaction. And the new people will be less and less knowledgeable and more and more unskilled.</p>

<p>and pay will be flat for a long time, until they can make up for all the concessions that they have given in the past 6-7 years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pairings like that between automorphic forms and Galois groups are called dualities. They suggest that different classes of objects mirror each other, which allows mathematicians to study either one in terms of the other.</p>
<p>Generations of mathematicians have worked to prove the existence of Langlands’ hypothesized duality. Though they have only managed to establish it for limited cases, even those limited cases have often yielded spectacular results. For example, in 1994, when Andrew Wiles showed that Langlands’ proposed duality holds for a particular class of examples, the result was his proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem, among the most celebrated results in the history of mathematics.</p>
<p>As mathematicians have pursued the Langlands program, they have also expanded it in many directions.</p>
<p>One such line has been to study dualities between arithmetic objects that are related to, but distinct from, the ones Langlands was interested in. In their 2012 book, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh studied a duality between periods, which are closely related to automorphic forms, and <em>L</em>-functions, which are infinite sums that attach to Galois groups. From a mathematical point of view, periods and <em>L</em>-functions are entirely different species of objects with no obvious common traits.</p>

<p>Periods emerged as objects of mathematical interest in the work of Erich Hecke in the 1930s.</p>
<p><em>L</em>-functions are infinite sums that have been used since the work of Leonhard Euler in the mid-18th century to investigate basic questions about numbers. The most famous <em>L</em>-function, the Riemann zeta function, is at the heart of the Riemann hypothesis, which can be viewed as a prediction about how prime numbers are distributed. The <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-i-learned-to-love-and-fear-the-riemann-hypothesis-20210104/">Riemann hypothesis</a> is arguably the most important unsolved problem in math.</p>
<p>Langlands was aware of possible connections between <em>L</em>-functions and periods, but he viewed them as a secondary matter in his scheme of joining different areas of math.</p>
<p>“In one paper, [Langlands] considered this study of periods and <em>L</em>-functions as something not worth studying,” Sakellaridis said.</p>
<h2><strong>Welcome to the Machine</strong></h2>
<p>Though Robert Langlands did not emphasize the connection between periods and <em>L</em>-functions,&nbsp; Sakellaridis and Venkatesh viewed them as central to broadening and deepening the connections between seemingly distant areas of mathematics that Langlands had proposed.</p>
<p>In their 2012 book, they developed a machine of sorts, which took a period as an input, performed a long computation, and output an <em>L</em>-function. Not all periods produce corresponding <em>L</em>-functions, though, and the main theoretical advance of their book was to understand which ones do. (This built on earlier work by Atsushi Ichino and Tamotsu Ikeda at Kyoto University.)</p>
<p>But their approach had two limitations. First, it did not explain why a given period yields a given <em>L</em>-function. The machine that turned one into the other was a black box. It was as if they’d constructed a vending machine that often reliably yielded something to eat each time you put in money, only there was no telling what it would be in advance, or if the machine would eat the money without dispensing a snack.</p>
<p>For any given case, you’d put in your money — your period — then “go and do a long computation and see which among a zoo of <em>L</em>-functions you got,” Venkatesh said.</p>
<p>The second thing they didn’t manage to accomplish in their book was to come to an understanding of which <em>L</em>-functions have associated periods. Some do. Others don’t. They couldn’t figure out why.</p>

<p>They kept working after the book came out, trying to figure out why the connection worked and how to run the machine in both directions — not only getting an <em>L</em>-function from a period, but also the other way around.</p>
<p>In other words, they wanted to know that if they put $1.50 into the vending machine, it meant they were going to get a bag of Cheetos. Moreover, they wanted to be able to tell that if they were holding a bag of Cheetos, it meant they’d put $1.50 into the vending machine.</p>
<p>Because they link objects that, on their face, have nothing in common, dualities are powerful. You could stare at a lineup of mathematical objects forever and not perceive how <em>L</em>-functions and periods match up.</p>
<p>“The way they are defined and given, this period and <em>L</em>-function, there’s no obvious relation,” said <a href="https://discovery.nus.edu.sg/2099-wee-teck-gan">Wee Teck Gan</a> of the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p>To translate between superficially incommensurate things, you need to find common ground. One way to do that for objects like <em>L</em>-functions and periods, which originate in number theory, is to associate them with geometric objects.</p>
<p>To take a toy example, imagine you have a triangle. Measure the length of each side, and you can produce a set of numbers that tells you how to write down an <em>L</em>-function. Look at another triangle, and rather than the lengths, look at the three interior angles — you can use those angles to define a period. So instead of comparing <em>L</em>-functions and periods directly, you can compare their associated triangles. The triangles can be said to “index” the <em>L</em>-functions and periods — if a period matches with a triangle with certain angles, then the lengths of that triangle match up with a corresponding <em>L</em>-function.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last week, Matt Barnum reported in Chalkbeat that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is laying off dozens of staff members and </span><a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2023/10/4/23903768/mark-zuckerberg-czi-schools-personalized-learning-technology-summit" rel="">pivoting away from the personalized learning platform</a><span> they have funded since 2015 with somewhere near $100M.</span></p><blockquote><p>CZI’s shift in approach marks something of a coda to an era when various advocates and funders believed that computer-based “personalized learning” could dramatically improve education. Summit, CZI’s pet project, has not spread as far as once hoped, and there’s little evidence that it or similar efforts have led to the large learning gains that Zuckerberg envisioned. This gap between ambitions and results underscores the difficulty of using technology to dramatically improve America’s vast system of decentralized schools.</p></blockquote><p><span>On Twitter, the social network where people are particularly sensitive to the hubris of the billionaire class, commenters have received Barnum’s article fairly gleefully. I’d like to go farther than glee, however, and name the </span><em>single</em><span> misunderstanding about education that, more than any other, led Zuckerberg to make this investment which he is now writing down.</span></p><p>This is the Summit model, which I have witnessed firsthand:</p><blockquote><p>Summit also featured 16 hours a week of “personalized learning time.” Students worked at their own pace on a computer, which fed them a “playlist” of content where they learned specific skills. Students could move on once they got eight of 10 questions right on an online quiz.</p><p><span>That seemed to be the biggest draw for Zuckerberg, who contrasted the approach to “</span><strong>having every student sit in a classroom and listen to a teacher explain the same material at the same pace in the same way</strong><span>.” He suggested this could lead to transformational improvements in student learning. The goal, he wrote in 2017, was “scaling this approach to every classroom.”</span></p></blockquote><p>There it is. You see this misunderstanding time and again from the people who influence whatever passes for a national strategy in education technology.</p><p><span>In 2016, for example, the Gates Foundation announced </span><a href="https://usprogram.gatesfoundation.org/news-and-insights/articles/investing-in-the-promise-of-quality-personalized-learning" rel="">a fund for personalized learning</a><span> under the same premise:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>[Personalized learning] allows students to progress through content at their own pace </span><strong>without worrying about being too far behind (or ahead) of their classmates.</strong></p></blockquote><p><span>Sal Khan </span><a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/74-interview-sal-khan-on-personalized-learning-a-global-diploma-and-how-hed-spend-100-million/" rel="">echoed this premise</a><span> in 2018:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>For us, personalization is — and we could talk about the different flavors of personalization that people use out in the world — but for us, it is, </span><strong>you learn at your own time and pace</strong><span>.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>I have tried to illustrate as often as my subscribers will tolerate that students don’t particularly enjoy learning alone with laptops within social spaces like classrooms. </span><a href="https://danmeyer.substack.com/p/why-generative-ai-will-underperform" rel="">That learning fails to answer their questions about their social identity</a><span>. </span><a href="https://danmeyer.substack.com/p/chatbots-have-a-math-problem-and" rel="">It contributes to their feelings of alienation and disbelonging</a><span>. I find this case easy to make but hard to prove. Maybe we just haven’t done personalized learning </span><em>right?</em><span> Maybe Summit just needed to include </span><em>generative AI chatbots</em><span> in their platform?</span></p><p><span>What is far easier to prove, or rather to </span><em>disprove</em><span>, is the idea that “whole class instruction </span><em>must</em><span> feel impersonal to students,” that “whole class instruction </span><em>must necessarily</em><span> fail to meet the needs of individual students.”</span></p><p><span>For that proof, I only need to raise the existence of </span><em>a single classroom</em><span> where the teacher interacts with </span><em>the whole class</em><span> in ways that feel personal and responsive to </span><em>the individual students</em><span>. Here is one of thousands operating daily.</span></p><p><span>In </span><a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/614deb03fdc6eb09ef4adbd5?collections=5fff36c7a65b820b3c57bc64%2C5fff839a8b9eb944c9391501#preview/663d1933-f70c-4817-838b-db101c647a73" rel="">our take on the classic Pool Border problem</a><span>, students eventually write an algebraic equation to represent the number of tiles around a pool of any size.

            <p>Speaking to partners last week as part of their annual Open Innovation Platform forum in Europe, a big portion of TSMC's roadshow was dedicated to the next generation of the company's foundry technology. TSMC's 2 nm-class&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18832/tsmc-outlines-2nm-plans-n2p-brings-backside-power-delivery-in-2026-n2x-added-to-roadmap">N2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/18832/tsmc-outlines-2nm-plans-n2p-brings-backside-power-delivery-in-2026-n2x-added-to-roadmap">N2P, and N2X process technologies</a>&nbsp;are set to introduce multiple innovations, including nanosheet gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, backside power delivery, and super-high-performance metal-insulator-metal (SHPMIM) capacitor over the next few years. But in order to take advantage of these innovations, TSMC warns, chip designers will need to use all-new electronic design automation (EDA), simulation, and verification tools as well as IP. And while making such a big shift is never an easy task, TSMC is bringing some good news to chip designers early-on: even with N2 still a couple of years out, many of the major EDA tools, verification tools, foundation IP, and even analog IP for N2 are already available for use.</p>

<p>"For N2 we could be working with them two years in advance already because nanosheet is different," said Dan Kochpatcharin, Head of Design Infrastructure Management at TSMC, at the OIP 2023 conference in Amsterdam. "[EDA] tools have to be ready, so what the OIP did is to work with them early. We have a huge engineering team to work with the EDA partners, IP partners, [and other] partners."</p>

<p><small><em>*Chip density published by TSMC reflects&nbsp;'mixed' chip density consisting of 50% logic, 30% SRAM, and 20% analog.&nbsp;</em></small></p>

<p>Preparations for the start of N2 chip production, scheduled for sometime in the second half of 2025, began long ago. Nanosheet GAA transistors behave differently than familiar FinFETs, so EDA and other tool and IP makers had to build their products from scratch. This is where TSMC's Open Innovation Platform (OIP) demonstrated its prowess and enabled TSMC's partners to start working on their products well in advance.</p>

<p>By now, major EDA tools from Cadence and Synopsys as well as many tools from Ansys and Siemens EDA have been certified by TSMC, so chip developers can already use them to design chips. Also, EDA software programs from Cadence and Synopsys are ready for analog design migration. Furthermore, Cadence's EDA tools already support N2P's backside power delivery network.</p>

<p>With pre-built IP designs, things are taking a bit longer. TSMC's foundation libraries and IP, including standard cells, GPIO/ESD, PLL, SRAM, and ROM are ready both for mobile and high-performance computing applications. Meanwhile, some PLLs exist in pre-silicon development kits, whereas others are silicon proven. Finally, blocks such as non-volatile memory, interface IP, and even chiplet IP are not yet available - bottlenecking some chip designs - but these blocks in active development or planned for development by companies like Alphawave, Cadence, Credo, eMemory, GUC, and Synopsys, according to a TSMC slide. Ultimately, the ecosystem of tools and libraries for designing 2 nm chips is coming together, but it's not all there quite yet.</p>

<p>"[Developing IP featuring nanosheet transistors] is not harder, but it does take more cycle time, cycle time is a bit longer," said Kochpatcharin. "Some of these IP vendors also need to be trained [because] it is just different. To go from planar [transistor] to FinFET, is not harder, you just need to know how to do the FinFET. [It is] same thing, you just need to know how to do [this]. So, it does take some to be trained, but [when you are trained], it is easy. So that is why we started early."</p>

<p>Although many of the major building blocks for chips are N2-ready, a lot of work still has to be done by many companies before TSMC's 2 nm-class process technologies go into mass production. Large companies, which tend to design (or co-design) IP and development tools themselves are already working on their 2 nm chips, and should be ready with their products by the time mass production starts in 2H 2025. Other players can also fire up their design engines because 2 nm preps are well underway at TSMC and its partners.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
	<p>12 Oct 2023</p>
	<p>Recently, Valve announced that Counter-Strike 2 would <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/10/valve-confirms-counter-strike-2-no-macos/">no longer support macOS</a>. As a one-man indie developer who has released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574000/Industry_Idle/">a game supporting macOS</a>, I find myself at first surprised at Valve’s decision. But after looking back at my own journey of supporting six platforms, I feel I can understand Valve’s perspective.</p>

<p>I feel it is beneficial to write down some of my “lessons learned”, hopefully, that will help fellow indie developers choose which platforms to support. A bit of background, my own game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574000/Industry_Idle/">Industry Idle</a> is mostly built on web technologies (WebGL + TypeScript). This means supporting different platforms is comparatively easy - I don’t have to deal with platform-specific graphics APIs (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan, Metal) and I mostly live inside the browser sandbox. This is pretty much the sunny day scenario when it comes to cross-platform support. Yet, I am constantly surprised and plagued by platform-specific issues.</p>

<h2 id="web">Web</h2>

<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>

<p>If I am asked to choose a “first-class” platform for Industry Idle, it would be the web. During development, I am running the game in my web browser. So supporting the web is pretty much “automatic”. The platform itself does not need much hassle: I can easily set up an automated build pipeline that deploys to Github/CloudFlare pages, which is mostly free.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>

<p>As a platform to release a game, the web platform is very saturated. There are a few portal websites left but they are geared towards a very casual audience, who would not play a hard-core factory builder and economy simulation game. The web version makes very little money. If Industry Idle is written without web-first support, I would probably not port the game to the web at all.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h3>

<p>It is very easy to cheat on the web - after all, the nice development and debug tooling that I enjoy also makes cheating very easy. I have to implement a login system (I implemented Steam OpenID login) so that I can ban bad actors - the game has a multiplayer player trade system and a cheater can easily ruin the experience for everyone. Also, it is possible that people will “steal” the game and host it on their website. I am not really bothered by this as long as people playing on those websites do not cheat.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not much work to support but not many players to gain</strong></p>

<h2 id="windows-steam">Windows (Steam)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-1">The Good</h3>

<p>Steam is the only storefront where the game is released. I’ve submitted to Epic Game Store as well but never gotten any reply - maybe it is a good thing as integrating another SDK is probably not worth it. In 2023, Windows is still the dominating platform for gamers. About 99% of all desktop players play on Windows. The platform has a relatively stable API - Microsoft almost never breaks backward compatibilities. Setting up an automated build pipeline is relatively easy - I build the Windows version on my Linux server.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-1">The Bad</h3>

<p>The game uses Electron as the runtime. But in order to integrate with Steam SDK (which is in C++), I have used a few solutions: <a href="https://github.com/greenheartgames/greenworks">greenworks</a> (no longer maintained), Node-API (via <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api">node-addon-api</a>, requires setting up a cross-platform C++ toolchain and write bindings manually), <a href="https://koffi.dev/">Koffi</a> (an FFI module for Node.JS, provides precompiled binaries but requires writing bindings manually) and finally <a href="https://github.com/ceifa/steamworks.js">steamworks.js</a> (calling Steamworks via Rust bindings).</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-1">The Ugly</h3>

<p>There are relatively few problems compared to the number of players but occasionally I have to deal with really obscure issues like an old Visual C++ Redistributable installed or a “trimmed” version of Windows missing some DLLs. And a lot of Windows players are not tech-savvy, which makes debugging hard. But I cannot really complain about it - looking at the <em>percentage</em> of people who have encountered platform-specific issues, Windows is probably the lowest among desktops.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not supporting Windows is not an option but luckily it’s relatively easy</strong></p>

<h2 id="macos-steam">macOS (Steam)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-2">The Good</h3>

<p>When I wrote the first line of code of Industry Idle, I was using a Mac. I’ve been a long-time Mac user and have only migrated to Windows after doing more game dev. Mac accounts for less than 1% of all desktop players but oftentimes people are pleasantly surprised that the game works on Mac and I’ve got several “thank-you” emails about it. Another good thing about the platform is that the x64 build more or less “just works” on Apple Silicon Macs - I don’t have an Apple Silicon Mac and the game only has an x64 build but several “thank-you” emails I’ve got are from Apple Silicon Mac owners - I guess they should really thank Rosetta. Running in emulation mode is not really ideal but the game runs on a potato so the powerful Apple Silicon can easily handle it even with emulation overhead.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-2">The Bad</h3>

<p>Mac is one of the most problematic platforms, even after Electron handles most of the platform-specifics, there are lots of gotchas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime">Code signing</a> with a hardened runtime is almost a must.</li>
  <li>However, Steamworks SDK loads <code>dylib</code>, which requires several <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation">entitlement exceptions</a>. It’s not well-documented so good luck figuring out which ones. And fingers crossed that Apple will not one day disallow those exceptions.</li>
  <li>After signing the executable, I need to notarize it. The old notarization API takes forever (for a 200MB executable, anywhere between 30 minutes to several hours), fails randomly, and almost never gives meaningful error messages. The new “notarytool” is much improved, but still adds 10mins to the build pipeline. In comparison, the total “Windows + Linux + macOS + upload to Steam” pipeline without code signing and notarization takes about 2-3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Of course, the above has to be done on a Mac (some limited experimental non-Mac support starts to become <a href="https://crates.io/crates/apple-codesign">available</a>), which is notoriously bad for build automation. I have a bunch of hacks like <code>security unlock-keychain</code> in the build script but it still fails occasionally.</li>
  <li>And, keep in mind, this is the <em>sunny day scenario</em>: no platform-specific API porting is needed (like from DirectX/Vulkan to Metal).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-ugly-2">The Ugly</h3>

<p>The economy of supporting Mac as an indie is bleak. A Mac is pretty much needed and they are not cheap. All the revenue from the platform does not even cover 10% of the cheapest Mac Mini. And then there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee for notarization. Luckily it can be used for iOS as well. Also, Apple is more willing to break backward compatibilities. Sometimes there are new macOS/XCode version requirements, which means upgrading the operating system (takes 1-2 hours, can occasionally fail) and XCode (takes 2+ hours, I usually just leave it overnight).</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Not worth the time and money and definitely not worth the pain</strong></p>

<h2 id="linux-including-steam-deck">Linux (Including Steam Deck)</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-3">The Good</h3>

<p>Linux is not picky about hardware - it runs on everything and costs nothing. I run Arch Linux inside a virtual machine on my development machine to test the game. I also run Ubuntu on my build machine to produce the executables. And the server runs on a VPS that runs Debian. Linux is very easy to automate.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-3">The Bad</h3>

<p>Linux is very saturated and the operating systems come in different shapes and forms. Initially, I struggled to get the game running at all. In fact, even an empty Electron app (from the official example) does not run. And after hours of Googling, adding <code>--no-sandbox</code> argument solves for <em>some</em> users but not for all. This is kind of expected because it is impossible to know what libraries are installed on the OS and which version. I wish Steam would allow me to say “Linux support is provided at a best-effort basis” but that’s not an option - I have to tick the checkbox to provide the Linux build, which sometimes sets the wrong expectation.</p>

<p>After Steam Deck was released, I thought supporting it would be automatic - after all, I have a Linux build - but no. It turns out that unless the game is explicitly marked (by Valve reviewers), Steam Deck will use the Windows build + Proton even if a Linux version is available. And the Linux version is running against <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime">“Steam Runtime”</a> - a relatively fixed set of libraries that developers can target. It is a good solution to the saturated Linux library situation but unfortunately, several libraries are missing to run Electron. To give Valve credit, they are very responsive and helpful in eventually <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-runtime/issues/579">resolving the issue</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-3">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Linux accounts for less than 1% of the total players, so from a business perspective, it is not worth it. And the platform has the <em>highest</em> percentage of players who run into platform-specific issues - the time used for customer support only makes the economy worse. Also, I don’t own a Steam Deck, so adding support is not always easy: Valve does not provide a SteamOS image to test. So Steam Deck-specific code (like controller support, starting the game in full-screen, making the UI bigger, etc) is not tested end-to-end. I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/HoloISO/holoiso">HoloISO</a> with limited success.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Even worse economy than Mac but less annoyance perhaps</strong></p>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-4">The Good</h3>

<p>Industry Idle’s core engine is actually a mobile engine - before Industry Idle, I was mainly making mobile games. However, Industry Idle is a desktop-first game, which means porting to mobile requires quite some UI adjustments. The game runs inside a custom <code>WkWebView</code> on iOS, with some bridging code that exposes native APIs (like Game Center). iOS hardware and software are generally less saturated compared to Android, which means after testing the game on my aging iPhone 6, I have high confidence that the game will work fine on most other iOS devices.</p>

<p>The base game of Industry Idle is free-to-play, with two Expansion Packs available for purchase (one-time purchase, not subscriptions) - the same as Steam. There’s only one optional “reward video” ad that allows a player to double the offline income by watching an ad. The game has no microtransactions - I don’t like mobile games that are full of ads or are very pushy about microtransactions.</p>

<p>iOS is generally a more “premium” mobile platform compared to Android, which means more players have purchased expansion packs compared to Android. Even though iOS accounts for only about 30% of all mobile players. it brings in about 50% of all mobile income. Also a nice side-effect of Apple’s walled garden is that iOS has the lowest <em>percentage</em> of cheaters.</p>

<p>I know there have been lots of complaints about App Review on iOS. I feel the situation has been much improved. Review time is relatively short (1-2 days) and if a reviewer rejects an update for nonsensical grounds, a quick reply usually solves the problem. For example, once an update was rejected for missing a “Restore Purchase” button. I replied by telling the reviewer where to find the button with a screenshot and also <em>gently</em> pointing out the fact that that button had been there since the initial release, which was more than <em>50 releases ago</em>. The update was approved the next day. During the initial release, the game was rejected for “copying an existing game”. It turned out the AppStore reviewer believed I was “pirating” the Steam version of Industry Idle. I ended up putting a secret web page on the official website, telling the reviewer that I was indeed the developer behind the Steam version. The release was timely approved. The fact that AppStore has human reviewers is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, people make mistakes, which causes unnecessary annoyances. On the other hand, it’s easy to talk to an actual human and resolve any issues. Compared to Google Play, which is very machine-driven and is very hard to find a human for solutions.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-4">The Bad</h3>

<p><code>WkWebView</code> is the only allowed web view on iOS and its update is coupled with the iOS update. Apple stopped supporting the iPhone 6 a while ago, which means it is stuck with iOS 12 and a relatively ancient WkWebView. Luckily most players use a much newer iPhone, which helps with this problem.</p>

<p>Similar to developing for macOS, a Mac is pretty much required for developing for iOS and there’s the $100 per year developer membership fee. I think the combined income of both iOS and macOS (95% of which comes from iOS) barely covers the cost of the membership fee and the cheapest Mac Mini. And presumably an iPhone is needed for testing, which means the game would be running at a loss. Luckily I had my old Macbook and iPhone so I didn’t have to spend that money.</p>

<p>Just like macOS, iOS is not really designed for build automation either. Partially because I have to run it on a Mac, and partially because the automation pipeline is flaky. <a href="https://fastlane.tools/">Fastlane</a> is a tremendous time saver, however, the build will occasionally fail (2FA required or Apple Server down) and require manual intervention. Because of this, I don’t produce iOS or macOS beta builds.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-4">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Mobile is generally a very different platform compared to desktop. Even though it has a very large audience, reaching the target audience usually requires paid user acquisition (i.e. spending money to buy ads). I have zero marketing budget: a lot of players learn about the game on other platforms; a lot of players join via their friends (word of mouth); and there was once a spike in downloads which I could only imagine was from AppStore Editorial or algorithm. Since I was never told anything about this, I could not confirm it.</p>

<p>The lack of annoying ads and pushy microtransactions provide a good experience on mobile. However, this means the mobile income is abysmal: it’s a fraction of desktop versions, even though the player amount is much higher.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: 50% of supporting mobile is supporting iOS</strong></p>

<h2 id="android">Android</h2>

<h3 id="the-good-5">The Good</h3>

<p>Android version uses the built-in <code>WebView</code> and Google has been doing a decent job of keeping it up-to-date. Since it is <em>not</em> tied to the OS update, a bigger percentage of players on Android have a relatively recent version. However, the same cannot be said about the operating system itself and hardware, which I will get to later. Android’s automated build pipeline (powered by Fastlane) is much faster and more stable - it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux and the command line has first-class support. Android devices are generally cheaper to acquire - I use Android as my daily phone so extra saving for me! As mentioned before, Google Play uses lots of machine-based checks, which means update review is generally faster (a few hours) if everything goes well.</p>

<h3 id="the-bad-5">The Bad</h3>

<p>Android OS and hardware is a mess! There are lots of different hardware, each can run a different OS version, which can have weird customizations from manufacturers. WebView is in general okay but native APIs are very messy - the same API can behave very differently on different devices (e.g. when display cutout API was first introduced, the adoption was bad and each manufacturer has its own quirkiness). My strategy is simple: I test on my own phone and cross my fingers hoping it will work on other devices.</p>

<p>Also Android has a relatively aggressive API deprecation strategy. Google Play requires a relatively recent <code>targetSdkVersion</code> and would reject an app update if one of the third-party SDKs is deprecated. This means I have to constantly fire up Android Studio and update Android and SDK versions (sometimes Kotlin and Gradle versions as well). The project usually will fail to compile, which means several hours of fixing and testing. This does not happen every day but often enough to be annoying. In comparison, I only have to open XCode and update the native Swift code maybe twice since the initial release.</p>

<h3 id="the-ugly-5">The Ugly</h3>

<p>Android accounts for 70% of all mobile players but the revenue is about the same as iOS. Few people have purchased the expansion packs and most income actually comes from the one and only <em>optional</em> reward video ad. Actually, the ad implementation on Android is probably buggy since it oftentimes does not show up after backgrounding the game until a hard restart - I have got complaints from users about this! However, I never managed to figure out why - partially because I couldn’t reproduce it on my phone and partially because I’d like to spend my time working on the game, not debugging some buggy Ad SDK.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: The other 50% of supporting mobile is supporting Android</strong></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I appreciate that you’ve read through my long rant about platform support as a one-man indie and hopefully, this will help you in your decision-making - I know I will definitely make better choices for <a href="https://www.cividle.com/">my next game</a>. When talking about game development, the boring details above are rarely mentioned, yet they are of vital importance in actually shipping a game and they can take a lot of effort. In fact, apart from doing platform support work, most of my time is spent on customer support, community management, reviewing and banning cheaters, and server maintenance. So much so that the work on my new game is severely delayed. I’ve yet to find a good balance but I am trying my best.</p>

		<p>This blog post centers on a vulnerability that was recently discovered related to the HTTP/2 protocol. Under certain conditions, this vulnerability can be exploited to execute a denial-of-service attack on NGINX Open Source, NGINX Plus, and related products that implement the server-side portion of the HTTP/2 specification. To protect your systems from this attack, we’re recommending an immediate update to your NGINX configuration.</p>
<h3>The Problem with HTTP/2 Stream Resets</h3>
<p>After establishing a connection with a server, the HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to initiate concurrent streams for data exchange. Unlike previous iterations of the protocol, if an end user decides to navigate away from the page or halt data exchange for any other reason, HTTP/2 provides a method for canceling the stream. It does this by issuing an RST_STREAM frame to the server, saving it from executing work needlessly.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is exploited by initiating and rapidly canceling a large number of HTTP/2 streams over an established connection, thereby circumventing the server’s concurrent stream maximum. This happens because incoming streams are reset faster than subsequent streams arrive, allowing the client to overload the server without ever reaching its configured threshold.</p>
<h3>Impact on NGINX</h3>
<p>For performance and resource consumption reasons, NGINX limits the number of concurrent streams to a default of 128 (see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a>). In addition, to optimally balance network and server performance, NGINX allows the client to persist HTTP connections for up to 1000 requests by default using an HTTP keepalive (see <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keepalive_requests</a>). </p>
<p>By relying on the default keepalive limit, NGINX prevents this type of attack. Creating additional connections to circumvent this limit exposes bad actors via standard layer 4 monitoring and alerting tools.</p>
<p>However, if NGINX is configured with a keepalive that is substantially higher than the default and recommended setting, the attack may deplete system resources. When a stream reset occurs, the HTTP/2 protocol requires that no subsequent data is returned to the client on that stream. Typically, the reset results in negligible server overhead in the form of tasks that gracefully handle the cancellation. However, circumventing NGINX’s stream threshold enables a client to take advantage of this overhead and amplify it by rapidly initiating thousands of streams. This forces the server CPU to spike, denying service to legitimate clients.</p>

<small><em>Denial-of-service by establishing HTTP/2 streams, followed by stream cancellations under abnormally high keepalive limits.</em></small></p>
<h3>Steps for Mitigating Attack Exposure</h3>
<p>As a fully featured server and proxy, NGINX provides administrators with powerful tools for mitigating denial-of-service attacks. To take advantage of these features, it is essential  that the following updates are made to NGINX configuration files, minimizing the server’s attack surface:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#keepalive_requests" rel="noopener" target="_blank">keepalive_requests</a> should be kept at the default setting of 1000 requests </li>
<li><a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a> should be kept at the default setting of 128 streams </li>
</ul>
<p>We also recommend that these safety measures are added as a best practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_conn_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limit_conn</a> enforces a limit on the number of connections allowed from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. </li>
<li><a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">limit_req</a> enforces a limit on the number of requests that will be processed within a given amount of time from a single client. This directive should be added with a reasonable setting balancing application performance and security. </li>
</ul>
<h3>How We’re Responding </h3>
<p>We experimented with multiple mitigation strategies that helped us gain an understanding into how this attack could impact our wide range of customers and users. While this research confirmed that NGINX is already equipped with all the necessary tools to avoid the attack, we wanted to take additional steps to ensure that users who do need to configure NGINX beyond recommended specifications are able to do so.</p>
<p>Our investigation yielded a method for improving server resiliency under various forms of flood attacks that are theoretically possible over the HTTP/2 protocol. As a result, we’ve issued a patch that increases system stability under these conditions. To protect against such threats, we recommend that NGINX Open Source users rebuild binaries from the latest codebase and NGINX Plus customers update to the latest packages (R29p1 or R30p1) immediately.</p>
<h3>How the Patch Works </h3>
<p>To ensure the early detection of flood attacks on NGINX, the patch imposes a limit on the number of new streams that can be introduced within one event loop. This limit is set to twice the value configured using the <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html#http2_max_concurrent_streams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">http2_max_concurrent_streams</a> directive. The limit will be applied even if the maximum threshold is never reached, like when streams are reset right after sending the request (as in the case of this attack).</p>
<h3>Affected Products </h3>
<p>This vulnerability impacts the NGINX HTTP/2 module (<a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ngx_http_v2_module</a>).

These companies are collecting enormous amounts of data — not only can they see user prompts, they also get explicit feedback (thumbs up/thumbs down) as well as implicit feedback (e.g., asking more questions if you didn’t get the answer you wanted). Better yet, they are also at the forefront of customer conversations, understanding where LLM users are pushing the boundaries and where the models fail.</p><p><span>All of this is grist for the mill of future model training, and investment is only accelerating: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nlkk3glap_U" rel="">recently predicted that we’ll have models that cost $10B in 2 years</a><span>.</span></p><p>Model quality is definitely a big advantage, but it’s only a part of the story. The more impressive moat these companies have is the scalability of their infrastructure and the quality of their service. Let’s look at fine-tuning APIs as an illustrative example.</p><p>Our team at RunLLM has been running experiments recently with the GPT fine-tuning API. A single fine-tuning run on GPT-3.5 costs us anywhere from $4-12 dollars and take about 1-1.5 hours to fine-tune over about 1 million tokens.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, a single </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> on AWS costs $32.77 per-hour on-demand or $19.22 per-hour if you reserve for 1 year. Each machine comes with 8 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Assuming that OpenAI only uses 8 GPUs to fine-tune GPT-3.5, it’s 3-8x cheaper to use OpenAI than it is to rent a </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> from Amazon — without even accounting for the technical expertise required to deploy and run the jobs.</span></p><p><span>AWS is obviously charging a markup on its EC2 instances, but OpenAI’s costs include training and storing the model weights (likely reasonably cheap </span><a href="https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/lora-explained" rel="">with LoRA</a><span>), building &amp; maintaining the fine-tuning infrastructure, and the expertise needed to rack &amp; stack thousands of GPUs internally</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p><span>If we had a dense enough workload, perhaps we could justify renting a </span><code>p4d.24xlarge</code><span> at the yearly reserved cost. At $19.22 per-hour, we’ll be paying about $166K per-year.</span></p><p>Let’s assume again we’re using LoRA to fine-tune a model on 8 A100s, perhaps at 2 hours per run. We can do 12 fine-tuning runs per-day. on these GPUs, or 4,380 fine-tuning runs per year. We’ll allocate one engineer to deploy, check, and validate fine-tuning runs full-time (we don’t envy them!), which will cost us perhaps $200K per-year. (Let’s also assume that we have plenty of data readily available to us to keep fine-tuning jobs going constantly.)</p><p>At $366K ($166K AWS + $200K talent), we’re paying around $80 per-fine-tuning run, about 8-20x higher than what we’re paying OpenAI!</p><p>This just to fine-tune a model. While per-token inference costs for fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is 10x more expensive than GPT-3.5 it is still 10x cheaper than GPT-4! Serving a model on your own hardware is significantly more expensive unless you can reach a large enough scale to fully utilize serving hardware or elastically scale (impossible when GPU availability is limited).</p><p>We’ll give the back of the envelope math a rest, but it proves a critical point: The major LLM providers’ advantage doesn’t just lie in the quality of the model but in their ability to serve models at extreme economies of scale. It simply doesn’t make sense for most organizations to run after their own open-source LLM deployments. They’ll be sinking needless time, talent, and money into an unsolvable optimization problem, while competitors will move faster and likely achieve better quality by layering on top of OpenAI.</p><p><span>Of course, that doesn’t mean that open-source models have no future. We </span><a href="https://generatingconversation.substack.com/p/open-source-llms-shouldnt-try-to" rel="">touched on this last week</a><span>, and our friend Nathan Lambert at Interconnects </span><a href="https://www.interconnects.ai/p/are-open-llms-viable" rel="">recently wrote about the future of open-source models as well</a><span>. Open-source models must get smaller over time to reduce the cost, complexity, and time required to customize and run them.</span></p><p>For everything else, the major LLM providers will dominate.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>T-Mobile is moving people to newer, more expensive plans starting with the November bill cycle unless customers call the company to opt out, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The forced migration <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174s0rx/forced_plan_migrations_coming_soon/">surfaced on Reddit</a> two days ago and was <a href="https://tmo.report/2023/10/breaking-t-mobile-will-force-customers-onto-newer-plans-unless-you-opt-out/">confirmed by The Mobile Report</a>, which published portions of leaked documents indicating how the plan changes will be implemented. T-Mobile also confirmed the change to CNET, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/t-mobile-is-forcibly-moving-those-on-older-plans-to-some-of-its-newer-ones-in-november/">telling the news site</a> that "there will be an increase of approximately $10 per line with the migration."</p>
<p>"We're always looking for ways to give our customers more from our services so we're moving a small number who were on older rate plans to newer plans that will deliver them enhanced features," T-Mobile told CNET.</p>
<p>The Mobile Report article said that users "can contact support upon notification of the pending changes and, after listening to a pitch on why they should migrate anyway, be allowed to opt out of the migration." Consumers will be moved to plans such as Go5G or Essentials, depending on what they have now.</p>
<p>Users who want to keep their current plan should call T-Mobile after receiving the notification that will be sent starting on Tuesday next week.</p>
<h2>T-Mobile: It’s not a price hike, just “a different cost”</h2>
<p>The leaked documents show what customer service reps are being trained to tell users. Instead of saying the price is going up, reps will say, "We are not raising the price of any of our plans; we are moving you to a newer plan with more benefits at a different cost." That's the talking point customer service reps are supposed to use if a customer mentions that they saw commercials "about how T-Mobile won't raise the price of my plan."</p>
<p>Customers will be switched to a newer plan if they're on any of the following packages offered in previous years: Simple Choice/Select Choice, Magenta, Magenta 55, ONE Plan, and Simple Choice Business.</p>
<p>Something a bit strange is going on with the Magenta plan. A T-Mobile document shown in The Mobile Report's article says that Magenta customers will be migrated to Go5G. But it also says that some Simple Choice and Select Choice customers will be migrated to Magenta. T-Mobile's list of <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> includes Magenta, so it isn't clear why anyone with that plan would be automatically migrated.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2015, then-CEO John Legere <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8249169/t-mobile-uncontract-announced">unveiled the "Un-Contract"</a> in which Simple Choice customers could keep their plans at the same price "for as long as you're a customer." T-Mobile currently has a "<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/price-lock">price lock</a>" but only for customers on certain plans who activated their accounts after April 28, 2022.</p>
<p>Customers who activated accounts before April 28, 2022, had the Un-Contract guarantee, which no longer guarantees that rates won't be raised. T-Mobile's price lock page says, "we have committed to pay your final month's recurring service charge if we were to raise prices and you choose to leave. Just let us know within 60 days."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans">current plans</a> range from $60 to $100 a month for a single line or $5 more if you don't enroll in the AutoPay discount. T-Mobile recently started <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/support/account/autopay">requiring</a> a debit card or linked bank account to get the AutoPay discount, which may be concerning to users because of the company's history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/t-mobile-screwup-caused-customers-to-see-other-users-billing-information/">data breaches and leaks</a>.</p>
<h2>$5 or $10 per-line increases</h2>
<p>One of the leaked documents says that customers will see $5 or $10 per-line monthly increases depending on which plan they have now. The document says the increase can be offset with the $5 AutoPay discount, but that discount has been available for years.</p>
<p>Customers whose plans are set to change should receive notifications via email and SMS starting October 17, though a document said that "timing will vary depending on the customer's bill cycle." The notifications will "include a link to a landing page with plan details and an option to call Care to opt out of this plan migration," the document said.</p>
<p>It will be possible to move back to an old plan for at least a little while, even if customers don't opt out in time. A document that describes a few customer service scenarios tells reps how to respond if a user says, "I just got my new bill, and you changed my plan without telling me."</p>
<p>Reps are supposed to tell customers, "We recently notified you of a change to your plan," and that if the plan "doesn't suit your needs, I can help you with the opt out request to keep your current plan."</p>
<p>We contacted T-Mobile today and will update this article if we get more details.</p>
<p>T-Mobile was once a smaller wireless company fighting behemoths AT&amp;T and Verizon but is now one of three major national carriers after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/">acquiring Sprint</a> in 2020. Critics of the merger <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/t-mobilesprint-merger-will-bring-higher-prices-small-carriers-tell-fcc/">predicted</a> it would result in higher prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/174uelk/megathread_forced_plan_migration_for_older_plans/">On Reddit</a>, T-Mobile users called the change a "shady" and "money-grubbing" move. "We are slowly turning into the Canada wireless industry with high prices everywhere," one person wrote. Another wrote, "How long until they just force you off without a choice? 1 year? 2? Pulling a VZW/ATT seems inevitable at this point."</p>

  <p>A hundred years ago, if you were a pedestrian, crossing the street was simple: You walked across it.</p>
<p>Today, if there's traffic in the area and you want to follow the law, you need to find a crosswalk. And if there's a traffic light, you need to wait for it to change to green.</p>

<p>Fail to do so, and you're committing a crime: jaywalking. In some cities — Los Angeles, for instance — police ticket tens of thousands of pedestrians annually for jaywalking, with&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://la.curbed.com/archives/2013/12/the_lapds_250_jaywalking_tickets_are_total_bullshit.php">fines of up to $250</a>.</p>
<p>To most people, this seems part of the basic nature of roads. But it's actually the result of an aggressive, forgotten 1920s campaign led by auto groups and manufacturers that redefined who owned the city streets.</p>
<p>"In the early days of the automobile, it was drivers' job to avoid you, not your job to avoid them," says <a href="http://www.cts.virginia.edu/peter-norton/">Peter Norton</a>, a historian at the University of Virginia and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Traffic-American-Inside-Technology/dp/0262516128" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Fighting-Traffic-American-Inside-Technology/dp/0262516128?ascsubtag=___vx__p_7315914__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___vx__p_7315914__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><i>Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City</i></a>. "But under the new model, streets became a place for cars — and as a pedestrian, it's your fault if you get hit."</p>
<p>One of the keys to this shift was the creation of the crime of jaywalking. Here's a history of how that happened.</p>

<p>Manhattan's Hester Street, on the Lower East Side, in 1914. (Maurice Branger/Roger Viollet/Getty Images)</p>
<p>It's strange to imagine now, but prior to the 1920s, city streets looked dramatically different than they do today. They were considered to be a public space: a place for pedestrians, pushcart vendors, horse-drawn vehicles, streetcars, and children at play.</p>
<p>"Pedestrians were walking in the streets anywhere they wanted, whenever they wanted, usually without looking," Norton says. During the 1910s there were few crosswalks painted on the street, and they were generally ignored by pedestrians.</p>
<p><span>As cars began to spread widely during the 1920s, the</span> consequence of this was predictable: death. Over the first few decades of the century, the number of people killed by cars skyrocketed.</p>

<p>Those killed were mostly pedestrians, not drivers, and they <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+Shall+Be+the+Cure+for+Automobile+Speed+Mania?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rri4b633M3&amp;sig=-Bp6tXcM-ysIRDOFLuB8khgbEz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OS2VO-hKIG9ggS-6oOgDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20Shall%20Be%20the%20Cure%20for%20Automobile%20Speed%20Mania%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">were disproportionately the elderly and  children</a>, who had previously had free rein to play in the streets.</p>
<p>The public response to these deaths, by and large, was outrage. Automobiles were often seen as frivolous playthings, akin to the way we think of yachts today (they were often called <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/which-pleasure-car-fits-the-buyers/">"pleasure cars"</a>). And on the streets, they were considered violent intruders.</p>
<p>Cities erected prominent memorials for children killed in traffic accidents, and newspapers covered traffic deaths in detail, usually blaming drivers. They also published cartoons demonizing cars, often associating them with the Grim Reaper.</p>

<p>The November 23, 1924, cover of the New York Times shows a common representation of cars during the era — as killing machines. (New York Times)</p>
<p>Before formal traffic laws were put in place, judges typically ruled that in any collision, the larger vehicle — that is, the car — was to blame. In most pedestrian deaths, drivers were charged with manslaughter regardless of the circumstances of the accident.</p>
<h3>How cars took over the roads</h3>

<p>In 1925 Midtown Manhattan, pedestrians compete for space with increasing automobile traffic. (Edwin Levick/Getty Images)</p>
<p>As deaths mounted, anti-car activists sought to slow them down. In 1920, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_-3NAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA85&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CWhat+Shall+Be+the+Cure+for+Automobile+Speed+Mania?%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rri4b633M3&amp;sig=-Bp6tXcM-ysIRDOFLuB8khgbEz8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3OS2VO-hKIG9ggS-6oOgDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CWhat%20Shall%20Be%20the%20Cure%20for%20Automobile%20Speed%20Mania%3F%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false">Illustrated World wrote</a>, "Every car should be equipped with a device that would hold the speed down to whatever number of miles stipulated for the city in which its owner lived."</p>
<p>The turning point came in 1923, says Norton, when 42,000 Cincinnati residents signed a petition for a ballot initiative that would require all cars to have a governor limiting them to 25 miles per hour. Local auto dealers were terrified, and sprang into action, sending letters to every car owner in the city and taking out advertisements against the measure.</p>

<p>A 1923 ad in the Cincinnati Post, taken out by a coalition of auto dealers. (Cincinnati Post)</p>
<p>The measure failed. It also galvanized auto groups nationwide, showing them that if they weren't proactive, the potential for automobile sales could be minimized.</p>
<p>In response, automakers, dealers, and enthusiast groups worked to legally redefine the street — so that pedestrians, rather than cars, would be restricted.</p>

<p>The idea that pedestrians shouldn't be permitted to walk wherever they liked had been present as far back as 1912, when <a href="http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/11/jaywalkers-and-jayhawkers-pedestrian.html">Kansas City passed the first ordinance</a> requiring them to cross streets at crosswalks. But in the mid-20s, auto groups took up the campaign with vigor, passing laws all over the country.</p>
<p>Most notably, auto industry groups took control of a series of meetings convened by Herbert Hoover (then secretary of commerce) to create a model traffic law that could be used by cities across the country. Due to their influence, the product of those meetings — the 1928 <a href="http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000968627">Model Municipal Traffic Ordinance</a> — was largely based off traffic law in Los Angeles, which had enacted strict pedestrian controls in 1925.</p>
<p>"The crucial thing it said was that pedestrians would cross only at crosswalks, and only at right angles," Norton says. "Essentially, this is the traffic law that we're still living with today."</p>

<p>Government safety posters ridicule jaywalking in the 1920s and '30s. (National Safety Council/Library of Congress)</p>
<p>Even while passing these laws, however, auto industry groups faced a problem: In Kansas City and elsewhere, no one had followed the rules, and they were rarely enforced by police or judges. To solve it, the industry took up several strategies.</p>
<p>One was an attempt to shape news coverage of car accidents. The National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, an industry group, established a free wire service for newspapers: Reporters could send in the basic details of a traffic accident and would get in return a complete article to print the next day. These articles, printed widely, shifted the blame for accidents to pedestrians — signaling that following these new laws was important.</p>
<p>Similarly, AAA began sponsoring school safety campaigns and poster contests, crafted around the importance of staying out of the street. Some of the campaigns also ridiculed kids who didn't follow the rules — in 1925, for instance, hundreds of Detroit school children watched the "trial" of a 12-year-old who'd crossed a street unsafely, and, as <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/technology_and_culture/v048/48.2norton.html">Norton writes</a>, a jury of his peers sentenced him to clean chalkboards for a week.</p>
<p>This was also part of the final strategy: shame. In getting pedestrians to follow traffic laws, "the ridicule of their fellow citizens is far more effective than any other means which might be adopted," said E.B. Lefferts, the head of the Automobile Club of Southern California in the 1920s. Norton likens the resulting campaign to the <a href="http://articles.drugabuse.net/drug_ads/">anti-drug messaging of the '80s and '90s</a>, in which drug use was portrayed as not only dangerous but stupid.</p>

<p>At a 1924 New York safety parade, a jaywalking clown is repeatedly rammed by a slow-moving Model T. (Courtesy of the Barron Collier Company, via Peter Norton)</p>
<p>Auto campaigners lobbied police to publicly shame transgressors by whistling or shouting at them — and even carrying women back to the sidewalk — instead of quietly reprimanding or fining them. They staged safety campaigns in which actors dressed in 19th-century garb, or as clowns, were hired to cross the street illegally, signifying that the practice was outdated and foolish. In a 1924 New York safety campaign, a clown was marched in front of a slow-moving Model T and rammed repeatedly.</p>
<p>This strategy also explains the name that was given to crossing illegally on foot: jaywalking. During this era, <a href="http://esnpc.blogspot.com/2014/11/jaywalkers-and-jayhawkers-pedestrian.html">the word "jay" meant</a> something like "rube" or "hick" — a person from the sticks, who didn't know how to behave in a city. So pro-auto groups promoted use of the word "jay walker" as  someone who didn't know how to walk in a city, threatening public safety.</p>
<p>At first, the term was seen as offensive, even shocking. Pedestrians fired back, calling dangerous driving "jay driving."</p>
<p>But jaywalking caught on (and eventually became one word). Safety organizations and police began using it formally, in safety announcements.</p>

<p>Use of the word "jaywalking" increases steeply starting in the 1920s. (Google Ngram Viewer)</p>
<p>Ultimately, both the word jaywalking and the concept that pedestrians shouldn't walk freely on streets became so deeply entrenched that few people know this history. "The campaign was extremely successful," Norton says. "It totally changed the message about what streets are for."</p>

We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nSecond, we’re not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world — not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe that’s an important part of building a more equal society. We can’t do that if we have a paywall. \r\n <br/>\r\n<br/>\r\nThat’s why we also turn to you, our readers, to help us keep Vox free. <a href=\&quot;http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=biz-explainer&amp;itm_medium=site&amp;itm_source=article-footer\&quot;> If you also believe that everyone deserves access to trusted high-quality information, will you make a gift to Vox today?</a>&quot;,&quot;article_footer_header&quot;:&quot;<a href=\&quot;http://vox.com/pages/support-now?itm_campaign=default&amp;itm_medium=article&amp;itm_source=article-footer\&quot;>Will you support Vox’s explanatory journalism?</a>&quot;,&quot;use_article_footer&quot;:true,&quot;article_footer_cta_annual_plans&quot;:&quot;{\r\n  \&quot;default_plan\&quot;: 1,\r\n  \&quot;plans\&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 50,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99546\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 100,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99547\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 150,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99548\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 200,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99549\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_button_annual_copy&quot;:&quot;year&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_button_copy&quot;:&quot;Yes, I'll give&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_button_monthly_copy&quot;:&quot;month&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_default_frequency&quot;:&quot;monthly&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_monthly_plans&quot;:&quot;{\r\n  \&quot;default_plan\&quot;: 0,\r\n  \&quot;plans\&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 5,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99543\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 10,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99544\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 25,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 99545\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 50,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 46947\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}&quot;,&quot;article_footer_cta_once_plans&quot;:&quot;{\r\n  \&quot;default_plan\&quot;: 0,\r\n  \&quot;plans\&quot;: [\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 20,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 69278\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 50,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 48880\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 100,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 46607\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \&quot;amount\&quot;: 250,\r\n      \&quot;plan_id\&quot;: 46946\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}&quot;,&quot;use_article_footer_cta_read_counter&quot;:true,&quot;use_article_footer_cta&quot;:true,&quot;featured_placeable&quot;:false,&quot;video_placeable&quot;:false,&quot;disclaimer&quot;:null,&quot;volume_placement&quot;:&quot;lede&quot;,&quot;video_autoplay&quot;:false,&quot;youtube_url&quot;:&quot;http://bit.ly/voxyoutube&quot;,&quot;facebook_video_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;play_in_modal&quot;:true,&quot;user_preferences_for_privacy_enabled&quot;:false,&quot;show_branded_logos&quot;:true}">
