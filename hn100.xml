The administration’s opponents have used group text chats to track Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, share photos of suspected ICE vehicles and raise awareness for neighbors. In June, administration officials <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iceblock-app-ice-agent-sightings-tops-app-store-white-house-backlash-rcna216327" target="_blank">criticized ICEBlock</a>, an app designed to share information about ICE sightings. Apple <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/apple-removes-iceblock-app-criticism-trump-administration-rcna235333" target="_blank">removed the app</a> from its app store in October, prompting a lawsuit <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/iceblock-developer-sues-trump-administration-app-removal-apple-store-rcna248045" target="_blank">from the app’s developer</a> alleging the administration unlawfully pressured Apple to remove it. </p><p id="anchor-00f834">In the past few days, the group text chats — especially those on the encrypted messaging app Signal — have drawn attention from right-wing media. On Saturday, Cam Higby, a conservative journalist based near Seattle, said in a thread on X that he had “infiltrated” Signal groups from around Minneapolis that he alleged were obstructing law enforcement. His thread, which got <a href="https://x.com/camhigby/status/2015093523733733474" target="_blank">20 million views</a>, focused on how the groups share such information as the license plate numbers of suspected federal vehicles. NBC News has not verified Higby’s claims.</p><p id="anchor-80b9bf">Patel said he got the idea for the investigation from Higby.</p><p id="anchor-33975a">“As soon as Higby put that post out, I opened an investigation on it,” he said. “We immediately opened up that investigation, because that sort of Signal chat — being coordinated with individuals not just locally in Minnesota, but maybe even around the country — if that leads to a break in the federal statute or a violation of some law, then we are going to arrest people.”</p><p id="anchor-b23e67">The Signal Foundation, the nonprofit organization that operates the Signal app, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p id="anchor-32952d">Signal, which is considered one of the most secure chat apps, is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/signal-app-used-hegseth-can-leave-door-open-hackers-rcna197956" target="_blank">a go-to resource</a> for people concerned about privacy.  It is perhaps best known as the app Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth used to share <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pentagon-inspector-general-investigation-signalgate-complete-rcna247030" target="_blank">sensitive military information</a> last year in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist.</p><p id="anchor-9d0775">In the Twin Cities, Signal group chats have been a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/minneapolis-school-patrols-ice-immigration-surge-rcna254477" target="_blank">standard part of toolkits</a> — along with walkie-talkies and whistles — used by activists, parents and neighborhood-watch members who have organized as volunteers to warn families about immigration enforcement activities by relaying real-time information, especially near schools. Patrol volunteers have said that, with <a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/ice-minnesota-how-many-feds-minnesota" target="_blank">more than 3,000</a> federal immigration agents in Minnesota, they are motivated by a desire to protect parents, children and school staff members who are not U.S. citizens.</p><p id="anchor-c5ebe7">Patel did not say which laws he thought Minnesota residents may have violated. An FBI spokesperson said the bureau had no further information to provide.</p><p id="anchor-2e2534">The announcement seemed likely to have implications for the First Amendment’s guarantee of free speech. Alex Abdo, litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the First Amendment protects the right to record law enforcement officers as they carry out their official responsibilities.</p><p id="anchor-3ecfcf">“The ability of everyday citizens to hold government agents to account, by observing them and advocating for change, is what has distinguished the American experiment with democracy from authoritarian regimes around the world,” Abdo said in an email.</p><p id="anchor-29aaea">“Unless the FBI has evidence of a crime, and not just evidence of activity the Constitution protects, it should stand down,” he said.</p><p id="anchor-2fc1ab">Patel acknowledged in the interview with Johnson that an investigation into group text chats would raise free speech concerns and said the FBI <a href="https://youtu.be/MwG5jS0cL9E?si=ue_6WtIujZzYbrWV&amp;t=279" target="_blank">would “balance” the rights</a> guaranteed by the First and Second amendments with what he said were potential violations of federal law.</p><p id="anchor-5ee288">“Now, we will balance the First and Second amendment constantly, but we have to let the community know that we will not tolerate acts of violence and an escalation and a violation of the federal code,” he said. The Second Amendment <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-administration-second-amendment-rights-minneapolis-shooting-rcna255784" target="_blank">could be at issue</a> because Alex Pretti, the nurse shot and killed by a federal agent Saturday in Minneapolis, was permitted to carry a gun in public and had one with him.</p><p id="anchor-153bf9">Terr, of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said the government does not get to “balance” the First Amendment against its other interests.</p><p id="anchor-ef9959">“The Constitution takes precedence over any conflicting state or federal law, and over any official’s desire to suppress speech they dislike,” he said in his email.</p><p id="anchor-e709cd">He added: “There is a First Amendment exception for speech intended and likely to provoke imminent unlawful action, but that doesn’t apply to just any speech the government claims puts officials in harm’s way. By contrast, if individuals are threatening federal agents or conspiring to physically harm them, that is illegal. But conspiracy requires an agreement to commit a specific crime and a substantial step toward carrying it out.”</p><p id="anchor-e530b0">Patel also said the FBI had made “substantial progress” in an investigation into groups and people responsible for funding resistance to immigration enforcement. He alleged that the protests and neighborhood monitoring are “not happening organically” but did not immediately provide evidence.</p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><p>David Ingram is a tech reporter for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Ryan J.

<p>The Department of Homeland Security now says that two weeks of critical surveillance footage from within Immigrations and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview detention center wasn’t actually lost in a “system crash,” but rather, was never recorded in the first place. It is also arguing that, had the footage been recorded, it would be irrelevant because prisoner living conditions have improved since the time it was supposed to be recorded.</p><p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/projects/223855-ice-broadview/?ref=404media.co" rel="noreferrer">The filings</a>, made by U.S. attorneys on behalf of Greg Bovino, Kristi Noem, and other DHS officials, are the latest in an ongoing class action lawsuit against the U.S. government filed by detainees at the Chicago-area ICE detention center. The people suing the government in this case argue that they were held in <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>subhuman, illegal conditions at Broadview</u></a>: “They are denied sufficient food and water […] the temperatures are extreme and uncomfortable […] the physical conditions are filthy, with poor sanitation, clogged toilets, and blood, human fluids, and insects in the sinks and the floor […] federal officers who patrol Broadview under Defendants’ authority are abusive and cruel,” their complaint reads in part.</p><p>As we <a href="https://www.404media.co/two-weeks-of-surveillance-footage-from-ice-detention-center-irretrievably-destroyed/"><u>have reported</u></a>, the plaintiffs’ lawyers have been trying to get the government to produce nearly two weeks worth of surveillance footage from inside the detention center from between October 20 and October 31, 2025, which was a critical period where ICE was detaining people en masse in Chicago. The government first said that the footage had been “irretrievably destroyed,” but that it was working with its vendor, a one-person company called Five by Five, to try to recover it. In a later filing, it <a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-says-critical-evidence-in-broadview-abuse-case-was-lost-in-system-crash-a-day-after-it-was-sued/"><u>said that the footage was lost due to a nonspecific</u></a> “system crash.”&nbsp;</p>

            <h4>Jan 27,2026</h4>
            <h2>Xfwl4 - The roadmap for a Xfce Wayland Compositor</h2>

            <p>We, the Xfce team are excited to share some great news!</p>

            <p>After careful consideration, we’ve decided on a meaningful way to use the generous donations from our community: funding longtime Xfce core developer <a href="https://gitlab.xfce.org/kelnos" target="_blank">Brian Tarricone</a> to create xfwl4, a brand-new Wayland compositor for Xfce.</p>

            <p>This initiative will utilize a significant portion of the project’s donated funds, but we believe it’s an important investment in Xfce’s future.</p>
 
            <p>The goal is, that xfwl4 will offer the same functionality and behavior as xfwm4 does, or as much as possible considering the differences between X11 and Wayland. Using xfwl4 should feel just like using xfwm4 on X11. We even plan to reuse the existing xfwm4 configuration dialogs and xfconf settings to ensure a seamless transition.</p>

            <p>Xfwl4 will not be based on the existing xfwm4 code. Instead, it will be written from scratch in rust, using <a href="https://github.com/Smithay/smithay/" target="_blank">smithay</a> building blocks.</p>

            <h3>Why doing a rewrite?</h3>

            <p>The first attempt at creating an Xfce Wayland compositor involved modifying the existing xfwm4 code to support both X11 and Wayland in parallel. However, this approach turned out to be the wrong path forward for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Xfwm4 is architected in a way that makes it very difficult to put the window management behavior behind generic interfaces that don't include X11 specifics.</li>
              <li>Refactoring Xfwm4 is risky, since it might introduce new bugs to X11. Having two parallel code bases will allow for rapid development and experimentation with the Wayland compositor, with zero risk to break xfwm4.</li>
              <li>Some X11 window management concepts just aren't available or supported by Wayland protocols at this time, and dealing with those differences can be difficult in an X11-first code base.</li>
              <li>Using the existing codebase would require us to use C and wlroots, even if a better alternative is available.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Why to base xfwl4 on smithay?</h3>

            <p>Once the decision to write a compositor from scratch was done, the next major question was: Which Wayland support library to use as a base? In order to find an answer on that question Brian evaluated wlroots and smithay. The decision to use smithay as a base was done for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>            
              <li>smithay supports most/all official Wayland protocol extensions, as well as the wlroots protocols and some KDE protocols.</li>
              <li>smithay has no high level abstraction, as wlroots has. However, it allows for very deep customization of the graphics and input pipeline, as well as all aspects of Wayland protocol and desktop/shell handling.</li>
              <li>smithay has great documentation.</li>
              <li>Using rust makes it easier to avoid memory related bugs and decreases the chances of crashes, something that should never happen for a Wayland compositor.</li>
              <li>Rather subjective: Brian has a strong preference to write code in rust over writing code in C.</li>
              <li>wlroots is written in C, in a way which makes it very difficult to write <a href="https://way-cooler.org/blog/2019/04/29/rewriting-way-cooler-in-c.html" target="_blank">wlroots rust bindings</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scope of the project</h3>

            <p>Besides getting feature parity with xfwm4, the xfwl4 project scope includes as well some other related tasks:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Major changes to session-startup will be required, since on Wayland the compositor has to be the root of the session instead of xfce4-session.</li>
              <li>Support for the xdg-session-management protocol is another goal.</li>
              <li>As well support for XWayland is part of the roadmap.</li>
              <li>The build system of the Xfce CI container will need to be upgraded in order to support building rust code via meson.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Brian has already started work on the project, so stay tuned for the first development release of xfwl4, which we hope to share around mid-year.</p>

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the pact "historic".</p><p>It will allow free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European states and the world's most populous country, which together make up nearly 25% of global gross domestic product and a market of two billion people.</p><p>The deal will see a number of huge tariff cuts across a range of goods and services, and a joint security partnership.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa are in Delhi, where they met Modi at a bilateral summit.</p><p>The European Commission said  would eliminate tariffs on most exports of chemicals, machinery and electrical equipment, as well as aircraft and spacecraft, following phased reductions. Significantly, duties on motor vehicles, currently as high as 110%, would be cut to 10% under a quota of 250,000 vehicles. That is six times larger than the 37,000-unit quota India granted to the UK in a deal signed last July.</p><p>India will also cut tariffs on wine, beer and olive oil from the EU. Brussels said the agreement would support investment flows, improve access to European markets and deepen supply-chain integration.</p><p>Delhi said almost all of its exports would get "preferential access" into the EU, with textiles, leather, marine products, handicrafts, gems and jewellery set to see a reduction or elimination of tariffs.</p><p>While commodities such as tea, coffee, spices and processed foods will benefit from the agreement, Delhi "has prudently safeguarded sensitive sectors, including dairy, cereals, poultry, soy meal, certain fruits and vegetables, balancing export growth with domestic priorities", it said.</p><p>Delhi and Brussels have also agreed on a mobility framework that eases restrictions for professionals to travel between India and the EU in the short term. </p><p>"This is India's biggest free trade agreement," Modi said. "It will make access to European markets easier for India's farmers and small business. It will also boost manufacturing and services sectors. It will boost innovative partnerships."</p><p>The trade deal comes as both India and the EU contend with economic and geopolitical pressure from the US. </p><p>Delhi is grappling with 50% tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump last year amid talks aimed at securing a trade deal between India and the US that are still  dragging on.</p><p>Last week, Trump threatened to escalate his trade war with European allies for opposing a US takeover of Greenland, before <a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgezx40r7d7o">backing off</a>. </p><p>That larger geopolitical context was evident in statements made by leaders.</p><p>On Tuesday, von der Leyen said: "This is the tale of two giants - the world's second and fourth largest economies.

A strong message that co-operation is the best answer to global challenges."</p><p>A day before that Costa had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-trade-pact-to-be-very-important-geopolitical-stabiliser-antonio-costa-101769440061733.html">said</a>, without naming the US, that the trade deal would send an "important political message to the world that India and the EU believe more in trade agreements than in tariffs".</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/eff1/live/e41a92a0-fb44-11f0-a0e0-496c391d5d58.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Narendra Modi/X Leaders stand in a line on a decorated stage at an outdoor ceremony.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p><em>Update: This post generated a <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bpqtph/state_linux_music_players_2026">thread on lobste.rs</a> with some more recommendations and thoughts from the friendly folks over there!</em></p>
<p>If you haven’t heard yet, in big 2026 we’re all ditching <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microslop-trends-on-social-media-backlash-to-microsofts-on-going-ai-obsession-continues">Microslop</a> for systems that actually respect you, and we’re also breaking up with our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/862465/spotify-premium-us-price-increase-2026">ever-pricier Spotify subscriptions</a> in exchange for actual ownership of the media we consume. So, for Fun February, I thought I’d take a look at some of the apps we can use to fill the Spotify-shaped void.</p>
<h2 id="the-manifesto-which-you-can-skip-if-you-do-not-care-about-the-self-righteous-linux-user-rant">The manifesto, which you can skip if you do not care about the self-righteous Linux user rant</h2>
<p>At this point, I strongly believe even straight up piracy is better for artists than streaming. At least looking up your favorite artist on Soulseek doesn’t pop up a dozen ads and two AI-generated ripoffs that Spotify would rather you listen to as they profit more from them.</p>
<p>But copyright infringement is only good when multi-trillion-dollar corporations do it to feed their LLMs. Us peasants are still bound by regular laws. So do not Google “life of a showgirl torrent safe no virus”. Instead, you can just… buy music for cheap.</p>
<p>The never-ending vinyl trend cratered prices of CDs, and even new releases can be found for under 10€, with older ones available for half that, especially if you look up sales. If you aren’t too bothered by a lossy format, iTunes - yes, that iTunes, the Apple one - will sell you DRM-free music on release day just like in the good old days. Finally, most music that’s not released on a major label finds its way to Bandcamp, which is another venue for lossless DRM-free music.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re not living in the stone ages anymore, so no one expects you to carry your Discman or iPod around. It takes whole of five minutes to pop a CD into a cheap drive and rip high-quality FLACs onto your drive, which you can then stream from wherever you are in the world. Yes, this advanced technology that took Spotify almost two full decades to figure out can be yours in just a few simple steps through servers like <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome">Navidrome</a> running on your own hardware.</p>
<p>You might say that owning is more expensive than renting, even with all the price increases. Sure. But I’ve paid for Spotify for ten years, from 2014 to 2024, and that’s a solid 1200€ with the old pricing. At the end, I had nothing to show for it. My carefully curated “library” was not mine - it was held hostage by a company that can up the prices at any point. If I stop paying, it’s all gone. And it’s not like the artists profited from that exchange either - one purchase of an album easily pays them more than a thousand streams, and realistically I do not stream most albums a thousand times.</p>
<p>At a time when copyright, and laws in general, only seem to apply selectively, I would rather directly support the artists whose work I enjoy and who need it. And for the rest… well, Taylor already got my right kidney for the Eras tour tickets. I’m sure she won’t mind if I give Opalite a few spins without selling my left one too.</p>
<h2 id="the-competition">The competition</h2>
<p>Anyway, with that out of the way, I wanted to take a look at the state of Linux music players in the current year. I went to  <code>nixpkgs</code> and searched for “music player”<sup id="fr-1-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, which gave me about 200 results. Then I narrowed it down to a handful of actual desktop music players that are also not streaming services.</p>
<p>I looked for features that I would expect to find in an average streaming app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> Modern, intuitive user interface. Looks like a desktop app, and not a blown-up phone app. Designed for human use (no CLIs). Celebrates music as an art form (doesn’t look like an Excel spreadsheet).</li>
<li><strong>Native:</strong> Respects common protocols - I can run it in the background, control the player with keyboard shortcuts, and it shows up in my shell as a music player.</li>
<li><strong>Performance:</strong> Snappy navigation. Works reasonably well with a moderately sized music library.</li>
<li><strong>Features:</strong> Has a concept of a “music library”. Fast, quality search. Playlists and play queues are easy to access and control. Respects existing metadata, doesn’t mess up my files by enforcing its own scheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is by no means an exhaustive list of Linux music players, but I think it covers a nice range and hope it helps someone discover something new. I also tried to surface only the apps I either thought were good or had a lot of potential - if I thought something was downright bad or if it didn’t work I just skipped over it, as all of these apps are free and open source and someone, somewhere put at least some effort into them.</p>
<h2 id="amberol">Amberol</h2>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/amberol">Amberol</a> is “a small and simple sound and music player that is well integrated with GNOME.”</p>
<p>This barely fits my criteria for features. But you know what? I kinda like it! Super minimal, no library management (beyond restoring your previous playlist when you load it up), but what it does, it does great. The waveform on the scrubber is a very nice touch. Looks great for very casual listeners, or maybe as your default app when opening an audio file.</p>

<h2 id="">Euphonica</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica">Euphonica</a> is an “MPD client with delusions of grandeur”. To set up Euphonica you will also need to set up MPD, which is not tragically difficult, and you might even prefer it over a bespoke library isolated to a specific app.</p>
<p>Euphonica has been my daily driver before I embarked on this journey, and it’s fairly straightforward with a few flourishes on top. You have your album and artist pages, a queue, playlists, and nice extras like synced lyrics. I also think it’s the prettiest one in the list - there’s <em>just enough</em> flair to the UI that it seems like it’s “glowing”, the album art is given ample space as it deserves, and the (optional) background visualizer is very tastefully implemented.</p>
<p>It’s not without its quirks. The UI chokes a bit with large collections, and despite my best efforts I’m unable to get photos for any artist except ABBA for some reason (maybe the developer is Swedish?). I also wish it had a song search function, more sorting options, and that re-ordering the queue could be done with drag and drop rather than buttons. My biggest complaint, however, is that changing the volume requires using my scroll wheel on the volume knob. At least let me click and move it up and down.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/euphonica.png" alt="screenshot of Euphonica" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-1">Feishin</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin">Feishin</a> is “a modern self-hosted music player”. You will need a music server of some description: Jellyfin, Navidrome and Subsonic are supported.</p>
<p>Feishin is by far the most feature-complete player on this list. If you want your “personal Spotify”, this is it. The user interface is very customizable, there’s not just search but a <em>goddamn command palette</em> for easy keyboard navigation, and the entire experience is very reminiscent of what you’d get from a streaming service if it cared for the user rather than the shareholders. This includes recommendations (from your own library), highlights, statistics and other fun stuff. Sure, a lot of it is powered by Jellyfin itself, but Feishin presents it in a coherent, understandable and friendly manner.</p>
<p>Not everything is perfect. Since Feishin is an Electron app that talks to your (potentially remote) music server, there are some obvious web-isms, like the in-app notifications and spinners while content loads, as well as the icky feeling of running yet another Chrome instance. You also depend on the Electron audio stack. However, those rough edges are generally minor, the important stuff works well, and the entire package is absolutely worth your try.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/feishin.png" alt="screenshot of Feishin" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-2">Lollypop</h2>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/lollypop">Lollypop</a> is “a new GNOME music playing application”.</p>
<p>I really want to like this app. The album of the day feature is very cool - a small, simple, but thoughtful feature (even if it did try to get me to listen to Weezer’s Blue Album - not today, Satan!). I like that it opens up on the “suggestions” page instead of an alphabetical list of Everything. It supports YouTube music playback. Someone clearly cares about this a lot.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the user experience is painful. The onboarding flow that gives no indication of the next step, the hidden sidebar that magically appears when you resize the window, the fact that you need to click the “plus” button next to the “Reset collection” label in the settings to add a directory to your library (and yes, I understand that ‘Reset collection’ is a button in its own right, but it only looks like a button if you hover over it), the location of the queue (hidden in the “Playing albums” item in the sidebar)…</p>
<p>I get that these might be GNOME-isms, but they are <strong>bad</strong> GNOME-isms. You absolutely <strong>can</strong> make a good app with GTK4 that looks like it belongs on the GNOME desktop. You just need to ignore everything the GNOME developers tell you to do. Be brave! I believe in you, Lollypop!</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/lollypop2.png" alt="screenshot of Lollypop" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-3">Plattenalbum</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/SoongNoonien/plattenalbum">Plattenalbum</a> is an album-focused MPD client. “Browse your collection while viewing large album covers. Play your music without managing playlists”. As with the previous MPD client, you will need to bring your own MPD.</p>
<p>Plattenalbum is kinda like Amberol if you strapped basic library search on top of it. If you want to occasionally listen to a full album and you generally know what you want, it’s going to get you there. The UI is pretty clean and minimal, although (another GNOME-ism) what you see is what you get - there are barely any customization options to speak of.</p>
<p>I want to like this concept - it’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://longplay.rocks/">Longplay app</a> which is an album-focused Apple Music client for iOS and the Mac. But Plattenalbum falls a bit short. You cannot even see a list of <em>all</em> albums in your library or sort by anything except the weird ‘Lastname, Firstname unless it’s a band then Sorta Alphabetically unless the name starts with “The” or “A”’. There’s also no support for multi-disc releases. I think there’s a lot of potential here, and I hope it gets realized over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/plattenalbum.png" alt="screenshot of Plattenalbum" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-4">Recordbox</h2>
<p><a href="https://codeberg.org/edestcroix/Recordbox">Recordbox</a> is “yet another music player for Linux, built with GTK and Libadwaita for the GNOME desktop”.</p>
<p>Recordbox had the best onboarding experience by far of any app on this list - click the prominent button, choose your music directory, wait for the obvious progress indicator to fill up, bam, done. You’re dropped into a very comfortable three-pane library screen reminiscent of iTunes when it was good.</p>
<p>From there I was also very happy to just hit Ctrl+F, be placed in the universal search bar, look up albums, artists or tracks, and have a few obvious options on what to do next. The app feels snappy even when rapidly scrolling through hundreds of albums. It <em>even</em> properly shows multi-disc albums. Another thing that I appreciated is that albums are grouped in the queue, so if you queue a couple of albums you can see (and also re-order!) them as whole units rather than a bunch of tracks.</p>
<p>I could nitpick the “now playing” section which seems a little bit unfinished, and some GNOME-isms like putting some settings into the Settings window (good) and some settings in three-dot menus (why?). But, all things considered, and given that it’s a pre-1.0 release, I’m really impressed by what the developers did in what seems to be a little over two years. Great job!</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/recordbox.png" alt="screenshot of Recordbox" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-5">Strawberry (Clementine, Amarok)</h2>
<p><a href="https://amarok.kde.org/">Amarok</a> needs little introduction - it was <em>the</em> Linux music player of its day, back when getting the audio drivers to work was a cause for celebration in its own right. It heavily influenced <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a> and <a href="https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/">Strawberry</a>. I’m grouping them all together because Clementine and Strawberry both look like Amarok’s UI was dragged kicking and screaming from late 90s into the early 2010s, and out of those three, Strawberry seems to be the most prominent one, while Amarok is kinda buggy on my WM.</p>
<p>Both Clementine and Strawberry seem functional, but out of the two, Strawberry looks marginally better with the context pane and slightly more consistent design. The interface is still less intuitive than I’d like it to be, and there’s really no need to have a giant translucent strawberry in the middle of my screen at all times. The foundation seems solid, though, and I really think that this venerable lineage of music players could reclaim its crown as the undisputed king of music players with a clean new design that streamlined the experience, trimmed some of the cruft, and modernized the appearance to match the rest of the Plasma desktop.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/strawberry.png" alt="screenshot of Strawberry" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-6">Tauon</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/Tauon">Tauon</a> is “the music player of today”. (It seems like the tagline used to be “Linux desktop music player from the future”, which sounds way cooler, but okay…)</p>
<p>I’m going to be super honest here - I never liked the “everything-is-a-playlist” approach of a specific breed of music players. Some people swear by it, but I find it overwhelming and confusing.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if this is your vibe, Tauon seems solid. The UI is a bit reminiscent of a DJ deck - I think it’s the default color scheme and the stretched icons. Being a native app, it’s super snappy, and scrolling through 8k+ tracks feels smooth, even if the scroll bar is on the left of the window for some reason. Navigation is not super intuitive at the start, but it certainly gets out of your way as much as possible and I see how I could learn to appreciate it with a little bit of effort.</p>
<p>Tauon also seems to support Plex, Subsonic, Jellyfin and even Spotify as network sources, includes tag management options, a lyrics editor and Discord integration if that’s your jam. It certainly gives Feishin a run for its money in the features department. Overall, if you’d consider yourself a “power user” and you’ve been looking for a Linux version of foobar2000, this is the app for you.</p>
<p><img src="https://crescentro.se/posts/linux-music-players-2026/tauon.png" alt="screenshot of Tauon" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="-7">Summary</h2>
<p>If you have a Jellyfin or a Subsonic-compatible server, and even if you do not but are willing to spend a little bit of time setting one up, <a href="https://github.com/jeffvli/feishin">Feishin</a> is the obvious choice. It works great, looks modern, and has tons of features. Once you set it up, it’s super simple to use.</p>
<p>For local playback or for the Electron-averse, <a href="https://github.com/Taiko2k/Tauon">Tauon</a> is definitely the power user’s choice with all of its intricacies. Otherwise, <a href="https://codeberg.org/edestcroix/Recordbox">Recordbox</a> is shaping up to be a really good choice, and <a href="https://github.com/htkhiem/euphonica">Euphonica</a> is still my pick if you already have an MPD server running.</p>
<p>If you’re just looking to play a few tracks now and then, I don’t know why you’ve been reading up until now, but <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/amberol">Amberol</a> is super cute.</p>
<p>Honestly, I’m really happy with this. I started looking into this feeling a bit desperate, but there’s actually a vibrant ecosystem of native Linux apps out there, with people building things they care about, and even if all the features aren’t all the way there yet, it’s much better than it was. I hope these trends continue!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody" data-epic-field="content">
                        <p>French politicians have passed a bill that will ban social media use by under-15s, a move championed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to protect children from excessive screen time.</p>
<p>The lower National Assembly adopted the text by a vote of 130 to 21 in a lengthy session that started yesterday.</p>
<p>It will now go to the Senate, France's upper house, ahead of becoming law.</p>
<p>Mr Macron hailed the vote as a "major step" to protect French children and teenagers in a post on X.</p>
<p>The legislation, which also provides for a ban on mobile phones in high schools, would make France the second country to take such a step following Australia's ban for under-16s in December<a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2025/1209/1547984-australia-social-media-ban/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<p>As social media has grown, so has concern that too much screen time is harming child development and contributing to mental health problems.</p>
<p>"The emotions of our children and teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated, either by American platforms or Chinese algorithms," Mr Macron said in a video broadcast on Saturday.</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://www.rte.ie/images/00204d61-614.jpg?ratio=1.78">
<figcaption>The draft bill excludes online encyclopedias and educational platforms</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Authorities want the measures to be enforced from the start of the 2026 school year for new accounts.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Gabriel Attal, who leads Mr Macron's Renaissance party in the lower house, said he hoped the Senate would pass the bill by mid-February so that the ban could come into force on 1 September.</p>
<p>He added that "social media platforms will then have until 31 December to deactivate existing accounts" that do not comply with the age limit.</p>
<p>In addition to combatting the impact of screens and social media on the mental health of young adolescents, Mr Attal stressed the measure would counter "a number of powers that, through social media platforms, want to colonise minds".</p>
<p>"France can be a pioneer in Europe in a month: we can change the lives of our young people and our families, and perhaps also change the destiny of our country in terms of independence," he said.</p>
<p>France's public health watchdog ANSES said this month that social media such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram had several detrimental effects on adolescents, particularly girls, though it was not the sole reason for their declining mental health.</p>
<p>The risks listed include cyberbullying and exposure to violent content.</p>
<p>The legislation stipulates that "access to an online social networking service provided by an online platform is prohibited for minors under the age of 15".</p>
<p>The draft bill excludes online encyclopedias and educational platforms.</p>
<p>An effective age verification system would have to come into force for the ban to become reality.</p>
<p>Work on such a system is under way at the European level.</p>

<figcaption>President Emmanuel Macron has backed a ban on pupils having mobile phones in high schools</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Arnaud Saint-Martin, of the left-wing France Unbowed party, criticised the ban as "a form of digital paternalism" and an "overly simplistic" response to the negative impacts of technology.</p>
<p>Yesterday, nine child protection associations urged politicians to "hold platforms accountable", not "ban" children from social media.</p>
<p>Mr Macron has also backed a ban on pupils having mobile phones in high schools.</p>
<p>In 2018, France banned children from using mobile phones in colleges, the schools attended between the ages of 11 and 15.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Elisabeth Borne expressed reservations about the measure.</p>
<p>"It's more complicated than that," she told broadcaster France 2.</p>
<p>"We first need to make sure that the ban is properly enforced in middle schools," she added.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/world/2025/1209/1547984-australia-social-media-ban/" target="_blank">In December, Australia became the first country to implement a minimum age for social media use</a>, with platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube forced to block more than a million accounts.</p>
<p>It required ten of the biggest platforms to block Australians aged under 16 or be fined up to A$49.5 million (€28 million).</p>
<p>The law received criticism from major technology companies and free speech advocates, but was praised by parents and child advocates.</p>

Below are examples generated by K2.5 from a single prompt with image-gen tool:</p><!----><p>Beyond text prompts, K2.5 excels at <strong>coding with vision</strong>. By reasoning over images and video, K2.5 improves image/video-to-code generation and visual debugging, lowering the barrier for users to express intent visually.</p><p>Here is an example of K2.5 reconstructing a website from video:</p><!----><p>This capability stems from massive-scale vision-text joint pre-training. At scale, the trade-off between vision and text capabilities disappears — they improve in unison.</p><p>Below is an example of K2.5 reasoning over a puzzle and marking the shortest path using code:</p><!----><p><strong>K2.5 excels in real-world software engineering tasks.</strong> We evaluate it using <strong>Kimi Code Bench</strong>, our <strong>internal coding benchmark</strong> covering diverse end-to-end tasks — from building to debugging, refactoring, testing, and scripting — across multiple programming languages. On this benchmark, <strong>K2.5 shows consistent and meaningful improvements over</strong> <strong>K2</strong> <strong>across task types</strong>.</p><p><img src="https://statics.moonshot.cn/blogs/k2-5/img_v3_02ub_47858019-34ce-4e34-ae76-f7165f95b91g.png"></p><p>To try out K2.5's agentic coding capabilities, <strong><a href="http://kimi.com/agent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">K2.5 Agent</a></strong> offers a set of preconfigured tools for immediate, hands-on experiences.

Running these subtasks concurrently significantly reduces end-to-end latency compared to sequential agent execution.</p><p>Training a reliable parallel orchestrator is challenging due to delayed, sparse, and non-stationary feedback from independently running subagents. A common failure mode is <strong>serial collapse</strong>, where the orchestrator defaults to single-agent execution despite having parallel capacity. To address this, PARL employs <em>staged reward shaping</em> that encourages parallelism early in training and gradually shifts focus toward task success.</p><p>We define the reward as</p><mjx-container tabindex="0" jax="SVG" display="true"><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="block"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><msub><mi>R</mi><mi>t</mi></msub><mo>=</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mtext>aux</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>⋅</mo><munder><mrow data-mjx-texclass="OP"><munder><msub><mi>r</mi><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mtext>parallel</mtext></mrow></msub><mo>⏟</mo></munder></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mtext>instantiation reward</mtext></mrow></munder><mo>+</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo>−</mo><msub><mi>λ</mi><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mtext>aux</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>⋅</mo><munder><mrow data-mjx-texclass="OP"><munder><mrow data-mjx-texclass="INNER"><mo data-mjx-texclass="OPEN">(</mo><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mi mathvariant="double-struck">I</mi></mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><mtext>success</mtext><mo stretchy="false">]</mo><mo>⋅</mo><mi>Q</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>τ</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo data-mjx-texclass="CLOSE">)</mo></mrow><mo>⏟</mo></munder></mrow><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mtext>task-level outcome</mtext></mrow></munder></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container><p>where <mjx-container jax="SVG"><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>λ</mi><mrow data-mjx-texclass="ORD"><mtext>aux</mtext></mrow></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>e</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> anneals from <mjx-container jax="SVG"><mjx-assistive-mml unselectable="on" display="inline"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mn>0.1</mn><mo accent="false" stretchy="false">→</mo><mn>0.0</mn></math></mjx-assistive-mml></mjx-container> over training.

General Testing Details</strong></p><ul><li>We report results for Kimi K2.5 and DeepSeek-V3.2 with thinking mode enabled, Claude Opus 4.5 with extended thinking mode, GPT-5.2 with xhigh reasoning effort, and Gemini 3 Pro with a high thinking level. For vision benchmarks, we additionally report results for Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking.</li><li>Unless otherwise specified, all Kimi K2.5 experiments were conducted with temperature = 1.0, top-p = 0.95, and a context length of 256k tokens.</li><li>Benchmarks without publicly available scores were re-evaluated under the same conditions used for Kimi K2.5 and are marked with an asterisk (*).</li><li>We could not evaluate GPT-5.2 xhigh on all benchmarks due to service stability issues. For benchmarks that were not tested, we mark them as "-".</li></ul><p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Text and Reasoning</strong></p><ul><li>HLE, AIME 2025, HMMT 2025 (Feb), GPQA-Diamond and IMO-AnswerBench were evaluated with a maximum completion budget of 96k tokens.</li><li>Results for AIME and HMMT are averaged over 32 runs (avg@32); GPQA-Diamond over 8 runs (avg@8).</li><li>For HLE, we report scores on the full set (text &amp; image). Kimi K2.5 scores 31.5 (text) and 21.3 (image) without tools, and 51.8 (text) and 39.8 (image) with tools. The DeepSeek-V3.2 score corresponds to its text-only subset (marked with †) . Hugging Face access was blocked to prevent potential data leakage. HLE with tools uses simple context management: once the context exceeds a threshold, only the latest round of tool messages is retained.</li></ul><p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Tool-Augmented / Agentic Search</strong></p><ul><li>Kimi K2.5 was equipped with search, code-interpreter, and web-browsing tools for HLE with tools and all agentic search benchmarks.</li><li>Except for BrowseComp (where K2.5 and DeepSeek-V3.2 used the discard-all strategy), no context management was applied, and tasks exceeding the supported context length were directly counted as failed.</li><li>The test system prompts emphasize deep and proactive tool use, instructing models to reason carefully, leverage tools, and verify uncertain information. Full prompts will be provided in the technical report.</li><li>Results for Seal-0 and WideSearch are averaged over four runs (avg@4).</li></ul><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Vision Benchmarks</strong></p><ul><li>Max-tokens = 64k, averaged over three runs (avg@3).</li><li>ZeroBench (w/ tools) uses max-tokens-per-step = 24k and max-steps = 30 for multi-step reasoning.</li><li>MMMU-Pro follows the official protocol, preserving input order and prepending images.</li><li>GPT-5.2-xhigh had ~10% failure rate (no output despite 3 retries), treated as incorrect; reported scores likely underestimate true performance.</li><li>WorldVQA, a benchmark designed to evaluate atomic vision-centric world knowledge. Access WorldVQA at <a href="https://github.com/MoonshotAI/WorldVQA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/MoonshotAI/WorldVQA</a>.</li><li>OmniDocBench Score is computed as (1 − normalized Levenshtein distance) × 100, where a higher score denotes superior accuracy.</li></ul><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Coding Tasks</strong></p><ul><li>Terminal-Bench 2.0 scores were obtained with the default agent framework (Terminus-2) and the provided JSON parser. In our implementation, we evaluated Terminal-Bench 2.0 under non-thinking mode. This choice was made because our current context management strategy for the thinking mode is incompatible with Terminus-2.</li><li>For the SWE-Bench series of evaluations (including verified, multilingual, and pro), we used an internally developed evaluation framework. This framework includes a minimal set of tools—bash tool, createfile tool, insert tool, view tool, strreplace tool, and submit tool—along with tailored system prompts designed for the tasks. The highest scores were achieved under non-thinking mode.</li><li>The score of Claude Opus 4.5 on CyberGym is reported under the non-thinking setting.</li><li>All reported scores of coding tasks are averaged over 5 independent runs.</li></ul><p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Long-Context Benchmarks</strong></p><ul><li>AA-LCR: scores averaged over three runs (avg@3).</li><li>LongBench-V2: identical prompts and input contexts standardized to ~128k tokens.</li></ul><p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Agent Swarm</strong></p><ul><li>BrowseComp (Swarm Mode): main agent max 15 steps; sub-agents max 100 steps.</li><li>WideSearch (Swarm Mode): main and sub-agents max 100 steps.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

The ‌iPhone‌ 5s came out in September 2013, while the ‌iPhone‌ 6 launched in September 2014.</p>
<p>According to Apple's release notes for the update, iOS 12.5.8 extends the certificate required for features like iMessage, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/">FaceTime</a>, and device activation, so they will continue to work after January 2027.</p>
<p>Originally, certificate-limited functions like device activation would have ceased when the certificate expired, but now key features on the two older iPhones will continue to work in the years to come.</p>
<p>Prior to now, the ‌iPhone‌ 5s and ‌iPhone‌ 6 last received software updates in January 2023, when Apple released important security fixes.</p>
<p>Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/06/apple-iphone-security-updates-five-year-minimum/">has publicly committed</a> to providing a minimum of five years of security updates for an ‌iPhone‌ from the time that it launches, but it often offers vulnerability fixes for an even longer period of time.</p>
<p>The ‌iPhone‌ 6s, for example, was released 11 years ago, but it received a security update in September 2025 with the launch of iOS 15.8.5. The device received an iOS 15.8.6 update just today, adding the same certificate extension.</p>
<p>Apple also released new versions of iOS 18 and iOS 16.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Change implies Canadian startups have to incorporate in the US, Cayman Islands, or Singapore to join accelerator. </p><article>
                                    
<p>Y Combinator has revised its standard deal terms to exclude Canada as a permitted site of investment, implying that Canadian startups aspiring to join the prestigious San Francisco-based startup accelerator will have to incorporate their companies elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As first reported by <a href="https://thelogic.co/news/exclusive/y-combinator-canada-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title=""><em>The Logic</em></a> Monday, Y Combinator’s standard deal terms webpage now says it invests in corporations based in the United States, the Cayman Islands, or Singapore. Canada was in that list as recently as Nov. 2, 2025, according to an archived version of the webpage, but the reference was removed by the end of that month. Dozens of <a href="https://betakit.com/opennote-raises-850000-usd-secures-y-combinator-spot-for-edtech-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Canadian</a> <a href="https://betakit.com/team-of-toronto-talent-unites-after-y-combinator-to-build-clado/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">companies</a> have been part of Y Combinator’s <a href="https://betakit.com/meet-the-y-combinator-winter-2024-cohort-startups-with-canadian-roots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">numerous</a> winter and summer cohorts since the first one was accepted in 2008.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The deal terms go on to state that if a startup is already incorporated in another country that is “not one of the three” (previously “four”) countries listed, the startup needs to “flip” its corporate structure to have a parent company in one of those three countries.</p>



<p>BetaKit has reached out to Y Combinator for comment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The gravitational pull of Y Combinator’s program over Canadian startups has <a href="https://betakit.com/y-combinator-is-stealing-canadian-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">increased in recent years</a>, aided by remote policies instituted during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the 2010s, there were usually fewer than five Canadian-headquartered companies in a given Y Combinator cohort, according to data gathered last year by <a href="https://x.com/bram/status/1896999177256886726?s=20">Bram Sugarman</a>. Between winter 2020 and winter 2022, that number grew to range between nine and 15 startups in the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="https://betakit.com/y-combinator-is-stealing-canadian-startups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""><strong>Y Combinator is stealing Canadian startups</strong></a></p>



<p>It is common practice for Canadian founders to set up shop in the Valley, especially to participate in Y Combinator. Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan claimed in an X post last year that “The Canadians stay in the USA and raise more money. The ones that stay in SF after demo day become unicorns at 2.5X the rate.”</p>



<p>Tan <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1897161477548896370?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" title="">added</a> at the time that he was part of a YC dinner with many Canadian founders looking to base their startups in San Francisco after graduation.</p>



<p>One such company is Guelph, Ont.- and Irvine, Calif.-based edtech startup <a href="https://betakit.com/opennote-raises-850000-usd-secures-y-combinator-spot-for-edtech-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Opennote</a>. A member of Y Combinator’s Summer 2025 batch, co-founder Vedant Vyas told BetaKit last July that the firm hoped to scale out of the Bay Area, citing support from US-based investors and an increased institutional willingness in the US to pilot new edtech solutions.</p>



<p>The pull was a topic of conversation at Toronto Tech Week’s <a href="https://betakit.com/canadian-tech-leaders-tell-the-next-generation-to-learn-to-say-no-at-homecoming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Homecoming event</a> in June 2025, where Shopify president Harley Finkelstein, Wealthsimple founder Mike Katchen, and Cohere founder Aidan Gomez encouraged the crowd to say no to leaving Canada.</p>



<p>“It’s the Valley-or-bust mentality that breaks the ecosystem and really hurts Canada,” Gomez said.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Hi! Long time no see, huh? 🙂</p>



<p>It’s been three years since my last State of the Windows article, which was about the inconsistencies in the Windows 11 user experience. Since then, Microsoft (and the world as a whole to be quite honest) has gotten through a lot of changes, especially since the introduction of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, and in our case, most importantly, Microsoft Copilot.</p>



<p>Until a few years ago, Windows was Microsoft’s crown jewel (or as they said in the Windows 7 commercial, <strong>the heartbeat of Microsoft</strong>), an impressive operating system that had the purpose to be a common platform for all devices. However, since the launch of Windows 11, which at first had the purpose to somewhat modernize the look and feel of the OS, it seems that priorities have changed quite a bit.</p>



<p>Today we are going to talk about the perceived drop of quality in Windows, from fundamental issues like critical bugs and incidents from the last 3 years to how everything’s become a Copilot upsell funnel mechanism.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let’s go!</p>



<p>First, let’s talk about the current, show-stopping errors that appeared with the latest January 2026 update, and how to fix them.</p>



<h2>1. PCs that wouldn’t shutdown – January 2026.</h2>



<p>This is one of the bugs that I’ve actually encountered a few days ago at work – people would come in saying that their PCs would either act unresponsive after shutting down (as in, they wouldn’t start up again the next day), or it would reboot immediately after shutting down.  </p>



<p>This issue was introduced with the January 2026 update, KB5073455&nbsp;and it is more prominent on newer platforms, especially Intel’s Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake.</p>



<p>Reportedly this issue is caused by the System Guard Secure Launch, a virtualization-based security component which, as the name implies, protects the boot process by using DRTM, or Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement.</p>

<p>More information about this technology can be found <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/hardware-security/how-hardware-based-root-of-trust-helps-protect-windows">here</a>.</p>



<p>Since last Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released a patch for this issue, <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5077797">KB5077797</a>, which seems to solve the issues. </p>



<p>As a temporary workaround, users can shutdown their PCs using the Command Prompt, by entering <em><strong>shutdown /s /t 0</strong>.</em> But this begs the question, why does the shutdown command work through this command which supposedly does the same thing, but not through the classic shutdown button?</p>



<h2>2. Outlook “classic” can’t open pst files – january 2026</h2>



<p>Once again, this month’s Patch Tuesday brought another major issue, which has the potential to affect one’s productivity in a big way. </p>



<p>If the KB5074109&nbsp;is installed, applications can become unresponsive when accessing PST files stored on cloud storage. To put it simply, if you have your mail archive saved on OneDrive or Dropbox and are still using the classic Win32 Outlook (and not the WebView based one) it’s possible that you can’t access the file, since the application would become unresponsive.</p>



<p>Also, users with Outlook POP account profiles and profiles with PST files report that Outlook hangs and does not exit properly.</p>



<p>Up until yesterday, the only fixes were to either <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/classic-outlook-profiles-with-pop-accounts-and-psts-hang-after-windows-updates-on-january-13-2026-590fe356-ecc2-49f4-b9e3-bd39fafa58f6#wl">uninstall the update or to “use webmail”</a>.  Their words, not mine.</p>

<p>However, as of January 25th, Microsoft released the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/5078132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KB5078132</a> update, which should fix the issue.</p>



<p>Some other issues with the latest update include:</p>



<p>Apps that wouldn’t load (including system ones like Notepad), crashing with the error 0x803f8001.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these are only some of the more prominent issues that occurred in the last year.</p>



<h2>But wait, that’s not all! </h2>



<p>Another ever-growing issue is the fact that Windows is <strong><em>bloated</em></strong>. And I’m not talking about the number of apps that are included in the OS or something that any script or custom OS could fix, but the fact that critical components are becoming so heavy that Microsoft has to develop workarounds in order to make them feel faster.</p>



<p>The prime example is Windows Explorer, which has become so sluggish that it has to be preloaded in order to make it faster, but even then it’s actually slower than previous versions of Windows! </p>

<p>How can one of the core UI elements of the OS become so heavy while not offering any noticeable quality-of-life improvement (apart from the introduction of tabs in Windows 11 22H2)? </p>



<p>Even Windows updates have become <em><strong>insanely </strong></em>big. Just take a look at the latest January 2026 update for Windows 11 23H2 and the one for 25H2.</p>

<p>More than 4 times bigger! <em>And you probably know why</em>. More on that later.</p>



<p>Last, but not least, the technical debt of Windows has become almost unbearable. 30+ years of Windows NT certainly adds up. And the fact that Microsoft can’t focus on a visual language or a software platform for once is daunting, especially since given the nature of Windows you have to support them <em>all</em>.</p>



<p>However, the biggest problem is that Windows is not only buggy. Sure, a piece of software of this magnitude can and will have its fair share of issues. Our use cases have gotten more complex and the software that we expect to fulfill those use cases have become more complex, more secure, more powerful, you name it. That being said…</p>



<h2>windows is getting annoying.</h2>



<p>Let’s tackle the elephant in the room.</p>



<p>LLMs (and AI as a whole) have the potential to be an outright revolution, changing the fabric of society and the way of our lives. Microsoft Copilot as well could be a brilliant idea if it is implemented correctly and has the power to completely transform Microsoft into an even bigger juggernaut, unlocking even more of that sweet shareholder value… if it’s done properly, that is.</p>



<p>Introduced in 2023, Microsoft Copilot is Microsoft’s chatbot based on OpenAI’s models after a $10 billion investment. Introduced in Windows 11 with the December 2023 Patch Tuesday, at first it was just a benign WebView application that could be easily removed. However, since 2024, Copilot and artificial intelligence have taken a critical role in Microsoft’s overall strategy, especially in areas like programming.</p>



<p>This shift also showed up in subsequent versions of Windows.</p>



<p>In Windows 11 24H2, the main highlight of the new update was the introduction of a suite of AI features, with the most important being Windows Recall.</p>



<p>The flagship feature of 24H2, Recall was intended to a be a “photographic memory” of sorts for your PC. This meant that, as you might have guessed, Windows Recall would take a snapshot of your screen every few seconds. Then, the information from those screenshots would be processed using local AI to make it searchable.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="604" data-permalink="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/2026/01/25/state-of-the-windows-what-is-going-on-with-windows-11/image-66/" data-orig-file="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png" data-orig-size="1280,800" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=1024" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="640" src="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=1024 1024w, https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=150 150w, https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=300 300w, https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png?w=768 768w, https://ntdotdev.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/image-22.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>However, soon after it was introduced it became clear that it was a security nightmare. Early security researchers discovered that the data was stored in a largely unencrypted SQLite database, making it a goldmine for info-stealing malware. Not only that, but the early builds of Recall had no option to disable it. The backlash was so severe that Microsoft was forced to pull the feature just days before the Copilot+ PC launch in 2024, leaving a new generation of PCs without their flagship feature. </p>



<p>Applications like Signal and Brave implemented anti-Recall features that would prevent the app from taking screenshots.</p>



<p>While Microsoft would mitigate the main security concerns related to Recall, by making it uninstallable, encrypting its database and making it usable only if Windows Hello was enabled, the damage was already done. </p>



<p>Also, Windows Recall is one of the main reasons why Windows updates are so big these days, as each Windows update also introduces updates to the AI models included with the OS, even though you may not even have a Copilot+ PC that supports these features.</p>



<p>Apart from Recall, Windows has also suffered from an acute Copilot-ification. </p>

<p>The preinstalled browser (Edge) has Copilot.</p>



<p>The main text editor (Notepad) has Copilot.</p>



<p>There is also a dedicated Copilot app which is preinstalled and non-removable (in most cases)</p>



<p>The main photo viewer has a Copilot button which just opens the main app</p>



<p>The Settings application has Copilot in its search function (which doesn’t even work properly).</p>



<p>The Search application has Copilot (which only opens up the Copilot app) and needs a COMPLETE overhaul in my opinion.</p>



<p>Paint has Copilot</p>



<p>Office has Copilot (which is one of the few instances where Copilot and AI as a whole is genuinely useful if used correctly)</p>



<p>Also, judging by the latest Windows 11 builds, even Windows Explorer, which is already quite heavy in itself as we discussed earlier is getting Copilot!</p>

<p>With the Copilot epidemic also came the complete death of the “offline” Windows.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most nagging change since 2023 is the slow death of the local account. Microsoft has spent the last three years systematically closing every “backdoor” that allowed users to set up Windows without a Microsoft Account.</p>

<p>Methods like OOBE.exe /bypassNRO or a@a.com as the email for the account have been “fixed”, meaning that it becomes harder and harder to use a local account with each subsequent update.</p>



<h2>a vision with a crumbling foundation</h2>



<p>Looking back at the last three years, the “State of Windows” is one of extreme ambition built on a crumbling foundation. Microsoft is trying to build a futuristic AI skyscraper, but they are building it on top of a basement filled with 30-year-old technical debt and a ground floor that can’t even handle a shutdown command properly.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the issue that plagued Windows since the dawn of time has only aggravated recently. Windows 11 is a mixture of old and new technologies that are glued together, with decades of legacy code that simply refuses to die (because if it did a lot of corporate costumers would complain, and whether we like it or not they are paying big cash for support to Microsoft). </p>



<p>Also, it tries to have a “modern” UI that unfortunately not only is inconsistent, but also it’s too heavy for its own good, being just a lipstick on a bloated old pig.</p>



<p>Last, but certainly not least, it is full of AI features that most people didn’t ask for, some are even actively feared (see Recall) and are also quite lacking in polish and usefulness. </p>



<p>I feel like a good analogy of the current situation with Windows is this picture which was shown in an internal presentation regarding the performance and reliability of pre-reset Longhorn </p>

<p>Until Microsoft stops treating Windows as an “AI innovation platform” of sorts and starts treating it as the stable, reliable tool it was always meant to be, the user experience will continue to feel like a battle between the person sitting at the desk and the company that built the desk.</p>

<p><strong>Did you find this article interesting?</strong> Writing these deep dives (once every few years 😂) takes a lot of time (and caffeine).☕Also it would be nice if I would get a proper domain for this page. </p>
