<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>Denmark’s government on Friday announced an agreement to ban access to social media for anyone under 15, ratcheting up pressure on Big Tech platforms as concerns grow that kids are getting too swept up in a digitized world of harmful content and commercial interests.</p><p>The move would give some parents — after a specific assessment — the right to let their children access social media from age 13. It wasn’t immediately clear how such a ban would be enforced: Many tech platforms already restrict pre-teens from signing up. Officials and experts say such restrictions don’t always work.</p><p>Such a measure would be among the most sweeping steps yet by a European Union government to limit use of social media among teens and younger children, which has drawn concerns in many parts of an increasingly online world.</p><p>Speaking to The Associated Press, Caroline Stage, Denmark’s minister for digital affairs, said 94% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and more than half of those under 10 do. </p>
    
<p>“The amount of time they spend online — the amount of violence, self-harm that they are exposed to online — is simply too great a risk for our children,” she said, while praising tech giants as “the greatest companies that we have. They have an absurd amount of money available, but they’re simply not willing to invest in the safety of our children, invest in the safety of all of us.”</p>
    
<h2>No rush to legislation, no loopholes for tech giants</h2><p>Stage said a ban won’t take effect immediately. Allied lawmakers on the issue from across the political spectrum who make up a majority in parliament will likely take months to pass relevant legislation. </p><p>“I can assure you that Denmark will hurry, but we won’t do it too quickly because we need to make sure that the regulation is right and that there is no loopholes for the tech giants to go through,” Stage said. Her ministry said pressure from tech giants’ business models was “too massive.” </p><p>It follows a move in December in Australia, where parliament enacted the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-social-media-children-ban-safeguarding-harm-accounts-d0cde2603bdbc7167801da1d00ecd056">world’s first ban on social media for children</a></span> — setting the minimum age at 16.</p><p>That made platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram subject to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts.</p><p>Officials in Denmark didn’t say how such a ban would be enforced in a world where millions of children have easy access to screens. But Stage noted that Denmark has a national electronic ID system — nearly all Danish citizens over age 13 have such an ID — and plans to set up an age-verification app. Several other EU countries are testing such apps. </p><p>“We cannot force the tech giants to use our app, but what we can do is force the tech giants to make proper age verification, and if they don’t, we will be able to enforce through the EU commission and make sure that they will be fined up to 6% of their global income.”</p>
    
<h2>Aiming to shield kids from harmful content online</h2><p>Many governments have been grappling with ways of limiting harmful fallout from online technologies, without overly squelching their promise. Stage said Denmark’s legislative push was “not about excluding children from everything digital” — but keeping them away from harmful content.</p><p>China — which manufacturers many of the world’s digital devices — has set limits on <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/gaming-business-children-00db669defcc8e0ca1fc2dc54120a0b8">online game time</a></span> and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-internet-restrictions-children-smartphone-limits-8435b530b117b70357856ddf6a5968d1">smart-phone time</a></span> for kids. </p><p>Prosecutors in Paris this week announced an investigation into <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/france-tiktok-suicide-children-investigation-3d8691d1cbc04d13b9d6b97af5e08699">allegations that TikTok allows content promoting suicide</a></span> and that its algorithms may encourage vulnerable young people to take their own lives.</p><p>“Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,” the Danish ministry said. “This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.”</p><p>The EU’s Digital Services Act, which took effect two years ago, forbids children younger than 13 to hold accounts on social media like TikTok and Instagram, video sharing platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and sites like Reddit and Discord, as well as AI companions. </p>
    
<p>Many social media platforms have for years banned anyone 13 or under from signing up for their services. TikTok users can verify their ages by submitting a selfie that will be analyzed to estimate their age. Meta Platforms, parent of Instagram and Facebook, says it uses a similar system for video selfies and AI to help figure out a user’s age.</p><p>Meta and TikTok didn’t respond immediately to requests for comment from the AP.</p><p>“We’ve given the tech giants so many chances to stand up and to do something about what is happening on their platforms. They haven’t done it,” said Stage, the Danish minister. “So now we will take over the steering wheel and make sure that our children’s futures are safe.”</p><p>___</p><p>AP Business Writer Kelvin Chan contributed to this report. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>Every morning, I wake up and ask myself: why isn’t OCaml more
popular? I mean, the language is not perfect, but the more I use it the
more I feel like this old language had it all figured out, somehow. I
mean, not in the literal sense: you write <code>String.of_X</code>
instead of <code>String.from_X</code> because the language has French
origins. But it is perfect in the sense that it has everything that is
important to me, except popular adoption. OCaml has its quirks, its old
age, but at the same time there is so much I appreciate about it.</p>
<p>I have some experience building amateur and professional software, in
many different languages, and as a result I have collected a list of
characteristics that I’ve come to appreciate over time. I think my
journey into programming is different from many. I learned and adored
functional programming before working in the industry, and while not my
very first language, Haskell was important to me early on. Functional
programming has allowed me to break big, complex problems down into
subproblems that I know how to solve. It has made me a better thinker.
Add to that the static guarantees of Haskell, which makes the mental
overhead much lower than for other languages, and I am also more
productive. Most importantly, with Haskell, I can focus more on the fun
parts of programming.</p>
<p>However, Haskell’s issues lie in its immense complexity and slow
compile times. I did say that Haskell lowers the mental overhead of
programming, but that’s only if you use a small subset of the language.
However because much of the community is very maximalist, introducing a
lot of complexity into the code becomes inevitable. Much of the code you
interact with is too “smart”, and becomes very hard to grok. Its runtime
is also very complex, and there’s always the chance of running into
notorious “space leaks”, that are extremely hard to debug.</p>
<p>At some point, I started exploring a language that is probably the
polar opposite to Haskell: Go. With Go, I learned to appreciate
simplicity and low-levels of abstractions, a good set of tooling, fast
performance and fast compilation speed. I also started to appreciate
good documentation that is easily available offline. The culture around
Go also places a lot of value on simple solutions, which made
interacting with the ecosystem easier. I can jump into any code base and
understand what is happening.</p>
<p>Over time, I also grew to hate the issues that come
with the language being so conservative: it is verbose in its error
handling yet manages to be fragile. At the same time, it doesn’t
have explicit null checks. These factors combined makes Go quite unpleasant and
easy to write buggy code in. I also found myself missing a REPL or fast
way of interacting with the program. The language is “predictably
disappointing”, which I guess is a good thing. However, the solutions to
those disappointments have been around before the language was even
created and I am just left feeling that these solutions could have been
implemented, and the compiler would not be much more complex as a
result. It just genuinely felt like the Go language designers didn’t
want to engage with any of the ideas coming from functional programming.
But I digress.</p>
<p>From these experiences, a list of features I consider to be “good”
features in a general programming language started to emerge:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast compile times</li>
<li>Fewer abstractions, and an easy to understand runtime</li>
<li>Strong static guarantees</li>
<li>Functional programming constructs. Especially pattern matching and
sum types.</li>
<li>Good performance</li>
<li>Good documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>And then, enter OCaml. This language just checks so many boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strong static guarantees. Sum types, polymorphic variants, pattern
matching.</li>
<li>Simpler runtime semantics. OCaml is weird in that it’s a garbage
collected language for systems, similar to Go. A seasoned OCaml
programmer is probably able to gauge what the compiled assembler looks
like just by looking at the code. That is a great quality.</li>
<li>Fast compile times. When using Haskell or Rust, the slow compile
times really kill your productivity. With Dune, OCaml compiles extremely
fast. Faster than Go I believe?</li>
<li>Similar to Go, OCaml can be compiled statically into a single
binary, making it easy to deploy.</li>
<li>Great documentation. OCaml has odig to browse documentation offline,
utop as a REPL to explore code, and also separates interface files from
implementation files. This makes it very pleasant to browse OCaml code.
The types help guide the user.</li>
<li>Automatically inferred types. I didn’t think this would matter, as
writing out the types used to help my thinking. But now that I am more
“fluent”, it is more typing and less code. In OCaml, modules
separate interface files from implementation, and these are a better
place to put types.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m left feeling that the authors of OCaml have good taste. It
is an old language, and there are a few features that could probably be left out
like the OOP-related features, and some libraries in the ecosystem over-complicate things
like in Haskell. But overall, it’s just damn good. There are a lot of
other features I appreciate about OCaml that I didn’t share. But to
summarize why I love it: the right balance between simple and
expressive, good documentation and good tooling.</p>

<p>Keep reading to learn more about what 0.50.0 brings, polishes and translates into Polish!</p>



<p><strong>Known Issues</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>On macOS, launching OpenMW from OpenMW-CS requires ‘OpenMW.app’ and ‘OpenMW-CS.app’ to be siblings</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7511">#7511</a>] On Windows, a freeze may be reported if engine startup takes too long; ignoring the message is usually harmless, as it should eventually disappear, but if it doesn’t, share the freeze dump with us</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8233">#8233</a>] Hardware antialiasing may cause driver timeouts on AMD GPUs of the RX 6000 and 7000 series; this is a driver bug AMD has yet to address</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8255">#8255</a>] On Intel GPUs, the game may freeze visually while still responding to input. This appears to be a recently introduced driver bug; as a workaround, you may need to install an older version of the driver. We’ve had reports of something similar happening on recent AMD drivers; the same workaround should apply&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8345">[#8345</a>] OpenMW-CS might crash randomly on Linux and macOS during global search or saving</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8464">#8464</a>] Shader rendering is tinted red on Apple Silicon; enable per-pixel lighting to prevent that</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>AI and Pathfinding</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Aussiemon, Capo, elsid</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>Evil Eye</em></strong></p>



<p>OpenMW’s navmesh-based pathfinding is already more elaborate than Morrowind’s. Some even wish it were less so.</p>



<p>There was, however, a case where it failed. The original content-supplied path grid works as a hint on where roads and bridges are so that wandering characters aren’t ignorant of the infrastructure. This is all well and good until you realise the content might be wrong and put some points inside rocks. Miraculously, Morrowind avoided the problem, so we had to solve it: wandering NPCs will now ignore the points they cannot reach.</p>



<p>Another situation where OpenMW could fall behind Morrowind was sneaking. In out-of-combat situations, Morrowind updates awareness only every so often, and characters don’t have superhuman (or superelvish) reaction time while observing your… exploits. It doesn’t mean the reaction time would reflect that of a real person, but it does the job. Sort of.</p>



<p>OpenMW, meanwhile, would update awareness every frame, which could mean the sneak indicator would be rather unreliable in figuring out whether you’re hidden. 0.50.0 still updates awareness every frame to react to sudden changes in how difficult it is to track the player, but it will cache the random dice roll result used for the relevant check for 5 seconds. This makes Sneak experience farming, err, that is, gaining less challenging.</p>



<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/5331">#5331</a>] When a Command effect stops, the affected actor will accept their new location as their new wander point</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/6029">#6029</a>] Hostile actors will no longer engage in combat with the player if the player is under the effect of &gt;=75% Chameleon</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/6029">#6029</a>] Awareness rolls of non-hostile actors are cached for 5 seconds to allow easier gain of Sneak experience</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7871">#7871</a>] Immobile actors such as the Kwama Queen in Morrowind can initiate combat, however futile</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7979">#7979</a>] Paralysed and knocked down NPCs can no longer use combat actions: to match Morrowind, they won’t yell taunts or drink potions to get themselves out of their predicament</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8433">#8433</a>] Improved Wander pathfinding: actors will try to avoid moving into unreachable waypoints when possible</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8612">#8612</a>] Actors will no longer harvest herbalism-enabled plants non-stop when the Activate package is used</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>Configuration and VFS</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Duron27</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>Evil Eye</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>New Features</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8077">#8077</a>] Setting files are now saved when you exit the settings window, rather than only when you exit the game</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8599">#8599</a>] Non-ASCII paths using native encodings are now supported in Morrowind format BSAs</li>



<li>Improved BSA archive reading stability in various cases, e.g., for corrupted files or files where directory hash collisions occur</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>ESM Format and Saved Games</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contribution from </em><strong><em>S3ctor</em></strong></p>



<p>We took care not to change the saved game format. This means that you should be able to revert to 0.49.0 on your ongoing playthrough if you experience issues in the new release, although this is not really recommended.</p>



<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8333">#8333</a>] Reading quest status subrecords no longer causes the rest of the quest record data to be discarded</li>
</ul>



<h3><strong>Gameplay</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Aussiemon, Capo, Evil Eye, Foal</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>Kuyondo</em></strong></p>



<p>As usual, and as we’re striving for a reasonably faithful reimplementation of the original experience, we have to sort out minor game mechanics inconsistencies. Do you think this will end at some point? Me neither.</p>



<p>You might already know prison time can improve your Sneak and Security skills. One thing that wasn’t replicated is the improvement counting towards level progress if you’ve chosen one of them as a major or a minor skill. On its own, this may not sound notable, but it was actually implemented by dehardcoding jail skill progression (well, mostly regression). Like the rest of the level progression previously dehardcoded in 0.49.0, it was moved into the built-in scripting.</p>



<p>But there were also more obviously problematic differences solved in this release. For example, Next/Previous Spell key bindings are now able to cope with enchanted items that come in stacks, rather than get stuck equipping the items of this type. Another example is that pickpocketing is now slightly less obnoxiously unfair, as OpenMW’s judicial system will no longer try to indict you for the same crime twice due to a design flaw.</p>



<p><strong>Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/6039">#6039</a>] Next Spell now skips over items that belong to the same stack as the current item (it would previously get stuck if there were multiple copies)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7622">#7622</a>] Ranged attacks will now hit underwater if you’re up close to a target (this matches Morrowind)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7649">#7649</a>] Sounds and visual effects of resisted effects no longer play</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7693">#7693</a>] Potions and ingredients no longer visually end up back in the inventory for a single frame before getting picked up again for convenient consumption (0.49.0 regression)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/7996">#7996</a>] Instant (zero-duration) effects can now act immediately. For example, instant Cure Poison can immediately cure the instant Poison preceding it</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8303">#8303</a>] Underwater spell projectiles cast by objects will explode rather than immediately disappear (this matches Morrowind)</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8340">#8340</a>] Multi-effect enchantment service price is now noticeably lower and should match Morrowind; it’s now based on the accumulated strength of the final effect rather than the enchantment’s overall strength</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8371">#8371</a>] Silence no longer affects powers</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8383">#8383</a>] Bound helm and boot effects cast on beast race characters are now interrupted immediately</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8399">#8399</a>] Jail-induced major/minor skill increases count as level progress</li>



<li>[<a href="https://gitlab.com/OpenMW/openmw/-/issues/8404">#8404</a>] Actors will no longer equip items to all slots when they want to replace their equipped light with a more appropriate shield. This allows the prevent merchant equipping option to work more intuitively for exterior merchants</li>

<p>0.50.0 comes with improved compatibility with various modded assets, thanks to the skinned geometry implementation being reworked to account for the skinning origin.</p>



<p>Wait, you probably don’t know what any of this means…</p>



<p>We’re not going to give you a course on 3D animation here, but long story short, most animations are based on moving bones around in the object’s “skeleton” (not literal bones, more like points). The object’s geometry is oriented relative to the bones. Spooked yet? More importantly, though, the geometry may be set up by the model artist in a way that it will graciously react to their movement by moving its triangles closer or farther from some bones in a process called skinning. Actors’ bodies and equipment tend to do this. Aside from bone weights and orientations, Morrowind’s (or rather, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=NetImmerse">NetImmerse</a>‘s) skinning data format includes the “base” bone of the geometry and its adjusted orientation. Previous releases of OpenMW would try to get away with ignoring those, but it didn’t work out so well. For example, the sails of some ships in <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/42270">abot’s Boats</a> would be shifted vertically. Well, not any more.</p>

<p><em>Wait, is that mod STILL not compatible?</em></p>



<p>0.50.0 also comes with fixes for OpenMW’s very own features: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping">normal mapping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_mapping">parallax mapping</a>.</p>



<p>Terrain normal maps previously erroneously used the OpenGL vertical convention. Like objects, they were supposed to use the DirectX convention. Essentially, they were flipped vertically. No more headache for artists: the convention is now finally consistent between objects and terrain.</p>



<p>Parallax will also no longer be flipped inappropriately — more specifically, when it’s applied to “mirrored” geometry. It will also not abruptly disappear forever when the parallax-mapped object glows due to enchantments and triggered traps.</p>



<p>There aren’t any shiny <em>new</em> graphical features in 0.50.0, but we should have already surpassed Morrowind in various areas here, so it’s not an issue, right?</p>

<h3><strong>Scripting: OpenMW-Lua</strong></h3>



<p><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>akortunov, Calandiel, DaisyHasaCat, Evil Eye, fallchildren, Foal, S3ctor, trav</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>wazabear</em></strong></p>



<p>So what is it about combat that is no longer locked up in the C++? That would be some of what happens when an attack connects: applying armour and difficulty to the damage, spawning blood, playing hit and miss sounds and damaging armour condition. What this means for modding is that scripts can now intercept attacks that land on a certain target, whether they succeed or fail, alter <em>some of</em> their outcome, and potentially override the mentioned mechanics entirely. Eventually, this functionality will be expanded to cover more of what happens before, upon and after impact.</p>



<p>0.50.0’s API also opens up more of the game world by means of its weather and terrain APIs and region record bindings. The early terrain API, for example, exposes the terrain textures, allowing for such incredible feats as letting the player <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57130">touch grass</a>, while the weather API lets you manipulate various built-in weather settings.</p>



<p>Additionally, scripts can now access the player’s journal and create entirely custom NPCs. No plugins necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Important: </strong>OnUpdate handler behaviour has changed for previously skipped paused frames! They are now handled with a simulation time of zero. This will affect scripts that assume simulation time is always positive, so they will need to be updated. It was necessary to allow scripts to react more fluidly to events happening during the pause, like combat music reacting to combat state changes during dialogue.</p>



<p>For a full overview of the current state of OpenMW-Lua, please consult <a href="https://openmw.readthedocs.io/en/openmw-0.50.0/reference/lua-scripting/api.html">the scripting API reference</a>.</p>

<p>Kudos to the international community of our Discord/IRC servers for helping us translate OpenMW!</p>



<p>As you may have heard, the headline feature of this release is, undeniably, the improved gamepad support introduced by our talented new contributor enoznal. By enabling the Controller Menus option in the launcher, you will be able to use the controller action buttons to navigate more conveniently through the slightly altered in-game UI. You are no longer limited to the combination of emulated mouse and A button use available previously. For example, you can brew potions and enchant items entirely without using the emulated mouse. While the alternative UI is not at all reminiscent of Morrowind’s famous official Xbox port, it should be intuitive enough for those familiar with it. The following screenshots use GUI scaling for better readability; the option does not scale UI on its own.</p>

<p><em>At least the Dwemer didn’t dabble in planned obsolescence.</em></p>



<p>This release also introduces Polish translations for user interface lines that are not translated by the game settings. Polish is one of the languages in which Morrowind was officially released, and we expect the sizeable Polish community to appreciate this addition.</p>

<p>Our content file editor’s selection markers got a design overhaul for better usability, while created/cloned instance numbering has been updated to be less eager to take over the numerical IDs used by other instances. This is particularly important when working on content that may override the instances from some other content. Which is actually a lot of content, come to think of it…</p>

<h3><strong>Beyond Morrowind</strong></h3>



<p><em>Major contributions from </em><strong><em>ptmikheev</em></strong><br><em>Contributions from </em><strong><em>Capo</em></strong><em> and </em><strong><em>cc9cii</em></strong></p>



<p>Didn’t get the memo? As the <a href="https://openmw.org/2025/openmw-0-49-0-released/">0.49.0 release announcement</a> boasted, running Oblivion and later Bethesda open-world engine games is in the engine’s eventual scope.</p>



<p>Petr Mikheev, the OpenMW-Lua pioneer, though mostly retired from his Lua maintenance role, keeps a special interest in advancing OpenMW’s relevant capabilities. During this release cycle, he thought to try his hand at finishing cc9cii’s work on a terrain texturing reimplementation, cleaning it up, fixing various issues and, importantly, implementing texture sampling for distant terrain— as well as implementing distant objects most straightforwardly: by plugging all cell references into OpenMW’s object paging functionality used for Morrowind’s LOD-free world.</p>



<p>That is, yes, any trees you see are full-detail trees. Any trees you <em>think</em> you should see but do not are probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpeedTree">SpeedTree</a> trees.</p>

        <p>We're building infrastructure that manages other people's infrastructure. State corruption can't be "rare." It has to be impossible. That's why we chose OCaml.</p>

        <p><img src="https://stategraph.dev/blog/why-we-chose-ocaml/ocaml-logo.svg" alt="OCaml logo">
            <img src="https://stategraph.dev/blog/why-we-chose-ocaml/ocaml-logo-dark.svg" alt="OCaml logo">
        </p>

        <p>Stategraph stores Terraform state as a dependency graph in PostgreSQL with resource-level locking. The challenge isn't building a database-backed state store. The challenge is ensuring that concurrent operations can never corrupt state, even with concurrent operations/users, that database schema changes break the build instead of production, and that JSON transformations are correct.</p>

        <p>We chose OCaml because its type system catches entire categories of bugs at compile time that would require extensive testing and still slip through in other languages.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Type-safe data structures</h2>

            <p>Here's a scenario every infrastructure engineer has seen. Two Terraform operations run concurrently and both read a resource in an <code>active</code> state. One updates it while the other destroys it. Without proper coordination, you risk marking the resource as <code>destroyed</code> in state while it's still being modified in the cloud.</p>

            <p>Most systems handle this defensively with locks and runtime validation, but race conditions are hard to test and the resulting state corruption usually appears in production, not CI.</p>

            <p>Stategraph tackles this in two ways. Immutability and database-level locking prevent concurrent writes from corrupting state, while OCaml's type system makes the underlying data structures themselves safer by construction. Resources, outputs, and instances are all defined as strongly-typed records, so you can't access a field that doesn't exist or mix up field types. The compiler enforces correctness before anything runs.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Type-safe resource definitions">
                    <p>type t = {</p>
                    <p>  lineage : string;</p>
                    <p>  outputs : Outputs.t option;</p>
                    <p>  resources : Resources.t;</p>
                    <p>  serial : int;</p>
                    <p>  terraform_version : string;</p>
                    <p>  version : int;</p>
                    <p>}</p>
                </div>

            <p>If you try to access <code>state.versions</code> (typo) instead of <code>state.version</code>, you get a compiler error. If you try to assign a string to <code>serial</code>, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle <code>None</code> in the outputs field, you get a compiler error with exhaustiveness checking.</p>

            <p>This extends throughout the codebase. Every Terraform resource type, every state transition, and every database record is strongly typed. The compiler catches entire categories of bugs at compile time, like accessing non-existent fields, missing null checks, or database schema mismatches.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The database schema drift problem</h2>

            <p>You're iterating on your database schema by renaming a column, changing a type, or adding a constraint. In most languages, you update the schema, deploy the migration, and hope you caught all the queries that reference the old structure. You didn't because a query somewhere references the old column name. It works in dev with the old schema but crashes in staging with the new schema.</p>

            <p>Stategraph uses typed SQL where every query declares explicit types for its parameters and return values. When you change a query's type signature, every call site in the codebase must be updated to match, and the compiler enforces this.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Type-checked database queries">
                    <p>let insert_resource_sql () =</p>
                    <p>  Pgsql_io.Typed_sql.(</p>
                    <p>    sql</p>
                    <p>    // Ret.bigint</p>
                    <p>    /^ "INSERT INTO resources (state_id, mode, type, name,</p>
                    <p>        provider_id, module_) VALUES ($state_id, $mode,</p>
                    <p>        $type, $name, $provider_id, $module_) RETURNING id"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.uuid "state_id"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.text "mode"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.text "type"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.text "name"</p>
                    <p>    /% Var.uuid "provider_id"</p>
                    <p>    /% (Var.option @@ Var.text "module_"))</p>
                </div>

            <p>This query expects specific types. The <code>state_id</code> must be a UUID, <code>mode</code> must be text, and <code>module_</code> is optional text. The return value is typed as <code>bigint</code>. If you try to pass a string where a UUID is expected, you get a compiler error. If you forget to handle the optional return value, you get a compiler error.</p>

            <p>When you update a query to match a new schema, the type system ensures every place that calls that query gets updated too. You can't deploy code where query definitions and their usage are out of sync.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>JSON transformations that can't lose data</h2>

            <p>Stategraph ingests Terraform state as JSON, normalizes it into a graph, stores it in PostgreSQL, and reconstructs it back to JSON when Terraform requests it. Every transformation is a place where data can get lost or corrupted, whether from a field you forgot to serialize, a nested structure you flattened incorrectly, or a type that doesn't round-trip.</p>

            <p>Testing can catch some of this, and round-trip tests help, but you're fundamentally relying on test coverage. Missed cases show up when someone's Terraform state comes back missing a field.</p>

            <p>OCaml has a feature called PPX (preprocessor extensions) that generates serialization code automatically. You define the type, and the serializer is generated from the type definition.</p>

            <div role="region" aria-label="Automatic JSON serialization">
                    <p>type aws_instance = {</p>
                    <p>  instance_id : string;</p>
                    <p>  instance_type : string;</p>
                    <p>  ami : string;</p>
                    <p>  availability_zone : string option;</p>
                    <p>  tags : (string * string) list;</p>
                    <p>} [@@deriving yojson]</p>
                    
                    
                    
                </div>

            <p>When you add a field, the serializer is regenerated. When you change a type, the serializer is regenerated. If you forget to handle a case, the exhaustiveness checker catches it at compile time. You don't write serialization tests because the type system guarantees serialization is correct.</p>

            <p>This is how Stategraph handles Terraform's resource types. Every AWS resource, every GCP resource, every Azure resource is an OCaml type with automatic JSON serialization. We don't write serialization code. We don't test round-trips manually. The type system handles it.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Race conditions prevented by default</h2>

            <p>Terraform operations are inherently concurrent. Multiple users apply changes, CI pipelines run in parallel, and drift detection scans resources continuously. Coordinating all of this without data races requires careful mutex management and defensive programming, and it's easy to get wrong.</p>

            <p>OCaml provides immutability by default, so you can't accidentally share mutable state between concurrent operations because there is no mutable state by default. When you want to modify something, you create a new version explicitly. This eliminates entire categories of race conditions.</p>

            <p>One operation can't corrupt another operation's view of state because state is immutable by default. When combined with PostgreSQL's row-level locking at the database layer, concurrent operations compose correctly without manual mutex management or defensive copying.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Error handling with discipline</h2>

            <p>Type safety is only half of what makes Stategraph robust. The other half is discipline in how we use those types.</p>

            <p>We encode errors as variants and exhaustively match every case. We never use a catch-all "else" clause that matches everything. When we add a new error to the system, the compiler tells us every place we aren't handling it. This is how robust systems are built. Systems can fail in far more ways than they succeed, and the compiler ensures we handle all of them.</p>

            <p>This discipline extends throughout the codebase. Every error case is explicit. Every state transition is enumerated. Every optional value is handled. The type system gives us the tools, but discipline is what turns those tools into reliability.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>The difference in practice</h2>

            <p><img src="https://stategraph.dev/blog/why-we-chose-ocaml/runtime-vs-compile-time-dark.svg" alt="Diagram comparing runtime validation where bugs are found in production versus compile-time safety where bugs are prevented by the compiler">
                
            </p>

            <p>The same categories of bugs. Different places to catch them.</p>
        </div>

        

        <div>
            <h2>Production systems that can't afford bugs</h2>

            <p>This isn't academic type theory. Production systems use OCaml for exactly this reason.</p>

            <p>At <a href="https://terrateam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrateam</a>, we process thousands of concurrent Terraform operations daily, managing infrastructure for hundreds of organizations where a state corruption bug would cascade across every customer. We're built on OCaml, and the type system catches bugs at compile time that would be production incidents in other languages.</p>

            <p>Jane Street trades billions daily on OCaml infrastructure. Their trading systems handle concurrent market data and execute trades with zero tolerance for race conditions or undefined behavior. They chose OCaml because correctness isn't optional.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Pattern Recognition</h4>
                <p>Systems that absolutely cannot fail choose languages where certain failures are impossible, not just unlikely. Testing finds bugs, but types prevent entire categories of bugs from existing.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>But who knows OCaml?</h2>

            <p>This is the most common objection, and OCaml developers are rare. This is true.</p>

            <p>But here's what we've found. Engineers who understand distributed systems, type systems, and correctness learn OCaml quickly. The learning curve from Rust, Haskell, or even TypeScript with advanced types is gentler than you'd expect because the concepts transfer even if the syntax is unfamiliar.</p>

            <p>More importantly, OCaml codebases are stable. We're not debugging race conditions or chasing down production crashes from schema drift. We're not writing extensive test suites for serialization edge cases. We're building features while the type system handles the category of bugs that would otherwise consume engineering time.</p>

            <p>When you encode correctness in types, maintenance gets easier instead of harder. New engineers spend less time understanding implicit invariants and more time writing code the compiler verifies.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Correctness as a feature</h2>

            <p>We're building Stategraph to manage Terraform state for infrastructure that runs production applications. State corruption has to be impossible instead of unlikely. Invalid state transitions need to be prevented by the compiler instead of caught by tests. Schema drift needs to break the build instead of production.</p>

            <p>That's what OCaml gives us. It provides a type system that makes entire categories of bugs impossible instead of just unlikely. The compiler proves properties about our code that testing can only approximate.</p>

            <p>OCaml's compile-time guarantees are why we use it to build Stategraph.</p>

            <guid>45844197</guid>
            <pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 07:09:30 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://prison.josh.mn/lessons">https://prison.josh.mn/lessons</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45844197">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>There are some contemporary piracy services that run ads—for marketing and, well, advertising purposes. This ranges
from PPC to social media campaigns. I opted not to, mostly because I didn't think I could do it tastefully,
and because I'd probably attract users who wouldn't be great customers.</p>

<p>Instead, my marketing relied entirely on word-of-mouth—which meant building tremendous trust with my users,
plus a single growth hack that I'll describe later on this page.</p>

<p>This is all fairly standard startup knowledge—I've worked with more than a handful of Y Combinator companies and I could apply this to all of them—but it's interesting to see how many parallels existed between what I built and what a "real" startup looks like.  </p>

<p>I learned a lot about running a business while operating HeheStreams: customer experience, retention, product design, and the weird parallels between illegal streaming and your typical B2C.  </p>

<p>Think of this as a founder postmortem with felony-level customer support.</p>

<h2>Lessons from Growing a B2C</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>noreply@</code> is absolutely stupid.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>I did everything I could to be visible to customers and encouraged them to talk to me any time. That helped build trust in a product sitting in a sea of shady, fly-by-night operations. I ended every email with some variation of "If you need anything, just reply :)".</p>

<p><strong>Get customers started.</strong>  </p>

<p>After a user subscribed, I sent a sequence of onboarding emails to make sure they were actually using the site: After three days, I'd check whether they'd watched anything and ask if they needed help; after they watched <em>n</em> minutes, I'd send an NPS-style survey ("1–10, how likely are you to recommend...") and if they gave a 9 or 10, I'd invite them to leave a review; if they didn't watch anything within two weeks, I offered a refund and suggestions on where else to watch.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Send fun emails.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>My copywriting was tongue-in-cheek and self-deprecating. It was all me, no bullshit. I treated <em>every</em> message—even transactional emails—as an opportunity to build trust. Users regularly told me they actually enjoyed reading my emails, which is not a thing that should happen.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be honest about service availability.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If things went sideways, I owned it. No hiding behind "maintenance windows."</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A customer with a bad taste in their mouth is bad.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If someone used their entire subscription and then asked for a refund, I'd still honor it—no questions asked. My users were shockingly honest, and I rarely dealt with chargebacks. My abuse detector barely had to do anything over 66 months.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It's okay to be direct about churn.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>I'd send messages like, "Hey, I saw you didn't renew. Did you find a good place to watch? Anything I could've done better?" People usually responded—nicely, even.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Recommend your competitors if you have to.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>If a user wasn't a good fit, I happily pointed them toward alternatives. It built credibility, even if it lost me a sale.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>You don't need to target everyone.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>I intentionally priced higher than competitors. That filtered in customers who were more tech-savvy and saw HeheStreams as an "investment in their leisure time," not a "cost."</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be great at one thing, and half-assed at nothing.</strong> </li>
</ul>

<p>I never added generic IPTV or random channels. I focused purely on sports. That probably left money on the table, but it kept quality high.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Say no.</strong><br></li>
</ul>

<p>Say no a lot. Customers can be stupid.</p>

<h2>The growth hack</h2>

<p>My proudest growth hack involved Reddit's API. I filtered posts mentioning phrases like "NBA League Pass," "blackouts," or "where to" on team-specific subreddits. Then I gave my users lists of those posts and encouraged them to comment—transparently—about why they liked HeheStreams, including their referral link.</p>

<p>Each referrer got a $10 credit per subscriber, and new subscribers got $10 off their next month. It worked well.</p>

<h2>Lessons still work</h2>

<p>I've applied these same principles to a Mexican ecotourism business with great success. Some of them will never scale to hundreds of thousands of customers (you can't automate personality or hire for charm), but they work beautifully for small, honest teams. That's enough for me.</p>

<h2>Why word-of-mouth beats ads (especially when you can't run ads)</h2>

<p>I believe that trust mechanics are reflections of self. If they're artificial, people will see right through them.</p>

<h2>The takeaway</h2>

<p>Wouldn't trade the lessons; would strongly advise against the exit strategy. "Acquired" by Alliance for Creativity/Motion Picture Association.</p>

<p>Dear Friends,</p>



<p>It is with a great appreciation and heartfelt emotions that we write to share some sad news. After more than 200 years of sharing a unique blend of weather, wit and wisdom, we’ve made the very difficult decision to write the final chapter of this historical publication. The<strong> <a href="https://store.farmersalmanac.com/FARM/p-FA-26_GBALFARET26">2026 <em>Farmers’ Almanac</em></a> will be our last edition</strong>.</p>

It is, by the standards of such tools, highly compatible with existing code -- so much so that building a full linux distro userspace seems likely within reach with only modest patching effort. The stated performance overheads (<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20251028-filcc-vs-clang.html">measured by Dan Bernstein at "about 1-4x cycles"</a>) are by modern standards "probably tolerable" for many workloads (EDIT: <a href="https://gist.github.com/graydon/c769a4d741b1fc955f78271a4fa3d2df">also see a few initial measurements I made with the "optfilc" tools</a> -- I did less-micro benchmarks and found a wider range), especially stuff that's IO bound or not otherwise straining for maximum performance.</p><p>I'm happy to see this work exist. It builds on a long line of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1543135.1542504">academic</a> and <a href="https://cheri-alliance.org/">industrial</a> work in this space (that Pizlo happily cites), including his own many years of iteration on the subject while at Apple. If I understand correctly, some of those earlier iterations are <a href="https://saaramar.github.io/iBoot_firebloom/">already in production in security sensitive code</a>. I recall talking with Pizlo about these prototypes when I was at Apple too, and I'm pleased to see the work maturing to its current state.</p><p>(He also makes an interesting point that the bounds checking Fil-C inserts can make pointer-twiddling C code safer than pointer-twiddling unsafe Rust. This seems likely true! And it would be interesting to know if there's a way to have the best of both worlds, eg. if his instrumentation pass could be adapted to compile otherwise-full-speed optimized unsafe Rust blocks with a little bit of systematic compiler-injected bounds checking, perhaps derived from Rust's strict pointer provenance? Obviously this wouldn't be appealing for folks who use unsafe blocks for speed, but I think a lot are for other reasons and might enjoy an extra layer of checks. This is well beyond anything I know anymore, sadly I've long since lost track of what rustc can or can't do. Just speculating, but it seems to me that most unsafe Rust code doesn't allocate or free or interact with an allocator at all, so you'd want to drive it from something other than allocator, could probably still omit the GC.)</p><p>Naturally Fil-C has some caveats (if we're comparing to Rust, say, or other PLs with restrictions on mutable aliasing):</p><ol><br><li>It's not going to <em>statically</em> prevent any of the errors it prevents; it's strictly dynamic. So your programs will still crash on memory errors. But almost all programs have paths that crash, and perhaps the density of crashes will be tolerable.</li><br><li>In addition to the stated performance overheads there will be a space overhead, as deferring frees until the GC is sure they're garbage (unreachable) will retain that garbage for a while. On most GCs the amount of memory spent on garbage is tunable: make the GC work more often and there's less retained garbage, but typical GC tuning will put the overhead at 1.5x-2x the memory. <strike>I haven't measured Fil-C-compiled code at all to see what its overheads are here</strike> EDIT: see measurements above, also included memory, looks to be more like 3-6x?) Anyway computers do have a lot of memory these days.</li><br><li>It's not going to do anything much to solve data races or help with <a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/312681.html">local reasoning for correctness</a>. Preventing mutable aliasing has additional correctness advantages beyond being a tool for memory safety. Fearless concurrency remains out of reach. But perhaps it's less fearful since you'll only crash or get data corruption.</li><br><li>There'll be a big obvious switch you can flip -- compile <em>without</em> Fil-C -- to turn the safety back off everywhere to make the program faster and use less memory. There will be a lot of temptation from bosses who like to see better numbers to flip that switch. But perhaps bosses in 2025 are safety conscious enough to leave it on.</li><br></ol><p>In any event, I only mention those caveats because they're the sort of thing that motivated languages like Rust in the first place. There have been memory-safe, bounds-checked and GC'ed AOT-compiled languages for a long time! And I like them! I'm happy to code in Haskell or OCaml or SBCL or Modula-3 or Java or C# or whatever. The main problem motivating Rust was that there was an audience of developers who <em>wouldn't accept those PLs</em> for their use cases. People were very <em>very</em> attached to their C/C++ performance and memory-usage envelopes. Like there are (or were) a lot of people who argue against having frame pointers too. It's weird! The gap between C/C++ and the next-fastest safe PL has never been especially huge, it's never anything like the performance gaps between different generations of hardware. But it persists across time, and it's been enough for decades to sustain the "we have to be unsafe" argument. </p><p>If times have changed and people are now mostly ok with the caveats and will throw the switch to turn safety on, I'm super happy for that to be true! Code that fails more-safely on memory errors is a great thing for human civilization. For people who have huge legacy C/C++ codebases with no ability or desire to rewrite, or even are writing anew but feel constrained to avoid (or just don't like) safer PLs, I hope Fil-C meets their needs. If at some point (say) there's an easy-to-install Debian distro built with this, I'll probably use it.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text_-1266136426" data-emptytext="Text"><p>Memory loss may not simply be a symptom of getting older. New research from Virginia Tech shows that it’s tied to specific molecular changes in the brain and that adjusting those processes can improve memory.</p>
<p>In two complementary studies,&nbsp;<a href="https://sas.vt.edu/people/faculty/jarome-timothy.html">Timothy Jarome</a>, associate professor in the&nbsp;<a href="http://cals.vt.edu/">College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</a>’&nbsp;<a href="http://sas.vt.edu/">School of Animal Sciences</a>, and his graduate students used gene-editing tools to target those age-related changes to improve memory performance in older subjects. The work was conducted on rats, a standard model for studying how memory changes with age.</p>
<p>“Memory loss affects more than a third of people over 70, and it’s a major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease,” said Jarome, who also holds an appointment in the&nbsp;<a href="https://neuroscience.vt.edu/">School of Neuroscience</a>. “This work shows that memory decline is linked to specific molecular changes that can be targeted and studied.&nbsp;If we can understand what’s driving it at the molecular level, we can start to understand what goes wrong in dementia and eventually use that knowledge to guide new approaches to treatment.”</p>
</div><div id="text_1518939200_270038343" data-emptytext="Text"><h2>Targeting memory loss in two key brain regions</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibroneuroscience.org/article/S0306-4522(25)00714-6/abstract">the first study</a>, published in&nbsp;the journal Neuroscience&nbsp;and led by Jarome and doctoral student Yeeun Bae, the team examined a process called K63 polyubiquitination. This process acts as a molecular tagging system that tells proteins inside the brain how to behave. When the system functions normally, it helps brain cells communicate and form memories.</p>
<p>Jarome and his team found that aging disrupts K63 polyubiquitination in two distinct areas of the brain. In the&nbsp;hippocampus, which helps form and retrieve memories, levels of K63 polyubiquitination&nbsp;increase&nbsp;with age. Using the&nbsp;CRISPR-dCas13 RNA editing system&nbsp;to reduce these levels, the researchers were able to improve memory in older rats.</p>
<p>In the amygdala, which is important for emotional memory, the researchers noted that K63 polyubiquitination declines with age. By reducing it even further, they were able to boost&nbsp;memory in older rats.</p>
<p>“Together, these findings reveal the important functions of K63 polyubiquitination in the brain’s aging process,”&nbsp;Jarome said. “In both regions, adjusting this one molecular process helped improve memory.”</p>
</div><div id="text_1356740091_434642113" data-emptytext="Text"><h2>Reactivating a gene that supports memory</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361923025003211?via%3Dihub">A second study</a>, published in&nbsp;the Brain Research Bulletin&nbsp;and led by Jarome with doctoral student Shannon Kincaid, focused on IGF2, a growth-factor gene that supports memory formation. As the brain ages, IGF2 activity drops as the gene becomes chemically silenced in the hippocampus.</p>
<p>“IGF2 is one of a small number of genes in our DNA that’s imprinted, which means it’s expressed from only one parental copy,” Jarome said. “When that single copy starts to shut down with age, you lose its benefit.”</p>
<p>The researchers found that this silencing happens through DNA methylation, a natural process in which chemical tags accumulate on the gene and switch it off. Using a precise gene-editing tool, CRISPR-dCas9, they removed those tags and reactivated the gene. The result was better memory in older rats.</p>
<p>“We essentially turned the gene back on,” Jarome said. “When we did that, the older animals performed much better. Middle-aged animals that didn’t yet have memory problems weren’t affected, which tells us timing matters. You have to intervene when things start to go wrong.”</p>
<p>Together, the two studies show that memory loss is not caused by a single molecule or pathway and that multiple molecular systems likely contribute to how the brain ages.</p>
<p>“We tend to look at one molecule at a time, but the reality is that many things are happening at once,” he said. “If we want to understand why memory declines with age or why we develop Alzheimer’s disease, we have to look at the broader picture.”</p>
<h2>Collaborative, graduate-led research</h2>
<p>Both studies were driven by graduate researchers in Jarome’s lab and supported through collaborations with scientists at Rosalind Franklin University, Indiana University, and Penn State.&nbsp;Yeeun Bae, who completed her doctoral work with Jarome in the&nbsp;<a href="http://sas.vt.edu/">School of Animal Sciences</a>, led the study on K63 polyubiquitination.&nbsp;Shannon Kincaid, a doctoral student in the same program, led the study on IGF2.</p>

<p><span>By the spring of 2022,</span> Ed Aldag was fed up. The 61-year-old CEO of a multibillion-dollar real estate company called Medical Properties Trust, Aldag is a high-society fixture in the company’s hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, where MPT has donated millions to local nonprofits and where he’s regularly listed as one of the city’s most influential businessmen. But for years, Aldag had watched as MPT faced tough questions from the federal government, investors, and, most recently, a series of articles in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MPT makes money by acting as a landlord: It buys hospitals and then rents the facilities back to providers. Over the previous year, the <em>Journal</em> had published several stories that focused on the company’s finances, including reporting that dug into MPT’s biggest tenant—Steward Health Care, then one of the largest for-profit hospital operators in the nation—and the unusually close financial relationship between the two companies.</p>



<p>The <em>Journal</em>’s pieces raised concerns about whether Steward was struggling—and whether MPT was engaging in secret transactions to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/pe-backed-hospital-chain-got-help-from-major-landlord-as-losses-mounted-11624014000">keep it afloat</a>. <em>Mother Jones</em> and others would later report how<strong> </strong>Steward’s financial mismanagement harmed hundreds of people: We found <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2025/05/steward-health-care-medical-properties-trust-hospitals-bankruptcy-ralph-de-la-torre/">83 deaths across its 39 hospitals</a>, hundreds of malpractice lawsuits, and more than 700 patient care problems documented in federal hospital inspections. The <em>Journal</em>, meanwhile, was the first to notice this mismanagement at work, revealing that Steward hospitals owed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/pe-backed-hospital-chain-got-help-from-major-landlord-as-losses-mounted-11624014000?mod=author_content_page_12_pos_7">nearly $1 billion</a> to medical supply companies and other vendors.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>In one tense email exchange in March 2022, Aldag wrote to a PR firm, “We cannot let a deranged pretend journalist tell a false story of MPT.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>That reporting was the beginning of years of intense scrutiny of MPT in the world of finance that hurt the company’s stock price and eventually led, earlier this month, to a trio of <a href="https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/markey-sanders-blumenthal-introduce-legislation-to-protect-health-systems-from-predatory-real-estate-investment-trust-deals">Democratic US senators proposing</a> the “Stop Medical Profiteering and Theft (MPT) Act” to impose limits on the company’s business. But it was also the apparent start of an aggressive, previously unreported campaign by Steward, MPT, and other still-unknown actors to silence their critics. Internal documents obtained by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and shared with <em>Mother Jones</em> show that MPT amassed an army of crisis management professionals to protect its reputation, eventually working alongside three different crisis public relations firms, five law firms, and two private intelligence firms. The documents, along with information from sources close to this effort, show a major effort to control the narrative: In one tense email exchange in March 2022, Aldag wrote to a PR firm, “We cannot let a deranged pretend journalist tell a false story of MPT.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of a social media push that used anonymous accounts to discredit and intimidate the growing chorus of journalists, investment analysts, and short sellers who questioned the company, an intelligence firm baited<strong> </strong>MPT’s detractors online.<strong> </strong>And while the <em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/07/01/metro/steward-health-care-surveillance-intelligence-gathering/">Boston Globe</a></em> and <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/scoop/claims-about-short-seller-made-in-uk-parliament-can-be-traced-back-to-private-intelligence-firm-hired-by-steward-health-care#:~:text=But%20now%2C%20leaked%20communications%20obtained,content%20about%20him%20on%20Twitter.">OCCRP</a> reported last year that Steward paid the British firm Audere International to surveil one particularly provocative MPT critic, new documents show a much broader tracking campaign, funded in part by Steward and other shadowy actors but focused on MPT, targeting a half dozen of the company’s skeptics.</p>







<p>“They were always looking for something explosive that would make things go away,” a source close to Audere wrote in messages reviewed by <em>Mother Jones</em> that were confirmed with the source directly. “Although Steward was the customer, it was clear that MPT was what Audere was protecting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>An MPT spokesperson did not respond to a detailed list of questions but made clear in an emailed statement that the company disagrees with the many critics questioning its business practices. The company, the spokesperson said, “has unfailingly disclosed each of its transactions as and when required under applicable securities laws.”</p>



<p>The spokesperson also said that as criticism of MPT has mounted, its executives and their families have been harassed, including receiving death threats: “As any responsible company in that position would do, we have periodically engaged advisors to help navigate this situation.” The spokesperson added: “It is critical to note that MPT has never directly or indirectly engaged with detractors on social media, nor have we paid any third-party to do so.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company’s damage control started in earnest with the lead reporter behind the <em>Journal</em>’s stories, Brian Spegele. His reporting on MPT began in 2021, when a number of its tenant hospitals across the country—a Steward hospital in Pennsylvania, and ones owned by other for-profit operators in Wyoming and Rhode Island—all seemed to be running into financial issues. While these facilities struggled, MPT was hitting its highest stock price ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>MPT leaders asked their PR firm to suss out the angle of Spegele’s upcoming article and questioned whether the <em>Journal</em> was working to short their stock.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Spegele emailed MPT with questions about how it was running its business—and how it might be affecting hospitals. He’d heard from insiders that MPT was overpaying for hospitals because higher sale values meant they could charge higher rents. Did the company want to comment? Why had one of their hospitals in Ohio shut down not long after it started renting from MPT? Did the company really have three corporate jets?&nbsp;</p>



<p>In dozens of leaked emails, Aldag strategized with other leaders over how to respond. They brought in the crisis PR firm Joele Frank to help, as well as a law firm that specializes in filing defamation cases against journalists, Clare Locke. They asked their PR firm to speak with Spegele and suss out the angle of his upcoming article and questioned whether the <em>Journal</em> was working to short their stock. Was the paper hinting to investors that MPT was going to fail?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2021, Clare Locke sent a letter to the <em>Journal</em>’s legal team and top editors, threatening to sue the paper before Spegele had even published his next story and demanding that he reveal his sources. The following month, MPT’s stock hit a new high: about $24 per share. Not long after, the paper’s lawyer sent an email to Clare Locke, noting that Spegele had experienced “some security concerns,” and he wanted to discuss them on the phone. (Spegele declined to comment; a <em>Wall Street Journal </em>spokesperson did not answer specific questions but noted, “The safety and security of our reporters is of paramount importance. While we won’t discuss the details of the protective measures we take, we stand by the <em>Journal</em>’s in-depth and consequential reporting on Medical Properties Trust.” Clare Locke and Joele Frank also did not respond to questions.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <em>Journal</em> published Spegele’s piece in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/hospitals-private-equity-reit-mpt-steward-11644849598?mod=author_content_page_11_pos_7">February 2022</a>. It claimed that MPT was quietly infusing hundreds of millions into Steward through complex loans and other means, enabling its hospitals to continue to pay rent. This meant that MPT’s largest tenant was actually struggling, which boded poorly for MPT, as well. Yet the article also pointed out executives’ excessive spending on things like Aldag’s multimillion-dollar salary and the regular use of the company’s private jets. Investors started emailing and calling MPT, and its stock price began to slide.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“We already know what he is going to say and I refuse to let him tell the story…” Aldag wrote. “We need to devise a plan to be proactive in our storytelling.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Spegele soon started working on another story, about an MPT-owned hospital in California. His continued requests for comment angered Aldag.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m tired of this guy,” Aldag wrote, adding that the former employees Spegele had cited anonymously were “absolutely fake.” Then he called his team to action: “We already know what he is going to say and I refuse to let him tell the story…We need to devise a plan to be proactive in our storytelling outside of the WSJ.” He told his PR advisers that if this wasn’t a project they could take on, he imagined they could find other companies to help.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ladies,” he wrote, “it’s time we go on the offensive.”</p>



<p><span>Investment analyst Rob Simone </span>thought there was something to the <em>Journal</em>’s<em> </em>stories. He worked at a research firm called Hedgeye, and soon he started digging into whatever public information he could find about MPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was struck by the fact that MPT seemed to be at the root of Steward’s financial issues—and its hospitals’ increasing problems paying their bills. According to our own analysis, by 2022, at least four health care companies that had lease agreements with MPT had gone bankrupt, shutting down hospitals or throwing them into uncertainty.</p>



<p>Simone told Hedgeye’s paid subscribers in April 2022 that MPT was sinking hospitals instead of helping them, by saddling their operations with leases they couldn’t afford. He claimed that beneath its veneer of success, Steward “appears to be insolvent” and that its dwindling finances likely meant future trouble for MPT, which he suggested was quietly infusing money into Steward to help it pay rent. And he wondered about the compensation that MPT’s board of directors (which includes Aldag and the company’s CFO) had green-lit for executives, while Steward and some of their other tenants were financially struggling. He recommended shorting the stock.</p>



<p>“I just started doing work on this and became fascinated and thought it was a real problem—and that problem kept getting worse, and so I kept writing about it,” Simone told us when we spoke last year. “It never, never, ever improved.”</p>



<p>MPT leadership pilloried Simone’s research on the company’s next earnings call. But Simone’s reports about MPT continued to gain traction on Twitter and investing websites, especially as the company’s stock price started to dip, from around $20 to $15 in the summer of 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>But as more investors began to short MPT and drag down its stock price, Audere’s work increasingly focused on those critical of the publicly traded landlord.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And Simone wasn’t alone. A writer who called himself @BigRiverCapita1 was making similar claims on social media and Wall Street blogs. The account was anonymous but clearly well versed in finance, pointing out past bankruptcies of MPT’s tenants and questioning whether these hospitals were struggling, shutting down, or cutting back patient care due to their pricey leases with MPT.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around then is when Audere, the British private intelligence firm, got involved. According to OCCRP and the <em>Boston Globe,</em> Steward had already been paying Audere to surveil its critics for a few years—eventually spending more than $7 million on these operations. But as Big River’s posts and Simone’s research spread, and more investors began to short MPT and drag down its stock price, Audere’s work increasingly focused on those critical of the publicly traded landlord, even as its tenant Steward remained Audere’s client, according to leaked documents and sources close to Audere. (An Audere spokesperson told <em>Mother Jones</em> that the company cannot answer questions about its confidential work, but that Audere “takes its legal and regulatory compliance obligations seriously and acts in accordance with the same.”)</p>



<p>In June 2022, Audere hired a contractor to start looking into these critics, leaked emails show. They named the operation “Project Morden.” They told the contractor they had two main goals: Dig into why Rob Simone was writing about MPW (they referred to MPT by its stock ticker symbol), and identify the person behind @BigRiverCapita1:</p>

Hi XXXX,
Great to see you earlier.

As discussed, please find attached: (1) Rob Simone background and (2) WS' article, featuring
Apollo Global Management Inc.

To reiterate, our aim is to:

1. Understand Rob Simone's: (1) intentions regarding MPW, (2) whether this is a long-term investigation project for him or just temporarily, (3) what else is he planning to publish on MPW and (4) whether this is his own interest or past to him from his boss?
2. Identify who is behind the Twitter account: @BigRiverCapita 1
Linked to the above, please let me know what time on Wednesday you would like to speak.

Many thanks and all the best,

<p>A strategy memo noted that “multiple financial professionals believe that RS [Rob Simone] does not have the capacity to drive MPW downward.” Still, the firm demanded an aggressive approach to Big River and Simone, whom they deemed Target 1 and Target 2.</p>



<p>“Uncover the subjects (sic) vulnerabilities and pressure points,” the memo urged, suggesting the contractor unearth details about “career, integrity, personal life and identify any potential misconduct.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Anonymous Twitter accounts started to follow and harass Simone, asking if he had security and even tweeting, “his life [was] in danger.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>And that, Simone said, is when the trouble started.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonymous Twitter accounts started to follow and harass him, asking if he had security and even tweeting that “his life [was] in danger.” Simone’s company, Hedgeye, grew concerned about this safety and provided him with enhanced security, but neither they nor Simone ever figured out who was behind the accounts. One tweet even warned&nbsp;that if he didn’t stop reporting and tweeting about MPT, “he could end up like Daphne,” an allusion to the murder of the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was killed after reporting on a Steward hospital deal in Malta in 2017.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MPT’s leaders also began to meticulously track their detractors. By October 2022, they were keeping tabs on all the skeptics dialing in to their public earnings calls and even discussed not taking their questions: “Please make us a list of all the bad actors that listened in,” Aldag wrote to top executives in an email. They sent back a lengthy list that included nearly 20 professional financial analysts, including Simone.</p>






<p>The following month, MPT received Audere’s intelligence reports over email. And soon, Audere further ramped up its campaign against Simone, even hiring a contractor to create a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230411163951/https://hedgespy.medium.com/">fake blog</a> written from the perspective of a woman trying to hold investment analysts to account. But its true goal was to criticize just one player: Hedgeye. It was called “Hedge Spy.” (After <em>Mother Jones </em>and <em>Reveal</em> mentioned this contractor’s work in previous reporting, the blog was <a href="https://hedgespy.medium.com/">taken down</a> from the internet.)</p>



<p>Initially the blog was populated with stories that cast doubt on a variety of firms, as the contract writer explained to Audere in emails reviewed by <em>Mother Jones</em>. “The more general content will disguise the blog’s objective,” wrote the contractor.</p>



<p>The contractor also launched a Reddit account, Loud-Peanut-7716, whose goal was “to actively engage in discussions and facilitate the conversations concerning Hedgeye.” In an email to Audere, the contractor listed some of the Reddit posts trying to discredit Simone’s firm:</p>



<p>“Can you recommend any research platforms? I tried Hedgeye but I don’t trust them after their recent dirty tricks stalking and intimidating their competitors”</p>



<p>“They don’t care about making us rich, they want to make THEMSELVES rich! DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH!”</p>



<p><span>At the start of 2023,</span> a new critic took on MPT, publishing a series of reports with cheeky titles and provocative tweets that alleged MPT was committing a brazen financial fraud.</p>



<p>That voice was a British investor named Fraser Perring. Perring runs a short-selling firm called Viceroy Research that makes big financial bets on companies it thinks will fail, digging deep into their financials to see if they might be hiding something. He has tens of thousands of followers on social media, where he often posts his findings and claims of corporate wrongdoing.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Management soon would help fuel a conspiracy theory that was already growing at MPT: that their critics were working together to short their stock.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>In January of that year, Viceroy published the first of what would be several reports on MPT. Titled “Medical Properties (dis)Trust,” the report arrived at many of the same conclusions that had been swirling around Wall Street: Steward was going belly up, and MPT seemed to be secretly funneling it money to stave off bankruptcy. And perhaps more clearly than anyone before, Viceroy accused MPT of “round-tripping”: Not only was it loaning money to help Steward pay rent, but it was then recording this rent as new earnings and not disclosing it, all to maintain the illusion that it was a healthy landlord.</p>



<p>Viceroy’s report sent MPT executives into a tizzy. Leaked documents show the company was scrutinizing Perring’s tweets alleging round-tripping, with executives furiously sharing them with one another and one of their PR firms compiling them all.</p>



<p>Management soon would help fuel a conspiracy theory that was already growing at MPT: that their critics—from Simone to the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>—were working together to short their stock and bring them down.</p>



<p>Around that time, social media trolling of Simone and Perring ramped up. On top of that, reporting from the <em>Boston</em> <em>Globe</em> and OCCRP shows that a security firm contracted by Audere videotaped Perring at his home and watched him around his neighborhood—even following him and his daughter on their way back from school. When MPT <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67117032/medical-properties-trust-inc-v-viceroy-research-llc/">sued Viceroy</a> the following month for defamation, it denied all of Perring’s findings, writing that they were “malicious fiction” and had “caused serious harm to MPT.” But during litigation, according to <a href="https://viceroyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-3.pdf">court documents</a>, Viceroy’s lawyers said an impostor had called Perring’s bank in the weeks leading up to MPT’s suit and pretended to be him. It’s unclear who was behind the impostor, who was able to gain access to Perring’s financial transactions; soon those details were included in a report sent to Audere. No money was stolen, but in reports to Audere the impersonator tried to figure out what Perring was spending his money on. (MPT, which agreed to settle the defamation case last December, said in a statement that it hired Audere in late 2022 for work unrelated to Perring.)&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>They wondered if anyone in their “army of advisors” had an in with regulators. Included on that email chain was exactly that kind of connection: Mick Mulvaney.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>A few months later, when JP Morgan recommended that investors view the company’s stock with caution, emails show that MPT’s top executives circulated a lengthy list of analysts they believed were somehow connected to each other. They named five different investment funds and investors, and the many possible ways they were “connected”—to each other, to a <em>Journal</em> reporter, to Hedgeye, to Viceroy, even to liberal megadonor George Soros. And they wondered if anyone in their “army of advisors” had an in with regulators. Included on that email chain was exactly that kind of connection, someone who used to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: Mick Mulvaney.</p>



<p>Mulvaney, who also had been President Donald Trump’s acting chief of staff, was helping to run a consulting firm called Actum. Leaked emails show that MPT brought Actum on to help it “combat” what they saw as people conspiring to target the company. To counter their criticisms, Actum drafted a white paper praising MPT, calling it a company “investing in the future of health care and communities.” (Actum did not respond to questions from <em>Mother Jones</em>.)</p>



<p>Reputation management is common among publicly traded companies, notes Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of business at Santa Clara University who studies corporate conduct and ethics. But the scale and expense of the effort to manage MPT’s PR crises is “unequivocally not normal,” she says.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>After years of high rents to MPT, hospitals had failed to pay on-call doctors, nurse staffing agencies, repairmen, and suppliers of everything from blood to hospital beds.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“The fact that these folks were so willing to waste company resources—spend significant amounts of money that could have been diverted to more productive uses—to investigate journalists, to investigate investment analysts, it suggests to me that they are spying, and think that everybody else is doing the same,” Pozner said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While MPT focused on its value and reputation, patient care issues at its Steward hospitals began to reach crisis levels. Under the weight of years of high rents to MPT, these facilities had failed to pay on-call doctors, nurse staffing agencies, repairmen, and suppliers of everything from blood to hospital beds. Eventually, some Steward hospitals couldn’t afford to keep paying MPT rent and closed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These troubles further drove MPT’s stock price down. In October 2023, when it dipped below $5, Aldag recorded a message to shareholders, telling them he remained confident in “MPT’s proven business model” for investing in and improving hospitals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At one of them, St. Elizabeth’s in Massachusetts, a crisis had begun to unfold. The hospital owed more than $500,000 to a company that made devices used to stem internal bleeding called embolism coils; the supplier recently had come to repossess the coils.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two weeks after Aldag posted the video reassuring shareholders, a first-time mom named Sungida Rashid delivered a baby girl at St. Elizabeth’s. Hours later, Rashid began to bleed severely, doctors discovered they didn’t have the embolism coil needed to treat her, and <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/25/business/steward-health-care-mother-death/">she died</a>. Her family’s tragedy would set in motion articles and hearings and subpoenas trying to understand the financial dealings of MPT and Steward. It had taken years—and a mother’s life—for the story to finally come to light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, let’s just walk through the whole thing, end to end. Here’s a twelve-step program for understanding game design.</p>

<h3>One: Fun</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Types-of-Fun">There are a lot of things people call “fun.”</a> But most of them are not useful for getting better at making games, which is usually why people read <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2013/04/16/playing-with-game/" data-type="post" data-id="11489">articles like this</a>. The fun of a bit of confetti exploding in front of you, and the fun of excruciating pain and risk to life and limb as you free climb a cliff are just not usefully paired together.</p>



<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Slide30.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="960" height="720" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Slide30.png?resize=960%2C720&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Slide30.png?w=960&amp;ssl=1 960w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Slide30.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></figure></div>


<p>In <em><a href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/">Theory of Fun</a></em> I basically asserted that the useful bit for game designers was “mastery of problems.” That means that free climbing a cliff is in bounds even though it is terrifying and painful. Which given what we already said, means that you may or may not find the activity fun at the time! Fun often shows up <em>after </em>an activity.</p>



<p>There’s neuropsych and lots more to go with that, and <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/a-theory-of-fun-10-years-later/" data-type="page" data-id="24047">you can go read up on it if you want</a>.</p>

</figure>



<p><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/20/narrative-is-not-a-game-mechanic/">Anything that is <em>not</em> about a form of problem-solving is not going to be core to game <em>systems</em> design</a>. That doesn’t mean it’s not useful to game <em>experience</em> design, or not useful in general.</p>



<p>Also, in case it isn’t obvious – you can make interactive entertainment that is <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2011/03/10/replay-as-meditation/">not meant to be about fun</a>. You can also just find stuff in the world and turn it into a game! You can also look at a game and <em>choose not to treat it as one</em>, and then it might turn into real work (this is often called “training”).</p>



<p>This rules out <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/26/narrative-isnt-usually-content-either/">the bit of confetti</a>. A game being made of just throwing confetti around with nothing else palls pretty quick.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: fun is basically about making progress on prediction.</strong></p>

<p>There are <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/teaching-to-fish/" data-type="page" data-id="27177">a <em>lot</em> of types of problems in the world</a>. It is really important to understand that you have to think about problems games can pose as broadly as possible. A problem is <em>anything</em> you have to work to wrap your head around. A good movie poses problems too, that’s why you end up thinking about it long after.</p>



<p>You can go look at theorists as diverse as Nicole Lazzaro, Roger Caillois, or Mark LeBlanc for types of fun. You’ll find they’re mostly types of <em>problems</em>, not types of fun. “I enjoy the types of problems that come from chance” or “I enjoy the types of problems that come from interacting with others” or whatever.</p>

<p>This is not a bad thing. This is what makes these lists useful. Your game mechanics are about posing problems, so knowing there’s clumps of problem types is very useful.</p>



<p>In the end, though, a problem is built out of a set of constraints. <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2011/12/13/rules-versus-mechanics/" data-type="post" data-id="3926">We call those rules, usually</a>. It also, though, has a goal. Usually, if we come across a set of rules with no problem, we just play with it, and call it a toy.</p>



<p>Building toys is hard! Arriving at those rules and constraints to define a nice chewy problem is very challenging. You can think of a toy as a problematic object, a problem that invites you to play with it.</p>



<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2013/04/16/playing-with-game/" data-type="post" data-id="11489">it’s not hard to turn a toy into a game, and people do it all the time.</a> All you have to do is invent a goal. We shouldn’t forget that players do so routinely.</p>



<p>Building a toy is <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/rules-of-the-game-five-further-techniques-from-rather-clever-designers/" data-type="page" data-id="32253">an excellent place to start</a> designing a game.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: we play with systems that have constraints and movement, and we stick goals on them to test ourselves.</strong></p>

<h3>Three: Prediction and uncertainty</h3>



<p>Games are <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/depth-and-design-contrasting-ai-and-human-understandings/" data-type="page" data-id="31940">machines built around uncertainty</a>. Almost all games end by turning an uncertain outcome into a certain one. There’s a problem facing you, and you don’t know if you can overcome it to reach that goal. Overcoming it is going to be about predicting the future.</p>



<p>If there’s one thing that good games and good stories have in common, it’s about <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/playing-with-game/" data-type="page" data-id="24668">being unpredictable as long as possible</a>. (This is also where dopamine comes in, it’s tied to prediction; but it’s complicated and nuanced).</p>



<p>If a problem basically has one answer, we often call it a puzzle. There’s not a lot of uncertainty built into a binary structure. You can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game">stack a bunch of puzzles one on top of the other and build a game out of them</a> (which then introduces uncertainty into the whole), but a singular puzzle isn’t likely to be called that by most people.</p>



<p>It happens quite often that we used to think something was a game, and it turned out it was actually a puzzle. Mathematicians call that “solving the game.” They did it to Connect Four – and you did it to tic-tac-toe, when you were little.</p>



<p><em>Good</em> problems for games therefore <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/the-core-of-fun/" data-type="page" data-id="22306">all have the same characteristics</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>They need to have answers that evolve as you dig in more – so they need to have depth to them. Your first answer should only work for a while. There might be many paths to the solution, too. This is why so many games have a score – it helps indicate how big a spread of solutions there are!</li>



<li>They need to have uncertain answers. (When you’re little, this universe is a lot larger than it is when you’re older – peek-a-boo is uncertain up to a certain point!).</li>



<li>The problem should be something that can show up in a <em>lot</em> of situations.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of very good problems seem stupidly simple, but <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/playing-with-game/" data-type="page" data-id="24668">have depths to them</a>. Math ones, like “what’s the best path to cross this yard?” but also story ones like “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.”</p>



<p>I recently watched a video that included the statement that “picking up sticks” is not a useful loop. Picture a screen with a single stick in the middle. The problem posed is to move the cursor over it and click it. Once you do it, you get to do it again.</p>



<p>Guess what? The original Mac shipped with games that taught you how to move a mouse and click things. Once upon a time, mousing was a skill that was challenging; for all I know, you have grandparents who still have trouble with it. For them, it has uncertainty. For you, probably, it doesn’t.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: the more uncertainty, indeterminacy, ambiguity in your game, the more depth it will have.</strong></p>

<h3>Four: Loops</h3>



<p>Now, imagine that the stick pops to a random location each time. Better, yes?</p>



<p>The core of a loop is a problem you encounter over and over again. “How do I get the next one?” But <em>something needs to be pushing back</em>, that’s what makes it an interesting problem and is usually what takes it past being a puzzle. I like to say “in every game, there is an opponent.” Even it’s just physics.</p>

<p>People talk about the core loop of a game. But there’s really two types of loops.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/game-grammar/" data-type="page" data-id="26966">One is what we might think of as the <em>operational loop</em></a>. This is the loop between you and the problem, it is how you interact with it. You look at it. You form a hypothesis. You poke the problem. You see a result. Maybe it was success, and you grabbed the stick. Maybe it was failure. Maybe it was <em>partial</em> success. You update your hypothesis so you can decide what to do next.</p>



<p>The second loop is really your <em>progression loop</em> but <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/gritty-systems-design-for-retention/" data-type="page" data-id="29984">is better thought of as a spiral</a>. It’s what people usually mean when they say “a game loop.” They mean picking up the stick over and over. I say it’s a spiral, because clicking on the same stick in the middle of the screen over and over is not usually how we design games. That would actually be repeatedly doing the same puzzle.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Slide38.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></figure></div>


<p>Instead, we move the stick on the screen each time, and maybe give you a time limit. Now there’s something you’re pushing against, and there’s a skill to exercise and patterns to try to recognize. Far more people will find this a diverting problem for a while. It’s a better game. It’ll get even better if there are reasons why the stick appears in one place versus another, and the player can figure them out over time.</p>



<p>This matters: the verbs are in a loop. “Pick up,” over and over. But the <em>situation</em> isn’t. And you are learning how to reduce uncertainty of the outcome: move the mouse <em>here</em> and click, next move it <em>there</em>. That’s why it is a spiral: it is spiraling to a conclusion. It’ll be fun until it’s predictable.</p>



<p>You can think of the operational loop as how you turn the wheel, and the situations as the road you roll over. A spot on the wheel makes a progression spiral as you move. One machine, many situations — we call these rules mechanics for a reason.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: players need to understand how to use the machine, and the point is to gradually infer how it works by testing it against varied situations.</strong></p>

<h3>Five: Feedback</h3>



<p>You can’t learn and get better unless <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/disassembling-games/" data-type="page" data-id="31385">you get a whole host of information</a>.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Slide74.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></figure></div>


<ul>
<li>You need to know what actions – we usually call them verbs — are even available to you. There’s a gas pedal.</li>



<li>You need to be able to tell you <em>used</em> a verb. You hear the engine growl as you press the pedal.</li>



<li>You need to see that the use of the verb affected the state of the problem, and <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2011/12/08/notes-on-game-feedback/">how it changed.</a> The spedometer moved!</li>



<li>You need to be told if the state of the problem is better for your goal, or worse. Did you mean to go this fast?</li>
</ul>



<p>There are fancy names for each of these, and <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2015/06/29/game-design-ux-design/" data-type="post" data-id="26419">you can go learn them all</a>. Everything from “affordance” and “juice,” to terms like “state space” and “perfect information” and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7yn31MMAGs">very confusing contradictory uses of the words “positive” and “negative” paired with the word “feedback.”</a></p>



<p><a href="https://jenson.org/games/">Feedback in general can, and should be, delightful.</a> That means it’s where you get to use all those forms of fun that I threw away at the beginning. It can be surprising. It can be a juicy multimedia extravaganza. It can be a deeply affecting tragic cutscene that advances the game story.</p>



<p>If you have too little feedback, players cannot go around the interaction loop. Picture <em>Tetris</em> if the piece you drop is invisible until it lands.</p>

<p>If you have bad feedback, players cannot go around the learning loop either. Picture <em>Tetris</em> if sometimes your score goes down when you complete a line and sometimes it goes up. You can’t draw any conclusions about what the problem in the way of the goal actually <em>is</em>, in that crappy version of <em>Tetris</em>. Feedback needs to act as a reward to help you draw conclusions.</p>



<p>But there’s a third mistake: you can supply a gorgeous and compelling set of feedback and not actually have a real problem under there. At minimum you’re making shallow entertainment. At worst, you are building exploitative entertainment.</p>



<p>People will be willing to go along with <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2013/03/13/why-are-qtes-so-popular/" data-type="post" data-id="10439">pretty simple and pretty familiar problems</a> as long as the feedback is great.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: show what you can do, that you did it, what difference it made, and whether it helped.</strong></p>

<h3>Six: Variation and escalation</h3>

<p>If you are trying to design and are thinking of a specific problem <em>scenario</em> you are not doing game systems design. You are doing level design. “How to multiply numbers” is a problem. <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2012/01/26/narrative-isnt-usually-content-either/" data-type="post" data-id="4087">“What is 6 x 9” is not a problem, it’s <em>content</em>.</a></p>



<p>Now consider the game of <em>Snake</em>, or <em>Pac-Man</em>. They are also games where the core loop is picking up a stick. The difference is that something is an obstacle to you picking up the stick: you get longer when you pick up the stick, and can crash into yourself. You have to avoid ghosts as you gather the stick.</p>



<p>How long you are in <em>Snake</em> is a different <em>situation</em>. Where the apple to eat is located is a different situation. To be specific, you have the same problem in different topology. Where you are relative to the ghosts, and which dots are left, and what directions you can go in the maze are different situations in <em>Pac-Man</em>.</p>



<p>You want the verbs you use in the loop to end up confronting many many situations. If your verb can’t, your core loop is probably bad. Your core problem (aka your core game mechanic) is probably shallow.</p>

<p>What you want is to be able to throw increasingly complex situations at the player. <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/good-design-bad-design-great-design/">That’s how they climb the learning ladder</a>. Ideally, they should arrive at interim solutions (lots of words for that, too: heuristics, strategies) that later <em>stop working</em>.</p>



<p><em>Pac-Man</em> actually got solved, by the way! That’s why <em>Ms. Pac-Man</em> was invented. Sometimes, the way to escalate is to change the rules, and that’s what <em>Ms. Pac-Man</em> did. It did it by adding randomness, and in fact using randomness is one of the biggest (and oldest) ways to create situation variation in games. </p>

<h3>Seven: Pacing and balance</h3>



<p>Since we can put all this this down very much to problem solving and learning and mastery, it means we can steal a whole bunch of knowledge from other fields.</p>

<p>People learn best when they can experiment iteratively, which <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2014/12/03/practicing-the-creativity-habit/" data-type="post" data-id="21760">we also call “practicing.” </a>That’s why loops make sense. There’s a lot of science out there about how to train, how to practice (and also a lot of educational theory that overlaps hugely), and your game will be better if it follows some of those guidelines.</p>



<p>People learn best when the problem they are tackling is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development">right past the edge of what they can do</a>. If it’s too far past that edge, they may not even be able to perceive the problem in the first place! And if the reverse is true and they see a solution instantly, they’ll either be bored, or they might just do that over and over again and <a href="https://muds.fandom.com/wiki/Grinding">never develop any new strategies and not progress</a>.</p>

<p>There’s an optimal pacing shape. It looks just like what you see in your literature textbooks when they diagram tension, or whatever: sort of like a rising sine wave. You start slow, then speed up, hit a peak challenge, then back off a bit, give a breather that falls back but not all the way, then speed up… we have conventions for what to put at those peaks (bosses!). But what matters is the shape of the curve.</p>



<p>You need to structure your game so that you push players up. They might need to climb the curve at different paces, which is why you might also have difficulty sliders. They might not be capable of getting all the way to the top, and that’s okay.</p>



<p>You also need to pace to allow room for everything that <em>isn’t</em> mastering the problem — such as <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/snippets/on-socialization-and-convenience/" data-type="page" data-id="16238">having fun with friends socially</a>. But at the same time, things to do in the game need to come along at the right pace too!</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: Vary intensity and pressure, give players a chance to practice and moments to be tested</strong>.</p>

<h3>Eight: Games are made of games</h3>



<p>Remember the game about clicking on a stick that appeared at a random location on screen? That’s also a rail shooter. You move the mouse and click on a spot in 2d space. Which is also not that different from an FPS — only now you move the camera, not the cursor.</p>



<p>Almost no games are made of only one loop. Instead, we chain loops together – complete loop A, and it probably outputs <em>something</em> that may serve as a tool or constraint on a different loop.</p>



<p>An FPS has the problem of moving the camera (instead of the mouse) to click on the stick. It also has a loop around moving around in 3d space. Moving around is actually made of several loops, probably, because it may be made of running and jumping and spatial orientation. Those are all problem types!</p>

<p>We speak sometimes of <em><a href="https://lostgarden.com/2021/12/12/value-chains/">value chains</a></em>: that’s where one loop outputs something to the next loop. We speak also of <em>game economies</em>, which is what happens when loops connect in non-linear ways, more like a web. This is not the sort of economy where you are simulating money or commerce. Instead it’s a metaphor for stocks and flows and other aspects of actual system dynamics science. In this view, your hit points is a “stock” or, if you like, a “currency” you spend in a fight.</p>



<p>Games nest fractally, they web into complex economies, and they unroll chains of linked loops. That’s why they can be diagrammed in a multitude of ways.</p>



<p>At heart though, you can decompose them all into those elemental small problems, each with an interaction loop and a learning loop centered on that problem.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: build small problems into larger webs, and map them so you understand how they connect.</strong></p>

<p>The common question is “okay, so how do I design a problem like that?” And that is indeed the unique bit in games, because the other items here are common to lots of other fields.</p>



<p>The list of possible problems is, as mentioned, enormous. This is a big rabbit hole. And once you consider that you can stack, web, and otherwise interlink problems, it means that there’s a giant composable universe of games (and <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/tabletop-game-grammar/" data-type="page" data-id="32715">game variants</a>) to create.</p>



<p>Just bear in mind that because of varied tastes and experience, the diversity of the set of problems you pose is going to affect who wants to play your game.</p>



<p>There are basically a set of categories of problems that we know work, and this is the absolute simplest version of them:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/games-are-math-10-core-mechanics-that-drive-compelling-gameplay/" data-type="page" data-id="23813">Mathematically complex puzzles</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/social-mechanics-the-engines-behind-everything-multiplayer/" data-type="page" data-id="23999">Figuring out how other humans think</a></li>



<li>Mastering your body and brain</li>
</ul>



<p>These break down into a ton of sub-problems, but there are less than you think, and you can actually <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/browse/boardgamemechanic">find lists of them</a>. The hard part is that often they each seem so small and trivial that we don’t think of them as actually being worth looking at!</p>



<p>They are also often in disguise: the problem behind where a tossed ball will land, and the problem of how much fuel you have left in your car if you keep driving at this speed, and the problem of when your hit points will run out given you have a poison status effect on you <em>are the same thing</em>.</p>

<p>But the more of them you as a designer have wrapped your head around, the more you can combine. And you’ll find them very plastic and malleable. In fact, you could almost make a YouTube video about <em>each one</em>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/practical-creativity/" data-type="page" data-id="21143">So where do you get them?</a> Steal them. Other games, sure, but also, <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/reconciling-games/">the world is full of systems that pose tough problems.</a> You can grab them and reskin them.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: not every mechanic has been invented, but a ton have. Build your catalog and workbench.</strong></p>

<p>In the end, the feedback layer of a game is <em>everything</em> about how you present it. The setting, the lore, the audio, the story, the art…</p>



<p>How you dress up the problems can change everything about how the player learns from it, and how they perceive the problem. The exact same underlying problem can be as different as picking up sticks or shooting someone in the face, or as mentioned, the calculus problem of estimating the trajectory of a variable in a system of rates of change (the ball, the car and its gas, the hit points and poison) might be the same but <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2006/01/06/undressing-a-game/" data-type="post" data-id="248">dressed extraordinarily differently</a>.</p>

<p>When you think about how you dress up the problems, you are in <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2013/04/26/worch-explains-game-culture-wars/" data-type="post" data-id="11680">the realm of metaphor</a>. You are engaging in painting, poetry, and music composition, and rhetoric, and the bardic tradition, and <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/digital-bards-interactive-media-and-the-evolution-of-storytelling/" data-type="page" data-id="30188">all that other humanities stuff.</a></p>



<p>This is a giant and deep universe for you as a designer to dive into. A lot of this stuff gets called “game design,” but then again, we also often say that a given game designer is <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2005/12/07/the-pixar-lesson/">a frustrated moviemaker,</a> too.</p>



<p>It is really easy to create an experience that clashes with the underlying problems it is teaching. There are fancy critical terms for this. You also need to be very conscious about whether you are building your game so that you are telling the player a story, or so that <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/two-models-for-narrative-worlds/">the player can tell stories with your game</a>.</p>

<p>So the takeaway should be: <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2014/01/06/how-i-analyze-a-game/" data-type="post" data-id="14229">this stuff is deeply, deeply synergistic with the “game system” stuff that this article is about,</a> but <em>they are not the same thing.</em> And games is <em>not the best place to learn how to do these things.</em></p>



<p>Those other fields have <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2016/03/05/books-on-writing/" data-type="post" data-id="28338">much longer traditions</a> and loads of expertise and lessons. They won’t all apply to the issue of “how do I best dress up this collection of problems” but most of them will.</p>



<p>It does not frickin’ matter if you start out <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/rules-of-the-game-five-further-techniques-from-rather-clever-designers/" data-type="page" data-id="32253">wanting to make interesting problems,</a> or if you start out wanting to <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/influences/" data-type="page" data-id="22101">provide a cool experience</a>. You are going to need to do both to make the game <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2018/02/06/why-i-loved-edith-finch/">really good</a>. </p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: game development is a compound art form. You can go learn those individual arts <em>and</em> the part unique to games.</strong></p>

<h3>Eleven: Motivations</h3>



<p>Researchers have done a ton of studying “why people play games.” This gets called “motivations.”</p>



<p>Motivations are basically about people’s personal taste for groups of problems and how those problems are presented, and characteristics of those problems and the situations in which you find them. Some people like problems where you destroy stuff. Others like problems where you bond with others. <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2018/03/16/the-trust-spectrum/" data-type="post" data-id="32038">Some have trouble trusting other people.</a> Others want to cooperate. </p>

<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Slide54-1.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></figure></div>


<p><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2013/02/15/why-do-we-like-a-given-game/" data-type="post" data-id="10230">Not everyone likes the same sorts of problems</a> or the same sorts of dressings. Some of this is down to personality types, some of it is down to social dynamics, how they were raised, what their local culture is like, what trauma they have had, and countless other psychological things. That’s why one fancy term for this is <em>psychographics</em>.</p>



<p>The big thing is, it’s not enough that the problems need to not be obvious to you, and also not be baffling to you. <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/revisiting-fun-20-years-of-a-theory-of-fun/" data-type="page" data-id="45916">They also have to be <em>interesting </em>to you.</a> What problems fit in that range is going to depend entirely on who you are, what your life experiences have been, what skills you have, and even what mood you are in.</p>



<p>Picking motivations and selecting problems based on them is a great way to design. But motivations are not the same thing as fun. They’re a filter, <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2011/06/30/marketing/" data-type="post" data-id="3810">useful in marketing exercises</a> and in building your game pillars (which is an exercise in focus and scope).</p>



<p>Scientists have spent a bunch of time <a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/">surveying tons of people</a> and have arrived at all sorts of conclusions that map people onto reasons to play and from there onto particular problems.</p>

<p>If you start with motivations, then you can go from there to types of problems, types of experience, and even player demographics. And then, if you want problems that are about interacting with people, well, there’s lists of those. If you want problems that are about managing resources, or solving math issues, there’s lists of those too.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: no game is for everyone, so you will make better games if you know who you are posing problems for.</strong></p>

<h3>Twelve: It’s simple, but not</h3>



<p>I run into game developers who do not understand the above eleven steps <em>all the time</em>. And understanding all eleven is <em>more valuable</em> than building expertise in just one, because they depend on one another. This is because getting any one of the eleven wrong can break your game. The real issue is that each of these eleven things is often multiple fields of study. And yeah, you do need to become expert in at least one.</p>

<p>To pick one example, some of us have been working out the rule set for <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/a-grammar-of-gameplay/" data-type="page" data-id="17523">how you can link loops into a larger network of problems</a> for literally over twenty years.</p>



<p>Others have spent their entire career doing nothing but figuring out how best to provide <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2015/06/29/game-design-ux-design/" data-type="post" data-id="26419"><em>just the affordances part</em> of feedback</a>.</p>



<p>So game design is pretty simple. But the devil is in details that are not very far below the surface. It’s fairly easy to explain why something is fun for an given audience. It is much harder to build something new that is fun for an arbitrary person. That said, every single one of those fields has best practices, and they are mostly already written down. It’s just a lot to learn.</p>



<p>Put another way — <em>every single paragraph in this essay could be a book.</em> Actually, probably already is several.</p>



<p><strong>Bottom line: each of these topics is deep, but you want a smattering of all of them.</strong></p>

<p>Some of you may not like <a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/games/presentations/influences/">this deconstructive view</a> on how games are designed. That’s okay. Personally, I find it best to poke and prod at a problem, like “how do I get better at making games?” and treat it as a game. And that’s what I have done my whole career. The above is just my strategy guide. Someone else will have different strategies, I guarantee it.</p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?resize=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.raphkoster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Slide14.png?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w" data-sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxIiB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciPjwvc3ZnPg=="></a></figure></div>


<p>But I also guarantee that if you get better at the above twelve things, you will get better at making games. This is a <em>pragmatic</em> list. And it will be helpful for making narrative games, puzzle games, boardgames, action games, RPGs, whatever. I breezed through it, but there are very specific tools you can pick up underneath each of these twelve things. It really is that simple, but also that hard, because that’s a frickin’ long list if you want to actually dive into each of the twelve.</p>



<p>What that also means is that people designing games <em>fail a lot at it</em>. You might say, “can’t they just do the part they know how to do, and therefore predictably make good games?”</p>



<p>No, because <em><a href="https://www.raphkoster.com/2008/01/10/devs-learning-from-gamers/">players learn along with the designers. </a></em>If you just make the same game, the one you know how to make, the players get bored because it’s nothing but problems they have seen before and already have their answers to. Sometimes, they get so bored that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtSRV1EeWco">an entire genre dies.</a></p>

<p>And if you instead make it super-complicated by adding more problems, it might dissolve into noise for most people. Then nobody plays it. And then <a href="https://lostgarden.com/2005/05/06/game-genre-lifecycle-part-i/">the genre dies too!</a></p>



<p>Game designers will routinely fail at making something fun. <strong>When the game of making games is played right, it is always right outside the edge of what the designers know how to do. </strong></p>



<p>That’s where the fun lives, not just for the designer, but also for their audience. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Software development has always resisted the idea that it can be turned into an
                assembly line. Even as our tools become smarter, faster, and more capable, the
                essential act remains the same: we learn by doing.</p>

<p>An Assembly Line is a poor metaphor for software development</p>

<p>
                In most mature engineering disciplines, the process is clear: a few experts design
                the system, and less specialized workers execute the plan. This separation between
                design and implementation depends on stable, predictable laws of physics and
                repeatable patterns of construction. Software doesn't work like that. There are
                repetitive parts that can be automated, yes, but the very assumption that design can
                be completed before implementation doesn't work. In software, design emerges through
                implementation. We often need to write code before we can even understand the right
                design. The feedback from code is our primary guide. Much of this cannot be done in
                isolation. Software creation involves constant interaction—between developers,
                product owners, users, and other stakeholders—each bringing their own insights. Our
                processes must reflect this dynamic. The people writing code aren't just
                'implementers'; they are central to discovering the right design.
            </p>

<p> LLMs are
            reintroducing the assembly line metaphor </p>

<p>
                Agile practices recognized this over two decades ago, and what we learnt from Agile
                should not be forgotten. Today, with the rise of large language models (LLMs), we're
                once again tempted to see code generation as something done in isolation after the
                design structure is well thought through. But that view ignores the true nature of
                software development.
            </p>

<p>I learned to use LLMs judiciously as brainstorming partners</p>

<p>
                I recently developed a framework for building distributed systems—based on the
                patterns I describe in my book. I experimented heavily with LLMs. They helped in
                brainstorming, naming, and generating boilerplate. But just as often, they produced
                code that was subtly wrong or misaligned with the deeper intent. I had to throw away
                large sections and start from scratch. Eventually, I learned to use LLMs more
                judiciously: as brainstorming partners for ideas, not as autonomous builders. That
                experience helped me think through the nature of software development, most
                importantly that writing software is fundamentally an act of learning, 
                and that we cannot escape the need to learn just because we have LLM agents at our disposal.
            </p>

<p>LLMs lower the threshold for experimentation</p>

<p>
                Before we can begin any meaningful work, there's one crucial step: getting things
                set-up to get going. Setting up the environment—installing dependencies, choosing
                the right compiler or interpreter, resolving version mismatches, and wiring up
                runtime libraries—is sometimes the most frustrating and necessary first hurdle.
                There's a reason the “Hello, World” program is legendary. It's not just tradition;
                it marks the moment when imagination meets execution. That first successful output
                closes the loop—the tools are in place, the system responds, and we can now think
                through code. This setup phase is where LLMs mostly shine. They're incredibly useful
                for helping you overcoming that initial friction—drafting the initial build file, finding the right
                flags, suggesting dependency versions, or generating small snippets to bootstrap a
                project. They remove friction from the starting line and lower the threshold for
                experimentation. But once the “hello world” code compiles and runs, the real work begins.
            </p>

<p>There is a learning loop that is fundamental to our work</p>

<p> As we consider the nature of any work we do, it's clear that continuous learning is
                the engine that drives our work. Regardless of the tools at our disposal—from a
                simple text editor to the most advanced AI—the path to building deep, lasting
                knowledge follows a fundamental, hands-on pattern that cannot be skipped. This
                process can be broken down into a simple, powerful cycle:
            </p>

                    Next, you must move from passive observation to active participation. You don't
                    just read about a new programming technique; you write the code yourself. You
                    change it, you try to break it, and you see what happens. This is the crucial
                    “hands-on” phase where abstract ideas start to feel real and concrete in your
                    mind.

                    This is the most important step, where true learning is proven. It's the moment
                    when you face a new challenge and have to actively recall what you learned
                    before and apply it in a different context. It's where you think, “I've seen a
                    problem like this before, I can use that solution here.” This act of retrieving
                    and using your knowledge is what transforms fragmented information into a
                    durable skill.
                </p>

<p>AI cannot automate learning</p>

<p>
                    This is why tools can't do the learning for you. An AI can generate a perfect
                    solution in seconds, but it cannot give you the experience you gain from the
                    struggle of creating it yourself. The small failures and the “aha!” moments are
                    essential features of learning, not bugs to be automated away.

<p>There Are No Shortcuts to Learning</p>

<p>✣&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✣&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;✣</p>
</div>

<p>Everybody has a unique way of navigating the learning cycle</p>

<p>
                    This learning cycle is unique to each person. It's a continuous loop of trying things,
                    seeing what works, and adjusting based on feedback. Some methods will click for
                    you, and others won't. True expertise is built by finding what works for you
                    through this constant adaptation, making your skills genuinely your own.
                </p>

<p>Agile methodologies understand the importance of learning</p>

<p>
                This fundamental nature of learning and its importance in the work we do is
                precisely why the most effective software development methodologies have evolved the
                way they have. We talk about Iterations, pair programming, standup meetings,
                retrospectives, TDD, continuous integration, continuous delivery, and 'DevOps' not
                just because we are from the Agile camp. It's because these techniques acknowledge
                this fundamental nature of learning and its importance in the work we do.
            </p>

<p>The need to learn is why high-level code reuse has been elusive</p>

<p>
                Conversely, this role of continuous learning in our professional work, explains one
                of the most persistent challenges in software development: the limited success of
                high-level code reuse. The fundamental need for contextual learning is precisely why
                the long-sought-after goal of high-level code “reuse” has remained elusive. Its
                success is largely limited to technical libraries and frameworks (like data
                structures or web clients) that solve well-defined, universal problems. Beyond this
                level, reuse falters because most software challenges are deeply embedded in a
                unique business context that must be learned and internalized. 
            </p>

<p>Low code platforms provide speed, but without learning,
            that speed doesn't last</p>

<p> This brings us to the
                Illusion of Speed offered by “starter kits” and “low-code platforms.” They provide a
                powerful initial velocity for standard use cases, but this speed comes at a cost.
                The readymade components we use are essentially compressed bundles of
                context—countless design decisions, trade-offs, and lessons are hidden within them.
                By using them, we get the functionality without the learning, leaving us with zero
                internalized knowledge of the complex machinery we've just adopted. This can quickly
                lead to sharp increase in the time spent to get work done and sharp decrease in
                productivity. </p>

<div id="graph.svg"><p><img src="https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop/graph.svg"></p>
</div>



<p>What seems like a small change becomes a
                time-consuming black-hole</p>

<p>I find this very similar to the performance graphs of software systems
                at saturation, where we see the 'knee', beyond which latency increases exponentially
                and throughput drops sharply. The moment a requirement deviates even slightly from
                what the readymade solution provides, the initial speedup evaporates. The
                developer, lacking the deep context of how the component works, is now faced with a
                black box. What seems like a small change can become a dead end or a time-consuming
                black hole, quickly consuming all the time that was supposedly saved in the first
                few days.
            </p>

<p>LLMs amplify this ephemeral speed while undermining the
            development of expertise</p>

<p> Large Language Models amplify this dynamic manyfold. We are now swamped with claims
                of radical productivity gains—double-digit increases in speed and decreases in cost.
                However, without acknowledging the underlying nature of our work, these metrics are
                a trap. True expertise is built by learning and applying knowledge to build deep
                context. Any tool that offers a readymade solution without this journey presents a
                hidden danger. By offering seemingly perfect code at lightning speed, LLMs represent
                the ultimate version of the Maintenance Cliff: a tempting shortcut that bypasses the
                essential learning required to build robust, maintainable systems for the long term.
            </p>

<p> LLMs Provide a Natural-Language Interface to All the Tools </p>

<p>
            So why so much excitement about LLMs?
            One of the most remarkable strengths of Large Language Models is their ability to bridge
            the many languages of software development. Every part of our work needs its own
            dialect: build files have Gradle or Maven syntax, Linux performance tools like vmstat or
            iostat have their own structured outputs, SVG graphics follow XML-based markup, and then there
            are so may general purpose languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, etc. Add to this 
            the myriad of tools and frameworks with their own APIs, DSLs, and configuration files.
            LLMs can act as translators between human intent and these specialized languages. They
            let us describe what we want in plain English—“create an SVG of two curves,” “write a
            Gradle build file for multiple modules,” “explain cpu usage from this vmstat output”
            —and instantly produce code in appropriate syntax inseconds. This is a tremendous capability. 
            It lowers the entry barrier, removes friction, and helps us get started faster than ever.
            But this fluency in translation is not the same as learning. The ability to phrase our
            intent in natural language and receive working code does not replace the deeper
            understanding that comes from learning each language's design, constraints, and
            trade-offs. These specialized notations embody decades of engineering wisdom. 
            Learning them is what enables us to reason about change—to modify, extend, and evolve systems
            confidently.
            LLMs make the exploration smoother, but the maturity comes from deeper understanding.  
            </p>

<p> The fluency in translating intents into code with LLMs is not the same as learning </p>

<section>
<p>
                Large Language Models give us great leverage—but they only work if we focus
                on learning and understanding.
                They make it easier to explore ideas, to set things up, to translate intent into
                code across many specialized languages. But the real capability—our
                ability to respond to change—comes not from how fast we can produce code, but from
                how deeply we understand the system we are shaping.
                Tools keep getting smarter. The nature of learning loop stays the same.
                We need to acknowledge the nature of learning, if we are to continue to
                build software that lasts— forgetting that, we will always find
                ourselves at the maintenance cliff.

          <p>Some concepts are easy to grasp in the abstract. Boiling water: apply heat and wait. Others you really need to try. You only think you understand how a bicycle works, until you learn to ride one.</p>
<p>There are big ideas in computing that are easy to get your head around. The AWS S3 API. It’s the most important storage technology of the last 20 years, and it’s like boiling water. Other technologies, you need to get your feet on the pedals first.</p>

<p>LLM agents are like that.</p>

<p>People have <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/contra-ptaceks-terrible-article-on-ai/" title="">wildly varying opinions</a> about LLMs and agents. But whether or not they’re snake oil, they’re a big idea. You don’t have to like them, but you should want to be right about them. To be the best hater (or stan) you can be.</p>

<p>So that’s one reason you should write an agent. But there’s another reason that’s even more persuasive, and that’s</p>

<p>Agents are the most surprising programming experience I’ve had in my career. Not because I’m awed by the magnitude of their powers — I like them, but I don’t like-like them. It’s because of how easy it was to get one up on its legs, and how much I learned doing that.</p>

<p>I’m about to rob you of a dopaminergic experience, because agents are so simple we might as well just jump into the code. I’m not even going to bother explaining what an agent is.</p>

<p>A subtler thing to notice: we just had a multi-turn conversation with an LLM. To do that, we remembered everything we said, and everything the LLM said back, and played it back with every LLM call. The LLM itself is a stateless black box. The conversation we’re having is an illusion we cast, on ourselves.</p>

<p>The 15 lines of code we just wrote, a lot of practitioners wouldn’t call an “agent”. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/18/agents/" title="">An According To Simon “agent”</a> is (1) an LLM running in a loop that (2) uses tools. We’ve only satisfied one predicate.</p>

- Reachability: 0% packet loss to all tested endpoints.
- Latency:
  - 8.8.8.8 (Google Public DNS): avg ~10 ms (8.5–14.4 ms), very stable.
  - www.google.com: avg ~31 ms (28.5–36.0 ms), stable.
  - google.com: avg ~35.9 ms (28.3–60.1 ms), mostly stable with one mild spike.
- Overall: Healthy connectivity with low latency and minimal jitter. No signs of packet loss or DNS issues.

tool call: ping google.com

</code></pre>
  </div>
<p>Did you notice where I wrote the loop in this agent to go find and ping multiple Google properties? Yeah, neither did I. All we did is give the LLM permission to ping stuff, and it figured out the rest.</p>
<p><strong>What happened here:</strong> since a big part of my point here is that an agent loop is incredibly simple, and that all you need is the LLM call API, it’s worth taking a beat to understand how the tool call actually worked. Every time we <code>call</code> the LLM, we’re posting a list of available tools. When our prompt causes the agent to think a tool call is warranted, it spits out a special response, telling our Python loop code to generate a tool response and <code>call</code> it in. That’s all <code>handle_tools</code> is doing.</p><p>Spoiler: you’d be surprisingly close to having a working coding agent.</p>
<p>Imagine what it’ll do if you give it <code>bash</code>. You could find out in less than 10 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="real-world-agents"><a href="#real-world-agents" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Real-World Agents</span></h2>
<p>Clearly, this is a toy example. But hold on: what’s it missing? More tools? OK,  give it <code>traceroute</code>. Managing and persisting contexts? <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/logging.html" title="">Stick ‘em in SQLite</a>. Don’t like Python? <a href="https://github.com/superfly/contextwindow" title="">Write it in Go</a>. Could it be every agent ever written is a toy? Maybe! If I’m arming you to make sharper arguments against LLMs, mazel tov. I just want you to get it.</p>

<p>You can see now how hyperfixated people are on Claude Code and Cursor. They’re fine,  even good. But here’s the thing: you couldn’t replicate Claude Sonnet 4.5 on your own. Claude Code, though? The TUI agent? Completely in your grasp. Build your own light saber. Give it 19 spinning blades if you like. And stop using <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/9/" title="">coding agents as database clients</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing to notice: we didn’t need MCP at all. That’s because MCP isn’t a fundamental enabling technology. The amount of coverage it gets is frustrating. It’s barely a technology at all. MCP is just a plugin interface for Claude Code and Cursor, a way of getting your own tools into code you don’t control. Write your own agent. Be a programmer. Deal in APIs, not plugins.</p>

<p>When you read a security horror story about MCP your first question should be why MCP showed up at all. By helping you dragoon a naive, single-context-window coding agent into doing customer service queries, MCP saved you a couple dozen lines of code, tops, while robbing you of any ability to finesse your agent architecture.</p>

<p>Security for LLMs is complicated and I’m not pretending otherwise. You can trivially build an agent with segregated contexts, each with specific tools. That makes LLM security interesting. But I’m a vulnerability researcher. It’s reasonable to back away slowly from anything I call “interesting”.</p>

<p>Similar problems come up outside of security and they’re fascinating. Some early adopters of agents became bearish on tools, because one context window bristling with tool descriptions doesn’t leave enough token space left to get work done. But why would you need to do that in the first place? Which brings me to</p>
<h2 id="context-engineering-is-real"><a href="#context-engineering-is-real" aria-label="Anchor"></a><span>Context Engineering Is Real</span></h2>
<p>I think “Prompt Engineering” is silly. I have never taken seriously the idea that I should tell my LLM “you are diligent conscientious helper fully content to do nothing but pass butter if that should be what I ask and you would never harvest the iron in my blood for paperclips”. This is very new technology and I think people tell themselves stories about magic spells to explain some of the behavior agents conjure.</p>

<p>So, just like you, I rolled my eyes when “Prompt Engineering” turned into “Context Engineering”. Then I wrote an agent. Turns out: context engineering is a straightforwardly legible programming problem.</p>

<p>You’re allotted a fixed number of tokens in any context window. Each input you feed in, each output you save, each tool you describe, and each tool output eats tokens (that is: takes up space in the array of strings you keep to pretend you’re having a conversation with a stateless black box). Past a threshold, the whole system begins getting nondeterministically stupider. Fun!</p>

<p>No, really. Fun! You have so many options. Take “sub-agents”. People make a huge deal out of Claude Code’s sub-agents, but you can see now how trivial they are to implement: just a new context array, another <code>call</code> to the model. Give each <code>call</code> different tools. Make sub-agents talk to each other, summarize each other, collate and aggregate. Build tree structures out of them. Feed them back through the LLM to summarize them as a form of on-the-fly compression, whatever you like.</p>

<p>Your wackiest idea will probably (1)  work and (2)  take 30 minutes to code.</p>

<p>Haters, I love and have not forgotten about you. You can think all of this is ridiculous because LLMs are just stochastic parrots that hallucinate and plagiarize. But what you can’t do is make fun of “Context Engineering”. If Context Engineering was an <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" title="">Advent of Code problem</a>, it’d occur mid-December. It’s programming.</p>

<p><a href="https://xbow.com/" title="">Startups have raised tens of millions</a> building agents to look for vulnerabilities in software. I have friends doing the same thing alone in their basements. Either group could win this race.</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the OWASP Top 10.</p>
<p>I’m stuck on vulnerability scanners  because I’m a security nerd. But also because it crystallizes interesting agent design decisions. For instance: you can write a loop feeding each file in a repository to an LLM agent. Or, as we saw with the ping example, you can let the LLM agent figure out what files to look at. You can write an agent that checks a file for everything in, say, the OWASP Top 10. Or you can have specific agent loops for DOM integrity, SQL injection, and authorization checking. You can seed your agent loop with raw source content. Or you can build an agent loop that builds an index of functions across the tree.</p>

<p>You don’t know what works best until you try to write the agent.</p>

<p>I’m too spun up by this stuff, I know. But look at the tradeoff you get to make here. Some loops you write explicitly. Others are summoned from a Lovecraftian tower of inference weights. The dial is yours to turn. Make things too explicit and your agent will never surprise you, but also, it’ll never surprise you. Turn the dial to 11 and it will surprise you to death.</p>

<p>Agent designs implicate a bunch of open software engineering problems:</p>

<li>How to balance unpredictability against structured programming without killing the agent’s ability to problem-solve; in other words, titrating in just the right amount of nondeterminism.
</li><li>How best to connect agents to ground truth so they can’t lie to themselves about having solved a problem to early-exit their loops.
</li><li>How to connect agents (which, again, are really just arrays of strings with a JSON configuration blob tacked on) to do multi-stage operation, and what the most reliable intermediate forms are (JSON blobs? SQL databases? Markdown summaries) for interchange between them
</li><li>How to allocate tokens and contain costs.
</li></ul>

<p>I’m used to spaces of open engineering problems that aren’t amenable to individual noodling. Reliable multicast. Static program analysis. Post-quantum key exchange. So I’ll own it up front that I’m a bit hypnotized by open problems that, like it or not, are now central to our industry and are, simultaneously, likely to be resolved in someone’s basement. It’d be one thing if exploring these ideas required a serious commitment of time and material. But each productive iteration in designing these kinds of systems is the work of 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Get on this bike and push the pedals. Tell me you hate it afterwards, I’ll respect that. In fact, I’m psyched to hear your reasoning. But I don’t think anybody starts to understand this technology until they’ve built something with it.</p>

            <p>I hate hyperbolic news headlines about data breaches, but for the "2 Billion Email Addresses" headline to be hyperbolic, it'd need to be exaggerated or overstated - and it isn't. It's rounded up from the more precise number of 1,957,476,021 unique email addresses, but other than that, it's exactly what it sounds like. Oh - and 1.3 billion unique passwords, 625 million of which we'd never seen before either. It's the most extensive corpus of data we've ever processed, by a <em>significant</em> margin.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-synthient-threat-data/" rel="noreferrer">I wrote about the 183M unique email addresses that Synthient had indexed in their threat intelligence platform and then shared with us</a>. I explained that this was only <em>part</em> of the corpus of data they'd indexed, and that it didn't include the credential stuffing records. Stealer log data is obtained by malware running on infected machines. In contrast, credential stuffing lists usually originate from other data breaches where email addresses and passwords are exposed. They're then bundled up, sold, redistributed, and ultimately used to log in to victims' accounts. Not just the accounts they were initially breached from, either, because people reuse the same password over and over again, the data from one breach is frequently usable on completely unrelated sites. A breach of a forum to comment on cats often exposes data that can then be used to log in to the victim's shopping, social media and even email accounts. In that regard, credential stuffing data becomes "the keys to the castle".</p><p>Let me run through how we verified the data, what you can do about it and for the tech folks, some of the hoops we had to jump through to make processing this volume of data possible.</p><h2 id="data-verification">Data Verification</h2><p>The first person whose data I verified was easy - me 😔 An old email address I've had since the 90s has been in credential stuffing lists before, so it wasn't too much of a surprise. Furthermore, I found a password associated with my address, which I'd <em>definitely</em> used many eons ago, and it was about as terrible as you'd expect from that era. However, none of the other passwords associated with my address were familiar. They certainly looked like passwords that other people might have feasibly used, but I'm pretty sure they weren't mine. One was even just an IP address from Perth on the other side of the country, which is both infeasible as a password I would have used, yet eerily close to home. I mean, of all the places in the world an IP address could have appeared from, it had to be somewhere in my own country I've been many times before...</p><p>Moving on to HIBP subscribers, I reached out to a handful and asked for support verifying the data. I chose a mix of subscribers with many who'd never been involved in any data breach we'd ever seen before; my experience above suggested that there's recycled data in there, and we had previously verified that when investigating those other incidents. However, is the all-new stuff legitimate? The very first response I received was exactly what I was looking for:</p><blockquote>#1 is an old password that I don't use anymore. #2 is a more recent password. Thanks for the heads up, I've gone and changed the password for every critical account that used either one.&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Perfectly illustrating most people's behaviour with passwords, #2 referred to above was just #1 with two exclamation marks at the end!! (Incidentally, these were simple six and eight-character passwords, and neither of them was in <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Pwned Passwords</a> either.) He had three passwords in total, which also means one of them, like with my data, was not familiar. However, the most important thing here is that this example perfectly illustrates why we put the effort into processing data like this: #2 was a real, live password that this guy was actively using, and it was sitting right next to his email address, being passed around among criminals. However, through this effort, that credential pair has now become useless, which is precisely what we're aiming for with this exercise, just a couple of billion times over.</p><p>The second respondent only had one password against their address:</p><blockquote>Yes that was a password I used for many years for what I would call throw away or unimportant accounts between 20 and 10 years ago</blockquote><p>That was also only eight characters, but this time, we'd seen it in Pwned Passwords many times before. And the observation about the password's age was consistent with my own records, so there's definitely some pretty old data in there.</p><p>The following response was not at all surprising:</p><blockquote>I am familiar with that password... I used it almost 10 years ago... and cannot recall the last time I used it.</blockquote><p>That was on a corporate account, too, and the owner of the address duly forwarded my email to the cybersecurity team for further investigation. The single password associated with this lady's email address had a massive <em>nine characters</em>, and also hadn't previously appeared in Pwned Passwords.</p><p>Next up was a respondent who replied inline to my questions, so I'll list them below with the corresponding answers:</p><blockquote>Is this familiar? Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Have you ever used it in the past? Yes and is still on some accounts I do not use any longer.</blockquote><blockquote>And if so, how long ago? Unfortunately, it is still on some active accounts that I have just made a&nbsp;list of to change or close immediately.</blockquote><p>This individual's eight-character password with uppercase, lowercase, numbers and a "special" character also wasn't in Pwned Passwords. Similarly, as with the earlier response, that password was still in active use, posing a real risk to the owner. It would pass most password complexity criteria and slip through any service using Pwned Passwords to block bad ones, so again, this highlights why it was so important for us to process the data. </p><p>The next person had three different passwords against rows with their email address, and they came back with a now common response:</p><blockquote>Yes, these are familiar, last used 10 years ago</blockquote><p>We'd actually seen all three of them in Pwned Passwords before, many times each. Another respondent with precisely the kind of gamer-like passwords you'd expect a kid to use (one of which we hadn't seen before), also confirmed (I think?) their use:</p><blockquote>maybe when i was a kid lol</blockquote><p>Responses that weren't an emphatic "yes, that's my data" were scarce. The two passwords against one person's name were both in Pwned Passwords (albeit only once each), yet it's entirely possible that neither of them had been used by this specific individual before. It's also possible they'd forgotten a password they'd used more than a decade ago, or it may have even been automatically assigned to them by the service that was subsequently breached. Put it down as a statistical anomaly, but I thought it was worth mentioning to highlight that being in this data set isn't a guarantee of a genuine password of yours being exposed. If your email address is found in this corpus then that's real, of course, so there must be some truth in the data, but it's a reminder that when data is aggregated from so many different sources over such a long period of time, there's going to be some inconsistencies.</p><h2 id="searching-pwned-passwords">Searching Pwned Passwords</h2><p>As a brief recap, we load passwords into the service we call <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Pwned Passwords</a>. When we do so, there is absolutely no association between the password and the email address it appeared next to. This is for both your protection and ours; can you imagine if HIBP was pwned? It's not beyond the realm of possibility, and the impact of exposing billions of credential pairs that can immediately unlock an untold number of accounts would be catastrophic. It's highly risky, and completely unnecessary when you can search for standalone passwords anyway without creating the risk of it being linked back to someone.</p><p>Think about it: if you have a password of "Fido123!" and you find it's been previously exposed (which it has), it doesn't matter if it was exposed against your email address or someone else's; it's still a bad password because it's named after your dog followed by a very predictable pattern. If you have a genuinely <em>strong</em> password and it's in Pwned Passwords, then you can walk away with some confidence that it really was yours. Either way, you shouldn't ever use that password again anywhere, and Pwned Passwords has done its job.</p><p>Checking the service is easy, anonymous and depending on your level of technical comfort, can be done in several different ways. Here's a copy and paste from the last Synthient blog post:</p><ol><li><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Use the Pwned Passwords search page</a>. Passwords are protected with an anonymity model, so we never see them (it's processed in the browser itself), but if you're wary, just check old ones you may suspect.</li><li><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3?ref=troyhunt.com#PwnedPasswords" rel="noreferrer">Use the k-anonymity API</a>. This is what drives the page in the previous point, and if you're handy with writing code, this is an easy approach and gives you complete confidence in the anonymity aspect.</li><li><a href="https://watchtower.1password.com/?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Use 1Password's Watchtower</a>. The password manager has a built-in checker that uses the abovementioned API and can check all the passwords in your vault. (Disclosure: 1Password is a regular sponsor of this blog, and has product placement on HIBP.)</li></ol><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/10/image-9.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="855" height="537" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image-9.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/10/image-9.png 855w"></figure><p>My vested interest in 1Password aside, Watchtower is the easiest, fastest way to understand your potential exposure in this incident. And in case you're wondering why I have so many vulnerable and reused passwords, it's a combination of the test accounts I've saved over the years and the 4-digit PINs some services force you to use. Would you believe that every single 4-digit number ever has been pwned?! (If you're interested,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-01-28/almost-one-in-ten-people-use-the-same-four-digit-pin/103946842?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the ABC has a fantastic infographic using a heatmap based on HIBP data that shows some very predictable patterns for 4-digit PINs</a>.)</p><h2 id="this-is-not-a-gmail-breach">This <em>Is Not</em> a Gmail Breach</h2><p>It pains me to say it, but I have to, given the way the stealer logs made ridiculous, completely false headlines a couple of weeks ago:</p>
<!--kg-card-begin: html-->
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This story has suddenly gained *way* more traction in recent hours, and something I thought was obvious needs clarifying: this *is not* a Gmail leak, it simply has the credentials of victims infected with malware, and Gmail is the dominant email provider: <a href="https://t.co/S75hF4T1es?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/S75hF4T1es</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1982945972394320203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">October 27, 2025</a></blockquote> 
<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>There are 32 <em>million </em>different email domains in this latest corpus, of which gmail.com is one. It is, of course, the largest and has 394 million unique email addresses on it. In other words, 80% of the data in this corpus has absolutely nothing to do with Gmail, and the 20% of Gmail addresses have absolutely nothing to do with any sort of security vulnerability on Google's behalf. There - now let reporting sanity prevail!</p><h2 id="the-technical-bits">The Technical Bits</h2><p>I wanted to add this just to highlight how painful it has been to deal with this data. This corpus is nearly 3 times the size of the previous largest breach we'd loaded, and HIBP is <em>many</em> times larger than it was in 2019 when we loaded <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/Collection1?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">the Collection #1 data</a>. Taking 2 billion records and adding the ones we hadn't already seen in the existing 15 billion corpus, whilst not adversely impacting the live system serving millions of visitors a day, was <em>very</em> non-trivial. Managing the nuances of SQL Server indexes such that we could optimise both inserts and queries is not my idea of fun, and it's been a pretty hard couple of weeks if I'm honest. It's also been a very expensive period as we turned the cloud up to 11 (we run on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/service-tier-hyperscale?view=azuresql&amp;ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Azure SQL Hyperscale</a>, which we maxed out at 80 cores for almost two weeks).</p><p>A simple example of the challenge is that after loading all the email addresses up into a staging table, we needed to create SHA1 hashes of each. Normally, that would involve something to the effect of "update table set column = sha1(email)" and you're done. That crashed completely, so we ended up doing "insert into new table select email, sha1(email)". But on other occasions the breach load required us to do updates on other columns (with no hash creation), which, on mulitple occasions, we had to kill after a day or more of execution with no end in sight. So, we ended up batching in loops (usually 1M records at a time), reporting on progress along the way so we had some idea of when it would actually finish. It was a painful process of trail, waiting ages, error then taking a completely different approach.</p><p>Notifying our subscribers is another problem. We have 5.9 million of them, and 2.9 million are in this data 🫨 Simply sending that many emails at once is hard. It's not so much hard in terms of firing them off, rather it's hard in terms of not ending up on a reputation naughty list or having mail throttled by the receiving server. That's happened many times in the past when loading large, albeit much smaller corpuses; Gmail, for example, suddenly sees a massive spike and slows down the delivery to inboxes. Not such a biggy for sending breach notices, but a major problem for people trying to sign into their dashboard who can no longer receive the email with the "magic" link.</p><p>What we've done to address that for this incident is to slow down the delivery of emails for the individual breach notification. Whilst I'd originally intended to send the emails at a constant rate over the period of a week, someone listening to me on my Friday live stream had a much better suggestion:</p><blockquote>the strategy I've found to best work with large email delivery is to look at the average number of emails you've sent over the last 30 days each time you want to ramp up, and then increase that volume by around 50% per day until you've worked your way through the queue</blockquote><p>Which makes a lot of sense, and stacked up as I did more research (thanks Joe!). So, here's what our planned delivery schedule now looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/11/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="722" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/image-1.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2025/11/image-1.png 2021w"></figure><p>That's broken down by hour, increasing in volume by 1.015 times per hour, such that the emails are spread out in a similar, gradually increasing cadence. On a daily basis, that works out at a 45% increase in each 24-hour period, within Joe's suggested 50% threshold. Plus, we obviously have all the other mechanisms such as a dedicated IP, properly configured DKIM, DMARC and SPF, only emailing double-opted-in subscribers and spam-friendly message body construction. So, it could be days before you receive a notification, or just run a <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">haveibeenpwned.com</a> search on demand if you're impatient.</p><p>We've sent all the domain notification emails instantly because, by definition, they're going to a very wide range of different mail servers; it's just the individual ones we're drop-feeding.</p><p>Lastly, if you've integrated Pwned Passwords into your service, you'll now see noticeably larger response sizes. The numbers I mentioned in the opening paragraph increase the size of each hash range by an average of about 50%, which will push responses from about 26kb to 40kb. That's when brotli compressed, so obviously, make sure you're making requests that make the most of the compression.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>This data is now searchable in HIBP as the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Breach/SynthientCredentialStuffingThreatData?ref=troyhunt.com" rel="noreferrer">Synthient Credential Stuffing Threat Data</a>. It's an entirely separate corpus from that previous Synthient data I mentioned earlier; they're discrete datasets with some crossover, but obviously, this one is significantly larger. And, of course, all the passwords are now searchable per the Pwned Passwords guidance above.</p><p>If I could close with one request: this was an extremely laborious, time-consuming and expensive exercise for us to complete. We've done our best to verify the integrity of the data and make it searchable in a practical way while remaining as privacy-centric as possible. Sending as many notifications as we have will inevitably lead to a barrage of responses from people wanting access to complete rows of data, grilling us on precisely where it was obtained from or, believe it or not, outright abusing us. Not doing those things would be awesome, and I suggest instead putting the energy into getting a password manager, making passwords strong and unique (or even better, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/passkeys-for-normal-people/" rel="noreferrer">using passkeys where available</a>), and turning on multi-factor auth. That would be an awesome outcome for all 😊</p>

Their land has expanded to <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/mark-zuckerberg-palo-alto.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/mark-zuckerberg-palo-alto.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/mark-zuckerberg-palo-alto.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">include 11</a> previously separate properties, five of which are connected by at least one property line.</p><p>The Zuckerberg compound’s expansion first became a concern for Crescent Park neighbours <a data-offer-url="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/11/zuckerburg-snatches-up-pao-alto-homes-in-privacy-bid.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/11/zuckerburg-snatches-up-pao-alto-homes-in-privacy-bid.html&quot;}" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2013/10/11/zuckerburg-snatches-up-pao-alto-homes-in-privacy-bid.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">as early</a> <a data-offer-url="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/Zuckerberg-to-raze-4-houses-surrounding-Palo-Alto-7940437.php" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/Zuckerberg-to-raze-4-houses-surrounding-Palo-Alto-7940437.php&quot;}" href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/Zuckerberg-to-raze-4-houses-surrounding-Palo-Alto-7940437.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">as 2016</a>, due to fears that his purchases were driving up the market. Then, about five years later, neighbors noticed that a school appeared to be operating out of the Zuckerberg compound. This would be illegal under the area’s residential zoning code without a permit. They began a crusade to shut it down that did not end until summer 2025.</p><p>WIRED obtained 1,665 pages of documents about the neighborhood dispute—including 311 records, legal filings, construction plans, and emails—through a public record request filed to the Palo Alto Department of Planning and Development Services. (Mentions of “Zuckerberg” or “the Zuckerbergs” appear to have been redacted. However, neighbors and separate public records confirm that the property in question belongs to the family. The names of the neighbors who were in touch with the city were also redacted.)</p><p>The documents reveal that the school may have been operating as early as 2021 without a permit to operate in the city of Palo Alto. As many as 30 students might have enrolled, according to observations from neighbors. These documents also reveal a wider problem: For almost a decade, the Zuckerbergs’ neighbors have been complaining to the city about noisy construction work, the intrusive presence of private security, and the hordes of staffers and business associates causing traffic and taking up street parking.</p><p>Over time, neighbors became fed up with what they argued was the city’s lack of action, particularly with respect to the school. Some believed that the delay was because of preferential treatment to the Zuckerbergs. “We find it quite remarkable that you are working so hard to meet the needs of a single billionaire family while keeping the rest of the neighborhood in the dark,” reads one email sent to the city’s Planning and Development Services Department in February. “Just as you have not earned our trust, this property owner has broken many promises over the years, and any solution which depends on good faith behavioral changes from them is a failure from the beginning.”</p><p>Palo Alto spokesperson Meghan Horrigan-Taylor told WIRED that the city “enforces zoning, building, and life safety rules consistently, without regard to who owns a property.” She also refuted the claim that neighbors were kept in the dark, claiming that the city’s approval of construction projects at the Zuckerberg properties “were processed the same way they are for any property owner.” She added that, though some neighbors told the city they believe the Zuckerbergs received “special treatment,” that is not accurate.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Staff met with residents, conducted site visits, and provided updates by phone and email while engaging the owner’s representative to address concerns,” Horrigan-Taylor said. “These actions were measured and appropriate to abate the unpermitted use and responsive to neighborhood issues within the limits of local and state law.”</p><p>According to The New York Times, <a data-offer-url="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/zuckerberg-compound-palo-alto-school.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/zuckerberg-compound-palo-alto-school.html&quot;}" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/10/us/zuckerberg-compound-palo-alto-school.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">which first reported</a> on the school’s existence, it was called “Bicken Ben School” and shared a name with one of the Zuckerbergs’ chickens. The <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/SchoolDirectory/details?cdscode=43696416165278">listing</a> for Bicken Ben School, or BBS for short, in a California Department of Education directory claims the school opened on October 5, 2022. This, however, is the year after neighbors claim to have first seen it operating. It’s also two and a half years after Sara Berge—the school’s point of contact, per documents WIRED obtained from the state via public record request—claims to have started her role as “head of school” for a “Montessori pod” at a “private family office” according to her LinkedIn profile, which WIRED viewed in September and October. Berge did not respond to a request to comment.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2025, according to the documents Bicken Ben filed to the state, the school grew from nine to 14 students ranging from 5 to 10 years old. Neighbors, however, estimated that they observed 15 to 30 students. Berge similarly claimed on her LinkedIn profile to have overseen “25 children” in her job. In a June 2025 job <a data-offer-url="https://montessori-usa.org/job/operations-coordinator/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://montessori-usa.org/job/operations-coordinator/&quot;}" href="https://montessori-usa.org/job/operations-coordinator/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">listing</a> for “BBS,” the school had a “current enrollment of 35–40 students and plans for continued growth,” which the listing says includes a middle school.</p><p>In order for the Zuckerbergs to run a private school on their land, which is in a residential zone, they need a “conditional use” permit from the city. However, based on the documents WIRED obtained, and Palo Alto’s public <a data-offer-url="https://aca-prod.accela.com/PALOALTO/Welcome.aspx" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://aca-prod.accela.com/PALOALTO/Welcome.aspx&quot;}" href="https://aca-prod.accela.com/PALOALTO/Welcome.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">database</a> of planning applications, the Zuckerbergs do not appear to have ever applied for or received this permit.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Per emails obtained by WIRED, Palo Alto authorities told a lawyer working with the Zuckerbergs in March 2025 that the family had to shut down the school on its compound by June 30. A state directory <a href="https://www.cde.ca.gov/SchoolDirectory/details?cdscode=43696416165278">lists</a> BBS, the abbreviation for Bicken Ben School, as having operated until August 18, and three of Zuckerberg’s neighbors—who all requested anonymity due to the high-profile nature of the family—confirmed to WIRED in late September that they had not seen or heard students being dropped off and picked up on weekdays in recent weeks.</p><p>However, Zuckerberg family spokesperson Brian Baker tells WIRED that the school didn’t close, per se. It simply moved. It’s not clear where it is now located, or whether the school is operating under a different name.</p><p>In response to a detailed request for comment, Baker provided WIRED with an emailed statement on behalf of the Zuckerbergs. “Mark, Priscilla and their children have made Palo Alto their home for more than a decade,” he said. “They value being members of the community and have taken a number of steps above and beyond any local requirements to avoid disruption in the neighborhood.”</p><h2>“Serious and Untenable”</h2><p>By the fall of 2024, Zuckerberg’s neighbors were at their breaking point. At some point in mid-2024, according to an email from then mayor Greer Stone, a group of neighbors had met with Stone to air their grievances about the Zuckerberg compound and the illegal school they claimed it was operating. They didn’t arrive at an immediate resolution.</p><p>In the years prior, the city had received several rounds of complaints about the Zuckerberg compound. Complaints for the address of the school were filed to 311, the nationwide number for reporting local non-emergency issues, in February 2019, September 2021, January 2022, and April 2023. They all alleged that the property was operating illegally under city code. Both were closed by the planning department, which found no rule violations. An unknown number of additional complaints, mentioned in emails among city workers, were also made between 2020 and 2024—presumably delivered via phone calls, in person, or to city departments not included in WIRED’s public record request.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In December 2020, building inspection manager Korwyn Peck wrote to code enforcement officer Brian Reynolds about an inspection he attempted to conduct around the Zuckerberg compound, in response to several noise and traffic complaints from neighbors. He described that several men in SUVs had gathered to watch him, and a tense conversation with one of them had ensued. “This appears to be a site that we will need to pay attention to,” Peck wrote to Reynolds.</p><p>“We have all been accused of ‘not caring,’ which of course is not true,” Peck added. “It does appear, however, with the activity I observed tonight, that we are dealing with more than four simple dwellings. This appears to be more than a homeowner with a security fetish.”</p><p>In a September 11, 2024, email to Jonathan Lait, Palo Alto’s director of planning and development services and Palo Alto city attorney Molly Stump, one of Zuckerberg’s neighbors alleged that since 2021, “despite numerous neighborhood complaints” to the city of Palo Alto, including “multiple code violation reports,” the school had continued to grow. They claimed that a garage at the property had been converted into another classroom, and that an increasing number of children were arriving each day. Lait and Stump did not respond to a request to comment.</p><p>“The addition of daily traffic from the teachers and parents at the school has only exacerbated an already difficult situation,” they said in the email, noting that the neighborhood has been dealing with an “untenable traffic” situation for more than eight years.</p><p>They asked the city to conduct a formal investigation into the school on Zuckerberg’s property, adding that their neighbors are also “extremely concerned” about the school, and “are willing to provide eyewitness accounts in support of this complaint.”</p><p>Over the next week, another neighbor forwarded this note to all six Palo Alto city council members, as well as then mayor Stone. One of these emails described the situation as “serious” and “untenable.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We believe the investigation should be swift and should yield a cease and desist order,” the neighbor wrote.</p><p>Lait responded to the neighbor who sent the original complaint on October 15, claiming that he’d had an “initial call” with a “representative” of the property owners and that he was directing the city's code enforcement staff to reexamine the property.</p><p>On December 11, 2024, the neighbor claimed that since one of their fellow neighbors had spoken to a Zuckerberg representative, and the representative had allegedly admitted that there was a school on the property, “it seems like an open and shut case.”</p><p>“Our hope is that there is an equal process in place for all residents of Palo Alto regardless of wealth or stature,” the neighbor wrote. “It is hard to imagine that this kind of behavior would be ignored in any other circumstance.”</p><p>That same day, Lait told Christine Wade, a partner at SSL Law Firm—who, in an August 2024 email thread, said she was “still working with” the Zuckerberg family—that the Zuckerbergs lacked the required permit to run a school in a residential zone.</p><p>“Based on our review of local and state law, we believe this use constitutes a private school use in a residential zone requiring a conditional use permit,” Lait wrote in an email to Wade. “We also have not found any state preemptions that would exclude a use like this from local zoning requirements.” Lait added that a “next step,” if a permit was not obtained, would be sending a cease and desist to the property owner.</p><p>According to several emails, Wade, Lait, and Mark Legaspi, CEO of the Zuckerberg family office called West 10, went on to arrange an in-person meeting at City Hall on January 9. (This is the first time that the current name of the Zuckerberg family office, West 10, has been publicly disclosed. The office was <a data-offer-url="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-family-office-weststreet-misconduct-allegations-2020-2" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-family-office-weststreet-misconduct-allegations-2020-2&quot;}" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-family-office-weststreet-misconduct-allegations-2020-2" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">previously called</a> West Street.) Although WIRED did not obtain notes from the meeting, Lait informed the neighbor on January 10 that he had told the Zuckerbergs’ “representative” that the school would need to shut down if it didn’t get a conditional use permit or apply for that specific permit.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Lait added that the representative would clarify what the family planned to do in about a week; however, he noted that if the school were to close, the city may give the school a “transition period” to wind things down. Wade did not respond to a request for comment.</p><h2>“At a Minimum, Give Us Extended Breaks”</h2><p>There was another increasingly heated conversation happening behind the scenes. On February 3 of this year, at least one neighbor met with Jordan Fox, an employee of West 10.</p><p>It’s unclear exactly what happened at this meeting, or if the neighbor who sent the September 11 complaint was in attendance. But a day after the meeting with Fox, two additional neighbours added their names to the September 11 complaint, per an email to Lait.</p><p>On February 12, a neighbor began an email chain with Fox. This email was forwarded to Planning Department officials two months later. The neighbor, who seemingly attended the meeting, said they had “connected” with fellow neighbors “to review and revise” an earlier list of 14 requests that had been reportedly submitted to the Zuckerbergs at some previous point. The note does not specify the contents of this original list of requests, but of the 19 neighbors who originally contributed to it, they claimed that 15 had contributed to the revised list.</p><p>The email notes that the Zuckerbergs had been “a part of our neighborhood for many years,” and that they “hope that this message will start an open and respectful dialogue,” built upon the “premise of how we all wish to be treated as neighbors.”</p><p>“Our top requests are to minimize future disruption to the neighborhood and proactively manage the impact of the many people who are affiliated with you,” the email says. This includes restricting parking by “security guards, contractors, staff, teachers, landscapers, visitors, etc.” In the event of major demolitions, concrete pours, or large parties, the email asks for advance notice, and for dedicated efforts to “monitor and mitigate noise.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The email also asks the Zuckerbergs to, “ideally stop—but at a minimum give us extended breaks from—the acquisition, demolition and construction cycle to let the neighborhood recover from the last eight years of disruption.”</p><p>At this point, the email requests that the family “abide by both the letter and the spirit of Palo Alto” by complying with city code about residential buildings.</p><p>Specifically, it asks the Zuckerbergs to get a use permit for the compound’s school and to hold “a public hearing for transparency.” It also asks the family to not expand its compound any further. “We hope this will help us get back the quiet, attractive residential neighborhood that we all loved so much when we chose to move here.”</p><p>In a follow-up on March 4, Fox acknowledged the “unusual” effects that come with being neighbors with Mark Zuckerberg and his family.</p><p>“I recognize and understand that the nature of our residence is unique given the profile and visibility of the family,” she wrote. “I hope that as we continue to grow our relationship with you over time, you will increasingly enjoy the benefits of our proximity—e.g., enhanced safety and security, shared improvements, and increased property values.”</p><p>Fox said that the Zuckerbergs instituted “a revised parking policy late last year” that should address their concerns, and promised to double down on efforts to give advanced notice about construction, parties, and other potential disruptions.</p><p>However, Fox did not directly address the unpermitted school and other nonresidential activities happening at the compound. She acknowledged that the compound has “residential support staff” including “childcare, culinary, personal assistants, property management, and security,” but said that they have “policies in place to minimize their impact on the neighborhood.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the neighbor responded to Fox.</p><h2>“You Have Not Earned Our Trust”</h2><p>While these conversations were happening between Fox and Zuckerberg’s neighbors, Lait and others at the city Planning Department were scrambling to find a solution for the neighbor who complained on September 11, and a few other neighbors who endorsed the complaint in September and February.</p><p>Starting in February, one of these neighbors took the lead on following up with Lait. They asked him for an update on February 11, and heard back a few days later. He didn’t have any major updates, “but after conversations with the family's representatives, he said he was exploring whether a “subset of children” could continue to come to the school sometimes for "ancillary" uses.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“I also believe a more nuanced solution is warranted in this case,” Lait added. Ideally, such a solution would respond to the neighbors’ complaints, but allow the Zuckerbergs to “reasonably be authorized by the zoning code.”</p><p>The neighbor wasn’t thrilled. The next day, they replied and called the city’s plan “unsatisfactory.”</p><p>“The city's ‘nuanced solution’ in dealing with this serial violator has led to the current predicament,” they said (referring to the nuanced solution Lait mentioned in his last email.)</p><p>Horrigan-Taylor, the Palo Alto spokesperson, told WIRED that Lait’s mention of a “nuanced” solution referred to “resolving, to the extent permissible by law, neighborhood impacts and otherwise permitted use established by state law and local zoning.”</p><p>“Would I, or any other homeowner, be given the courtesy of a ‘nuanced solution’ if we were in violation of city code for over four years?” they added.</p><p>“Please know that you have not earned our trust and that we will take every opportunity to hold the city accountable if your solution satisfies a single [redacted] property owner over the interests of an entire neighborhood,” they continued.</p><p>“If you somehow craft a ‘nuanced solution’ based on promises,” the neighbor said, “the city will no doubt once again simply disappear and the damage to the neighborhood will continue.”</p><p>Lait did not respond right away. The neighbor followed up on March 13, asking if he had “reconsidered” his plan to offer a “‘nuanced solution’ for resolution of these ongoing issues by a serial code violator.” They asked when the neighborhood could “expect relief from the almost decade long disruptions.”</p><p>Behind the scenes, Zuckerberg’s lawyers were fighting to make sure the school could continue to operate. In a document dated March 14, Wade argues that she believed the activities at “the Property” “represent an appropriate residential use based on established state law as well as constitutional principles.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Wade said that “the Family” was in the process of obtaining a “Large Family Daycare” license for the property, which is legal for a cohort of 14 or fewer children all under the age of 10.</p><p>"We consistently remind our vendors, guests, etc. to minimize noise, not loiter anywhere other than within the Family properties, and to keep areas clean,” Wade added in the letter. Wade also attached an adjusted lease corresponding with the address of the illicit school, which promises that the property will be used for only one purpose. The exact purpose is redacted.</p><p>On March 25, Lait told the neighbor that the city’s June 30 deadline for the Zuckerbergs to shut down the school had not changed. However, the family’s representative said that they were pursuing a daycare license. These licenses are granted by the state, not the city of Palo Alto.</p><p>The subtext of this email was that if the state gave them a daycare licence, there wasn’t much the city could do. Horrigan-Taylor confirmed with WIRED that “state licensed large family day care homes” do not require city approval, adding that the city also “does not regulate homeschooling.”</p><p>“Thanks for this rather surprising information,” the neighbor replied about a week later. “We have repeatedly presented ideas to the family over the past 8 years with very little to show for it, so from our perspective, we need to understand the city's willingness to act or not to act.”</p><p>Baker told WIRED that the Zuckerbergs never ended up applying for a daycare license, a claim that corresponds with California’s public <a href="https://www.ccld.dss.ca.gov/carefacilitysearch/">registry</a> of daycare centers. (There are only two registered daycare centers in Palo Alto, and neither belongs to the Zuckerbergs. The Zuckerbergs’ oldest child, Maxima, will also turn 10 in December and consequently age out of any daycare legally operating in California.)</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Horrigan-Taylor said that a representative for the Zuckerbergs told the city that the family wanted to move the school to “another location where private schools are permitted by right.”</p><p>In a school administrator job listing <a data-offer-url="https://montessori-usa.org/job/school-administrator-for-traveling-homeschool/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://montessori-usa.org/job/school-administrator-for-traveling-homeschool/&quot;}" href="https://montessori-usa.org/job/school-administrator-for-traveling-homeschool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">posted</a> to the Association Montessori International website in July 2022 for “BBS,” Bicken Ben head of school Berge claims that the school had four distinct locations, and that applicants must be prepared to travel six to eight weeks per year.

It’s unclear where the other sites are located.</p><p>Most of the Zuckerbergs’ neighbors did not respond to WIRED’s request for comment. However, the ones that did clearly indicated that they would not be forgetting the Bicken Ben saga, or the past decade of disruption, anytime soon.</p><p>“Frankly I’m not sure what’s going on,” one neighbor said, when reached by WIRED via landline. “Except for noise and construction debris.”</p></div></div></article><div><div data-testid="RowWrapper" data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper"><ul><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"><p><strong>In your inbox:</strong> Will Knight's <a href="https://www.wired.com/newsletter/ai-lab?sourceCode=BottomStories">AI Lab</a> explores advances in AI</p></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li><li data-testid="LinkStackBullet"></li></ul></div><div data-testid="RowWrapper" data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper"><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/author/caroline-haskins/">Caroline Haskins</a> is a business reporter at WIRED, covering Silicon Valley, surveillance, and labor.
