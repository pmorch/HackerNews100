            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://frankzliu.com/blog/a16z-blogs-are-just-glorified-marketing">https://frankzliu.com/blog/a16z-blogs-are-just-glorified-marketing</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39901289">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h4 id="-glorified-marketing-for-portfolio-companies-that-is">… glorified marketing for portfolio companies, that is</h4>

<p>I came across one of a16z’s blog posts on Hacker News today, titled <a href="https://a16z.com/2023/06/20/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications">Emerging Architectures for LLM Applications</a>. For folks who didn’t catch it, here’s the tl;dr:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The emerging LLM stack is composed of several elements centered around data orchestration tools such as Langchain and Llamaindex. Data pipelines, embedding models, vector databases, and queries form the primary input for these orchestration tools.</li>
  <li>The stack is based on in-context learning, where off-the-shelf LLMs are used and their behavior is controlled through prompting and conditioning on contextual data.</li>
  <li>Strategies for prompting LLMs are becoming increasingly complex and are a core differentiating factor for both closed-source and open-source LLMs. Of these LLMs, strategies for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are most common, seeing as OpenAI is the current leader.</li>
  <li>AI agents - programmatic runtimes that can reason and plan - excite both developers and researchers alike, but don’t work just yet. Most agent frameworks are currently in PoC phase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I thought the article was informative, but I was surprised that the section on vector databases mentions neither <a href="https://milvus.io/">Milvus</a> nor <a href="https://zilliz.com/">Zilliz</a>, especially since Milvus was mentioned in an older <a href="https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/">a16z blog on data and ML infrastructure</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://frankzliu.com/img/emerging-architectures-vector-databases.jpg">
</p>
<p><sub>Also of note: another Zilliz project (<a href="https://github.com/zilliztech/GPTCache">GPTCache</a>) is listed in the post.</sub></p>

<p>My initial instinct was that Milvus was left off because it is part of the LF AI &amp; Data Foundation rather being a project wholly owned by Zilliz, so I left a comment on the HN post that links back to the Milvus website. I came back a couple of hours later to find an interesting take:</p>

<p><img src="https://frankzliu.com/img/emerging-architectures-comment.jpg">
</p>
<p><sub>Full disclosure: we (Zilliz) raised $103M back in 2022, and Pinecone raised $100M this April.</sub></p>

<p>Running it back in my head, I felt that SheepHerdr’s response actually made excellent sense - a16z’s ultimate goal is to generate returns for LPs, and the best way to do that is by supporting founders and propping their portfolio companies. To me, this is also unequivocally unfair to Vespa, Weaviate, etc as it delivers a subliminal message that they have no realistic long-term chance in the vector database space relative to Pinecone. This, of course, is absolute nonsense: vector databases are <em>NOT</em> a zero-sum game.</p>

<p>I dove a bit deeper and was surprised to find that this is fairly commonplace behavior for a16z as a firm:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The aforementioned article also lists Databricks in the “Data Pipelines” section, but not <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/building-data-centric-platform-ai-llm/">Snowflake</a>. There is a <a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/langchain/document_loaders/snowflake_loader.py">Snowflake loader for Langchain</a> and a guide for using <a href="https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/docs/guides/tutorials/sql_guide.md">Llamaindex with Snowflake</a>. Databricks is an a16z portfolio company.</li>
  <li><a href="https://a16z.com/2023/04/14/the-modern-transactional-stack/">The Modern Transactional Stack</a> doesn’t come close to listing all of the available data connectors. To be fair, Airbyte and Fivetran (an a16z portfolio company) are the two largest and most well-known, but to distill the entire segment to just two companies seems unfair.</li>
  <li>a16z’s crypto division has backed LayerZero, going as far as actively <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/defi/uniswap-taps-wormhole-for-bridge-to-bnb-in-defeat-for-a16z/">voting against Wormhole</a>, a LayerZero competitor. Side note: LayerZero was also featured in a16z’s <a href="https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/announcement/crypto-startup-school-2023-recap-resources/">Crypto Startup School</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just three random examples I dug out - there are probably many other examples in verticals that I am unfamiliar with.</p>

<h4 id="other-llmgenai-infrastructure-landscapes">Other LLM/GenAI Infrastructure landscapes</h4>

<p>Here’s a couple alternative landscapes that are, in my eyes, more wholly representative:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://mattturck.com/mad2023">ML/AI/Data Landscape</a> (<a href="https://mad.firstmark.com/">Interactive version</a>). Matt Turck’s MAD Landscape is arguably the most complete out there. Companies that do vector search are listed under “Infrastructure/Vector Database” and “Analytics/Enterprise Search” categories. It was released in February 2023 so it’s about 4 months old, but a good resource nonetheless.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.unusual.vc/post/ai-native-infrastructure-will-be-open">Future of AI-Native Infrastructure</a>. This one’s from Wei Lien Dang and David Hershey of Unusual Ventures. I found this pretty unique as it has a vertical for AI agents. It’s unfortunately not as complete as the MAD Landscape (missing Vespa, Vectara, etc), but still a good overview.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/llm-stack-perspective/">The New Language Model Stack</a>. Sequoia Capital’s blog post on the LLM stack is also excellent. Milvus isn’t in the diagram, but it’s mentioned in the section on vector databases.</li>
  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/YingjunWu/status/1667232357953466369/">Vector Database Landscape</a>. Yingjun Wu’s infographic is centered specifically around vector search infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h4>

<p>I have tremendous respect for a16z, a firm that helped pioneer the practice of working with and nurturing founders rather than forcing them out pre-IPO or minmaxing term sheets. Their content is also incredibly informative and valuable for understanding the nuances of building a company, from finding PMF to hiring executives. I also wholeheartedly understand a16z’s motivation for sharing knowledge and highlighting their portfolio companies, but to do so under the guise of being helpful and impartial is just plain silly. In particular, a16z’s blog post yesterday has as much to do with emerging strategies for portfolio company marketing as it does with emerging architectures for LLM applications. This practice would be somewhat analagous to Google putting paid URLs at the very top of search results without an “Ad” label. (To be clear, Google doesn’t do this.)</p>

<p>I’d like to end with some glorified marketing of my own:</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>wireproxy</code> is a completely userspace application that connects to a wireguard peer,
and exposes a socks5/http proxy or tunnels on the machine. This can be useful if you need
to connect to certain sites via a wireguard peer, but can't be bothered to setup a new network
interface for whatever reasons.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>You simply want to use wireguard as a way to proxy some traffic.</li>
<li>You don't want root permission just to change wireguard settings.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Currently, I'm running wireproxy connected to a wireguard server in another country,
and configured my browser to use wireproxy for certain sites. It's pretty useful since
wireproxy is completely isolated from my network interfaces, and I don't need root to configure
anything.</p>

            <p>Friday, March 29, 2024 </p><p>In late February 2024, after receiving a few support requests, the OWASP Foundation became aware of a misconfiguration of OWASP’s old Wiki web server, leading to a data breach involving decade+-old member resumes.</p>

<!--more-->

<ul>
  <li><strong>Who is affected?</strong> If you were an OWASP member from 2006 to around 2014 and provided your resume as part of joining OWASP, we advise assuming your resume was part of this breach.</li>
  <li><strong>What data was exposed?</strong> The resumes contained names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and other personally identifiable information.</li>
  <li><strong>Why was the data collected?</strong> OWASP collected resumes as part of the early membership process, whereby members were required in the 2006 to 2014 era to show a connection to the OWASP community. OWASP no longer collects resumes as part of the membership process.</li>
  <li><strong>What steps has OWASP taken to rectify the breach?</strong> We have disabled directory browsing, reviewed the web server and Media Wiki configuration for other security issues, removed the resumes from the wiki site altogether, and purged the CloudFlare cache to prevent further access. Lastly, we have requested that the information be removed from the Web Archive.</li>
  <li><strong>Who will OWASP notify?</strong> We are bringing this issue to the broader public’s attention with abundant caution. As many of the individuals affected by this breach are no longer with OWASP and the age of the data is between ten and 18 years old, a great deal of the personal details included in this breach are significantly out of date, making contact difficult. Regardless, we will contact the email addresses discovered during our investigations.</li>
  <li><strong>How does OWASP protect current membership data?</strong> We apply modern cloud-based security best practices such as two-factor authentication, minimal access, and resiliency to protect our membership data. We also purposefully collect only minimal information for OWASP membership to minimize any potential data loss in the future.</li>
  <li><strong>I think I am affected. What do I need to do?</strong> OWASP has already removed your information from the Internet, so no immediate action on your part is required. Nothing needs to be done if the information at risk is outdated. However, if the information is current, such as containing your mobile phone number, please take the usual precautions when answering unsolicited emails, mail, or phone calls.</li>
</ul>

<p>We recognize the significance of this breach, especially considering the OWASP Foundation’s emphasis on cybersecurity. We apologize to those affected by the breach and are committed to ensuring that this does not happen again. We are reviewing our data retention policies and will be implementing additional security measures to prevent future breaches.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://momo5502.com/posts/2024-03-31-bypassing-denuvo-in-hogwarts-legacy/">https://momo5502.com/posts/2024-03-31-bypassing-denuvo-in-hogwarts-legacy/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39898205">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I announced my Black Ops 3 integrity bypass, someone commented that my research was not impressive and I should try analyzing Denuvo instead.</p>
<p>That kinda stuck with me, so I did what everyone would do and spent the last 5 months of my life reverse engineering and bypassing the Denuvo DRM in Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
<p>I am obviously not as skilled and experienced as EMPRESS, who managed to do it within days, but that’s ok 😃</p>
<h2 id="how-does-denuvo-work">How does Denuvo work?</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://momo5502.com/posts/2024-03-31-bypassing-denuvo-in-hogwarts-legacy/images/denuvo-token.jpg" alt="">
</p>
<p>The game collects hardware/software features into a fingerprint and generates a Steam Ticket (proof of game ownership).</p>
<p>Fingerprint and Ticket are then sent to Denuvo Servers.</p>
<p>From there the Steam Ticket is sent to Steam to make sure the user really owns the game (I obviously don’t know what’s going on in their servers, so this is only an assumption, but it should be accurate enough).</p>
<p>If the user really owns the game, a Denuvo Token is generated, that only works on a PC with the exact fingerprint.</p>
<p>Using that token, the player can now run the game.</p>
<p>The game can not run without the token, as it is used to e.g. decrypt certain values at runtime and similar things.</p>
<p>Ontop of using the token to decrypt values, Denuvo regularly verifies the hardware features for the fingerprint still match with the token, at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-my-goal">What was my goal?</h2>
<p>Cracking the game was not a goal I had. I like Hogwarts Legacy and thus causing any harm is not my intention. I wanted to do research purely for myself.</p>
<p>Therefore this post is going to be intentionally vague and not going to show how I analyzed and patched the game in detail, because I don’t need anymore legal trouble than I already have.</p>
<p>The actual goal I had in mind was to find all features the game uses to derive the fingerprint and to patch them.
Ontop of that, I want to patch most of the runtime checks.</p>
<p>For a real crack, it is obviously needed to patch all of the runtime checks.
Finding all of them is still an extremely time consuming task, so everyone who has achieved that deserves my utmost respect.</p>
<p>However, I do believe that once I have patched some/most of the runtime checks and discovered all hardware features, I would be capable to patch all of them with enough time and motivation.</p>
<p>The real challenge I saw for myself was to analyze the protection to discover all the bindings it uses for the fingerprint.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-i-do-it">How did I do it?</h2>
<p>Using a Denuvo Token on a PC that has a mismatching fingerprint shows the following dialog:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://momo5502.com/posts/2024-03-31-bypassing-denuvo-in-hogwarts-legacy/images/bad-token.png" alt="">
</p>
<p>Therefore the goal is to get past that dialog.</p>
<p>This is the part I wish I could talk more about, but I don’t think that’s a good idea. Instead I will roughly scratch the surface and at least outline the tools I used.</p>
<p>To figure out what features the game collects I used the <a href="https://qiling.io/">Qiling</a> reverse engineering framework.<br>
Qiling emulates any kind of binary allowing to fully instrument it. It is truly a powerful framework:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://momo5502.com/posts/2024-03-31-bypassing-denuvo-in-hogwarts-legacy/images/qiling.png" alt="Qiling">
</p>
<p>However, it requires a whole lot of scripting and adaption. It is by far not a tool that does all the work for you out-of-the-box.</p>
<p>In fact, it even has quite a lot of bugs (e.g. wrongly emulated Windows APIs) and lacks quite a few essential features: I had to implement so many basics that I expected the framework to handle, e.g. TLS support 🥲.</p>
<p>It feels like it is mainly designed for Linux, so maybe one day I can either upstream my patches/fixes or write my own framework. Who knows.</p>
<p>But even with all these flaws, I can not stress enough how helpful of a tool it was.</p>
<p>Getting fully accomodated to Qiling and finding most of the fingerprint features took me about two months.
Discovering the last one took the remaining 3 months and I only discovered it on accident.</p>
<p>To verify that a certain feature really is part of the fingerprint, I patched/spoofed it and checked that my previously valid Denuvo Token is now invalid and shows the error dialog.</p>
<p>For most of my patches, I had to use quite a lot of runtime disassembling to dynamically build my hooks and stubs, which lead me to discover quite a few bugs in various disassemblers 😂.</p>
<p>However, as making a portable crack was not a goal, I made extensive use of my own <a href="https://github.com/momo5502/hypervisor">hypervisor</a>. I used it for example to install EPT hooks at a few locations that were otherwise too tedious to patch manually.</p>
<p>With all features at hand, I forced the game to generate a token on my PC, using a fingerprint for my PC.
Using all my patches and hooks (~2000 in total), I now wanted to run the game on my laptop using the token generated for my PC.</p>
<p>After some time, I managed to get it to run until the start screen:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://momo5502.com/posts/2024-03-31-bypassing-denuvo-in-hogwarts-legacy/images/running.png" alt="">
</p>
<p>This is the point I wanted to reach.
The game can now launch with a token issued for a different machine and I am absolutely happy.</p>
<p>The game obviously still crashes here and there with the PC token. Sometimes I can launch into the game and play, sometimes it crashes. This is where one would need to patch all runtime checks.<br>
Knowing how the game performs these, it is just a matter of time and motivation.<br>
However, as previously mentioned, this is still a huge task task to pull off, so everyone who managed to do that deserves my utmost respect.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-performance">What about performance?</h2>
<p>Everyone knows the rumors that Denuvo kills performance, but is that actually true?</p>
<p>With all hooks to disable (most) runtime validations in place, it is now time to do some performance measurements:</p>
<p>Note that this analysis only applies to Hogwarts Legacy. I don’t know if any of that applies to other games protected by Denuvo!</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JriEmiZ1t0" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Every time the console prints <code>[MOMO] OVERHEAD</code> one of my hooks triggers. This essentially means Denuvo intervenes in the execution of the game (that I had to patch). This in turn means Denuvo causes at least “some” (non-zero) performance overhead during those times.</p>
<p>One can see that Denuvo does indeed intervene from time to time, but from what it seems, it doesn’t do that very often.<br>
Only when major things happen, scene switches, loading screens or similar, the logs accumulate. Potential frame drops in those occasions don’t seem relevant to me though.</p>
<p>I was really surprised how few <code>OVERHEAD</code> lines were logged, as I expected the rumors to be true and tons of lines to be spamed, but this was not the case!</p>
<p>Of course that’s no absolute proof that Denuvo does not kill the performance. There might be interactions Denuvo does, which didn’t require a patch and thus won’t get logged.<br>
However, I wasn’t able to find any indicators of any kind of relevant performance kills caused by Denuvo that would require a more thorough analysis.<br>
I would even argue that anyone who says Denuvo kills performance hasn’t done any research to sustain their claims. (Again, only applicable to Hogwarts Legacy!)</p>
<p>It seems the protection is very well integrated into the game. Being a DRM developer myself, I know this is often a super tough challenge and definitely requires the protection to be manually integrated and adapted for the game.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This was the last thing I currently had on my bucket list and I’m so happy to cross that one off.
It is to note that Denuvo could have done things a bit differently that would have made my analysis a lot harder.<br>
However, I still have to admit that it’s an extremely strong protection. There was definitely more than one occasion when I was about to give up.
On top of its protection, it seems to be very well integrated into the game and I was not able to measure any relevant performance overheads caused by it.</p>
<p>Developing DRMs is always a super challenging task. Whether the use of DRMs is good or not, whether it feeds capitalism or just protects the hard work done by developers is something I can’t decide.
After all though, I don’t think Denuvo deserves all the hate it gets.</p>

    <p><em>Happy April 1st! This post is part of <a href="https://aprilcools.club/">April Cools Club</a>: an April 1st effort to publish genuine essays on unexpected topics. Please enjoy this true story, and rest assured that the tech content will be back soon!</em></p>
<p>That's what my dad said when I asked what was wrong with our home internet connection. "The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining."</p>
<figure>
  

  

  

  
  <img src="https://predr.ag/processed_images/wifi-router-on-balcony-cropped.74b365103ecb7814.jpg" alt="Illustration of a Wi-Fi antenna attached to the exterior of an upper floor of an apartment building. It's currently raining, and the Wi-Fi is working flawlessly.">
</figure>
<p>Let's back up a few steps, so we're all on the same page about the <em>utter ridiculousness</em> of this situation.</p>
<p>At the time, I was still a college student — this was over 10 years ago. I had come back home to spend a couple of weeks with my parents before the fall semester kicked off. I hadn't been back home in almost a full year, because home and school were on different continents.</p>
<p>My dad is an engineer who had already been tinkering with networking gear longer than I'd been alive. Through the company he started, he had designed and deployed all sorts of complex network systems at institutions across the country — everything from gigabit Ethernet for an office building, to inter-city connections over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation">line-of-sight</a> microwave links.</p>
<p>He is <em>the last person on Earth</em> who would say a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">"magical thinking"</a> phrase like that.</p>
<p>"What?" I uttered, stunned. "The Wi-Fi only works while it's raining," he repeated patiently. "It started a couple of weeks ago, and I haven't had a chance to look into it yet."</p>
<p>"No way," I said. If anything, <a href="https://www.microwave-link.com/microwave/rain-fade-on-microwave-links/">rain makes wireless signal quality <em>worse</em></a>, not <em>better</em>. Never <em>better</em>!</p>
<p>Two weeks without reliable internet? I started a speed-run through the stages of grief...</p>
<h2 id="denial">Denial</h2>
<p>I pulled open my laptop and started poking at the network.</p>
<p>Pinging any website had a 98% packet loss rate. The internet connection was still up, but only in the most annoying "technically accurate" sense. Nothing loads when you have a 98% packet loss rate! The network may as well have been dead.</p>
<p>I was upset. I had just started dating someone a few months prior, and she was currently on the other side of the planet! How was I to explain that I couldn't stay in touch because it wasn't raining?<label for="sn-mobile-internet"></label>

<span>Mobile data at the time was <em>exorbitantly</em> expensive, so much so that I didn't have a data plan at all for my cell service at home. I couldn't just use my phone's data plan to work around the problem, like one might do today in a similar situation.</span>
</p>
<p>I was pacing around the house, fuming. Grief, stage two!</p>
<p>That's when the rain started.</p>
<h2 id="bargaining">Bargaining</h2>
<p>Like a miracle, within 5 minutes of the rain starting, the packet loss rate was down to 0%!</p>
<p>I couldn't believe my eyes! I was ready for the connection to die at any second, so I opened a million tabs at once — as if I don't normally do that anyway...</p>
<p>The rain held up for about an hour, and so did the internet connection.</p>
<p>Then, 15 minutes or so after the rain stopped, the packet loss rate shot back up to 90%+. The internet connection went back to being unusable.</p>
<p>I was ready to do just about anything to get more rain.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the weather stayed grey and murky for the next few days. Each time, the pattern stayed the same:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rain starts, and not even a few minutes later the internet connection is crisp and fast.</li>
<li>The rain stops, and within 15 minutes the internet connection is unusable again.</li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I hated to admit it, the evidence was solid. The Wi-Fi only works when it's raining!</p>
<p>At this point, I had a choice to make.</p>
<p>I could keep going through the stages of grief: I could sulk and plan my calls with my girlfriend around the weather forecast.</p>
<p>Or, I could break out of that downward spiral and get to the bottom of what was going on.</p>
<p>"<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_thinking">Magical thinking</a> be damned! Am I an engineer or what?" I told myself.</p>
<p>That settled it. I wasn't going to take this lying down.</p>
<h2 id="determination">Determination</h2>
<p>Some context on our home networking setup is in order.</p>
<p>Remember how my dad's company had extensive experience with networking solutions? Well, we had a fancy networking setup at home too — and it had worked flawlessly for the best part of 10 years!</p>
<p>My dad's office had a very expensive, very fast<label for="sn-contemporaneous"></label>

<span>For the time, of course.</span>
 commercial internet connection. The home internet options, meanwhile, weren't great! In my family, we are often stubbornly against settling for less unless there's absolutely no other choice.</p>
<p>The office and our apartment were a few blocks away from each other along a small hill, with our second-floor apartment holding the higher ground. With a bit of work, my dad set up a line-of-sight Wi-Fi bridge — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_Wi-Fi">a couple of high-gain directional Wi-Fi antennas pointed at each other</a> — between the office and our apartment. This let us enjoy the faster commercial internet connection at home!</p>
<p>I started poking around the network to figure out where the connection was breaking down.</p>
<p>The local Wi-Fi router at home was working well — no packets lost. The local end of the Wi-Fi bridge was fine too.</p>
<p>But pinging the remote end of the Wi-Fi bridge was showing a 90%+ packet loss rate — and so did pinging any other network device behind it. Aha, there's something wrong with the Wi-Fi bridge!</p>
<p>But <em>what</em>? And why <em>now</em>, when the system had been working fine for almost 10 years, rain or shine?<label for="sn-work-experience"></label>

<span>Maybe <a href="https://predr.ag/blog/mediocrity-can-be-a-sign-of-excellence/#years-of-experience-vs-experience-in-those-years">years of work experience isn't a good metric</a> here either 😄</span>
</p>
<p><em>How</em> can a rain storm <em>fix</em> a Wi-Fi bridge, anyway?</p>
<p>So many confusing questions. Time to get some answers!</p>
<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>
<p>Like any experienced engineer, the first thing I tried was turning everything off and then on again. It didn't work.</p>
<p>Then I checked all the devices on the network individually:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe one of the devices has gone bad with age? Nope.<label for="sn-diagnostics"></label>

<span>I physically connected my laptop to each device's local Ethernet, then ran diagnostics, pinged the devices over the wired connection, etc.</span>
</li>
<li>Maybe a cable got unseated or came loose? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe a power brick has become faulty over time? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an automatic firmware update failed and broke something? Nope.</li>
<li>Maybe an antenna connector has corroded from spending years outdoors? Nope.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike debugging software, a lot of this hardware debugging was annoyingly <em>physical</em>. I had to climb up ladders, trace cables that hadn't been touched in 10 years, and do a lot of walking back and forth between our home and my dad's office.</p>
<p>On my umpteenth back-and-forth walk, as I was bored and exasperated, I started noticing how much our neighborhood had changed in the many years I hadn't been living at home full-time.<label for="sn-boarding-school"></label>

<span>Before college, I spent four years at a boarding high school. I was on our national math and programming teams for the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/">IMO</a> and <a href="https://ioinformatics.org/">IOI</a>), so I even spent most of each summer away from home at prep camps and at the competitions themselves.</span>
 Many of the little neighborhood shops were new. Many houses had gotten a fresh coat of paint. Trees that used to be barely more than saplings had grown tall and strong.</p>
<p>Then it hit me.</p>
<h2 id="realization">Realization</h2>
<p>I ran home and climbed up onto the scaffolding holding up the Wi-Fi bridge's antenna. I was hanging precariously off the side of our apartment building, two stories up in the air.<label for="sn-safety-harness"></label>

<span>In retrospect, a safety harness would have been a good idea... Things people do for internet! Don't forget, a girl was involved too — I wasn't doing this merely for Netflix or Twitter.</span>
</p>
<p>Then I looked downhill, at the antenna that formed the second half of the Wi-Fi bridge.</p>
<p>Or at least, <em>toward</em> the antenna, because I couldn't see it — a tree in a neighbor's yard was in the way! Its topmost branches were swaying back and forth in the line-of-sight between the antenna pair.</p>
<p><em>Bingo!</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-and-the-fix">The Problem and the Fix</h2>
<p>Here's what was going on.</p>
<p>Many years ago, we installed the Wi-Fi bridge. For a long time, everything was great!</p>
<p>But every year, our neighbor's tree grew taller and taller. Shortly before when I came back home that summer, its topmost branches had managed to reach high enough to interfere with our Wi-Fi signal.</p>
<p>It was <em>only barely</em> tall enough to interfere with the signal, though!</p>
<p>Every time it rained, the rain collected on its leaves and branches and <em>weighed them down</em>. The extra weight bent them out of the way of the Wi-Fi line-of-sight!<label for="sn-fresnel"></label>

<span>Interestingly, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation#Impairments_to_line-of-sight_propagation">objects <em>outside</em> the straight line between antennas can still cause interference</a>! For best signal quality, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_zone">Fresnel zone</a> between the antennas should be clear of obstructions. But perfection isn't achievable in practice, so RF equipment like Wi-Fi uses techniques like error-correcting codes so that it can still work without a perfectly clear Fresnel zone.</span>
</p>
<p>Each time the rain stopped, the rainwater would continue to drip off the tree. Slowly, over the course of 15ish minutes, that would unburden the tree — letting it rise back up into the path of our bits and bytes. That's when the Wi-Fi would stop working.</p>
<p>The fix was easy: upgrade our hardware. We replaced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11g-2003">our old 802.11g devices</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11n-2009">new 802.11n ones</a>, which took advantage of new <del>magic</del> math and physics to make signals more resistant to interference.<label for="sn-beamforming"></label>

<span>One such piece of magic new to 802.11n Wi-Fi is called "<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/80211ac-a-survival/9781449357702/ch04.html">beamfoming</a>" — it's when a transmitter can use multiple antennas transmitting on the same frequency to shape and steer the signal in a way that improves the effective range and signal quality. Modern Wi-Fi does beamforming with only a few antenna elements, but if we scale that number way up we get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array">a phased array antenna</a>. Ever wondered how come <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/spacex-reveals-next-gen-starlink-dish-for-residential-users">Starlink antennas are flat</a> and not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_dish#Gallery">"dish" like old satellite TV antennas</a>? They use phased arrays to aim their signal at <a href="https://www.space.com/starlink-satellite-train-how-to-see-and-track-it">the Starlink satellites streaking across the sky</a> — without any moving parts. <del>Magic!</del> Physics!</span>
</p>
<p>A few days later, the new gear arrived and I eagerly climbed back up the scaffolding to install the new antennas.</p>
<p>A few screws, zip ties, and cable connections later, the Wi-Fi's "link established" lights flashed green once again.</p>
<p>This time, <em>it wasn't raining.</em></p>
<p>All was well once again.</p>

We've fixed over a thousand bugs, added tons of new features and APIs, and now, Bun supports Windows!</p><h2 level="2" anchor-id="windows-support" id="windows-support"><a name="windows-support"></a><a href="#windows-support">Windows Support</a></h2><p>You can now run Bun on Windows 10 and later! This is a huge milestone for us, and we're excited to bring Bun to a whole new group of developers.</p><p>Bun on Windows passes <a href="https://twitter.com/bunjavascript/status/1774036956474978507">98%</a> of our own test suite for Bun on macOS and Linux. That means everything from the runtime, test runner, package manager, bundler — it all works on Windows.</p><p>To get started with Bun on Windows, run the following command in your terminal:</p><div><pre><code><span><span>&gt;</span><span> powershell </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>irm bun.sh/install.ps1 | iex</span><span>"</span></span>

When installing a Vite React App, <code>bun install</code> runs 18x faster than <code>yarn</code> and 30x faster than <code>npm</code> on Windows.</p><figure><a href="https://bun.sh/images/bun-install-on-windows.png"><img src="https://bun.sh/images/bun-install-on-windows.png" caption="Time spent installing dependencies in a vite react app using `--ignore-scripts` on Windows."></a><figcaption>Time spent installing dependencies in a vite react app using `--ignore-scripts` on Windows.</figcaption></figure><h3 level="3" anchor-id="bun-run-on-windows" id="bun-run-on-windows"><a name="bun-run-on-windows"></a><a href="#bun-run-on-windows"><code>bun run</code> on Windows</a></h3><p>You can also run scripts using <code>bun run</code>, which is a faster alternative to <code>npm run</code>. To make <code>bun run</code> even faster on Windows, we engineered a new file-format: <code>.bunx</code>.</p><p>The <code>.bunx</code> file is a cross-filesystem symlink that is able to start scripts or executables using Bun or Node.js. We decided to create this for several reasons:</p><ul><li>Symlinks are not guaranteed to work on Windows.</li><li>Shebangs at the top of a file (<code>#!/usr/bin/env bun</code>) are not read on Windows.</li><li>We want to avoid creating three permutations of each executable: <code>.cmd</code>, <code>.sh</code>, and <code>.ps1</code>.</li><li>We want to avoid confusing "Terminate batch job? (Y/n)" prompts.</li></ul><p>The end result is that <code>bun run</code> is 11x faster than <code>npm run</code>, and <code>bunx</code> is also 11x faster than <code>npx</code>.</p><figure><a href="https://bun.sh/images/bun-run-on-windows.png"><img src="https://bun.sh/images/bun-run-on-windows.png" caption="Time spent running `bunx cowsay` vs `npx cowsay` on Windows."></a><figcaption>Time spent running `bunx cowsay` vs `npx cowsay` on Windows.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if you only use Bun as a package manager and not a runtime, <code>.bunx</code> just works with Node.js.

<span><span>});</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre></div><p>Different platforms also have different shells, each with slightly different syntax rules, behavior, and even commands. For example, if you want to run a shell script using <code>cmd</code> on Windows:</p><ul><li><code>rm -rf</code> doesn't work.</li><li><code>FOO=bar &lt;command&gt;</code> doesn't work.</li><li><code>which</code> doesn't exist. (it's called <code>where</code> instead)</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/shell">Bun Shell</a> is a lexer, parser, and interpreter that implements a bash-like programming language, along with a selection of core utilities like <code>ls</code>, <code>rm</code>, and <code>cat</code>.</p><p>The shell can also be run from JavaScript and TypeScript, using the <code>Bun.$</code> API.</p><div><pre><code><span><span>import</span><span> { $ } </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>bun</span><span>"</span><span>;</span></span>

<span></span></code></pre></div><p>The syntax makes it easy to pass arguments, buffers, and pipes between the shell and JavaScript.</p><div><pre><code><span><span>const</span><span> response </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> </span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>https://example.com/</span><span>"</span><span>);</span></span>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	    <div>
	  		<p>Electrical baby toys are interesting to disassemble and look at how it’s made. Not up to the point of screwing out the PCB, decapping the chips and trying to reverse-engineer the ROM—I’m sure that’s interesting too—but just on a basic mechanical level. Companies like VTech and Clementoni apply simple but clever techniques for their systems to provide just enough variation while keeping the production costs low.</p>
<p>Consider the Baby Clementoni puzzle farmer themed laying board game. The board is divided into four sections, where our toddler can place three plastic blocks in their correct respective place in and around the farm. It’s just the plastic mold that keeps the puzzle pieces in place. But these pieces can also be inserted into the central mechanism that’ll emit a charming sound, identifying the piece: if our daughter manages to insert the cat piece, it’ll say <em>miauw</em>, and if that was the bird, you’ll hear chirping. How does it do that?</p>
<figure>

		<img src="https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/04/clementoni.jpg" loading="lazy" title="The Clementoni puzzle board, with four buttons clearly visible in the orange part in the center. Note the recesses in the plastic pieces." data-pagefind-index-attrs="title">
	</a>
	
		<figcaption>The Clementoni puzzle board, with four buttons clearly visible in the orange part in the center. Note the recesses in the plastic pieces.</figcaption>
	
</figure>

<p>The central system simply registers switch presses. It comes with 4 small switches, and the bottom size of the plastic puzzle pieces are cut out in a way that it’ll press a certain combination of those switches. That means there are <code>2^4</code> or 16 possible combinations. But wait! There are only 12 puzzle pieces. Does that mean you can buy an expansion? We categorized each puzzle number and came to the conclusion that there are three unregistered binary combinations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Binary</th>
<th>Puzzle Piece</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>1100</code></td>
<td>Cow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1011</code></td>
<td>Rabbit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0010</code></td>
<td>Cat</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0100</code></td>
<td>Rooster</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1110</code></td>
<td>Frog</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0101</code></td>
<td>Chicken</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0110</code></td>
<td>Horse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1000</code></td>
<td>Farmer</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>1010</code></td>
<td>Sheep</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0011</code></td>
<td>Bird</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0111</code></td>
<td>Duck</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>0001</code></td>
<td>Dog</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Then there’s of course <code>0000</code> which shouldn’t trigger any sound since it’s the default state, meaning we’re left with <code>1111</code>, <code>1001</code>, and <code>1101</code> as unassigned ones. Would pressing that combination of switches crash the whole thing? Nope! Clementoni’s engineers were smart enough to “catch” that error: triggering one of the unknown states by forcing a combination with your fingers emits a bloop followed by a voice saying “uh-oh!”. It made me laugh—good catch indeed!</p>
<p>You have to design these things a bit more robust: a baby or toddler mashing in plastic pieces without care in practice means our cow regularly sounds like the rooster, and our dog like the chicken: sometimes, the switches are stuck, and sometimes, the plastic pieces trigger <code>1</code>s next to the ones they’re supposed to trigger. In that case, having a fail-safe “uh-oh” seems like a good idea.</p>
<p>VTech uses this unique-combination-of-trigger mechanism in many of their products: on their <a href="https://www.vtechnl.com/onze-merken/zoef-zoef-dieren">Zoef Zoef Dieren</a> animals, cars, and water amusement park. That last one is more interesting, as the figures are round, meaning the plastic notches at the bottom pressing the buttons to identify the figurine have to take rotation into account. A <code>010010</code> and a <code>100100</code> and a <code>001001</code> produces different numbers (18, 36, 9), but it’s the same little hippo.</p>
<figure>

		<figcaption>The VTech water fun play center, with two figurines upside-down (left; green) and three figurines on the right. Note the switches in the orange round section on the lower left that identify these pieces.</figcaption>
	
</figure>

<p>Bit rotation can be implemented using a combination of bit shifting and or operations, and on a hardware level, with different locical XOR ports. That’s of course just one way, and you still need a way to identify the number without confusing it with another figure. Although I don’t think that last was implemented: if you select your starting bits in a smart way, there won’t be any overlap. The identification system here uses 14 bits, and all of the figures have either 6 or 7 <code>1</code>s, making it even possible to completely ignore bit rotation and just rely on the relative position of the enabled bits to do the identification. I’m of course merely guessing at this point.</p>
<p>The VTech animals of the zoo and farm emit a different sound based on the position where you put them in the zoo/farm. For example, before their feed tray, on the track itself, small plastic notches again press on the switches below the animals on wheels, triggering the correct “I love corn, yummy!” reaction.</p>
<p>Until you go off track, or the track breaks, that is.</p>
<p>So what happens when you press an unknown combination of buttons on VTech toys? Unfortunately, nothing. What a letdown and missed opportunity! Instead of putting in an easter egg like the Clementoni puzzle board, the VTech <em>Zoef Zoef</em> animals, <em>Toet Toet</em> cars, steam train blocks, and wobbly water fun figurines all go silent. Italian versus Chinese humor, perhaps?</p>
<p>That said, this article proves we have way too many battery-powered toys that make noise…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    
    

    <div>
  

<p><em>It’s <a href="https://www.aprilcools.club/">April Cools</a>! It’s like April Fools, except instead of cringe comedy you make genuine content that’s different what you usually do. For example, last year I talked about <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/weird-things-you-can-buy/">the strangest markets on the internet</a>. This year I went down a different rabbit hole.</em></p>

<p>Daniel has been a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/top5names.html">top 5 baby name twice since 2000</a>. There are <a href="https://www.mynamestats.com/First-Names/D/DA/DANIEL/index.html">over 1.5 million Daniels</a>  in the United States (and almost 100,000 last-name Danielses). There are who knows how many Dans, Dannies, and Daniellas out there. “Daniel” is, by any way you slice it, a very modern name.</p>

<p>It may be the oldest attested name in common use.</p>

<hr>

<p>Last year was Chicago’s last <a href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2023/10/23/why-is-the-newberry-library-ending-its-popular-book-fair/">Newberry Library book sale</a>. Part of my haul was several collections of ancient literature:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/books.jpg" alt="Three books, two on Egypt, one on near-east"></p>

<p>I’m interested in ancient history, which shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody who reads this blog. And I love how their literature reflects the modern human experience. Take this lament carved in a pyramid from the Egyptian Middle Kingdom:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have heard the words of Imohotep and Hardedef \ Whose sayings are recited whole. \ What of their places?</p>

<p>Their walls have crumbled, \ Their places are gone, \ As though they had never been! (<a href="https://archive.org/details/MiriamLichtheimAncientEgyptianLiteratureVolI">pg 196</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This anonymous poet, writing 4500 years ago, shares our fears about losing our past and of our memories being forgotten. Beautiful.</p>

<p>But I found something far more relevant in the Mesopotamian literature.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/books2-crop.jpg" alt=""></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Straightway Daniel the Raphaman … gives oblations to the gods to eat (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ancient-Near-East-Anthology-Pictures/dp/0691002002">pg 118</a>)</p>

<p><strong>Daniel</strong> the Raphaman</p>

<p><strong>DANIEL</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The story comes from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tale_of_Aqhat">Tale of Aqhat</a>, pulled out of the ruins of a forgotten city, estimated to approximately 1350 BCE. That’s a hundred years older than the oldest known <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_bone_script">Chinese writing</a>, one <em>thousand</em> years older than the book of Daniel, and thirty-four hundred years before today. I needed to know if this was the <em>same</em> name, transmitted across cultures, stretching 3400 years of unbroken “Daniels” to our modern day. Is this where “Daniel” comes from, or is just a strange coincidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A historian of the modern world has to learn how to sip from a firehose of evidence, while the historian of the ancient world must learn how to find water in the desert. — <a href="https://acoup.blog/2021/03/26/fireside-friday-march-26-2021-on-the-nature-of-ancient-evidence/">Bret Devereaux</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve done some historical work before, but all of it was in software, a “history of the modern world”. I decided to try anyway. This is what I’ve put together from reading books and trawling JSTOR.<sup id="fnref:JSTOR"><a href="#fn:JSTOR">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This is the tale of Daniel.</p>

<h3 id="ugarit">Ugarit</h3>

<p>Obviously, finding an unbroken lineage of specific Daniels across three millennia is impossible. Instead, I want to learn if the name was in the “cultural consciousness”. If so, we can be modestly confident that <em>real people</em> are getting named Daniel, like how real people are being named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleesi_%28given_name%29">Khaleesi</a> today.</p>

<p>So let’s start with where the name was first found. <strong>Ugarit</strong> was a port city of the shores of Ras Shamra, unknown until 1928. Scholars believe that it was a city of roughly 8,000 people and the capitol of a kingdom of 20,000 (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/43303580">ref</a>). While never a great power, Ugarit was <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2npq9cv.12?seq=4">a fairly “literate” society</a>  and had <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv2npq9cv.5?seq=18">extensive trade relations</a> with all of the regional powers.</p>

<p>Along with a trove of archaeological material (pots and doodads), excavators also found large collections of clay tablets. Like with many Bronze Age civilizations, most of these recovered documents are either religious, diplomatic, or administrative. That’s because clay tablets are expensive and only reserved for important matters. Most of these were dated to very approximately 1500-1200 BCE.</p>

<p>But also in that collection, we found three piece of literature. The first, the Baal Cycle, tells of how Baal Hadad became one of the great gods of the Ugaritic pantheon. The second, the Legend of Keret, probably matters a lot to another person chasing a completely different white whale, but doesn’t matter to me. The final one, the one that started this obsession of mine, is the Tale of Aqhat.</p>

<p>I found this picture in the <a href="https://digitallibrary.usc.edu/CS.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;VBID=2A3BXZ8ODTDTD&amp;PN=1&amp;WS=SearchResults#/SearchResult&amp;VBID=2A3BXZ79NBNBN&amp;PN=1&amp;WS=SearchResults">InscriptiFact collection</a>. Sadly no digital transcription! It tells of the story of the great hero Aqhat, who was loved and murdered by the goddess Anath. But I don’t actually care about any of that, I’m only after the Daniel. I’m <em>pretty sure</em> this is Daniel’s name:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/tale-of-daniel/img/daniel-zoom-markup.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I have a few friends who can read cuneiform, so I asked if any understood this text. I found out 1) that’s like asking a person who “can read ASCII” if they can understand Spanish, and 2) this is <em>not actually</em> cuneiform. It’s just an alphabet that <em>looks</em> like cuneiform.</p>

</center>


<p>Aqhat’s father is 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍. Left to right: D, N, ‘I, L. “Judged by El”, El being the chief God in the Ugaritic pantheon.</p>

<p>The name <em>could</em> be older than this text, since most early written myths were first oral traditions. This is just the first time the name “Daniel” is attested. The name <em>could</em> also be a lot younger, at least the modern name. The old name could just be an unusual coincidence, like how people in both England and China have the last name “Lee”.<sup id="fnref:China"><a href="#fn:China">2</a></sup> For “Daniel” to be that old, it’s not enough for the Ugarits to have had the name, it has to <em>come from</em> them, in a chain of Daniels reaching into present.</p>

<p>And here we run into a problem. We know roughly how old the tablets are because we know roughly when the city collapsed. By cross-referencing names of Egyptian rulers that appear in Ugarit tablets with the much better preserved Egyptian corpus, historians estimate that the city collapsed around 1190 BCE. This corresponds with the “Bronze Age Collapse”, a cataclysmic era where dozens of cities and kingdoms in the region are turned to ruins. Scholars still don’t have a clear picture why.</p>

<p>Regardless of the <em>why</em>, the Ugarites disappeared from history. The name Daniel would have to be carried by a new generation.</p>

<p>But this is also where the chain breaks.</p>

<h3 id="phoenicia">Phoenicia</h3>

<p>The Ras Shamra find was a one-in-a-million miracle, an enormous corpus of about 40,000 words, roughly as much as one Harlequin romance novel. After that? Well, here’s the <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad_Statue">Hadad Statue</a>:</p>

<center>

</figure>
</center>


<p>If you look closely, you can see the bottom is covered in faint writing. The language is “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samalian_language">Samalian</a>”, one of the many languages in the region. The engraving is roughly 400 words long and represents <em>over half of all Samalian.</em> This essay is four times longer than the Samalian corpus.</p>

<p>So what happened? It’s easy to imagine the Bronze Age Collapse turning the broader region into a Stone Age wasteland, but the archaeological evidence suggests the opposite. Rather, it points to a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3632872">rapid economic recovery of the region</a>, with new kingdoms soon establishing a large number of seafaring trade routes. Eventually they’d come in contact with the Greeks, who’d call all of the many distinct groups “Phoenicians”.</p>

<p>But we know so little of what the “Phoenicians” (in all their languages) wrote because of <em>how</em> they wrote it. Instead of Ugarit’s clay tablets, the Phoenicians used papyrus. Papyrus is lighter and cheaper, but also rots after a few decades. The fragments of text we do have— with one big exception— are engravings.<sup id="fnref:preservation"><a href="#fn:preservation">3</a></sup> Inscriptions on tombs, statues, weapons, etc. This is a major problem for historians, but an even bigger problem for <em>me</em>, because it makes the question of Daniel impossible to answer.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, we can look for clues that the same stories persisted, even if we don’t have concrete evidence. Let’s start with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadad_Statue#Text">first two lines</a> of the Hadad statue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>𐤀𐤍𐤊 𐤐𐤍𐤌𐤅 · 𐤁𐤓 · 𐤒𐤓𐤋 · 𐤌𐤋𐤊 · 𐤉𐤀𐤃𐤉 · 𐤆𐤉 · 𐤄𐤒𐤌𐤕 · 𐤍𐤑𐤁 · 𐤆𐤍 · 𐤋𐤄𐤃𐤃 · 𐤁𐤏𐤋𐤌𐤉‎· 𐤒𐤌𐤅 · 𐤏𐤌𐤉̇ ·· 𐤀̇𐤋𐤄𐤅 ·· 𐤄𐤃𐤃 · 𐤅𐤀𐤋 · 𐤅𐤓𐤔𐤐 · 𐤅𐤓𐤊𐤁𐤀𐤋 · 𐤅𐤔𐤌𐤔 · 𐤅𐤍𐤕𐤍 · 𐤁𐤉𐤃𐤉</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the “Phoenician alphabet”—the same one that inspired the Greek alphabet— which many distinct cultures in the region used for their own languages. Unlike Ugaritic, it’s read right-to-left. Scholars don’t think this alphabet descended from Ugaritic, but the two writing systems are closely related: the same sounds appear in roughly the same places in the alphabet.<sup id="fnref:order"><a href="#fn:order">4</a></sup> Here’s the translation (from wiki):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am Panamuwa, son of Qarli, king of Y’DY, who have erected this statue for Hadad in my eternal abode (burial chamber). The gods Hadad and El and Rašap and Rākib-El and Šamaš supported me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same gods, El and Baal Hadad, are important gods in the Ugarit corpus! And this is coming four hundred years after the fall of Ugarit. It suggests the Baal Hadad and El weren’t local gods to the Ugarits, but regional gods, part of a shared culture. The tale of Aqhat could have been preserved as a literary tradition, just on sources we don’t have anymore. And with Aqhat comes his dad(niel).</p>

<p>To get out of the Daniel dark ages, we have to look at a different inscription found 600 miles away.</p>

<p>Like the Hadad statue, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele">Misha Stele</a> is one of our only sources on a long-dead language. In this case, Moabite. It’s a distinct language from Samalian but this uses the same Phoenician alphabet. Here’s a sample (also from wiki):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have built its gates and I have built its towers. I have built the palace of the king, and I made the prisons for the criminals within the wall. And there were no wells in the interior of the wall in Karchah. And I said to all the people, ‘Make you every man a well in his house.’ And I dug the ditch for Karchah with the chosen men of Israel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="israel">Israel?</h3>

<p>Yes, Israel.</p>

<p>The Greeks called this region Phoenicia, but the locals always called it <em>Canaan</em>. The same “Canaan” from the Bible. The Israelites were a Canaanite population with Canaanite religions: Israel literally means <a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/jacob-is-renamed-israel-twice-why-does-the-name-jacob-remain">One who fought El</a>. Slowly, over years and centuries, they developed their own ethnic identity. At some point, there were two Israelite kingdoms: the kingdom of Israel/Samaria in the north and the kingdom of Judah (where we get “Jew”) in the south.</p>

<p>The Torah, or “Old Testament”, is a 300,000 word corpus of ancient Hebrew, chronicling the stories, religious practices, and history (mythic and attested) of the Jews.<sup id="fnref:orthodox"><a href="#fn:orthodox">6</a></sup> It’s the reason we can decipher the scant inscriptions of other Canaanite languages like Moabite, Samalian, and <a href="https://forward.com/culture/182321/cracking-the-ugaritic-code/">even Ugaritic itself</a>!</p>

<p>And it’s where the tale of Daniel continues.</p>

<h3 id="judah">Judah</h3>

<p>Quick recap on Daniel so far: we know the Ugarites wrote about a son of Daniel, the Canaanites (nee Phoenicians) shared a culture with the Ugarites, and the Israelites shared a culture with the Canaanites.</p>

<p>In 600 BCE, the Neo-Babylonian empire conquered Judah, which leads to the sixty year “Babylonian exile” of Jews from Canaan. It’s <em>allegedly</em> during this time that we get the collection of prophecies known as the “Book of Ezekiel”.<sup id="fnref:Ezekiel"><a href="#fn:Ezekiel">7</a></sup> Mostly it’s about how the Jews lost the favor of God and will one day earn it back, and with it redemption.</p>

<p>Far, <strong>far</strong> more importantly, it marks the triumphant return of Daniel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Son of man, if a land sins against Me by trespassing grievously, I shall stretch forth My hand upon it and break its staff of bread, and I shall send famine upon it and cut off from it both man and beast. Now should these three men be in its midst- Noah, <strong>Daniel</strong>, and Job-they would save themselves with their righteousness, says the Lord God.<sup id="fnref:translations"><a href="#fn:translations">8</a></sup> — Ezekiel 14:13-14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Daniel is written (דנאל). As a distant descendent of Phoenician, Hebrew reads right-to-left: Daled, Nun, Aleph, Lamed. “God judged me.” Same meaning as the Ugaritic name, same letters as 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍.</p>

<p>I’m amazed that the same meaning can be preserved across so many centuries. But I also want to be as thorough as possible. Two names, eight hundred years apart, with the same meaning, is still not enough for me. I still worry that it could just be an enormous coincidence that two cultures in the same region, speaking sister languages, came up with the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomastics">name-meaning</a>.</p>

<p>Ezekiel provides the missing link. In the Torah, both Noah and Job are treated as pious men, but critically, <em>neither are Israelites</em>.<sup id="fnref:job"><a href="#fn:job">9</a></sup> Making Daniel part of the trio implies he was also a righteous non-Jew.</p>

<p>Ezekiel would expect people would know who “Daniel” was if he used that name. This would make sense if Daniel was, say, a righteous figure in the broader Canaanite folklore. At least the Tale of Aqhat implies he was a righteous and just man who was worthy of El’s blessing. He prayed for a son and his wish was granted. He’d be a distinct character, a known righteous non-Israelite, which Ezekiel used as a point of reference.</p>

<p>A tenuous chain, I know, but enough to persuade me at least. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1517522">Enough to persuade other scholars too</a>. It may be the best we’ll ever do.</p>

<p>We can finally use the Bible to establish that Daniel wasn’t just a folkloric name, but a name people actually used. From the Book of Ezra:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And these are the heads of their father’s houses and the lineage of those who ascended with me in the kingdom of King Artaxerxes from Babylon. Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar, <strong>Daniel</strong>; of the sons of David, Hattush. — Ezra 8:1-2</p>

<p>And these were the sons of David who were born to him in Hebron: the firstborn, Amnon, to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second, <strong>Daniel</strong>, to Abigail the Carmelitess. — Chronicles 3:1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If they’re using Daniel as the name of a minor son of a minor figure, it’s probably a real name.</p>

<h3 id="the-false-daniel">The False Daniel</h3>

<p>But now we have a problem.</p>

<p>The Ezekiel Daniel has four letters. But all of the later Daniels have <em>five</em>: Daled, Nun, <em>Yud</em>, Aleph, Lamed (דניאל) .</p>

<p>It’s still possible to read the four-letter version as “Daniel” but it’s more likely to be “Danel” or “Danil”. And, Ezekiel’s Daniel being closest to the Ugaritic DN’IL, suggests that DN’IL was <em>also</em> “Danel”. That’s how most modern scholars now transliterate the name.</p>

<p>So yes, I may have been chasing a false Daniel this whole time. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LMr5XTgeyI">Theophanu is not Tiffany</a>, after all. Maybe “Daniel” is <em>at best</em> attested from 600 BCE, putting it in contention with things like Debrah and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty">Zhou</a>. There is a <em>tradition</em> to pronounce the Ezekiel DN’IL as “Daniel”, so it could be the actual pronunciation and the Yud was added later. I don’t know when the tradition started, though. At the very least, this strengthens the connection between Ezekiel’s דנאל and the Ugarite’s 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍: Ezekiel was working off a different name than the rest of the Torah authors.</p>

<p>Then again, maybe this is all just quibbling over specifics. The Latin alphabet wasn’t meant for Canaanite names, and the Hebrew alphabet wasn’t meant for Ugaritic ones. The Biblical שרה could be Romanized as “Sarah” or “Sara”, חנכה could be Hannukah, Channuka, or Chanukah. Maybe it doesn’t matter whether 𐎄𐎐𐎛𐎍  is דניאל or Danel or דנאל or Daniel. It’s still the same name.</p>

<p>Regardless, we’re following a chain, and there’s still one more link.</p>

<h3 id="from-daniel-to-today">From Daniel to Today</h3>

<p>There’s one last question here: lots of people use Torah names, like Sarah and Benjamin and David. But many Torah names, like Tamar and Yehuda and Hillel, are only used by Jews. Why is Daniel in the former group and not the latter?</p>

<p>I’d speculate that the difference is how likely it is for a <em>Christian</em> reader to encounter the name. “Adam” appears in the first book of Genesis, while Shamgar is a minor figure in the book of Judges. Christians would most likely encounter names that appear either really early, have entertaining stories, or are directly relevant to the New Testament.</p>

<p>And here’s where we finally get to the last link between then and now: the Book of Daniel. Like the Book of Ezekiel, this recounts the story of someone living during the Babylonian exile. <em>Unlike</em> Ezekiel, it was pretty clearly <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3209969">written four hundred years after</a> the exile. Daniel contains an awful lot of prophecies that <a href="https://www.thetorah.com/article/chanukah-daniel-11-and-the-rabbis-limited-knowledge-of-history">seem <em>very</em> relevant to the Greek occupation</a> (the one that leads to the story of Channukah).  The most famous of them is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy_of_Seventy_Weeks">prophecy of 70 weeks</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you shall know and understand that from the emergence of the word to restore and to rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed king [shall be] seven weeks, and [for] sixty-two weeks it will return and be built street and moat, but in troubled times. — Daniel 9:25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later writers took this to be a prophecy about <em>Jesus</em>. I don’t admit to understand <em>how</em> it’s supposed to be about Jesus, but it is. So the book of Daniel is really important in Christian thought. This kept  the name “Daniel” in the Christian mainstream for the next 2000 years, carrying it across the world to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gabriel_Fahrenheit">Europe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniyal_Mirza">India</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Nushiro">East Asia</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Paiola">South America</a>, all the way to the present daytoday. The end of a 3400 year chain.</p>

<hr>

<p>So that’s the story of the name of Daniel, from an ancient clay tablet to the millions of Daniels alive now.</p>

<p>I want to reiterate that <strong>I’m not a trained historian</strong> and almost certainly got a lot of details wrong. Also, this isn’t and wouldn’t pass peer review. Don’t cite this for a class paper. Happy April Cools!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Scientists at a recently opened cancer institute at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/cambridge" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cambridge</a> University have begun work that is pinpointing changes in cells many years before they develop into tumours. The research should help design radically new ways to treat cancer, they say.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.earlycancer.cam.ac.uk/" data-link-name="in body link">Early Cancer Institute</a> – which has just received £11m from an anonymous donor – is focused on finding ways to tackle tumours before they produce symptoms. The research will exploit recent discoveries which have shown that many people develop precancerous conditions that lie in abeyance for long periods.</p><p>“The latency for a cancer to develop can go on for years, sometimes for a decade or two, before the condition abruptly manifests itself to patients,” said Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald, the institute’s director.</p><p>“Then doctors find they are struggling to treat a tumour which, by then, has spread through a patient’s body. We need a different approach, one that can detect a person at risk of cancer early on using tests that can be given to large numbers of people.”</p><p>One example of this is the <a href="https://www.nhsinform.scot/tests-and-treatments/non-surgical-procedures/cytosponge/" data-link-name="in body link">cytosponge</a> – a sponge on a string – which has been developed by Fitzgerald and her team. It is swallowed like a pill, expands in the stomach into a sponge and is then pulled up the gullet collecting oesophagus cells on the way. Those cells that contain a protein, called TFF3 – which is found only in precancerous cells – then provide an early warning that a patient is at risk of oesophageal cancer and needs to be monitored. Crucially, this test can be administered simply and on a wide scale.</p><p>This contrasts with current approaches to other cancers, added Fitzgerald. “At present, we are detecting many cancers late and are having to come up with medicines, which have become incrementally more expensive. We are often extending life by a few weeks at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds. We need to look at this from a different perspective.”</p><p>One approach being taken by the institute – which is to be renamed the Li Ka-shing Early <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Cancer</a> Institute after the Hong Kong philanthropist who has supported other Cambridge cancer research – focuses on blood samples. Provided by women as part of past screening services for ovarian cancer and kept in special stores, these samples have now been repurposed by the institute. “We have around 200,000 such samples and they are a goldmine,” said Jamie Blundell, a research group leader at the institute.</p><p>Using these samples, researchers have identified changes that differentiate those donors who have subsequently been diagnosed with a blood cancer 10 or even 20 years after they provided samples, with those who did not develop such conditions.</p><p>“We are finding that there are clear genetic changes in a person’s blood more than a decade before they start to display symptoms of leukaemia,” said Blundell. “That shows there is a long window of opportunity that you could use to intervene and give treatments that will reduce the odds of going on to get cancer.”</p><p>Cancers grow in stages and by spotting those with cells that have taken an early step on this ladder, it should be possible to block or hamper further developments. The crucial point is that at this early stage there is time for doctors to take action and avoid them having to deal with a cancer at a late stage when it has spread.</p><p>A similar strategy is being taken by Harveer Dev, another group leader, who has investigated men who have had their prostates removed. His team are now developing biomarkers that will provide better ways to pinpoint those who are likely to suffer poor outcomes from prostate cancer, one of the most common tumours in the UK.</p><p>“Our pilot data suggests that these tests may be much better than existing PSA tests and will be crucial in spotting those who with prostate cancer that is likely to progress,” said Dev.</p><p>Pinpointing those at risk of cancer – for example, people from families who have an inherited predisposition to tumours – will form a key part of the institute’s strategy. In addition, it will focus on finding ways to reduce cancer risks, as well as ensuring treatments can be widely administered.</p><p>A woman had, in her 80s, decided to leave the university £1m for cancer research, Fitzgerald said. “However, she lived until she was over 100 and only died recently, so we only just got that donation. We want to understand what makes some live into very old age while others get cancer, so more people can live as long as she did.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

It’s the fundamental industry on which everything else is built. We take it for granted. In 1989, 35% of the entire software industry was manufacturing systems. Back then, services, hand holding, customization, and consulting were necessary to get the systems to where they are today. What was the first massive burst in productivity from technology has stagnated into incremental diminishing returns and exponentially increasing complexity. We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses. "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." Manufacturing is important. We must deliver a touch of technological genius to reintroduce simplicity, efficiency, and integration.

But to build something like Github, we had to build languages, version control, IDEs, and infrastructure for contracts and financial models (the backbones of every asset class in finance) to make them computable and connectable.</p><p>I've been building Phosphor for over three years as both CEO and CTO. As we've really honed in on what we're doing as a business, how/where we innovate, etc, I need someone experienced to take the reins and help me grow this company into the ridiculous opportunity it represents.</p><p>You might be a fit if:
- You're demonstrably obsessed with HCI and end-user computing
- You’ve lost sleep thinking about knowledge abstraction problems
- You’ve built CRDTs and collaborative applications for fun
- You're design-oriented, but as speed is a UX problem, you’ve learned systems languages
- You’re excited by the emergence that occurs when AI is applied against observable systems
- You're excited to 
- You’re a polyglot, and maybe frustrated that functional languages aren’t the norm
- You have an expansive model of the world, and the idea of consolidating these skills to create extraordinary real-world impact excites you
- You're deeply technical, but have also built capable teams</p><p>What you’ll do:
- Build one of the most unique products in finance
- Inherit a three year old, thoughtfully architected, event-driven application with only minor tech debt
- Build a 5-10 person engineering team
- Kick off/manage all of the bits and pieces that go into such a ridiculous endeavor</p><p>This is a very hard technical problem at every level (low level up through design) which we've made extraordinary progress towards.</p><p>We have traction and investment from leaders in clean energy finance (where I built one of the leading solar platforms as first hire), real estate, and more.</p><p>To apply, email oliver@phosphor.co with "CTO position" in the title. Include a PDF of your resume, links to LinkedIn/GH, and lay some bullets that point to awesome you've done or built before that match the bits and pieces of the "You might be a fit if" section.</p><p>Cheers.

About me: I'm a versatile and adaptable software developer with a long experience building back-end systems, mostly for Web apps (e.g. API, SaaS, etc). In recent years I've also picked up some valuable front-end skills working with Vue.js. I believe that much of my experience is transferable to new paradigms, if need be. I can adapt to various team dynamics and development philosophies, but I tend to thrive in environments that encourage developers to be autonomous, exert judgment, and be responsible.<p>I'm looking forward to hear about you and your project.</p><pre><code>  Email address:

As a Senior Full-stack engineer with over 7 years of experience, I have contributed to many stages of startups. I'm not one of the programmers who just use the wrong tool with high enthusiasm and a lack of knowledge, or at least I try not to be.<p>I love problem-solving for given situations, including designing clean, scalable, and efficient architecture. My primary focus is on how to deliver products fast with an acceptable standard, and this gives me dopamine. I build things as simply as possible in the early stage for higher productivity, and I don't do over-engineering.</p><p>I understand what you're saying quickly without much context, and I can make you understand complex problems without a 30-minute explanation.</p><p>I've been working remotely for a long time in a cross-cultural environment with real English.</p><p>If you want to hire a man who gets the job done with no bs, please contact me.
Cheers.

Been writing code for 25+ years. 10+ years professionally. Started freelancing a few years back. I've done a number of projects with the community so far, and really hoping to find new avenues currently. On the side I release a great deal of open source software at <a href="https://github.com/jcmccormick">https://github.com/jcmccormick</a>.<p>I've made web applications (front and back end concurrently) for the majority of my time developing. However, now I have turned my sights on to LLM use. I have now learned how to work with all kinds of backends (JAX, Transformers, PyTorch, etc.) while being able to effectively fine tune my own models (from other bases). Definitely not a math major, but I do understand the practical use and intentions of model layers, matrix multiplications, and other various inner processes of neural networks.</p><p>I am currently working on a project that produces AST parses of one of my projects (20k+ loc), turns them into embeddings, and trains a model to answer questions and help me continue to code that project. All I can say is that it does work on principle, and is just a matter of time before I'll have a generalized pipeline for such projects.</p><p>If any of this sounds valuable to you, I'm certainly looking forward to utilizing my knowledge, so please do reach out via linkedin messenger, or my email. Thanks for your time.

At the same time I also get satisfaction from "shipping". So it's important to me to achieve a harmonious balance between these, so expect this to be an area of focus in terms of communication. My technical interests are anything from simple CRUD/REST APIs through to integration of more advanced features, which could be real time application (Pusher/Websocket, possibly Reverb when this is released) or integration with ML models and pipelines.

I have had the good fortune to spend the last decade working at the ground level of a startup. By starting from the bottom and working my way up to a Senior Director level position, I have been able to get a unique view of how a company functions while being part of the decisions and mistakes a company makes as it goes from being on the brink of bankruptcy to growth on a global scale.<p>My initiatives to continuously automate as much work as possible, re-evaluate working processes, and improve redundant systems allowed the company to grow at an exponential rate while not increasing headcount. The extra capital this saved us allowed us to easily handle industry-wide downturns without having to cut any of the workforce or pull back on any projects or goals.</p><p>I am fluent in Python 3+ and don't have much desire to write anything else at this point.</p><p>Areas that currently interest me are</p><pre><code>  * Climate Change, Climate Tech
  * Agriculture, AgTech
  * Automotive
  * Robotocs (MicroPython)
  * Solar
  * General Charity or 501(c)(3)
  * Research Lab
  * National security

---<p>20+ years of experience building and deploying web apps mostly as a contract worker but have FT experience too. I've worked with solo developers to 9 figure businesses.</p><p>For the last ~10 years I've focused a lot on deployment and infrastructure / SRE / platform type of work to create pipelines and solutions to help developers build and deploy things faster and more reliably without cutting corners on security or quality control. This includes fully building out and managing cloud infrastructure to run an assortment of applications both on 1 server with Docker Compose to scaling Kubernetes clusters.</p><p>I've built a few SAAS apps with Flask and Rails and understand the expected surrounding tech / knowledge around building, scaling, debugging and profiling database driven web apps. I have a preference for doing infrastructure related work but I consider myself a developer at heart.</p><p>I'm comfortable working alone or with a team and have a lot of experience chatting with vendors, giving demos, etc. and I never want to stop getting my hands dirty when it comes to writing code and implementing things. I've also written over a million words worth of technical documentation and blog posts, recorded hundreds of technical videos, have over 100+ episodes recoded in a technical podcast and created / maintain a number of ~1k+ star open source projects.

I am currently looking for a data-centric role such as data or machine learning engineer.<p>I spent the last 5 years as the founding member and CTO of a startup, which still thrives under the leadership of my two co-founders. There I architected, designed and developed a procurement software for custom made packaging that convinced customers with industry revolutionizing features and excellent UX using Angular, Java and PostgreSQL. I also applied state-of-the-art optimization and machine learning algorithms to industry specific tasks. One example is a packaging size optimization service that I created, which saves Germany's leading e-commerce websites (e.g. Flaconi) 10 - 15% of packaging and shipping costs every day.</p><p>Before that I worked as a data engineer at a global mobile advertisement company. I worked on extremely high traffic systems with hundreds of servers, where the limiting factor was the number of requests, which required us to switch to an asynchronous architecture by migrating our application to Vert.x, which reduced the number of required computing resources by over 60%. I also delivered on a data pipeline redesign, where we reduced data storage requirements by 80% through efficient sampling, which saved tens of thousand of dollars every month.</p><p>If you are interested in working together feel free to reach out.

I'm a mid-level software engineer who has spent the last year or so doing full-stack web development with Google Maps APIs and the 3 years before that doing C systems programming on a compiler/database at a startup. I'm also a Google Cloud certified Associate Cloud Engineer. I'm always looking to broaden my skillset and learn new technologies.<p>My preference is for full time work but I'm open to part time or freelance/consulting work as well. I'm also open to working with technologies I haven't worked with before.

It is time I turned my lifelong passion and hobby into a career while I'm still young. I'm self-taught through a combination of books, open course classes, and community involvement. The most technically impressive thing I can say about myself is that a couple years ago I solved twenty cryptopals puzzles in as many days, without looking at anyone else's code.<p>I spend a lot of time, since Covid started, volunteering in disaster relief - purposefully putting myself outside my technology comfort zone. Travel is now welcome, public speaking still scares me but in a good way, and I have never felt so grounded.</p><p>Hollar if interested,</p><p>Michael

Hello!  I'm Ricardo, a Full-stack Engineer with 10y of professional experience and a strong emphasis on backend development . Beyond my technical prowess in Javascript/Typescript, PHP 8, Flutter, SQL, Docker, and more, I complement my web development skills with an MBA  and prior experience in administration and financial analysis.<p>For over a decade, I've dedicated myself to the same company, managing the complete life cycle of numerous projects from inception  to deployment , consistently ensuring optimal performance and user experience . Working solo has given me a broad perspective, but I'm now keen to join a team where I can focus on a specific role. Collaborating with and learning from others will undoubtedly fast-track my professional growth .</p><p>Lately, I've been learning about Svelte , Astro , NestJS , and Rust . I'd really like to use them in real work. I look forward to leveraging both my technical and analytical skills in new, challenging projects .</p><p>I'm not inclined to engage in industries that harm the environment , jeopardize people's health , or are ethically dubious. I am committed to making positive contributions to the world through my work .

Hello. I'm Matt. waves.<p>I've been programming since ~2012, and have worked with various technologies (I didn't list everything above, as I'm not completely strong with everything). I'm currently employed full-time as primarily a front-end developer (but work with the entire stack) at a marketing company, and also run the JavaScript Today websites.

If you potentially have scenarios where the speaker's audio is being mixed with other sounds or music, they'll often be flagged as an additional speaker (so, speaker 1 might also be speaker 7 and 9) - which can make for a less useful summary.</span></p></div></td></tr>

        <p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>At the edge of Aneyoshi, a small village on Japan’s northeastern coast, a 10-foot-tall stone tablet stands, carved with a dire warning to locals.</span></span></p>

<p><span>"High dwellings are the peace and harmony of our descendants," the rock slab says. "Remember the calamity of the great tsunamis. Do not build any homes below this point."</span></p>

<p><span>While the Aneyoshi tablet might be the most straightforward, so-called “tsunami stones” dot Japan’s coastline, warning the carvers’ descendants to seek high ground after earthquakes in case they foreshadow destructive waves. The stones vary in degrees of repair, with most dating back to around 1896, when two deadly tsunamis killed about 22,000 people, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">Martin Fackler writes for <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>“The tsunami stones are warnings across generations, telling descendants to avoid the same suffering of their ancestors,” Itoko Kitahara, a historian of natural disasters at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">told Fackler in 2011</a> after an earthquake killed nearly 29,000 people. </span></span><span>“Some places heeded these lessons of the past, but many didn’t,” Kitahara </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">told Fackler</a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Over the decades, the stones’ warnings were disregarded or forgotten by many as coastal towns boomed and people placed their faith in massive seawalls built by the Japanese government. But in some places like Aneyoshi, residents still heeded the tsunami stones’ warnings.</span></p>

<p><span>"Everybody here knows about the markers. We studied them in school," 12-year-old Yuto Kimura told <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-stone-markers-warned-of-tsunamis/">the Associated Press in 2011</a>. "When the tsunami came, my mom got me from school and then the whole village climbed to higher ground."</span></p>

<p><span>Aneyoshi’s tsunami stone is the only one found that explicitly describes where to build houses, but centuries of tsunamis have also left their marks on the names of places in the region, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2">Fackler writes</a>. While some places have names like “Valley of the Survivors” and “Wave’s Edge” that might indicate ground high enough to escape a massive wave, places that weren’t so lucky might instead be named “Octopus Grounds,” after the sea life left behind in the rubble.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>"It takes about three generations for people to forget. Those that experience the disaster themselves pass it to their children and their grandchildren, but then the memory fades," Fumihiko Imamura, a professor in disaster planning at Tohoku University, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ancient-stone-markers-warned-of-tsunamis/">told the AP</a>.</span></span></p>



<p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-ab594e69-758c-6bf4-fc3a-34822961400f"><span>Four years later, <a href="http://www.livescience.com/39110-japan-2011-earthquake-tsunami-facts.html">parts of Japan are still recovering</a> from the March 2011 tsunami, with about 230,000 people still living in temporary housing. The tsunami and accompanying earthquake were also responsible for the Fukushima Daiichi disaster, when equipment damaged during the &nbsp;disaster triggered a nuclear meltdown</span></span></p>

<p>Here is a simple process for shipping software projects that works. First, decompose the project into a stream<a href="#footnote-1AV3" id="ref-1AV3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> of headlines. Then pick an aggressive date to ship the first headline and work like hell to meet that date. Have everyone work only on one headline at a time– the upcoming one. Ignore everything else. Don’t work on anything that doesn’t help you ship the headline. Once the headline is shipped, switch to the next headline in the stream and repeat. That’s all, you can fire your agile consultant.</p>
<p>A headline is a very short sentence that contains only the highest order bit, with all the other bits culled. Imagine you bump into someone on the street after not having seen them for a few months and they ask what you’ve been up to. What kinds of responses work well in this situation?<span></span> <span>“</span>I trekked through Southeast Asia”,<span></span> <span>“</span>I switched jobs”,<span></span> <span>“</span>I got married”. Software release headlines work the same way.<span></span> <span>“</span>You can now rent VMs through an <span>API</span><span></span><span>”</span>,<span></span> <span>“</span>we rolled out <span>FSD</span> autopilot”,<span></span> <span>“</span>Treasury is available in India”.</p>
<p>Headline driven development works really well for three reasons.</p>
<p>First, headlines is how humans process change. If you ever found your users confused, your boss frustrated, your investors anxious, your peers indifferent– these problems go away when you organize communication around a stream of headlines. But it doesn’t work as an afterthought. Communicating through headlines but developing in some other way is like leading a double life. It gets too messy. So to communicate with headlines you must develop with headlines too.</p>
<p>Second, it makes it easy to ruthlessly prioritize. If you can credibly ship a headline without something, cut that something. For example, suppose you’re working on your Southeast Asia trek headline and you’re planning to visit six countries. Can you credibly say to your friends<span></span> <span>“</span>I trekked through Southeast Asia” only having visited five countries instead of six? Obviously yes. So one of the countries gets cut. How about four countries? Repeatedly go through this exercise and stop before the credibility of the headline is at risk. You want to do the minimum possible amount of work that still leaves the headline credible.</p>
<p>Third, the deadline effect is real. Most of the work in college happens at midnight before the project is due. The industry isn’t that different. So simulating class assignments turns out to be a very effective way to ship quickly. You need a discrete chunk of work, with an arbitrary deadline<a href="#footnote-2AV3" id="ref-2AV3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, and a binary outcome. You get this with headlines– a headline has either shipped by a given timestamp or it hasn’t.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is one of the most important algorithms in modern computing: it plays a key role in communications,  image and audio processing, machine learning, data compression, and much more. Curiously, it’s also among the worst explained topics in computer science. For example, the Wikipedia article on the matter assaults the reader with around three dozen cryptic formulas, but offers no accessible explanation how or why the algorithm works.</p><p>My goal today is to change this. Let’s start with the basics: DFT takes a time-domain waveform — for example, an audio track — and turns it into frequency-domain data: a series of sine wave intensities that describe the underlying signal. If summed back together, these sine waves of different frequencies, phases, and magnitudes should faithfully recreate the original waveform.</p><p><span>To illustrate the utility of DFT, let’s have a look at a conventional waveform representation of a </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/police.mp3" rel="">🔈 police siren</a><span> next to its frequency-domain treatment. On both plots, the horizontal axis represents time. In the bottom image, the vertical axis represents frequency and pixel color represents intensity. The top view tells us very little about the recording; in the bottom plot, the shifting pitch of the siren is easy to see, at its base frequency and </span><a href="https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/square-waves-or-non-elephant-biology" rel="">a number of harmonics</a><span>:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg" width="990" height="875" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:875,&quot;width&quot;:990,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:675735,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fed62bf6d-9b51-442f-8a39-a07648b7d080_990x875.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Police siren: time-domain versus frequency-domain</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>The frequency-domain representation of signals allows us to perform a variety of interesting tricks. For example, when it comes to music, we can easily isolate specific instruments, remove unwanted AC hum, or pitch-shift the vocals. With the edits done, we can then convert the data back to to the time-domain waveform. Indeed, the infamous Auto-Tune pitch corrector, employed by some pop singers to cover up the lack of skill, is one of many applications of DFT.</p><p>To get it out of the way, let’s start with the official formula — which to a layperson, is rather opaque:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(F_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n \cdot e^{-i 2 \pi k\frac{n}{N} }\)</span></p></div><p><span>In this equation, </span><em><span>F</span><sub>k</sub></em><sub> </sub><span>is the DFT value (“coefficient”) for a particular frequency bin </span><em>k. </em><span>Bin numbers are integers corresponding to fractions of the input sample rate. Moving on, </span><em><span>s</span><sub>0</sub></em><sub> </sub><span>to</span><em><span> s</span><sub>N-1</sub></em><span> are the time-domain samples that make up the DFT input window; and the rest is… some voodoo?</span></p><p>To make sense of the voodoo, let’s conduct a simple thought experiment. Imagine a mechanical arm rotating at a constant angular speed. The arm is holding a pen that makes contact with a piece of drawing paper. The pen moves up and down the length of the arm in response to an input waveform.</p><p>Let’s assume that the arm is completing one rotation per second, and that the input signal is a sine wave running three times as fast (3 Hz). In this setting, the pen will end up drawing a neatly centered, three-lobed shape with every single turn:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png" width="1200" height="1100" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1100,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:98556,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F48d91b3d-1687-4bd7-b111-89bec123c791_1200x1100.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A polar plot of a 3 Hz signal at an angular speed of 1 turn per second.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p>If you prefer, you can watch an animated version below:</p><div id="vimeo-922688562" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;922688562&quot;,&quot;videoKey&quot;:&quot;76ef391e61&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="VimeoToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/922688562?autoplay=0&amp;h=76ef391e61" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p></div><p>In some circumstances — for example if the signal has a frequency lower than the rotation of the arm — it might take multiple revolutions to produce a closed shape.

We can even quantify the component’s magnitude by measuring the deviation of the shape from the center of rotation.</span></p><p><span>The discrete Fourier transform boils down to this exact operation.

It then sums the resulting coordinates (the ∑ part). The distance from the center of rotation to the computed midpoint is the magnitude of the calculated frequency component; the angle of the vector is the (sometimes disregarded) phase of the waveform. Note that some popular online sources mistakenly state that the </span><em>x</em><span> axis component is the magnitude; this is incorrect.</span></p><p><span>This algorithm can be implemented with polar coordinates — angle and distance — mimicking what we did above.

      sum += in_buf[s_no] * exp(-2 * I * M_PI * bin_no * s_no / len);
    out_buf[bin_no] = sum;
  }

}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>The code accepts and outputs complex numbers; for real number inputs, </span><em>in_buf</em><span> can be changed to </span><em>double*</em><span>. To convert the resulting complex coefficients in </span><em>out_buf</em><span> to magnitude, call </span><em>cabs(). </em><span>To get phase information (in radians), use </span><em>carg().</em></p><p><span>Let’s start with the maximum frequency range. If the input data consists of real numbers, the DFT will produce useful output only up to the so-called Nyquist frequency — that is, one half of the sample rate. This frequency component can be found in the bin at </span><em>k = N/2</em><span>.  The coefficients above that can and sometimes need to be computed — but perhaps a bit surprisingly, they just contain mirrored data from the lower-frequency bins.</span></p><p>To understand why this is happening, consider the following animation of our rotating arm. In the video, the arm is spinning so fast in relation to the input sample rate that successive samples are placed more than 180° apart. In fact, the angular distance is 330°, suggesting that we’re running the DFT at ~92% of the input sample rate:</p><div id="vimeo-923565902" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;923565902&quot;,&quot;videoKey&quot;:&quot;e1f3e178d8&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}" data-component-name="VimeoToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/923565902?autoplay=0&amp;h=e1f3e178d8" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" loading="lazy"></iframe></p></div><p>After watching the clip, it should become clear that the end result is identical to what would be produced by a much slower arm spinning in the opposite direction.</p><p>The coefficient mirroring behavior is an artifact of the DFT algorithm, but the curse of the Nyquist frequency itself is not. It’s a fundamental bandwidth limitation for signal sampling techniques: above it, there’s simply not enough samples available to faithfully discern the frequency. The Nyquist limit is the reason why music is commonly recorded at ~44 kHz, even though our hearing only goes up to about 20 kHz (and only on a good day).</p><p>The other limitation of DFT has to do with frequency separation. A discrete Fourier transform that could use an infinitely-long sample window would have perfect selectivity — that is, it would be able to precisely discern chosen frequencies while rejecting everything else. In practice, DFT is run on finite sample windows, causing each bin to pick up something extra.</p><p><span>To understand the cause, let’s assume we’re doing DFT with bins spaced three hertz apart — i.e., </span><em><span>F</span><sub>0</sub></em><span> is the DC component, </span><em><span>F</span><sub>1</sub></em><span> is 3 Hz, and </span><em><span>F</span><sub>2</sub></em><span> is 6 Hz. The </span><em><span>F</span><sub>1</sub></em><span> bin is always calculated by completing a single turn (the timing expression is </span><em>k × 2π</em><span> and </span><em>k = 1). </em><span>But with an input signal frequency of 2 Hz, we’d need three turns to form a closed shape. Instead, we run out of time — and out of input samples — by the time we’ve drawn only one off-center lobe:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png" width="1200" height="1200" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1200,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:41860,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F168cb46f-d1b4-4d94-840d-3af82284702d_1200x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><span>The limitations of DFT: a nearby frequency creeping into the F</span><sub>1 </sub><span>bin.</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In practice, the plot ends up badly off-center only if the two frequencies are quite close to each other.

Nothing stops us from calculating ad-hoc DFT coefficients for any non-integer </span><em>k </em><span>in between, but these “partial-turn” bins don’t extract any new, finer-grained information from the system. If you need better frequency discrimination, you gotta up the window size.</span></p><p><span>This brings us to temporal resolution: the transform needs a certain number of samples to work. Selectivity aside, at the very minimum, you must use a window long enough so that the bottom bin (</span><em><span>F</span><sub>1</sub></em><span>) corresponds to the lowest frequency you wish to discern; for example, if you have a 44 kHz audio stream and want to measure down to 20 Hz, you need a window of 2,200 samples — spanning 50 milliseconds — per each DFT.</span></p><p>Yet, within that chosen time window, the algorithm just outputs frequency intensities; this doesn’t make it easy to pinpoint when a particular tone starts or ends, or whether its intensity is going up or down. Indeed, sharp signal discontinuities within the analysis window produce wide-spectrum “halos” that are hard to interpret as any specific frequency.</p><p>It follows that various workarounds, such as the use of overlapping windows, weighted sampling, or specialized aliasing methods might be necessary to get acceptable temporal resolution in certain applications; audio processing tends to be one of them.</p><p><span>The inverse discrete Fourier transform is conceptually simple. It boils down to generating waveforms for to every previously-calculated frequency bin, adjusting their magnitude and phase in accordance with the DFT-produced </span><em><span>F</span><sub>k</sub></em><span> coefficients, and then summing the results to recreate the contents of the time-domain sample window (</span><em><span>s</span><sub>0</sub></em><span> to </span><em><span>s</span><sub>N-1</sub></em><span>). </span></p><p>Here’s the IDFT formula that does just that:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(s_n = \frac{1}{N} { \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} F_k \cdot e^{i{{2 \pi n \frac{k}{N} }}} } \)</span></p></div><p>Note the similarity of this equation to the forward DFT formula. There is an important symmetry in respect to inputs and outputs at the core of the algorithm; this is known as orthogonality. In a mildly mind-bending sense, the frequency domain is just the time domain turned “inside out”.</p><p>Here’s a simple implementation of IDFT in C:</p><blockquote><pre><code>void idft(complex* out_buf, complex* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (int s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++) {
    complex sum = 0;
    for (int bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++)
      sum += in_buf[bin_no] * cexp(2 * I * M_PI * s_no * bin_no / len);
    out_buf[s_no] = sum / len;
  }

}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>As earlier, if working with real-number signals, </span><em>out_buf</em><span> can be declared as </span><em>double* </em><span>instead.</span></p><p>Remarkably, forward DFT followed by IDFT is lossless - i.e., it gets you the exact same time-domain data that you started with. In practice, some attention should be paid to the precision of floating-point calculations to avoid cumulative errors, but it’s usually not a big deal.</p><p><span>The DFT is perfectly adequate except for one tiny problem: even if we precompute the exponentiation part, the algorithm still involves </span><em>K × N </em><span>complex-number multiplications. Because the number of computed bins (</span><em>K</em><span>) is frequently the same as window size (</span><em>N</em><span>), some computer science buffs with a penchant for vagueness describe the computational complexity of DFT as </span><em>O(n²)</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>This is where fast Fourier transform (FFT) comes to play; FFT is still a discrete Fourier transform and it produces the same results, but the calculation is cleverly optimized for large input windows and for the </span><em>K = N</em><span> use case (the algorithm can’t be used to selectively compute only some frequency bins). </span></p><p><span>The performance gains are due to a technique known as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley%E2%80%93Tukey_FFT_algorithm" rel="">radix-2 Cooley-Tukey algorithm</a><span>. The derivation of this optimization is somewhat involved, but on a high level, it involves iteratively splitting the full DFT calculation into smaller sub-sums, and then exploiting the fact that the </span><em><span>e</span><sup>-i2</sup></em><sup>π</sup><em><sup>kn/N</sup></em><span> expression is periodic — it literally goes in circles! — to factor out many redundant multiplications. For larger windows, the resulting complexity of FFT approaches </span><em>O(n ⋅ log₂ n</em><span>), which is a pretty substantial improvement.</span></p><p><span>Numerous reference FFT implementations exist for </span><a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" rel="">almost every language imaginable</a><span>; a particularly clean, minimalistic C implementation for power-of-two window sizes is as follows:</span></p><blockquote><pre><code>void __fft_int(complex* buf, complex* tmp, 
               const uint32_t len, const uint32_t step) {

}

void in_place_fft(complex* buf, const uint32_t len) {
  complex tmp[len];
  memcpy(tmp, buf, sizeof(tmp));
  __fft_int(buf, tmp, len, 1);
}</code></pre></blockquote><p><span>Turning this code into inverse FFT (IFFT) boils down to removing the minus sign in the </span><em>cexp(…) </em><span>expression and dividing the final values by </span><em>len. </em></p><p><span>Again, in practical applications, it would be wise to precompute the results of complex exponentiation; the value depends only on the </span><em>pos </em><span>index and the chosen window size.</span></p><p>Discrete cosine transform can be thought of as a partial, real-numbers-only version of DFT. Just like discrete Fourier, it converts time-domain samples into a frequency spectrum. And just like DFT, it gets there by multiplying input data by cosine waveforms and then summing the results to obtain a bunch of binned coefficients.</p><p>That said, this description falls a bit short; the algorithm differs from discrete Fourier in a handful of interesting ways. First, let’s have a look at the usual formula for DCT-II, the most common variation of DCT:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(F_k = \sum\limits_{n=0}^{N-1} s_n \cdot cos ( \pi k { n + \frac12 \over N} )\)</span></p></div><p><span>If you scroll back to the DFT equation, you might notice that in the formula above, </span><em>k</em><span> is multiplied by π (180°) instead of 2π (360°). In effect, the waveform-generating part uses an interleaved pattern of full-turn and partial-turn bins, running at half the frequency of DFT and putting F</span><sub>N-1 </sub><span>at the Nyquist limit. This change isn’t just about being more efficient: if you try to switch the timing expression back to </span><em>2π</em><span>, the entire algorithm goes sideways and many frequency bins start reading zero. In a moment, we’ll discuss why.</span></p><p><span>The other new element is the </span><em>+½</em><span> offset in the timing expression. Recall that sample numbers run from </span><em>n = 0</em><span> to </span><em>N - 1</em><span>, so dividing </span><em>n </em><span>by </span><em>N </em><span>leaves a gap on the upper end of the range. A +</span><em>½ </em><span>shift centers the waveform; the symmetry is important for making the inverse function work. Discrete Fourier doesn’t use this because its symmetry comes from the more basic relationship between cosine and sine in the complex plane.</span></p><p>The usual inverse DCT-II (IDCT-II) formula is:</p><div data-component-name="Latex"><p><span>\(s_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum\limits_{k=0}^{N-1} F_k \cdot w_k \cdot cos [ \pi (n + \frac12) {k \over N} ]\)</span></p></div><p><span>The </span><em><span>w</span><sub>k</sub></em><span> value is</span><em> 1</em><span> for the DC bin (</span><em>k = 0</em><span>) and 2 for all the subsequent partial-turn bins (</span><em>k &gt; 0</em><span>). You might encounter variants that put </span><em><span>w</span><sub>k</sub></em><span> and the scaling factor (</span><em>1/N</em><span>) in the forward DCT formula instead; heck, some authors split the factors between DCT and IDCT. These changes result in differently-scaled coefficients, but the overall operation is the same.</span></p><p>Now, let’s examine the fundamental mechanism of discrete cosine transform. Imagine we’re working with one second’s worth of data sampled at 2 kHz. With DFT, we get N / 2 = 1,000 usable frequency bins before hitting the Nyquist limit (1 kHz); bin spacing is 1 Hz. With the cosine transform, we’re getting N = 2,000 bins representing DC to Nyquist in 0.5 Hz increments. </p><p><span>Let’s pick the 4 Hz bin (</span><em><span>F</span><sub>8</sub></em><span>). First, consider what happens if we’re analyzing an input signal that’s running at 8 Hz. The image shows the reference 4 Hz waveform for the bin (blue), followed the input frequency (green), and then the computed product of the two (red). The product is centered around the </span><em>x</em><span> axis, so the DCT coefficient is zero:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png" width="1456" height="713" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:713,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:130190,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feed1e143-eb67-4342-9a18-906a2be4bb92_2092x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>DCT: mismatched frequencies.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>But what if the frequencies (and phases) match?

Within this “partial-turn” bin’s measurement window, the average product is positive. If we go to the next “full-turn” bin (5 Hz), the product of the waveforms is once again zero.</p><p><span>In other words, DCT bins encode magnitude </span><strong>and</strong><span> phase information, just not always where we’re expecting it. This explains why the transform needs twice as many bins — and why trying to increase their spacing to match DFT breaks the algorithm.</span></p><p>This messy encoding scheme makes discrete cosine transform a fairly poor tool for most signal analysis tasks. That said, it’s great for fast, space-efficient compression algorithms where the aesthetics of the frequency-domain representation don’t matter much. A classic example is the JPEG image format, which performs DCT on 8×8 pixel tiles and then quantizes (i.e., reduces the precision of) the calculated coefficients to make them easier to compress using conventional lossless compression (Huffman coding). </p><p>Oh — if you wish to experiment with DCT-II, a simple implementation is included below:</p><blockquote><pre><code><code>void dct(double* out_buf, double* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (uint32_t bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (uint32_t s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++)
      sum += in_buf[s_no] * cos(M_PI * bin_no * (s_no + 0.5) / len);
    out_buf[bin_no] = sum;
  }

}

void idct(double* out_buf, double* in_buf, uint32_t len) {

  for (uint32_t s_no = 0; s_no &lt; len; s_no++) {
    double sum = 0;
    for (uint32_t bin_no = 0; bin_no &lt; len; bin_no++)
      sum += in_buf[bin_no] * cos(M_PI * (s_no + 0.5) * bin_no/ len) *
             (bin_no? 2 : 1);
    out_buf[s_no] = sum / len;
  }

<p>On Friday, researchers revealed the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/">discovery</a> of a backdoor that was intentionally planted in xz Utils, an open-source data compression utility available on almost all installations of Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. The person or people behind this project likely spent years on it. They were likely very close to seeing the backdoor update merged into Debian and Red Hat, the two biggest distributions of Linux when an eagle-eyed software developer spotted something fishy.</p>
<p>"This might be the best executed supply chain attack we've seen described in the open, and it's a nightmare scenario: malicious, competent, authorized upstream in a widely used library," software and cryptography engineer Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3kouaom62oi2b">said</a> of the effort, which came frightfully close to succeeding.
</p><p>Researchers have spent the weekend gathering clues. Here's what we know so far.</p>
<p><b>What is xz Utils?</b></p>
<p>xz Utils is nearly ubiquitous in Linux. It provides lossless data compression on virtually all Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. xz Utils provides critical functions for compressing and decompressing data during all kinds of all kinds of operations. xz Utils also supports the legacy .lzma format, making this component even more crucial.</p>
<p><b>What happened?</b></p>
<p>Andres Freund, a developer and engineer working on Microsoft’s PostgreSQL offerings, was recently troubleshooting performance problems a Debian system was experiencing with SSH, the most widely used protocol for remotely logging into devices over the Internet. Specifically, SSH logins were consuming too many CPU cycles and were generating errors with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/link">valgrind</a>, a utility for monitoring computer memory.</p>
<p>Through a combination of sheer luck and Freund’s careful eye, he eventually discovered the problems were the result of updates that had been made to xz Utils. On Friday, Freund took to the Open Source Security List to disclose the updates were the result of someone intentionally planting a backdoor in the compression software.</p>
<p><b>What does the backdoor do?</b></p>
<p>Malicious code added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 modified the way the software functions when performing operations related to lzma compression or decompression. When these functions involved SSH, they allowed for malicious code to be executed with root privileges. This code allowed someone in possession of a predetermined encryption key to log into the backdoored system over SSH. From then on, that person would have the same level of control as any authorized administrator.</p>
<p><b>How did this backdoor come to be?</b></p>
<p>It would appear that this backdoor was years in the making. In 2021, someone with the username JiaT75 made their <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1609">first known commit</a> to an open-source project. In retrospect, the <a href="https://github.com/libarchive/libarchive/pull/1609">change</a> to the libarchive project is suspicious, because it replaced the safe_fprint funcion with a variant that’s long been recognized as less secure. No one noticed at the time.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The following year, JiaT75 submited a patch over the xz Utils mailing list, and almost immediately, a never-before-seen participant named Jigar Kumar joined the discussion and argued that Lasse Collin, the longtime maintainer of xz Utils, hadn’t been updating the software often or fast enough. Kumar, with the support of Dennis Ens and several other people who had never had a presence on the list, pressured Collin to bring on an additional developer to maintain the project.</p>
<p>In January 2023, JiaT75,made their <a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/7">first commit</a> to xz Utils. In the months following, JiaT75, who used the name Jia Tan, became increasingly involved in xz Utils affairs. For instance, Tan replaced Collins's contact information with their own on oss-fuzz, a project that scans open-source software for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Tan also requested that oss-fuzz disable the ifunc function during testing, a change that prevented it from detecting the malicious changes Tan would soon make to xz Utils.</p>
<p>In February of this year, Tan issued commits for versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz Utils. The updates implemented the backdoor. In the following weeks, Tan or others appeal to developers of Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Debian to merge the updates into their OSes. Eventually, one of the two updates made its way into the following releases, <a href="https://www.tenable.com/blog/frequently-asked-questions-cve-2024-3094-supply-chain-backdoor-in-xz-utils">according to</a> security firm Tenable:</p>

<p><b>Can you say more about what this backdoor does?</b></p>
<p>In a nutshell, it allows someone with the right private key to hijack sshd, the executable file responsible for making SSH connections, and from there to execute malicious commands. The backdoor is implemented through a five-stage loader that uses a series of simple but clever techniques to hide itself. It also provides the means for new payloads to be delivered without major changes being required.</p>
<p>Multiple people who have reverse engineered the updates have much more to say about the backdoor.</p>
<p>Developer Sam James provided <a href="https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27">this overview</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This backdoor has several components. At a high level:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">The release tarballs upstream publishes don't have the same code that GitHub has. This is common in C projects so that downstream consumers don't need to remember how to run autotools and autoconf. The version of build-to-host.m4 in the release tarballs differs wildly from the upstream on GitHub.</li>
<li aria-level="1">There are crafted test files in the tests/ folder within the git repository too. These files are in the following commits:
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">tests/files/bad-3-corrupt_lzma2.xz (<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0">cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0</a>,<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1"> 74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1</a>)</li>
<li aria-level="2">tests/files/good-large_compressed.lzma (<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0">cf44e4b7f5dfdbf8c78aef377c10f71e274f63c0</a>,<a href="https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1"> 74b138d2a6529f2c07729d7c77b1725a8e8b16f1</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li aria-level="1">A script called by build-to-host.m4 that unpacks this malicious test data and uses it to modify the build process.</li>
<li aria-level="1">IFUNC, a mechanism in glibc that allows for indirect function calls, is used to perform runtime hooking/redirection of OpenSSH's authentication routines. IFUNC is a tool that is normally used for legitimate things, but in this case it is exploited for this attack path.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally upstream publishes release tarballs that are different than the automatically generated ones in GitHub. In these modified tarballs, a malicious version of build-to-host.m4 is included to execute a script during the build process.</p>
<p>This script (at least in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1) checks for various conditions like the architecture of the machine. Here is a snippet of the malicious script that gets unpacked by build-to-host.m4 and an explanation of what it does:</p>
<pre>if ! (echo "$build" | grep -Eq "^x86_64" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1) &amp;&amp; (echo "$build" | grep -Eq "linux-gnu$" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1);then</pre>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">If amd64/x86_64 is the target of the build</li>
<li aria-level="1">And if the target uses the name linux-gnu (mostly checks for the use of glibc)</li>
</ul>
<p>It also checks for the toolchain being used:</p>
<pre>if test "x$GCC" != 'xyes' &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;then
exit 0
fi
if test "x$CC" != 'xgcc' &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;then
exit 0
fi
LDv=$LD" -v"
if ! $LDv 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -qs 'GNU ld' &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1;then
exit 0</pre>
<p>And if you are trying to build a Debian or Red Hat package:</p>
<pre>if test -f "$srcdir/debian/rules" || test "x$RPM_ARCH" = "xx86_64";then</pre>
<p>This attack thusly seems to be targeted at amd64 systems running glibc using either Debian or Red Hat derived distributions. Other systems may be vulnerable at this time, but we don't know.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an online interview, developer and reverse engineer HD Moore confirmed the Sam James suspicion that the backdoor targeted either Debian or Red Hat distributions.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>“The attack was sneaky in that it only did the final steps of the backdoor if you were building the library on amd64 (intel x86 64-bit) and were building a Debian or a RPM package (instead of using it for a local installation),” he wrote.</p>
<p>Paraphrasing observations from researchers who collectively spent the weekend analyzing the malicius updates, he continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>When verifying an SSH public key, if the public key matches a certain fingerprint function, the key contents are decrypted using a pre-shared key before the public key is actually verified. The decrypted contents are then passed directly to system.</p>
<p>If the fingerprint doesn't match or the decrypted contents don't match a certain format, it falls back to regular key verification and no-one's the wiser.</p>
<p>The backdoor is super sneaky. It uses a little-known feature of the glibc to hook a function. It only triggers when the backdoored xz library gets loaded by a /usr/bin/sshd process on one of the affected distributions. There may be many other backdoors, but the one everyone is talking about uses the function indirection stuff to add the hook. The payload was encoded into fake xz test files and runs as a shellcode effectively, changing the SSH RSA key verification code so that a magic public key (sent during normal authentication) let the attacker gain access</p>
<p>​​Their grand scheme was:</p>
<p>1) sneakily backdoor the release tarballs, but not the source code</p>
<p>2) use sockpuppet accounts to convince the various Linux distributions to pull the latest version and package it</p>
<p>3) once those distributions shipped it, they could take over any downstream user/company system/etc</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional technical analysis is available from the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/filippo.abyssdomain.expert/post/3kowkezwz6g2q">above</a> Bluesky thread from Valsorda, <a href="https://doublepulsar.com/inside-the-failed-attempt-to-backdoor-ssh-globally-that-got-caught-by-chance-bbfe628fafdd">researcher Kevin Beaumont</a> and <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4">Freund’s Friday disclosure</a>.</p>
<p><b>What more do we know about Jia Tan?</b></p>
<p>At the moment, extremely little, especially for someone entrusted to steward a piece of software as ubiquitous and as sensitive as xz Utils. This developer persona has touched dozens of other pieces of open-source software in the past few years. At the moment, it’s unknown if there was ever a real-world person behind this username or if Jia Tan is a completely fabricated individual.</p>

<p>In a world first, Austin Health clinicians have implanted an electrical nerve stimulation device into a patient with Crohn’s disease to prevent inflammation recurring after surgery.</p>
<p>The device, developed and manufactured by the Bionics Institute in collaboration with researchers at The Florey and The University of Melbourne, could put Crohn’s sufferers<br>
into long-term remission.</p>
<p>Crohn’s disease is a condition that causes inflammation to the lining of the gut. Most patients with Crohn’s eventually require bowel surgery to remove sections of gut<br>
damaged by inflammation. However, the disease frequently returns, requiring further surgery.</p>
<p>Crohn’s sufferers are also often at the mercy of life-long drug therapies to manage symptoms.</p>
<p>Co-investigator and team leader Professor John Furness, head of The Florey’s Digestive Physiology and Nutrition Laboratories, said this breakthrough therapy could transform the lives of people suffering from Crohn’s disease.</p>

<figure id="attachment_12355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-12355"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://florey.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/John-Furness-resized-1280x907.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="907"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-12355">Professor John Furness</figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>“By stimulating anti-inflammatory nerves and addressing inflammation early, the recurrent inflammation and associated scar tissue development can hopefully be prevented altogether, meaning patients will avoid the cycle of surgery and recovery.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Associate Professor Peter De Cruz, Austin Health’s Director of Inflammatory Bowel Disease Service said Crohn’s disease can have significant impacts on the lives of Australians throughout some of the best years of their lives.</p>
<p>“Australia has among the highest incidence of Crohn’s disease in the world, and affects young people in their 20s to 30s at a time when they are trying to study, enter the workforce or commence families.”</p>
<p>Professor James Fallon, CTO and Head of Research at the Bionics Institute leads the team that developed the groundbreaking device, which was this month implanted onto the vagus nerve of Crohn’s patient, Anthony Becker.</p>
<p>Mr Becker has suffered from Crohn’s disease for as long as he can remember, now into his 40s and with a young family, he is determined to tackle the disease head-on to ensure he maintains a quality of life that is free of surgeries.</p>
<p>Anthony was the first patient to receive the stimulation device earlier this month, and despite being on medication for a number of years, he still required surgery.</p>
<p>If this treatment proves successful, he may never need additional surgical treatments to keep his Crohn’s disease at bay.</p>
<p>Professor James Fallon said: “The vagus nerve controls many functions in the body, such as digestion, heart rate and the immune system. The device is made up of tiny electrodes that stimulate the vagus nerve to trigger the body’s natural defences and prevent inflammation from damaging the gut.</p>

Picture: The Bionics Institute</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We have designed the device to be a set-and-forget treatment powered by a small battery under the skin, hopefully allowing patients to continue<br>
their lives without the fear of further surgery.”</p>
<p>“Up to 80 per cent of Crohn’s sufferers will require surgery at some point in their lives. It’s hoped that eventually this new device will work as a set and forget, allowing patients to continue with their lives without the fear of ongoing treatment with medication,” said Associate Professor Peter De Cruz.</p>
<p>If successful, this study will confirm safety and efficacy of the device for Crohn’s sufferers and provide data to understand if remission can be sustained after surgery.</p>

<p>The hearts of the Super Nintendo</p><hr>


<p>When I start studying a vintage system, the first thing I like to do is understand how its components work together at the hardware level<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.
</p>


<p>Every computer has at least one heart which beats the cadence to all the other chips. The <b>C</b>lo<b>CK</b> output pin is connected to a copper line which spreads to most components, into their <code>CLK</code> input pin.</p>

<p>If you are mostly a software person like me, you may have never noticed it but all kinds of processors have a <code>CLK</code> input pin. From CPUs (Motorola 68000<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, Intel Pentium<a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, MOS 6502<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>), to custom graphic chips (Midway's DMA2<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>, Capcom CPS-A<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>/CPS-B<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, Sega's Genesis VDP<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>) to audio chips (Yamaha 2151<a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>, OKI msm6295<a name="back_10" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>), they all have one.</p>


<p>How is the CLK generated?</p><hr><p>The <code>CLK</code> can be generated by two types of components. One is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_oscillator#:~:text=The%20crystal%20oscillator%20circuit%20sustains,and%20size%20of%20the%20crystal">crystal oscillator</a> which usually looks like a flattened capsule. The others are named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_resonator">ceramic resonators</a>. These are <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_hearts/ceramic_resonator_sideview.webp">vertical</a> capacitor which look less high-tech than the crystals (and they also happen to drift over time).
</p>




<p>Let's open it already!</p><hr><p>With this in mind, let's peek inside a Super Nintendo. Can you find the <code>CLK</code> generators on a SNES motherboard? Clue: There are two.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_hearts/Nintendo_SNS-CPU-GPM-02_SNES_Motherboard.webp" width="3095" height="3447" id="mobo"><span><i><small>
<a href="https://consolemods.org/wiki/SNES:SNES_Model_Differences">Source</a>. Click the image to find the CLK generators.
</small></i></span>



<p>Two hearts</p><hr><p>In the X2 slot, the blue thingy is a <code>24.576</code> MHz ceramic resonator. It is located on the side where the audio chips are so it sets the pace of the <b>A</b>udio <b>P</b>rocessing <b>U</b>nit.</p>

<p>In the X1 slot, the yellow one is labeled <code>D21L3</code>. It is a <code>21.300</code> MHz oscillator. It is located near (and sets the pace of) the CPU and the <b>P</b>icture <b>P</b>rocessing <b>U</b>nit.</p>


<p>Documentation discrepancies</p><hr><p>Looking at the Super Nintendo developer guide<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> reveals it does not match our observations.</p>

The diagram shows not two but three oscillators (there is one feeding the CIC chip, responsible for copy-protection). We are missing one!</p>

<p> Moreover, the frequency for the CPU/PPU is documented as <code>21.47727</code>MHz but we found a <code>21.300</code>Mhz oscillator (this is a PAL motherboard, an NTSC one would have featured a <code>21.500</code>Mhz oscillator).</p>

<p>What is going on here?</p>


<p>CPU/PPU: From <code>21.500</code>MHz to <code>21.47727</code>MHz</p><hr><p>If we look at the motherboard again, we will notice a red component in the lower left, just next to the oscillator. This red thingy is a variable capacitor (some people also call it a trimmer capacitor) which turns the <code>21.500</code> MHz frequency into <code>21.47727</code> MHz.</p>

<p>Why did the designers make it adjustable? The likely answer is that Nintendo feared the oscillator would deteriorate over time, and technicians would be able to tune it. They may not have been wrong since a common issue for the Super Nintendo console is to render in black and white. The solution is often to adjust the capacitor (or replace the oscillator)<a name="back_12" href="#footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.

<p>Dividers</p><hr><p>There are only two "master" clocks in the console but none of the processors use them. What happens is that these masters go into dividers to create new clocks. The Ricoh 5A22 CPU for example, runs at 1/6 of the master clock, which results in <code>3.579545</code>MHz. Luckily, the SNES community (and <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/snes_hearts/%3Ca%20href=" https:="" problemkaputt.de="" fullsnes.htm#snestimingoscillators"="">nocash</a> in particular) has documented all these dividers<a name="back_13" href="#footnote_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In total there are fifteen clocks in the Super Nintendo. Hopefully this solves the mystery of the "missing" oscillator from the documentation.</p>

<p>Enhancement chips</p><hr><p>The <code>SYS-CLK</code> (21.47727MHz) line is fed into the cartridge port. This signal is normally not needed by the components in the cartridge. These are made of ROM containing the game instructions and assets which don't need a clock signal. So why route it there?</p>

<p>The answer is that it allows cartridges to embed processors of their own, called enhancement chips<a name="back_14" href="#footnote_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a>. The most famous of these games is StarFox which features a "mario" SuperFX processor. The MARIO version has an internal divider which halves the clock to <code>10.738635</code>MHz. Later, GSU-1, versions ran at the full <code>21.47727</code>MHz clock.</p>

<p>
<b><u>Trivia:</u></b> There is a second CLK line fed into the cartridge. It is <code>CIC-CLK</code> (3.072MHz) which is fed in the CIC chip located in the cartridge<a name="back_15" href="#footnote_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p> 


<p>However <code>SYS-CLK</code> (21.47727MHz) was not always suitable. Some games, like Megaman 2 and 3 used a CX4 enhancement chip for graphic effects. If we open a MM2 PCB, we find a <code>20</code> MHz oscillator (X1 slot) which feeds the CX4 <code>CLK</code> pin.
