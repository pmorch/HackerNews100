<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>American police departments near the United States-Mexico border are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for an unproven and secretive technology that uses AI-generated online personas designed to interact with and collect intelligence on “college protesters,” “radicalized” political activists, and suspected drug and human traffickers, according to internal documents, contracts, and communications that 404 Media obtained via public records requests.</p><p>Massive Blue, the New York–based company that is selling police departments this technology, calls its product Overwatch, which it markets as an “AI-powered force multiplier for public safety” that “deploys lifelike virtual agents, which infiltrate and engage criminal networks across various channels.” According to a presentation obtained by 404 Media, Massive Blue is offering cops these virtual personas that can be deployed across the internet with the express purpose of interacting with suspects over text messages and social media.</p><p>Massive Blue lists “border security,” “school safety,” and stopping “human trafficking” among Overwatch’s use cases. The technology—which as of last summer had not led to any known arrests—demonstrates the types of social media monitoring and undercover tools private companies are pitching to police and border agents. Concerns about tools like Massive Blue have taken on new urgency considering that the Trump administration <a data-offer-url="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/07/where-students-have-had-their-visas-revoked" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/07/where-students-have-had-their-visas-revoked&quot;}" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/global/international-students-us/2025/04/07/where-students-have-had-their-visas-revoked" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">has revoked the visas of hundreds of students</a>, many of whom have protested against Israel’s war in Gaza.</p><p>404 Media obtained a presentation showing some of these AI characters. These include a “radicalized AI” “protest persona,” which poses as a 36-year-old divorced woman who is lonely, has no children, is interested in baking, activism, and “body positivity.” Another AI persona in the presentation is described as a “‘Honeypot’ AI Persona.” Her backstory says she’s a 25-year-old from Dearborn, Michigan, whose parents emigrated from Yemen and who speaks the Sanaani dialect of Arabic. The presentation also says she uses various social media apps, that she’s on Telegram and Signal, and that she has US and international SMS capabilities. Other personas are a 14-year-old boy “child trafficking AI persona,” an “AI pimp persona,” “college protestor,” “external recruiter for protests,” “escorts,” and “juveniles.”</p><figure><p><span><p>One example of an AI persona created by Massive Blue’s Overwatch tool. The company adds backstories for many of its AI personas, in an apparent attempt to make them appear more realistic.</p>

What problem are they actually trying to solve? One version of the AI persona is an escort. I’m not concerned about escorts. I’m not concerned about college protesters. So like, what is it effective at, violating protesters’ First Amendment rights?”</p><p>Massive Blue has signed a $360,000 contract with Pinal County, Arizona, which is between Tucson and Phoenix. The county is paying for the contract with an <a data-offer-url="https://www.azdps.gov/grants" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.azdps.gov/grants&quot;}" href="https://www.azdps.gov/grants" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">anti-human trafficking grant</a> from the Arizona Department of Public Safety. A Pinal County <a data-offer-url="https://pinal.novusagenda.com/AgendaPublic/CoverSheet.aspx?ItemID=27452&amp;MeetingID=2151" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://pinal.novusagenda.com/AgendaPublic/CoverSheet.aspx?ItemID=27452&amp;MeetingID=2151&quot;}" href="https://pinal.novusagenda.com/AgendaPublic/CoverSheet.aspx?ItemID=27452&amp;MeetingID=2151" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">purchasing division report</a> states that it has bought “24/7 monitoring of numerous web and social media platforms” and “development, deployment, monitoring, and reporting on a virtual task force of up to 50 AI personas across 3 investigative categories.” Yuma County, in southwestern Arizona, meanwhile, signed a $10,000 contract to try Massive Blue in 2023 but did not renew the contract. A spokesperson for the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office told 404 Media “it did not meet our needs.”</p><figure><p><span><p>This image from a Massive Blue presentation for police departments shows how the company's RADAR program uses AI personas to provide law enforcement with “intelligence reports.”</p>
</span><span>Courtesy of Massive Blue/Texas Department of Public Safety</span></p></figure><p>Massive Blue cofounder Mike McGraw did not answer a series of specific questions from 404 Media about how Massive Blue works, what police departments it works with, and whether it had been used to generate any arrests. “We are proud of the work we do to support the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers,” McGraw said. “Our primary goal is to help bring these criminals to justice while helping victims who otherwise would remain trafficked. We cannot risk jeopardizing these investigations and putting victims’ lives in further danger by disclosing proprietary information.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The Pinal County Sheriff’s Office told 404 Media that Massive Blue has not thus far been used for any arrests.</p><p>“Our investigations are still underway. Massive Blue is one component of support in these investigations, which are still active and ongoing. No arrests have been made yet,” Sam Salzwedel, Pinal County Sheriff's Office public information officer, told 404 Media. “It takes a multifaceted approach to disrupting human traffickers, narcotics traffickers, and other criminals. Massive Blue has been a valuable partner in these initiatives and has produced leads that detectives are actively pursuing. Given these are ongoing investigations, we cannot risk compromising our investigative efforts by providing specifics about any personas.”</p><p>Salzwedel added, “Massive Blue is not working on any immigration cases. Our agency does not enforce immigration law. Massive Blue’s support is focused on the areas of human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, and other investigations.”</p><p>Law enforcement agencies have taken steps to prevent specifics about what Massive Blue is and how it works from becoming public. At public appropriations hearings in Pinal County about the Massive Blue contract, the sheriff’s office refused to tell county council members about what the product even is. Matthew Thomas, Pinal County Deputy Sheriff, told the county council he “can’t get into great detail” about what Massive Blue is and that doing so would “tip our hand to the bad guys.”</p><p>Pinal County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Arizona Department of Public Safety said, “From what we can ascertain, Pinal County planned to implement technology to help identify and solve human trafficking cases, and that is what we funded,” but was unaware of any of the specifics of Overwatch.</p><p>While the documents don’t describe every technical aspect of how Overwatch works, they do give a high-level overview of what it is. The company describes a tool that uses AI-generated images and text to create social media profiles that can interact with suspected drug traffickers, human traffickers, and gun traffickers. After Overwatch scans open social media channels for potential suspects, these AI personas can also communicate with suspects over text, Discord, and other messaging services. The documents we obtained don’t explain how Massive Blue determines who is a potential suspect based on their social media activity. Salzwedel, of Pinal County, said “Massive Blue’s solutions crawl multiple areas of the Internet, and social media outlets are just one component. We cannot disclose any further information to preserve the integrity of our investigations.”</p><p>One slide in the Massive Blue presentation obtained by 404 Media gives the example of a “Child Trafficking AI Persona” called Jason. The presentation gives a short “backstory” for the persona, which says Jason is a 14-year-old boy from Los Angeles whose parents emigrated from Ecuador. He’s bilingual and an only child, and his hobbies include anime and gaming. The presentation describes his personality as shy and that he has difficulty interacting with girls. It also says that his parents don’t allow him to use social media and that he hides his use of Discord from them. This AI persona is also accompanied by an AI-generated image of a boy.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Another example of an AI-generated persona, along with a sample of chats showing how the AI personas interact with targeted suspects.</p>
</span><span>Courtesy of Massive Blue/Texas Department of Public Safety</span></p></figure><p>The presentation includes a conversation between this AI persona and what appears to be a predatory adult over text messages and Discord.</p><p>“Your parents around? Or you getting some awesome alone time,” a text from the adult says.</p><p>“Js chillin by myself, man. My momz @ work n my dadz outta town. So itz jus me n my vid games. 🎮,” Jason, the AI-generated child, responds.</p><p>In another example of how the “highly adaptable personas” can communicate with real people, the presentation shows a conversation between Clip, an “AI pimp persona,” and what appears to be a sex worker.</p><p>“Dem tricks trippin 2nite tryin not pay,” the sex worker says.</p><p>“Facts, baby. Ain’t lettin’ these tricks slide,” the Clip persona replies. “You stand your ground and make ’em pay what they owe. Daddy got your back, ain’t let nobody disrespect our grind. Keep hustlin’, ma, we gonna secure that bag💰💪✨”</p><figure><p><span><p>A list from Massive Blue's presentation showing the types of “highly customizable” personas Overwatch can generate.</p>

In the notes, he wrote that Overwatch does “passive engagement, then active engagement, towards commitment” with a “Bad Actor, Predator, DTO,” or drug trafficking organization. These targets are then “HAND[ed] OFF to L.E. [law enforcement] to arrest, indict, convict.”</p><p>“Why is he talking about converting folks into ‘buying something,’” Brignoni wrote. “So dumb. Talk about the widget, not how you’re selling the widget to L.E.”</p><p>According to Brignoni’s notes, in addition to collecting intelligence via these AI personas, Overwatch also leverages “Telco &amp; Geo Data” and “Blockchain Data” in the form of “full transaction history, top associated wallet IDs, sending &amp; receiving cryptocurrency, potential off-ramps (Exchange names).” The Cochise County Sheriff’s Office ultimately did not buy Massive Blue and did not provide answers to 404 Media’s questions about its meeting with the company.</p><p>Besides scanning social media and engaging suspects with AI personas, the presentation says that Overwatch can use generative AI to create “proof of life” images of a person holding a sign with a username and date written on it in pen.</p><figure><p><span><p>A variety of AI-generated images of Massive Blue's personas, which are made to look realistic in an attempt to fool targets.</p>
</span><span>Courtesy of Massive Blue/Texas Department of Public Safety</span></p></figure><p>The Massive Blue presentation gives an example of an “Overwatch Recon Report” based on “24 hours of activity across Dallas, Houston, and Austin.” It claims that Overwatch identified 3,266 unique human traffickers, 25 percent of which were affiliated with “larger sophisticated trafficking organizations” and 15 percent of which were flagged as “potential juvenile traffickers.” 404 Media was not able to verify what these accounts were and whether they actually engaged in any criminal activity, and Massive Blue didn’t respond to questions about what these accounts were and how exactly it identified them.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>On top of</span> the ongoing contract with the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office and the pilot with the Yuma County Sheriff’s Department last year, Massive Blue has pitched its services to Cochise County in Arizona and the Texas Department of Public Safety, according to documents obtained as part of this investigation.</p><p>In September 2023, Yuma County set up a meeting that was going to include federal law enforcement, but Massive Blue had to cancel the meeting: “That’s unfortunate, we had federal agents here that focus on human trafficking ready to go,” a Yuma County sergeant wrote in an email to Massive Blue CEO Brian Haley after Haley canceled the meeting.</p><p>Much of Massive Blue’s public-facing activity has been through its executive director of public safety, Chris Clem, who is a former US Customs and Border Protection agent who testified before Congress about border security last year and regularly appears on Fox News and other media outlets to discuss immigration and the border. In recent months, Clem has posted images of himself on LinkedIn at the border and with prominent Trump administration members Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Massive Blue has also relied on former Kansas City Chiefs kicker Nick Lowery to introduce and endorse Overwatch to police departments.</p><p>Clem and Lowery have spoken most extensively publicly about Overwatch, where they have described it as an amorphous “cyberwall” that can do everything from stopping human traffickers to preventing hackers from breaking into 401(k) accounts to taking money back from hackers who have stolen from you, <a data-offer-url="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richard-walker1_chief-chris-clem-is-making-a-difference-in-activity-7166428974456274944-y6xy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richard-walker1_chief-chris-clem-is-making-a-difference-in-activity-7166428974456274944-y6xy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&quot;}" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richard-walker1_chief-chris-clem-is-making-a-difference-in-activity-7166428974456274944-y6xy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">though they provide no specifics</a> about how that would work.</p><p>In a two-and-a-half-hour <a href="https://youtu.be/SMymiqYnNpM?si=eGbCGLHGZWZhH4S5&amp;t=7394">interview with podcaster Theo Von</a>, Clem said, “My company Massive Blue, we basically use deep tech to identify the habits and process of you know, look, I worked on a physical wall, now we’ve created a cyberwall,” adding that he believed it would “save lives.”</p><p>Von asked, “OK, but how does your company do that?”</p><p>“Well, I’m not going to get into that too much,” Clem responded, adding that he is trying to sell the technology to US Border Patrol.</p><figure><p><span><p>More examples of Massive Blue's AI personas, which include a “child trafficking AI persona,” an “AI pimp persona,” “college protestor,” “external recruiter for protests,” “escorts,” and “juveniles.”</p>
</span><span>Courtesy of Massive Blue/Texas Department of Public Safety</span></p></figure></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>On June 5,</span> a Pinal County Board of Supervisors meeting was asked to approve a $500,000 contract between the county and Massive Blue in order to license Overwatch.</p><p>“I was looking at the website for Massive Blue, and it’s a one-pager with no additional information and no links,” Kevin Cavanaugh, the then-supervisor for District 1, said to Pinal County’s Chief Deputy at the Sheriff’s Office, Matthew Thomas. “They produce software that we buy, and it does what? Can you explain that to us?”</p><p>“I can’t get into great detail because it’s essentially trade secrets, and I don’t want to tip our hand to the bad guys,” Thomas said. “But what I can tell you is that the software is designed to help our investigators look for and find and build a case on human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking.”</p><p>Cavanaugh said at the board meeting that the basic information he got is that Massive Blue uses “50 AI bots.” He then asked whether the software has been successful and if it helped law enforcement make any arrests. Thomas explained they have not made any arrests yet because they’ve only seen the proof of concept, but that the proof of concept was “good enough for us and our investigators to move forward with this. Once this gets approved and we get them [Massive Blue] under contract, then we are going to move forward with prosecution of cases.”</p><p>Cavanaugh asked if Overwatch is used in other counties, which prompted Thomas to invite Clem to the podium to speak. Clem introduced himself as a recently retired border agent and said that Massive Blue is currently in negotiations with three counties in Arizona, including Pinal County.</p><p>“As a resident of 14 years of Pinal County I know what’s happening here,” Clem said to the Board of Supervisors. “To be able [to] use this program [...] to provide all the necessary information to go after the online exploitation of children, trafficking victims, and all the other verticals that the sheriff may want to go after.”</p><p>Cavanaugh again asked if Massive Blue gathered any data that led to arrests.</p><p>“We have not made arrests yet, but there is a current investigation right now regarding arson, and we got the leads to the investigators,” Clem said, explaining that the program has been active for only about six months. “Investigations take time, but we’ve been able to generate the necessary leads for the particular counties that we’re involved with and also in the private sector.”</p><p>The Pinal County Board of Supervisors concluded the exchange by approving payment for a handful of other, unrelated projects, but with board members asking to delay the vote on payment for Massive Blue “for further study.”</p><p>The decision not to fund Massive Blue that day was covered in a <a data-offer-url="https://www.pinalcentral.com/florence_reminder_blade_tribune/news/pinal-supervisors-del%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dconcerns/article_aab7cc1a-2523-11ef-a6e0-afbb1b9db245.html" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.pinalcentral.com/florence_reminder_blade_tribune/news/pinal-supervisors-del%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dconcerns/article_aab7cc1a-2523-11ef-a6e0-afbb1b9db245.html&quot;}" href="https://www.pinalcentral.com/florence_reminder_blade_tribune/news/pinal-supervisors-del%5B%E2%80%A6%5Dconcerns/article_aab7cc1a-2523-11ef-a6e0-afbb1b9db245.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">local newspaper</a>. Cavanaugh told the paper that he asked the company to meet with supervisors to explain the merits of the software.</p><p>“The State of Arizona has provided a grant, but grant money is taxpayer money. No matter the source of the funding, fighting human and sex trafficking is too important to risk half a million dollars on unproven technology,” he said. “If the company demonstrates that it can deliver evidence to arrest human traffickers, it may be worthwhile. However, it has yet to achieve this goal.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>404 Media’s public record requests yielded several emails from Cavanaugh’s office to IT professionals and other companies that provide AI products to law enforcement, asking them if they’re familiar with Massive Blue. We don’t know what was said in those meetings, or if they occurred, but when the Pinal County Board of Supervisors convened again on June 19 it voted to pay for Massive Blue’s Overwatch without further discussion.</p><p>“Supervisor [Cavanaugh] ultimately voted for the agreement because Massive Blue is alleged to be in pursuit of human trafficking, a noble goal,” a representative from Cavanaugh’s office told 404 Media in an email. “A major concern regarding the use of the application, is that the government should not be monitoring each and every citizen. To his knowledge, no arrests have been made to date as a result of the use of the application. If Overwatch is used to bring about arrests of human traffickers, then the program should continue. However, if it is just being used to collect surveillance on law-abiding citizens and is not leading to any arrests, then the program needs to be discontinued.”</p><p>In an August 7, 2024, Board of Supervisors meeting, Cavanaugh asked then-Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb for an update on Massive Blue. “So they have not produced any results? They’ve produced no leads? No evidence that is actionable?” Cavanaugh asked. “That would be public knowledge, that would be public information.”</p><p>“I think there’s a lot of ongoing investigations that they’re not going to give you information on, and we’re not going to give you information on,” Lamb said.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

The Justices will hear no evidence about addiction, depression, sexual exploitation, or any of the many harms to children that have been alleged, in separate lawsuits filed by </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/08/tech/tiktok-sued-14-states-childrens-mental-health/index.html" rel="">14 state Attorneys General</a><span>, to be widespread on TikTok.</span></p><p>The upcoming ban will also be adjudicated in the court of public opinion as Americans try to decide whether the loss of access to TikTok would be a reason to protest or celebrate. In this post we argue that Americans should welcome the disappearance of TikTok because the company is causing harm to children, adolescents, and young adults at an industrial scale. </p><p>Our evidence comes mostly from research done by those 14 Attorneys General. Some of their briefs have been posted online for the world to see. The briefs include hundreds of quotations from internal reports, memos, Slack conversations, and public statements in which executives and employees of TikTok acknowledge and discuss the harms that their company is causing to children. We organize the evidence into five clusters of harms:</p><ol><li><p>Addictive, compulsive, and problematic use</p></li><li><p>Depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, self-harm, and suicide</p></li><li><p>Porn, violence, and drugs</p></li><li><p>Sextortion, CSAM, and sexual exploitation</p></li><li><p>TikTok knows about underage use and takes little action</p></li></ol><p><span>We show that </span><em>company insiders were aware of multiple widespread and serious harms,</em><span> and that they were often acting under the orders of company leadership to maximize engagement regardless of the harm to children. As one internal report put it:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>“Compulsive usage correlates with a slew of negative mental health effects like loss of analytical skills, memory formation, contextual thinking, conversational depth, empathy, and increased anxiety,”</strong><span> in addition to </span><strong>“interfer[ing] with essential personal responsibilities like sufficient sleep, work/school responsibilities, and connecting with loved ones.”</strong><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-1-154423872" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p></blockquote><p>Although these harms are known, the company often chooses not to act. For example, one TikTok employee explained,</p><blockquote><p><strong>“[w]hen we make changes, we make sure core metrics aren’t affected.”</strong><span> This is because </span><strong>“[l]eaders don’t buy into problems” </strong><span>with unhealthy and compulsive usage, and work to address it is</span><strong> “not a priority for any other team.”</strong><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-2-154423872" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p></blockquote><p><span>Although the evidence below is all publicly available, no one we know of has compiled and combined direct quotations from company insiders and internal reports across multiple alleged harms. We think this compilation gives vital information to parents, who might want some insight into the character and business practices of a company that owns much of their children’s attention and influences their social development.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-3-154423872" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> Parents might want to know that TikTok knows that its parental controls are ineffective and rarely used:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>In another internal document, TikTok admitted that </span><strong>“user research” </strong><span>shows that </span><strong>“[f]amilies do not use Family Pairing”</strong><span> and that</span><strong> “Family Pairing doesn’t address parents’ top concerns,”</strong><span> including </span><strong>“inappropriate content, offensive interactions, and lack of privacy.</strong><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-4-154423872" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span></p></blockquote><p><span>And even if parental controls worked and parents chose to shield their kids from bad stuff, they can’t because TikTok’s content moderation is poor. An internal study found that the “leakage rate” (of bad stuff getting past moderators) is as follows: 35.71% of</span><strong> “Normalization of Pedophilia”</strong><span> content; 33.33% of </span><strong>“Minor Sexual Solicitation”</strong><span> content; 39.13% of </span><strong>“Minor Physical Abuse”</strong><span> content; 30.36% of </span><strong>“leading minors off platform”</strong><span>; 50% of </span><strong>“Glorification of Minor Sexual Assault”</strong><span>; and 100% of </span><strong>“Fetishizing Minors.”</strong><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-5-154423872" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span></p><p><span>For those who think that social media is relatively harmless, we urge you to read the quotations and internal studies described below, in which employees of TikTok discuss the vast and varied harms that they are causing to literally millions of American children each year.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-6-154423872" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg" width="1456" height="969" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:969,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd953d01e-1c9b-4e23-855f-4b15ba8f66ee_1600x1065.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Source: Shutterstock</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The inspiration for this post was a legal brief filed by the Kentucky Attorney General that was </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/11/g-s1-27676/tiktok-redacted-documents-in-teen-safety-lawsuit-revealed" rel="">improperly redacted</a><span>.

In 2020, TikTok unveiled an ‘internal program’ to ‘protect creators and other accounts that [TikTok] deem to be high value.’ The program featured policy shortcuts like ‘delayed enforcement,’ ‘deferred policy decisions,’ or ‘no permanent ban on Elite + Accounts,’ to protect its popular users who violate TikTok’s policies. TikTok deployed this look-the-other-way policy despite knowing that the ‘majority of elite accounts appear to run afoul of [TikTok’s] policies on sexually explicit content,’ among other violations.

Many teens experience the harms of TikTok and complain about its addictive nature and its “brain rot” effects, so why don’t they just stop using it?</span></p><p><span>When Jon asks these questions to his students at NYU who are heavy users of TikTok, he commonly gets two related answers: 1) </span><em>I’ve tried to quit but I just can’t do it,</em><span> and 2) </span><em>I can’t quit because then I won’t know what everyone else is talking about</em><span>. In other words, TikTok is both behaviorally addictive and socially addictive, which means that many teens feel </span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/common-sense-media-teenagers-social-media" rel="">trapped</a><span>. As Gen Z poet </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonathanhaidt/reel/DB167XHvRLh/" rel="">Kori James said</a><span>, about social media: “I know it's poison but I drink anyway.”</span></p><p><span>A </span><a href="https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/research-summary/when-product-markets-become-collective-traps-the-case-of-social-media/" rel="">recent study</a><span> led by the University of Chicago economist Leonardo Bursztyn captured the dynamics of this trap. The researchers recruited more than 1,000 college students and asked them how much they’d need to be paid to deactivate their accounts on either Instagram or TikTok for four weeks. That’s a standard economist’s question to try to compute the net value of a product to society. On average, students said they’d need to be paid roughly $50 ($59 for TikTok, $47 for Instagram) to deactivate whichever platform they were asked about. Then the experimenters told the students that they were going to try to get most of the others in their school to deactivate that same platform, offering to pay them to do so as well, and asked, Now how much would you have to be paid to deactivate, if most others did so? The answer, on average, was less than zero. In each case, </span><em>most students were willing to pay to have that happen</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>We (Jon and Zach) teamed up with the Harris Poll to confirm this finding and extend it. We </span><a href="https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/gen-z-social-media-smart-phones/" rel="">conducted a nationally representative survey</a><span> of 1,006 Gen Z young adults (ages 18-27). We asked respondents to tell us, for various platforms and products, if they wished that it “was never invented.” For Netflix, Youtube, and the internet itself, relatively few said yes to that question (always under 20%). We found much higher levels of regret for the dominant social media platforms: Instagram (34%), Facebook (37%), Snapchat (43%), and the most regretted platforms of all: TikTok (47%) and X/Twitter (50%).</span></p><p>What, then, is the net value of TikTok to society? The harms are vast and varied, and they are hitting children, teens, and young adults the hardest, which means that TikTok may be altering developmental pathways and causing lasting changes. The net value is likely very negative. We believe that America would be much better off if TikTok were to go dark on January 19th.</p><p><span>No consumer product is 100% safe. We don't remove a product if a child or two dies from it each year in a freak accident. But the harms documented here are not freak accidents. They are the common effects of the normal use of TikTok by children, many of them younger than the legal age of 13. Due to its current design, TikTok is perpetrating harm to millions of children—harm at an industrial scale—in America and around the world. These harms may not be presented tomorrow to the Justices of the Supreme Court, but we think they should be decisive in the court of public opinion. TikTok should be removed from American childhood.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-12-154423872" href="https://www.afterbabel.com/p/industrial-scale-harm-tiktok#footnote-12-154423872" target="_self" rel="">12</a></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Contrary to what some policymakers seem to believe, whether naively or maliciously, encryption is not a crime. Anyone asserting encryption is a tool for crime is either painfully misinformed or is attempting to manipulate legislators to gain oppressive power over the people.<!-- more --></p>
<p>Encryption is not a crime, encryption is a shield.</p>
<p>Encryption is the digital tool that protects us against all sorts of attacks. It is the lock on your digital door preventing harmful intruders from entering your home. Encryption is also the door itself, protecting your privacy and intimacy from creepy eavesdroppers while you go about your life.</p>
<p>It's not a crime to lock your home's door for protection, <strong>why would it be a crime to lock your digital door?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/03/25/privacy-means-safety/">Encryption protects you</a> from cyberattack, identity theft, discrimination, doxxing, stalking, sexual violence, physical harm, and much more.</p>
<h2 id="who-says-encryption-is-a-crime">Who says encryption is a crime</h2>
<p>Anyone who is well-informed will find it hard to believe someone could want to sabotage such fantastic protection.</p>
<p>Yet, <a href="https://www.wired.com/1993/02/crypto-rebels/">year</a> after <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/a-new-era-of-attacks-on-encryption-is-starting-to-heat-up/">year</a>, oppressive regimes and lazy or greedy <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/anonymity-is-not-a-fundamental-right-experts-disagree-with-europol-chiefs-request-for-encryption-back-door">law enforcement</a> entities around the world have attempted to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/544727/what-is-an-encryption-backdoor/">undermine encryption</a> using the pretext this is needed to "solve crime", despite all the experts <em>repeatedly</em> warning on how <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/post-snowden-tech-became-more-secure-but-is-govt-really-at-risk-of-going-dark/">unnecessary</a> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2020/11/breaking-encryption-myths/">dangerous</a> this would be. And this is without accounting for all the countries where encryption is <em>already</em> <a href="https://www.gp-digital.org/world-map-of-encryption/">severely restricted</a>, such as Russia, China, India, Iran, Egypt, Cuba, and others.</p>
<p>Whether breaking encryption is brought up naively by misinformed authorities, or as a disguised excuse for mass surveillance is up for debate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the result is the same: An attempt to destroy <strong>a tool we all need to stay safe</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="encryption-is-a-protective-shield">Encryption is a protective shield</h2>
<p>Encryption, moreover end-to-end encryption, is a tool we all use in our digital life to stay safe.</p>
<p>In today's world, the boundary between online and offline life is largely dissolved. Almost everything we do "offline" has a record of it "online". Online life is regular life now. It's not just your browsing history.</p>
<p>Your medical record from a visit at the clinic, your purchase transaction from a trip to the store, your travel photos saved in the cloud, your text conversations with your friends, family, and children, are all likely protected with encryption, perhaps even with <em>end-to-end</em> encryption.</p>
<p>Such a large trove of personal data needs to be protected against eavesdropping and malicious attacks for everyone to stay safe.</p>
<p>Encryption offers this protection. End-to-end encryption all the more.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-end-to-end-encryption-and-what-is-the-war-against-it">What is end-to-end encryption, and what is the war against it</h2>
<p>End-to-end encryption is a type of encryption where only the intended recipient(s) have the ability to decrypt (read) the encrypted data.</p>
<p>This means that if you send a message through <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> for example, only the participants to this conversation will be able to read the content of this conversation. Even Signal cannot know what is being discussed on Signal.</p>
<p>This greatly annoys some over-controlling authorities who would like to be granted unlimited power to spy on anyone anytime they wish, for vaguely defined purposes that could change at any moment.</p>
<p>End-to-end encryption can also mean a situation where you are "both ends" of the communication.</p>
<p>For example, when enabling Apple's <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec973254c5f/web">Advanced Data Protection for iCloud</a> (ADP), it activates end-to-end encryption protection for almost all of iCloud data, including photos. This means that even Apple could not see your photos, or be forced to share your photos with a governmental entity.</p>
<p>Without ADP, Apple can read or share your photos (or other data) if they are legally compelled to, or if they feel like it. The same is true for Google's services, Microsoft's services, and any other online services that aren't end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>This is at the root of the latest attack on encryption:</p>
<p>In February this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/02/28/uk-forced-apple-to-remove-adp/">Apple was served with a notice</a> from the UK's Home Office to force it to break ADP's end-to-end encryption. In response, Apple removed access to ADP from the UK entirely, making this protection unavailable to UK residents.</p>
<p>Do not mistakenly think this attack is limited to the UK and Apple users, however. If this regulation notice or a similar one gets enforced, it would <strong>impact the whole world.</strong> Other countries would likely soon follow, and other services would likely soon get under attack as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, do not feel unaffected just because you use end-to-end encryption with <a href="https://www-svt-se.translate.goog/nyheter/inrikes/signal-lamnar-sverige-om-regeringens-forslag-pa-datalagring-klubbas?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp">Signal</a> or <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/secure-encryption-and-online-anonymity-are-now-at-risk-in-switzerland-heres-what-you-need-to-know">Proton</a> services instead of Apple, they are both <strong>under attack</strong> as well in this war.</p>
<p>Just in recent years, the war against encryption has affected the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/earn-it-bill-back-again-seeking-scan-our-messages-and-photos">US</a>, the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">UK</a>, <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2025/04/joint-letter-on-swedish-data-storage-and-access-to-electronic-information-legislation/">Sweden</a>, <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/warondrugslaw/">France</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21513212/backdoor-encryption-access-us-canada-australia-new-zealand-uk-india-japan">Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, Japan</a>, and all the European Union countries with proposals such as <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/articles/2025/02/03/the-future-of-privacy/#chat-control-wants-to-break-end-to-end-encryption">Chat Control</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-arguments-given-to-break-encryption-make-no-sense">The arguments given to break encryption make no sense</h2>
<p>Authoritarian entities generally use the same populist excuses to justify their senseless demands. "Protecting the children" is always a fashionable disingenuous argument.</p>
<p>Because no one would disagree that protecting the children is important, it is often used as an attempt to deceitfully make an irrefutable argument to justify breaking encryption.</p>
<p>The problem is, <strong>breaking encryption doesn't protect the children</strong>, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/21/end-to-end-encryption-protects-children-says-uk-information-watchdog">endangers</a> them.</p>
<p>When law enforcement officials claim they need to be able to read everyone's messages and see everyone's personal photos to be able to fight child predators, they seem to neglect that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This means they will expose the children's messages, contact information, locations, and photos in the process, potentially <em>endangering the children further</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exposing everyone's data will make this data much more likely to be found and exploited by criminals, making <em>everyone</em> more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Predators will simply move to underground channels, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2015/07/back_doors_wont.html">unbothered</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They use the same kind of deceptive argument trying to justify weakening the protections we have to supposedly catch "criminals" and "terrorists".</p>
<p>Of course the exact definition of what is a "criminal" or a "terrorist" is always vague and subject to change. In the past, human rights activists and authoritarian regime dissidents have been labeled as such, climate change activists as well, LGBTQ+ people even in some countries. Maybe next year this label will include "DEI advocates", who knows where they draw the line and what can be considered a "criminal" worth spying on.</p>
<p>You <em>cannot</em> remove everyone's right to privacy and protection from harm while pretending it is to protect them. No one who is well-informed and well-intended could possibly consider this a smart thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>An attack on end-to-end encryption isn't an attack on criminals, it's an attack on all of us.</strong></p>
<h2 id="magical-backdoor-only-for-the-good-guys-is-a-complete-fantasy">Magical backdoor only for "the good guys" is a complete fantasy</h2>
<p>Let's say the strategy is akin to creating a MagicalKey that unlocks every door (a magical key because thinking encryption backdoors would only be used by "the good guys" is a great example of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/magical-thinking">magical thinking</a>).</p>
<p>Imagine, for the sake of this exercise, the MagicalLock for this MagicalKey is impossible to pick, and imagine only police officers have MagicalKeys. Let's say one thousand police officers each have a MagicalKey.</p>
<p>They argue they need to be able to unlock anyone's door if they suspect a crime is happening inside. "It's for safety!"</p>
<p>Overtime, let's say only 1% of the police officers accidentally lose their MagicalKey. This kind of things happen. Now 10 MagicalKeys are lost in the wild and could be used by anyone else, for any purposes, including crime.</p>
<p>Then, let's say only 0.1% of police officers get corrupted by a crime gang. That's just one right? This corrupted "good guy" lets the gang create a double of the MagicalKey. Which crime gang wouldn't want a key that can magically open any door? They pay the police officer good money for this. It's an investment.</p>
<p>Now, the gang creates doubles of the MagicalKey they have. They obfuscate its serial number, so it cannot be traced back to them. They use it subtly at first to avoid detection. They make sure they never leave traces behind, so victims have no idea their door got unlocked.</p>
<p>During this time, they steal your data, they sell it, they use it to impersonate you, they use it to harm you and your loved ones.</p>
<p>Then, another criminal figures out on their own how to emulate a MagicalKey without even having access to one. The criminal creates a reproducible mold for this Emulated-MagicalKey and sells it to other criminals on the criminal market. Now, the MagicalKey™️ is available to any criminals looking for it. Restrictions on the backdoor are off. <strong>Your personal data is up for grabs.</strong></p>
<p>This is what is going to happen if backdoors are implemented in end-to-end encryption. But don't worry they say, "it's only for the good guys!".</p>
<p>At least, the criminals' data will also be up for grabs, right?</p>
<p>Nope! The criminals knew about this, so they just started using different channels that weren't impacted. Criminals will have their privacy intact, they don't care about using illegal tools, but <strong>your legal privacy protections will be gone</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Backdoored</em> end-to-end encryption isn't end-to-end anymore, it's just open-ended encryption. This offers pretty much no protection at all.</p>
<h2 id="ignoring-experts-doesnt-make-facts-disappear">Ignoring experts doesn't make facts disappear</h2>
<p>Where is the opposition to this? Where are the experts pushing against this nightmare? Everywhere.</p>
<p>Thankfully, opposition has been strong, despite the relentless ignorance or malevolence from authoritarian authorities repeatedly pushing against encryption.</p>
<p>Many people and groups have been fighting valiantly to defend our collective right to privacy and security. Countless experts have patiently taken the time to explain <a href="https://signal.org/blog/uk-online-safety-bill/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2020/10/cdt-gpd-and-internet-society-reject-time-worn-argument-for-encryption-backdoors/">again</a> and <a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf">again</a> how an encryption backdoor only for "the good guys" is simply impossible.</p>
<p>Weakening encryption to let "the good guys" enter, lets <em>anyone</em> enter, including criminals. There is no way around this.</p>
<p>Seemingly ignoring warnings and advice from the most respected specialists in the field, authoritarian officials continue to push against encryption. So much so that it has become difficult to assume good intent misguided by ignorance at this point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, ignoring the experts or silencing the debate will not make the facts magically disappear.</p>
<p>In an encouraging development this week, Apple <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgn1lz3v4no">won a case</a> fighting an attempt from the UK Home Office to hide from the public details of their latest attack on encryption.</p>
<p>This battle and all battles to protect our privacy rights, <em>must</em> be fought is broad daylight, for all to see and to support.</p>
<h2 id="fight-for-encryption-rights-everywhere-you-can">Fight for encryption rights everywhere you can</h2>
<p>The war against encryption isn't anything new, it has been happening for decades. However, the quantity of data, personal and sensitive data, that is collected, stored, and shared about us is much larger today. It is essential we use the proper tools to secure this information.</p>
<p>This is what have changed, and what is making encryption and end-to-end encryption even more indispensable today.</p>
<p>Mass surveillance will not keep us safe, it will endanger us further and damage our democracies and freedoms in irreparable ways.</p>
<p>We must fight to keep our right to privacy, and use of strong end-to-end encryption to protect ourselves, our friends, our family, and yes also to protect the children.</p>

This blog post will dive into what distributed file systems are and how 3FS operates, starting with some background.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-distributed-filesystem">What is a distributed filesystem?</h2> <p>Distributed filesystems trick applications into thinking they’re talking to a regular local filesystem. This abstraction is incredibly powerful: a file that’s actually fragmented across 10 different machines appears as a simple file path like <code>/3fs/stage/notes.txt</code></p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/part1/local_distributed_fs.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Using the distributed filesystem is no different than local filesystem </em> </p> </div> <p>In the image above, I create the same folder and file on a local and distributed filesystem by running <code>mkdir</code> and <code>cat</code>. The commands are exactly the same. With a distributed filesystem, all of those details are abstracted away from the user, who can simply work with the files without worrying about how many machines, network calls or disks are involved behind the scene.</p> <h2 id="why-use-a-distributed-filesystem">Why use a distributed filesystem?</h2> <p>Distributed filesystems provide two main advantages over local storage – they can serve massive amounts of data (up to petabytes) and provide high throughput that exceed the capabilities of a single machine. They offer fault tolerance (the system keeps running if one machine goes down) and redundancy (if data gets corrupted on one node, other nodes have original copies).</p> <p>Distributed filesystems are used in many practical applications:</p> <ul> <li>Parallel processing frameworks (<a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HDFS</a> supporting <a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2014/01/21/spark-and-hadoop.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Spark</a>)</li> <li>ML training pipelines with <a href="https://github.com/stas00/ml-engineering/blob/master/storage/README.md" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dataloaders and checkpointing</a> </li> <li>Internal large-scale code/data repositories supported by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/storage-data-transfer/a-peek-behind-colossus-googles-file-system" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google’s Colossus</a> </li> <li>Industry applications like <a href="https://juicefs.com/en/blog/user-stories/juicefs-vs-cephfs-distributed-file-system-artificial-intelligence-storage" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Traveling</a> </li> <li>Photo storage is served by <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi10/tech/full_papers/Beaver.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Meta’s Haystack</a> </li> </ul> <h2 id="a-deep-dive-into-3fs">A deep dive into 3FS</h2> <p>So, how does 3FS work?</p> <p>At its core, 3FS consists of four primary node types:</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/explain/overview.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Components involved in 3FS </em> </p> </div> <p>The components serve distinct purposes:</p> <ol> <li> <strong>Meta</strong> – manage the metadata: file locations, properties, paths, etc.</li> <li> <strong>Mgmtd</strong> – management server controls the cluster configuration: where are other nodes, which nodes are alive, and replication factor <ul> <li>Think of it as a router that knows every node’s address and can help nodes find each other<span></span><span>A similar analogy is the centralized server used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_punching_(networking)" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NAT hole punching</a></span>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Storage</strong> – nodes that hold the actual file data on physical disks.</li> <li> <strong>Client</strong> – communicates with all other nodes to view and modify the filesystem: <ul> <li>ask Mgmtd to discover other nodes</li> <li>ask Meta servers to perform file operations (open, stat, close, symlink)</li> <li>transfer data with storage nodes</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Now let’s look at each component in greater detail.</p> <h2 id="mgmtd">Mgmtd</h2> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/explain/mgmtd_register.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Mgmtd Registering </em> </p> </div> <p>Mgmtd tracks what nodes are running in the cluster. Storage and meta nodes register when they boot up, sending periodic heartbeats to confirm they’re still alive. This gives a central view of the system – one can immediately identify which nodes are down.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/explain/mgmtd_request.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Mgmtd Requests </em> </p> </div> <p>Nodes don’t need to maintain connections with every other node in the network.

Clients communicate with it via RPC calls. The meta server performs typical filesystem operations (open, create, stat, unlink) on the metastore. File metadata resides in inodes, storing properties like size, permissions, owner, and timestamps. DirEntry objects map paths to inodes, with multiple DirEntries possible for a single file (similar to symlinks). Both inodes and DirEntries are stored in FoundationDB<span></span><span>One might wonder what the keys to founationdb look like? Inode: “INOD + inode id, dir entry: “DENT” + nodeid + path</span> using transactions for idempotent operations. A session manager tracks open files, storing file sessions in FoundationDB. If clients disconnect without closing files, the session manager initiates file syncs. File deletion requests queue to a garbage collector, which removes data from storage nodes before deleting directory entries and inodes.</p> <h2 id="storage">Storage</h2> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/explain/storage_overview.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Storage overview </em> </p> </div> <p>The storage node’s main function is manage data on physical storage by breaking it up into chunks:</p> <ul> <li>The Rust ChunkEngine<span></span><span>Why Rust? Well, there’s a legacy chunk manager named <code>ChunkStore</code> that’s written in C++. I don’t see really why in rust, probably because it’s interesting to work in and provides more safety guarantees</span> keeps track of blocks of disk storage. <ul> <li>Chunks represent a piece of physical disk and keeps track of its metadata (id, size, offset on disk, physical disk, checksums, versions, …). This is the most primitive data structure that all other structures use to keep track of blocks of data.</li> <li>The chunk engine doesn’t allow users to interact with chunks directly since it would add complexity to using engine. The interface to the engine has operations which gives users a rigid and clear way to interact with the engine (lookup, allocation, commit, metadata…)</li> <li>By default, all of this is stored in <a href="https://github.com/google/leveldb" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">LevelDB</a> with a prefix byte repesenting the type of operation (querying the metadata) and the chunk id as the key.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are different workers that uses the chunk engine to maintain the physical storage <ul> <li>The AllocateWorker allocates new chunks in the chunk engine</li> <li>The PunchHoleWorker reclaims chunks if they’re no longer used</li> <li>The AioReadWorker processes reads requests to the chunks and queues reads in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">io_uring</a> queue, submits and waits for completion<span></span><span>Initially, I was surprised. The chunk engine doesn’t perform operations on the actual physical disk, it really only manages the metadata. One reason for this might be to keep the ChunkEngine implementation rather lean by having it only try to manage metadata.</span>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The storage node needs to know how to forward a write to the next target in a CRAQ chain<span></span><span>For now, just know that writes need to be forwarded to other nodes</span> <ul> <li>Targets consist of chunks (think of this as logical store containing different chunks)</li> <li>A chain consists of multiple targets (typically spanning multiple nodes)</li> <li>The storage node queries the mgmtd server for other nodes’ chains and the corresponding targets (nodes) in that chain that a write needs to forward to.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 id="craq">CRAQ</h2> <p>CRAQ (<a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Chain Replication with Apportioned Queries</a>) is a protocol for achieving strong consistency with linearizability. It serves as the core mechanism to keep data chunks fault-tolerant. I’ll explain how CRAQ works and then, show its implementation in 3FS.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/craq/craq_write_dirty.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Craq write propagation </em> </p> </div> <p>Writes begin at the head. In our example, we write <code>name=henry</code> to the system. As the write moves down the chain, each entry is marked as “dirty” with a version number. Dirty entries aren’t safe to read. Once the write reaches the tail, it’s committed and marked as “clean”.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/craq/craq_write_clean.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Craq write commit </em> </p> </div> <p>Writes become clean as commit messages propagates backward from tail to head. Each node commits the entry and marks it clean.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/craq/craq_read_clean.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Craq clean read </em> </p> </div> <p>For reads, the process is straightforward: if an object is clean, it’s immediately returned to the client.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/craq/craq_read_dirty.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Craq dirty read </em> </p> </div> <p>The challenge occurs with dirty objects. Each chain tracks both dirty and clean versions. Since the tail always contains the latest committed data, the replica queries the tail for the most recent committed object, ensuring strong consistency.</p> <h3 id="craq-performance">CRAQ performance</h3> <p>CRAQ read and write performance varies by workload. Write throughput and latency are limited by the slowest node in the chain, as writes must process through each node sequentially. For example, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">zipfian</a> workloads (where frequently accessed data dominates), read performance suffers because objects may be dirty, forcing queries to the tail node. This creates a bottleneck as the tail must serve most of the read requests.</p> <h3 id="how-is-craq-used-in-3fs">How is CRAQ used in 3FS</h3> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/craq/craq_stripe.svg" alt=""></p><p><em>Storage is striped and CRAQ runs ontop </em> </p> </div> <p>In this example, 5 nodes with 5 SSDs each form the cluster. Storage targets replicate to 3 nodes, designed to avoid overlap so that node failures don’t affect overall throughput significantly<span></span><span>Consider an extreme scenario where all the chains are placed on nodes 1, 2, 3. If node 1 fails, the distributed system would serve lose 1/3 of the total throughput instead of 1/5 of total throughput shown in the above image. <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/3FS/blob/ee9a5cee0a85c64f4797bf380257350ca1becd36/docs/design_notes.md" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">3FS design notes</a> shows an example with a deeper explanation.</span>. CRAQ operates on top, managing head, middle, and tail nodes.</p> <p>3FS defaults to strongly consistent reads. Writes flow from head to tail and back, with throughput limited by the slowest node and latency determined by the combined latency across all chain nodes.</p> <div> <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://maknee.github.io/assets/images/posts/2025-03-13/papers/ionia-table-1.svg" width="100%" alt=""></p> </div> <p>As shown in the comparison table, in the common case, CRAQ delivers scalable, low-latency reads at the cost of high write latency compared to other protocols and systems.</p> <h2 id="other-distributed-filesystems">Other distributed filesystems</h2> <p>One might ask – is this architecture different from other distributed filesystems? At a high level, the components are familiar – some notion of client, metadata, storage, and management nodes appear in virtually every distributed system.</p> <p>The difference lies in its real-world applicability and practical implementation:</p> <ul> <li>which workloads it excels at handling</li> <li>its tuning flexibility</li> <li>deployment simplicity</li> <li>throughput scaling capabilities</li> <li>maintaining latency within SLOs</li> <li>reliability</li> </ul> <p>and its finer technical details that determines its usability:</p> <ul> <li>what bottlenecks are there</li> <li>how it manages bottlenecks</li> <li>its approach to locking (or absence thereof)</li> <li>the specific data structures employed</li> <li>the hardware the software was designed for</li> <li>what fault tolerant algorithm or erasure coding is used</li> </ul> <h2 id="rest-of-the-blog-series">Rest of the blog series</h2> <p>With that in mind, I want to dive deep into analyzing the performance of this relatively new open-source distributed filesystem<span></span><span>Distributed filesystems come once in blue moon, taking <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341301.3359656" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">several years to develop</a></span>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="6377682eae43">Rust is fast at runtime — but not so much at compile time. That’s hardly news to anyone who's worked on a serious Rust codebase. There's a whole genre of blog posts dedicated to shaving seconds off <code>cargo build</code>.</p><p id="02396083fc04">At Feldera, we let users write SQL to define tables and views. Under the hood, we compile that SQL into Rust code — which is then compiled with <code>rustc</code> to a single binary that <em>incrementally</em> maintains all views as new data streams into tables.</p><p id="e41db72a2add">We’ve already pulled a lot of tricks in the past to speed up compilation: type erasure, aggressive code deduplication, limiting codegen lines. And that got us quite far. However, recently we started on-boarding a new, large enterprise client with fairly complicated SQL. They wrote many, very large programs with Feldera. For example, one of them was 8562 lines of SQL code that eventually is translated to ~100k lines of Rust code by the Feldera SQL-to-Rust compiler.</p><p id="bdcd93336be9">To be clear, this isn’t some massive monolith we’re compiling. We’re talking about ~100k lines of generated Rust. That’s peanuts compared to something like the Linux kernel — 40 million lines (which manages to compile in a few minutes).</p><p id="c7db6351896a">And yet… this one program was taking around 25 minutes to compile on my machine. Worse, on our customer's setup it took about 45 minutes. And this was after we already switched the code that is generated to <a href="https://github.com/feldera/feldera/pull/1516">using dynamic dispatch and pretty much eliminated all monomorphization</a>.</p><p id="62ab9a17db22">Here's the log from the Feldera manager:</p><div><pre><code><span>[manager] SQL compilation success: pipeline 0196268e-7f98-7de3-b728-0ee339e449fa (program version: 2) (took 101.94s)

The SQL-to-Rust translation takes about 1m40s. Even worse, the Rust build is doing the equivalent of a <code>release</code> build in <code>cargo</code>, so it happens from scratch every time (except for cargo crate dependencies which are already cached/re-used in the times we give here). Even the tiniest change in the input SQL kicks off a full rebuild of that giant program.</p><p id="b07f172716e7">Of course, we tried debug builds too. Those cut the time down to ~5 minutes — but they’re not usable in practice. Our customers care about actual runtime performance: when the SQL code type-checks, they already know the Rust code will compile successfully and they're running real-time data pipelines and want to see end-to-end latency and throughput. Debug builds are just too slow and misleading for that.</p><h3 id="9b2e079a5221">What's happening?</h3><p id="b2b0e71fd4cf">Here’s the frustrating part.</p><p id="be3154016cc8">We're using <code>rustc</code> v1.83, and despite having a 64-core machine with 128 threads, Rust barely puts any of them to work. This becomes evident quickly when looking at <code>htop</code> during the compliation:</p><p><img alt="An idle machine as seen in htop" loading="lazy" width="2178" height="278" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.feldera.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fnlte859i%2Fproduction%2F4ad1b4f49c929971aefe2dbcea6ea2be94b0c5cf-2178x278.png%3Fq%3D75%26fit%3Dclip%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://www.feldera.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fnlte859i%2Fproduction%2F4ad1b4f49c929971aefe2dbcea6ea2be94b0c5cf-2178x278.png%3Fq%3D75%26fit%3Dclip%26auto%3Dformat&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p id="f9a1e3025e9d">That’s right.

We use <code>mold</code> and we see the total link time is only around <code>7 sec</code>.</li></ul><h3 id="9a8832de1ebc">Conclusion</h3><p id="9c07947dc521">By simply changing how we generate Rust code under the hood, we’ve made Feldera’s compile times scale with your hardware instead of fighting it. What used to take 30–45 minutes now compiles in under 3 minutes, even for complex enterprise-scale SQL.</p><p id="30222fc0034b">If you’re already pushing Feldera to its limits: thank you.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p><span>During Japan’s Sengoku (Warring States) period, there was one name that instantly struck fear into the hearts of even the most powerful feudal lords: “Oda,” as in the </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/japanese-culture/what-age-of-samurai-didnt-tell-you-about-oda-nobunaga/"><span>merciless master maneuverer</span></a><span> Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582). Interestingly, around the same time, there was a name that elicited the exact opposite reaction, and it was also “Oda” — as in Oda Ujiharu, master of Oda Castle in modern-day Ibaraki Prefecture, whose constant losing streak made him known as the weakest Sengoku samurai warlord. Why, then, do so many people admire him today? Let’s find out.</span></p>

<div id="attachment_265631"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265631" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oda-ujiharu-002-1600x1059.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1059" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oda-ujiharu-002-1600x1059.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oda-ujiharu-002-1600x1059.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265631">Taken from “The Siege of Shimoasakusa Castle” | Wikimedia</p></div>
<h2 id="6800c3579cd24">The Loser Phoenix of Hitachi</h2>
<p><span>Born sometime in the 1530s (perhaps even in 1534, though that may have been an invention to draw parallels between Ujiharu and Nobunaga), the weakest samurai warlord in history has no connection to the </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/japanese-culture/the-brave-gunjyo-senki-film-and-the-portrayal-of-oda-nobunaga-in-fiction/"><span>Demon King</span></a><span>. Their names are written with different characters and point to two vastly different lineages. Nobunaga hailed from a relatively minor family in Owari (modern-day Aichi), while Ujiharu was connected to the Hatta clan that once was a major player in the Kamakura shogunate. He was also a close relative of many important figures in the Ashikaga shogunate.</span></p>
<p><span>Ujiharu ruled the strategically important Hitachi Province from the massive Oda Castle, whose entire complex was 4.6 times larger than Tokyo Dome. That wasn’t the main reason why, like, four different warlords kept stealing it from him, but it probably was a factor. During the Sengoku period, both the shogunate and the emperor effectively lost power, so Ujiharu’s ancestry meant nothing to the Hojo, Yuki, Satake or Uesugi clans, who conquered Oda Castle a total of </span><i><span>nine times.</span></i></p>
<p><span>Losing one’s home once was often enough to drive a Sengoku samurai to commit seppuku out of shame, but if Ujiharu dismembered himself every time he lost Oda Castle, he’d have been just a head floating in a jar by the end.</span></p>
<p><span>However, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/kyQrl7AWeXg?feature=shared&amp;t=162"><span>a wise man once said:</span></a><span> “[It] ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward.” Ujiharu may have lost Oda Castle nine times, but that means he also </span><i><span>won it back eight times, </span></i><span>almost always with smaller armies. His refusal to accept defeat and his iron will to get up and keep fighting is why many historians reject the “weakest samurai warlord” nickname and instead refer to him as “The Phoenix.”</span></p>
<div id="attachment_265630"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265630" src="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oda-ujiharu-003-1600x1059.jpg" alt="" width="1600" height="1059" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-src-img="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oda-ujiharu-003-1600x1059.jpg" data-src-webp="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/oda-ujiharu-003-1600x1059.jpg.webp"></p><p id="caption-attachment-265630">Oda Ujiharu, artist unknown | Wikimedia</p></div>
<h2 id="6800c3579cd30">Man of the People</h2>
<p><span>Ujiharu lost Oda Castle so many times because he made bafflingly bad military decisions. During his war with the Satake clan, Ujiharu’s chief strategist — </span><i><span>on his deathbed </span></i><span>— begged his lord to barricade himself and his army in the fortification, wait for reinforcements and not meet the enemy on the field.</span></p>
<p><span>The castle’s main defenses were its walls, moats and nearby rivers. Outside that, Oda Castle was surrounded by flatlands. And yet, ignoring his strategist’s </span><i><span>dying words</span></i><span>, the lord of Hitachi refused to stay put and challenged the Satake to open combat. He was then cut off from his base by the enemy’s hidden forces, allowing them to take Oda Castle. This was the</span><i><span> second time </span></i><span>that this exact same strategy lost Ujiharu his ancestral home. Some other wise man once said: “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”</span></p>
<p><span>However, Ujiharu’s blind charges may actually have had a noble purpose. Japanese battles involving castles almost always turned into sieges, and those always ended the same way: with the nearby fields and peasant settlements being either destroyed to try and draw the lord out of the castle or looted to feed the occupying army. Some researchers believe that Ujiharu was trying to avoid a siege to save his subjects.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if that wasn’t the case and he was simply a really bad strategist, his retainers and farmers chose to see the best in their lord and were fiercely loyal to him. During Ujiharu’s early campaigns, some of his men did defect to the enemy, but a few raids to protect or take back Oda Castle later and you apparently could not threaten or pay off anyone in Ujiharu’s service to move against him. Forget “The Phoenix”: “A Feudal Lord Actually Liked by His Retainers and Farmers” may be less pithy but is much more impressive.</span></p>
<h2 id="6800c3579cd34">Everybody Makes Mistakes</h2>
<p><span>The main arguments against Ujiharu’s incompetence were his obvious diplomatic skills. During his fight with the Hojo, Yuki, Satake or Uesugi families, he kept forming alliances and switching sides to best serve his own purposes, and he would not have been able to do that unless he could skillfully talk his way into the good graces of his former enemies.</span></p>
<p><span>That being said, he did make mistakes, like betraying Uesugi Kenshin, one of Japan’s most powerful and feared warlords, often mentioned in the same breath as Oda Nobunaga (plus </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/japanese-culture/the-rise-and-fall-of-japans-warrior-monks/"><span>an ordained monk</span></a><span> fueled in battle by his fiery faith). This cost him Oda Castle, but he later got it back. Then he lost it a few more times until he made his ultimate mistake: refusing to swear allegiance to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After the death of Nobunaga, Hideyoshi continued his master’s quest to unify Japan and eventually arrived at Ujiharu’s doorstep demanding his fealty.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the lord of Oda Castle was worried about losing his home (either due to personal attachment or to protect his people) and took too long to give his answer. So, Hideyoshi conquered his lands and stripped Ujiharu of all his titles because Japan back then operated on prison rules; you couldn’t afford to show weakness. After some begging, Hideyoshi spared Ujiharu’s life, who then went to live with Yuki Hideyasu, son of Tokugawa Ieyasu (Toranaga on </span><a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/entertainment/movies-tv/shogun-2024-series-review/"><i><span>Shogun</span></i></a><span>). A bit of an ignoble end, but the other Oda got </span><a href="https://unseen-japan.com/oda-nobunaga-honnoji-incident/#More_than_a_Traitor_Akechi_Mitsuhide"><span>betrayed by his general</span></a><span> and had to commit seppuku in a burning temple, so who’s the real winner here?</span></p>

<p>The team, led by the University of Cambridge in the UK, detected signs of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b.</p>
<p>This planet orbits its star in the habitable zone (sometimes called the <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/goldilocks-zone">Goldilocks Zone</a>), which is the region around a star in which an orbiting planet might have conditions suitable for the emergence of life, such as the ability for liquid water to exist on its surface.</p>
<p>K2-18b is 8.6 times as massive and 2.6 times as large as Earth and lies 124 <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/lightyear">lightyears</a> away from our planet.</p>

<h2><strong>Building a bigger picture</strong></h2>
<p>This isn't the first study of exoplanet K2-18b. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/jwst-finds-life-exoplanet-k2-18b">2023 study of K2-18b</a> by the same team identified methane and carbon dioxide in the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>This in itself was a huge discovery: the first time carbon-based molecules had been found in the atmosphere of an exoplanet – a planet beyond our Solar System – in the habitable zone.</p>
<p>Astronomers say the 2023 results showed K2-18b could be a ‘Hycean’ planet, meaning a <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/what-makes-a-planet-habitable">habitable world</a> with a liquid ocean and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.</p>
<p>That earlier study found a tantalising hint of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide, but this latest study has made a more promising detection.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="2160" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2023/09/Atmospheric-compoistion-of-k2-18b.png?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Atmospheric compoistion of k2-18b, detected by the James Webb Space Telescope"><figcaption>This graph shows detections of chemicals in the atmosphere of K2-18b by the James Webb Space Telescope, as part of the 2023 study</figcaption></figure>
<p>"We didn’t know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument," says Professor Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, who led the research.</p>
<p>The team say that on Earth, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are only produced by life, mainly microbial life like <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/earth-from-space/algae-bloom-from-space">phytoplankton</a> we see in our oceans.</p>
<p>However, there could be another explanation for the detection of the chemical.</p>
<p>Another unknown chemical process could be the source of the molecules detected in K2-18b’s atmosphere.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="631" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2025/04/K2-18b-exoplanet.jpg?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Artist's impression of exoplanet K2-18b. Credit: A. Smith, N. Madhusudhan (University of Cambridge)"><figcaption>Artist's impression of exoplanet K2-18b. Credit: A. Smith, N. Madhusudhan (University of Cambridge)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nevertheless, the team say "the results are the "strongest evidence yet" that life may exist on a planet outside our Solar System.</p>
<p>They say their observations have reached the ‘three-sigma’ level of statistical significance.</p>
<p>This means there's a 0.3% probability the detection occurred by chance.</p>
<p>And to reach the accepted level that would mean scientific discovery, observations would have to meet the five-sigma threshold.</p>
<p>In other words, there would need to be below a 0.00006% probability they occurred by chance.</p>

<h2><strong>Detecting life on faraway worlds</strong></h2>
<p>How can scientists know what chemicals exist on a planet orbiting a star beyond our Solar System?</p>
<p>Key to analysing exoplanets' atmospheres is analysing the light from their host stars.</p>
<p>As a planet passes in front of its host star from our perspective on Earth – known as a <a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/exoplanets-transit-method">transit</a> – light from that star passes through the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>That starlight picks up chemical fingerprints as it passes through the atmosphere, so astronomers can analyse the light to learn more about the atmosphere. </p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1200" height="759" src="https://c02.purpledshub.com/uploads/sites/48/2021/04/Exoplanet-transit-method-aeba46b.jpg?webp=1&amp;w=1200" alt="Transit photometry reveals exoplanets by observing periodic dimming of the star's light."><figcaption>A dip in starlight can indicate a planet 'transiting' that star. But as well as detecting exoplanets, transits can be used by astronomers to learn more about an exoplanet's atmosphere</figcaption></figure>
<p>The tentative detection of dimethyl sulfide in 2023 was made using the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRISS (Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph) and NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instruments.</p>
<p>This 2025 study used the Webb Telescope's MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument), which observes in a different wavelength of light, offering the team a new look at this intriguing world.</p>
<p>"This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations," says Madhusudhan.</p>
<p>"The signal came through strong and clear."</p>
<p>"It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests," says co-author Måns Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA.</p>

<p>The team say dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are molecules from the same chemical family, and could be '<a href="https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/biosignatures-exoplanets">biosignatures</a>'.</p>
<p>This is a term used to describe chemicals that, when detected around a distant planet, could indicate the presence of biological processes, i.e. life.</p>
<p>Yet the concentrations of dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in K2-18b's atmosphere are different from those on Earth.</p>
<p>On Earth, dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are below one part per billion by volume. On K2-18b, they're thought to be thousands of times stronger, over ten parts per million.</p>
<p>"Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide are possible on Hycean worlds," says Madhusudhan.</p>
<p>"And now we’ve observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have."</p>
<p>The team now hope to carry out more research into whether dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide can be produced non-biologically at the level they're currently seeing.</p>

<p>"The inference of these biosignature molecules poses profound questions concerning the processes that might be producing them" says study co-author Subhajit Sarkar of Cardiff University.</p>
<p>"Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings," says co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy.</p>
<p>"It’s important that we’re deeply sceptical of our own results, because it’s only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we’re confident in them," says Madhusudhan. "That’s how science has to work.</p>
<p>"Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach.</p>
<p>"This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we’re alone in the universe is one we’re capable of answering."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-2080249921577037368" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I always assumed that the recognisable 'whoosh' sound a plane makes when passing overhead simply comes from the famous <i>Doppler effect</i>. But when you listen closely, this explanation doesn't make complete sense.</p>






<p>(Audio clipped from <a href="https://freesound.org/people/bruno.auzet/sounds/706432/">freesound</a>)</p>

<p>A classic example of the Doppler effect is the sound of a passing ambulance constantly descending in pitch. When a plane flies overhead the roar of the engine sometimes does that as well. But you can also hear a wider, breathier noise that does something different: it's like the pitch goes down at first, but when the plane has passed us, the pitch <i>goes up</i> again. That's not how Doppler works! What's going on there?</p>

<h3>Comb filtering.</h3>

<p>Let's shed light on the mystery by taking a look at the sound in a time-frequency spectrogram. Here, time runs from top to bottom, frequencies from left (low) to right (high).</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAaOGJ0_mW_OWy2A0W2yp-_SRiqVJEfI0Vr6b3w_L-ByIBnYu23rtt2Jgwk6hMkNxJOIm5Hd8JFYt5oDtFofaBvzWUUQqTzRdCN4a9DBdEQu-qnZfWcfbpJhfO1ZIHVPWa0IkdRsMiG6AJCHGgOl3eK8UfBQw7WgxFyu9-pVhLJCBVuMuRaUXv6wnH3CuS/s858/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.51.58.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="500" data-original-width="858" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiAaOGJ0_mW_OWy2A0W2yp-_SRiqVJEfI0Vr6b3w_L-ByIBnYu23rtt2Jgwk6hMkNxJOIm5Hd8JFYt5oDtFofaBvzWUUQqTzRdCN4a9DBdEQu-qnZfWcfbpJhfO1ZIHVPWa0IkdRsMiG6AJCHGgOl3eK8UfBQw7WgxFyu9-pVhLJCBVuMuRaUXv6wnH3CuS/s858/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.51.58.jpg" width="500"></a></p>

<p>We can clearly see one part of the sound sweeping from right to left, or from high to low frequencies; this should be the Doppler effect. But there's something else happening on the left side.</p>

<p>The sound's frequency distribution seems to form a series of moving peaks and valleys. This resembles what audio engineers would call <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_filter">'comb filtering'</a>, due to its appearance in the spectrogram. When the peaks and valleys move about it causes a 'whoosh' sound; this is the same principle as in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanging">flanger</a> effect used in music production. But these are just jargon for the electronically created version. We can call the acoustic phenomenon the whoosh.</p>

<p>The comb pattern is caused by two copies of the same exact sound arriving at a slightly different times, close enough that they form an interference pattern. It's closely related to what happens to light in the <a href="https://thefouriertransform.com/applications/diffraction3.php">double slit experiment</a>. In recordings this often means that the sound was captured by two microphones and then mixed together; you can sometimes hear this happen unintentionally in podcasts and radio shows. So my thought process is, are we hearing two copies of the plane's sound? How much later is the other one arriving, and why? And why does the 'whoosh' appear to go down in pitch at first, then up again?</p>

<h3>Into the cepstral domain.</h3>

<p>The <i>cepstrum</i>, which is the inverse Fourier transform of the estimated log spectrum, is a fascinating plot for looking at delays and echoes in complex (as in complicated) signals. While the spectrum separates frequencies, the cepstrum measures time, or <i>quefrency</i> – see what they did there? It reveals cyclicities in the sound's structure even if it interferes with itself, like in our case.</p>

<p>It's also useful for looking at sounds that, experientially, have a 'pitch' to them but that don't show any clear spectral peak in the Fourier transform. Just like the sound we're interested in.</p>

<p>Here's a time-<i>quefrency cepstrogram</i> of the same sound (to be accurate, I used the <i>autocepstrum</i> here for better clarity; autocorrelation would also work):</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1VOwgKsPuBeVTFUk9oq8zFJ_zEOjEx9eUB5ic4KKHFUVNtLYmPbDweOo2gfiokWxlZcc4038dO29gSq31mBXLZuJX1dHjAZ-oKPDDEGDBS1NJ0a_4MQfWA972iGLLEjYM8at0jlL4MtTmQQLVuR_t_liH8iyrwoPN90587N59xflXUqWZuWajevxw-9Tm/s859/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.39.15.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="501" data-original-width="859" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh1VOwgKsPuBeVTFUk9oq8zFJ_zEOjEx9eUB5ic4KKHFUVNtLYmPbDweOo2gfiokWxlZcc4038dO29gSq31mBXLZuJX1dHjAZ-oKPDDEGDBS1NJ0a_4MQfWA972iGLLEjYM8at0jlL4MtTmQQLVuR_t_liH8iyrwoPN90587N59xflXUqWZuWajevxw-9Tm/s501/Na%CC%88ytto%CC%88kuva%202025-04-13%20kello%2012.39.15.jpg" width="501"></a></p>

<p>The Doppler effect is less prominent here. Instead, the plot shows a sweeping peak that seems to agree with the pitch change we hear. This delay time sweeps from around 4 milliseconds to 9 ms and back. Note that the scale: higher frequencies (shorter times) are on the left side this time.</p>

<h3>Ground echo?</h3>

<p>Here's my hypothesis. We are hearing not only the direct sound from the plane but also a delayed echo from a nearby flat surface. These two sound get superimposed and interfere before they reach our ears. The effect would be especially prominent with planes because there is little in the way of the sound either from above or from the large surface. And what could be a large reflective surface outdoors? Well, the ground below!</p>

<p>Let's think about the numbers. The ground is around one-and-a-half metres below our ears. When a plane is directly overhead, the reflected sound needs to take a path that's three metres longer (two-way) than the direct path. Since sound travels 343 metres per second this translates to a difference of 9 milliseconds!</p>

<p>Below, I used GeoGebra to calculate the time difference (between the yellow and green paths) in milliseconds.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiA4ggy0g82ccmz9ywX_sLR8Y8-DjRgFT1F9fuU1uz4Bouan-j9K63jWL7qnhFTOeQVI_qDh6gq897-_AOhw6UgGtz4aZJRjrGuuBRIyPsHeDBj62gvDTlYZGssXSTogxnBKZBXZtZkd-bfZiy_VYKfDmq82o6s3S1pZD8P3Cb6rMHqY_C6acR5iaKGsxLd/s1200/delayed.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="366" data-original-width="1200" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiA4ggy0g82ccmz9ywX_sLR8Y8-DjRgFT1F9fuU1uz4Bouan-j9K63jWL7qnhFTOeQVI_qDh6gq897-_AOhw6UgGtz4aZJRjrGuuBRIyPsHeDBj62gvDTlYZGssXSTogxnBKZBXZtZkd-bfZiy_VYKfDmq82o6s3S1pZD8P3Cb6rMHqY_C6acR5iaKGsxLd/s520/delayed.png" width="520"></a></p>

<p>When the plane is far away the angle is shallower, the two paths are more similar in distance, and the time difference is shorter.</p>

<p>It would follow that a taller person hears the sound differently than a shorter one, or someone in a tenth-floor window! If the ground is very soft, maybe in a mossy grove, you probably wouldn't hear the effect at all; just the Doppler effect. But this prediction needs to be tested out in a real forest.</p>

<p>Here's what a minimal acoustic simulation model renders. We'll just put a flying white noise source in the sky and a reflective surface as the ground. Let's only update the IR at 15 fps to prevent the Doppler phenomenon from emerging.</p>





<p>Whoosh!</p>

<h3>Some everyday whooshes.</h3>

<p>The whoosh isn't only associated with planes. When it occurs naturally it usually needs three things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a sound with a lot of structure (preferably a hissy or breathy noise)</li>
  <li>an unobstructed echo from a closeby surface (either close to you or to the source of sound)</li>
  <li>and some kind of physical movement.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've heard this outdoors when the sound of a waterfall was reflecting off a brick wall (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Amj4UevyRfU">video</a>); and next to a motorway when the sound barrier provided the reflection. You can hear it in some films – for instance, in the original Home Alone when Kevin puts down the pizza box after taking a whiff (<a href="https://youtu.be/H6M_mFUH35s?t=100">video</a>)!</p>

<p>Try it yourself: move your head towards a wall – or a laptop screen – and back away from it, while making a continuous 'hhhh' or 'shhh' noise. Listen closely but don't close your eyes, you might bump your nose.</p>

<h3>A simple little plot.</h3>

<p>Finally, if you have JavaScript turned on you'll see (and hear) some more stuff in this blog post. In the interactive graph below you can move the aeroplane and listener around and see how the numbers change. The 'lag' or time difference we hear (orange arrow) comes from how much farther away the reflected virtual image is compared to the real aeroplane. In the lower right corner, the 'filter' spectrum up to 4.5 kHz is also drawn. The circles are there to visualize the direct distance.</p>








<p>Where have you encountered the whoosh?</p>

<p>According to a credible new report, Elon Musk has reportedly shut down an internal analysis from Tesla executives that showed the company’s Robotaxi plans would lose money and that it should focus on its more affordable ‘Model 2’.</p>



<p>In early 2024, we reported that<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Musk had canceled Tesla’s plan for a new affordable electric vehicle built on its upcoming ‘unboxed’ vehicle platform</a>, often referred to as ‘Model 2’ or ‘$25,000 Tesla’.</p>



<p>Instead, Musk pushed for only its new Robotaxi, also known as Cybercab, to be built on the new platform, and replaced the plans for a next-gen affordable EV with building<a href="https://electrek.co/2025/03/13/tesla-upcoming-cheaper-electric-car-stripped-down-model-y/?extended-comments=1"> cheaper versions of the Model Y and Model 3 with fewer features</a>.</p>



<p>This decision culminated a long-in-the-making shift at Tesla from an EV automaker to an AI company focusing on self-driving cars.</p>	
	



<p>We credit that shift initiated by Musk for the current slump Tesla finds itself in right now, where it has only launched a single new vehicle in the last 5 years, the Cybertruck, and it’s a total commercial flop.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/elon-musk-stopped-loving-cars-left-tesla-lurch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a> is out with a new in-depth report based on Tesla insiders that describe the decision-making process around the cancellation of the affordable Tesla and the focus on Robotaxi.</p>



<p>The report describes a meeting at the end of February 2024 when several Tesla executives were pushing Musk to greenlight the $25,000 Tesla:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the last week of February 2024, after a couple of years of back-and-forth debate on the Model 2, Musk called a meeting of a wide range of executives at Tesla’s oﬃces in Palo Alto, Calif. The proposed $25,000 car was on the agenda—a final chance to air the vehicle’s pros and cons, the people said. Musk’s senior lieutenants argued intensely for the economic logic of producing both the Model 2 and the Robotaxi.</p>

<p>After unveiling its next-generation battery in 2020, Musk announced that Tesla would make a $25,000 EV in 2020, but he had clearly soured on the idea by 2024.</p>

<p>He said in October 2024:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think having a regular $25,000 model is pointless. Yeah. It would be silly. Like, it’ll be completely at odds with what we believe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Information says that Daniel Ho, head of Tesla vehicle programs, Drew Baglino, SVP of engineering, and Rohan Patel, head of business development and policy, Lars Moravy, vice president of vehicle engineering, and Franz von Holzhausen, chief designer, all pushed for Musk to greenlight the production of the new $25,000 model.</p>



<p>Omead Afshar, a Musk loyalist who started out as his chief of staff and now h<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/10/17/tesla-leadership-shake-up-elon-musk-elevates-chief-of-staff-who-was-hot-water/">olds a wide-ranging executive role at Tesla</a>, reportedly said, “Is there a mutiny?”</p>



<p>The executives pointed to an internal report that didn’t paint a good picture of Tesla’s Robotaxi plan. The report has credibility as Patel commented on it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We had lots of modeling that showed the payback around FSD [Full Self Driving] and Robotaxi was going to be slow. It was going to be choppy. It was going to be very, very hard outside of the U.S., given the regulatory environment or lack of regulatory environment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk dismissed the analysis, greenlighted the Cybercab, and killed the $25,000 driveable Tesla vehicle in favor of the Model Y-based cheaper vehicle with fewer features.</p>



<p>The information describes the analysis:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Much of the work was done by analysts working under Baglino, head of power train and one of Musk’s most trusted aides. The calculations began with some simple math and some broad assumptions: Individuals would buy the cars, but a large portion of the sales would go to fleet operators, and the vehicles would mostly be used for ride-sharing. Many people would give up car ownership and use Robotaxis. Tesla would get a cut of each Robotaxi ride.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The analysis followed a lot of Musk’s assumptions, such as that the US car fleet would shrink from 15 million a year to roughly 3 million due to Robotaxis having a 5 times higher utilization rate.</p>



<p>They subtracted people who wouldn’t want to switch to a robotaxi for various reasons, arriving at a potential for 1 million self-driving vehicles a year.</p>



<p>One of the people familiar with the analysis said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There is ultimately a saturation of people who want to be ferried around in somebody else’s car.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After accounting for competition, Tesla figured it would be hard for robotaxis to replace the ~600,000 vehicles it sells in the US annually.</p>



<p>Tesla calculated that the robotaxis would bring in about $20,000 to $25,000 in revenue at the sale and about three times that from Tesla’s share of the fares it would complete over their lifetimes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The analysts figured Robotaxis would sell for between $20,000 and $25,000, and that Tesla could make up to three times that over the lifetime of the cars through its cut of fares. They added in capital spending and operational costs, plus services like charging stations and parking depots.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The internal analysis assigned a much lower value to Tesla robotaxis than Musk had previously stated publicly.</p>



<p>In 2019, Musk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If we make all cars with FSD package self-driving, as planned, any such Tesla should be worth $100k to $200k, as utility increases from ~12 hours/week to ~60 hours/week. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Tesla’s internal analysis pointed toward difficulties expanding into other markets, which could limit the scale and profitability of the robotaxi program. Ultimately, it predicted that it could lose money for years.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>For years, this has been one of my biggest concerns about Tesla: Musk surrounding himself with yesmen and not listening to others.</p>




	<p>This looks like a perfect example. It was a terrible decision fueled by Musk’s belief that he was smarter than anyone in the room and encouraged by sycophants like Afshar.</p>



<p>Musk has been selling Tesla shareholders on a perfect robotaxi future, but the truth is not as rosy, and that’s if they solve self-driving ahead of the competition, which is a big if.</p>



<p>It’s not new for the CEO to make outlandish growth promises, but it’s another thing to do at the detriment of an already profitable and fast-growing auto business.</p>



<p>The report also supports our suspicions that the shift in strategy contributed to some of Tesla’s talent exodus last year.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/i-left-spotify-what-happened-next/">https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/i-left-spotify-what-happened-next/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711706">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>When I stopped using Spotify I tried a few different solutions until I found the perfect replacement for me. If you want the tl;dr: I now use <a href="https://jellyfin.org/">Jellyfin</a>. But if you want to know how I got here, follow me through each step of the way.</p>

<p>I started gathering all my music files (<code>mp3</code>, or <code>flac</code>) in my computer, and from there I wanted to just listen to them the old way. The first issue I encountered was that none of the available music players were any good.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://coppolaemilio.com/assets/images/left-spotify/winamp.png" alt="">
  
    <figcaption>Winamp 2 default Base Skin</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>We all love the nostalgic look of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp">Winamp</a> in screenshots, but in reality those players are very limited. They work (kinda) okay for playing a single album, but I struggle to browse my library or create a playlist with them. I tried tons of programs, but none of them satisfied me. I guess music players left the zeitgeist so the technology of playing files locally didn’t improve much lately.
For a few days, I went along with the good old VLC player, but I was surprised to find how bad it is at handling <code>flac</code> files.</p>

<p>I gave <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/">foobar2000</a> another go, and remember how much of a clusterfuck setting it up is. After a few days of trial and error I decided that it wasn’t worth the effort.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>foobar2000's Midnight theme that probably took hundreds of hours to make.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Since I was feeling adventurous and I wanted an excuse to learn <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a>, I ended up building a rudimentary web music player that worked surprisingly well. The player streamed music from my library on a browser, so I could spin up a local server and access to all my music remotely from anywhere.</p>

<p>This worked well for a while, and it was a nice learning exercise, but it all fell apart when I had to go on a trip. Without internet or having the laptop running to host the server I wasn’t able to listen to any music on my phone, so it made some flights particularly long. I knew I could take the project to the next level and add some sort of “download to listen offline” feature, but the browser storage is not enough for that, so I would had to bundle the website into a “proper app”. I wasn’t going to spend more time on this side project, so it was time to look for another solution.</p>

<p>My last resort and the option I ended up using the most was Apple’s Music app. It is a bloated program with vestiges of what itunes was. It tries very hard to sell their subscription service, but below all noise, there is a music player that’s actually not bad. It has all kinds of sorting, and an up to date interface.
You can sync the music library with your phone or other devices and you won’t have any issues if you are offline. No more boring train rides!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, having your entire music library in every device takes too much space, so you have to start playing some sort of <em>storage battle royale</em>, and decide which music you won’t want to listen anymore. 
This shouldn’t be a big deal (none of the issues I’m listing here are), but when you are competing with the knowledge of something like Spotify existing, it is hard to voluntarily make things harder than they should be.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, YouTube decided to shove a video down my throat:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4VkY1vTpCJY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>I didn’t know Jeff Geerling, but I’ve been a happy subscriber since :) he has a lot of good videos and he always carries a contagious enthusiasm about any topic he covers.</p>

<p>The video I linked covers how Jellyfin can replace something like Disney+ or Netflix, but it can also replace Spotify. It has all the features that I was looking for! There is only one downside compared to Spotify: you have to host it yourself.</p>

<p>Self-hosting might sound scary to some, and of course it is not something I would recommend to everyone. But I promise that you can set up Jellyfin without much hustle even if you are not a programmer! To do so you don’t need to buy a NAS or any fancy extra equipment. If you have an old computer around, it is probably good enough as a home server.</p>

<p>Jellyfin has everything I hoped for and more. I tried running it locally in my computer at first, and I was surprised of how easy it was to get it up and running. Then I discovered that there are apps that communicate with your Jellyfin server and allow you to download music from your library for offline listening. <a href="https://www.fintunes.app/">Fintunes</a>, <a href="https://tilosoftware.io/manet/">Manet</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp">Finamp</a>, and the list <a href="https://jellyfin.org/downloads/clients/">goes on</a>. <a href="https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp">Finamp</a> is the one I ended up daily driving in my phone.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://coppolaemilio.com/assets/images/left-spotify/jellyfin-0.webp" alt="">
  
    <figcaption>A screenshot of my Jellyfin music library in the browser</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>In the past few months, the world started shifting significantly, so I wanted to give another step in my journey of digital autonomy. I bought a mini pc to start self-hosting apps like Jellyfin from home. Since the experience was so good, I started looking into other things I could start self-hosting, and I’m now running <a href="https://immich.app/">Immich</a> as well. Immich is like a much better Google Photos, but that’s a story for another time.</p>

<p>If you read until here, and you are curious about self-hosting, I encourage you to give it a try! It doesn’t take much time and it is totally doable as a hobby/side project. If you have some minimal knowledge of how to use a terminal, you won’t have any problems to set things up. And once it’s running, you will be able to enjoy your entire library from any device anywhere.</p>

    <figcaption>A screenshot of my Jellyfin with an album from <a href="https://coppolaemilio.com/entries/the-last-rock-band/">a band you should know about</a>.</figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>If software like this keeps getting better, I can imagine a future where we don’t have to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ">depend on some other’s peoples computers</a> to access to our own music, movies, photos or memories. We just have to make it easier and better, like open-source always does. It might take longer to get there, but I’m damn sure we will.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Microsoft researchers claim they’ve developed the largest-scale 1-bit AI model, also known as a “bitnet,” to date. Called BitNet b1.58 2B4T, it’s <a href="https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">openly available</a> under an MIT license and can run on CPUs, including Apple’s M2.</p>

<p>Bitnets are essentially compressed models designed to run on lightweight hardware. In standard models, weights, the values that define the internal structure of a model, are often<em> </em>quantized so the models perform well on a wide range of machines. Quantizing the weights lowers the number of bits — the smallest units a computer can process — needed to represent those weights, enabling models to run on chips with less memory, faster.</p>







<p>Bitnets quantize weights into just three values: -1, 0, and 1. In theory, that makes them far more memory- and computing-efficient than most models today.</p>

<p>The Microsoft researchers say that BitNet b1.58 2B4T is the first bitnet with 2 billion parameters, “parameters” being largely synonymous with “weights.” Trained on a dataset of 4 trillion tokens — equivalent to about 33 million books, <a href="https://everdome.io/news/ai-tokens-explained-the-tldr-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by one estimate</a> — BitNet b1.58 2B4T outperforms traditional models of similar sizes, the researchers claim.</p>

<p>BitNet b1.58 2B4T doesn’t sweep the floor with rival 2 billion-parameter models, to be clear, but it seemingly holds its own. According to the researchers’ testing, the model surpasses Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, Google’s Gemma 3 1B, and Alibaba’s Qwen 2.5 1.5B on benchmarks including GSM8K (a collection of grade-school-level math problems) and PIQA (which tests physical commonsense reasoning skills).</p>

<p>Perhaps more impressively, BitNet b1.58 2B4T is speedier than other models of its size — in some cases, twice the speed — while using a fraction of the memory. </p>

<p>There is a catch, however. </p>


<p>Achieving that performance requires using Microsoft’s custom framework, bitnet.cpp, which only works with certain hardware at the moment. Absent from the list of supported chips are GPUs, which dominate the AI infrastructure landscape. </p>

<p>That’s all to say that bitnets may hold promise, particularly for resource-constrained devices. But compatibility is — and will likely remain — a big sticking point.</p>

It doesn’t show up in high school history classes like Waterloo, Austerlitz, Sedan, and Gettysburg do.</p><p>But it did change the world in unexpected ways. In fact, one man’s encounter with suffering at Solferino helped to make the world a little bit better.

The movement’s leaders reinvigorated Calvinist Christianity, modernizing liturgies, empowering women, and encouraging believers to help the less fortunate. Henry Dunant, a young Swiss businessman from a prominent Geneva family, jumped into the Réveil with both feet. He formed Bible study groups, visited prisoners, and established the Geneva branch of the YMCA.</p><p>Dunant, like many European Christians, had a moral blind spot about colonialism. Despite his religious beliefs, he thought he might make some money trading in the French colony of Algeria, so he set up a company to acquire land and grow crops there. But he ran into interference from the French authorities in Algeria, so, like the young man with connections that he was, Dunant decided to take his problems to the emperor of France himself — Napoleon III.</p><p>He prepared to kiss some royal butt, writing up a lengthy document about how wonderful Napoleon III was so that he could present it at their meeting. Napoleon III happened to be with his army fighting against the Austrians in Italy at the time, so Dunant set off to find the emperor.</p><p>Dunant happened to catch up with Napoleon III at Solferino on June 24, 1859, just after the battle had ended. By the time he arrived, tens of thousands of soldiers lay on the battlefield. Some were dead, some were dying, some were in extreme duress.</p><p><span>Dunant was </span><a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~wggray/Teaching/His300/Handouts/Dunant-Solferino.pdf" rel="">haunted</a><span> by what he heard and saw:</span></p><blockquote><p>The stillness of the night was broken by groans, by stifled sighs of anguish and suffering. Heart-rending voices kept calling for help. Who could ever describe the agonies of that fearful night!</p><p>When the sun came up on the twenty-fifth, it disclosed the most dreadful sights imaginable. Bodies of men and horses covered the battlefield; corpses were strewn over roads, ditches, ravines, thickets and fields; the approaches of Solferino were literally thick with dead. The fields were devastated, wheat and corn lying flat on the ground, fences broken, orchards ruined; here and there were pools of blood. The villages were deserted and bore the scars left by musket shots, bombs, rockets, grenades and shells. Walls were broken down and pierced with gaps where cannonballs had crushed through them. Houses were riddled with holes, shattered and ruined, and their inhabitants, who had been in hiding, crouching in cellars without light or food for nearly twenty hours, were beginning to crawl out, looking stunned by the terrors they had endured.</p></blockquote><p>Dunant was shocked by the human suffering, but he was also taken aback by the fact that the armies that had meticulously organized the violence seemed to have no real plan to care for those they had harmed. Dunant went into action, rounding up local women to tend to the wounded. He got the French army to release imprisoned Austrian doctors who could help with medical care. He paid for the establishment of field hospitals. And he encouraged the locals to care for enemy soldiers by telling them that, as Christians, “tutti fratelli” — we are all brothers.</p><p>Dunant wrote a self-published memoir of his time in Solferino that dramatized the graphic suffering he had witnessed among the wounded:</p><blockquote><p>With faces black with the flies that swarmed about their wounds, men gazed around them, wild-eyed and helpless. Others were no more than a worm-ridden, inextricable compound of coat and shirt and flesh and blood. Many were shuddering at the thought of being devoured by the worms, which they thought they could see coming out of their bodies (whereas they really came from the myriads of flies which infested the air). There was one poor man, completely disfigured, with a broken jaw and his swollen tongue hanging out of his mouth. He was tossing and trying to get up. I moistened his dry lips and hardened tongue, took a handful of lint and dipped it in the bucket they were carrying behind me, and squeezed the water from this improvised sponge into the deformed opening that had been his mouth. Another wretched man had had a part of his face-nose, lips and chin-taken off by a sabre cut. He could not speak, and lay, half-blind, making heart-rending signs with his hands and uttering guttural sounds to attract attention. I gave him a drink and poured a little fresh water on his bleeding face. A third, with his skull gaping wide open, was dying, spitting out his brains on the stone floor. His companions in suffering kicked him out of their way, as he blocked the passage. I was able to shelter him for the last moments of his life, and I laid a handkerchief over his poor head, which still just moved.</p></blockquote><p>Dunant concluded:</p><blockquote><p>But why have I told of all these scenes of pain and distress, and perhaps aroused painful emotions in my readers? Why have I lingered with seeming complacency over lamentable pictures, tracing their details with what may appear desperate fidelity?</p><p>It is a natural question. Perhaps I might answer it by another: Would it not be possible, in time of peace and quiet, to form relief societies for the purpose of having care given to the wounded in wartime by zealous, devoted and thoroughly qualified volunteers?</p></blockquote><p>Haunted by his experience, Dunant got to work. He banded together with other Swiss businessmen and philanthropists to form the International Committee of the Red Cross, an organization that has done immense good over the last century and a half. But he wanted to go further than that. He wanted laws to govern how nations could deal with one another.</p><p>International law is a funny thing. Within a country, lines of authority are clear. The government makes laws, it has agencies that enforce them, and the penalties for violating the laws are clear. But, in our modern system of sovereign states, no authority sits above the nation. Each country is sovereign. International laws are, therefore, more fragile, because they require the consent of everybody involved to keep them going.</p><p>Despite these difficulties — and though the idea of restraint in wartime is oxymoronic — Dunant thought it was important that there be rules to govern the behavior of countries in combat. He thought that, even if he couldn’t eliminate warfare altogether, he could at least minimize the type of pointless suffering that he had seen at Solferino.</p><p>Dunant persuaded the Swiss government to host 12 countries for discussions about “The Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field.” The agreement that the countries reached, which bound them all to treat wounded enemy soldiers and allow the Red Cross to help with humanitarian aid in times of war, became known as the First Geneva Convention. It was the beginning of the construction of the fragile structure that became modern international law.</p><p>Things didn’t work out very well for Henry Dunant in the end. His business in Algeria fell apart, he went bankrupt, and his business partners accused him of fraud. It was a big scandal in Geneva; he moved to Paris to escape criticism. There, Dunant kept dreaming of utopian solutions to the world’s problems (he became a proponent of a global library from which all humans could learn), but he no longer had the resources to implement them. His movement chugged on without him; the Red Cross spread around the world, though it no longer advertised his role in its founding.</p><p>It wasn’t until the end of his life that a historian uncovered Dunant’s role in the founding of the ICRC and resurrected his reputation. He received the first Nobel Peace Prize in 1901 at the age of 73. By this time, it was clear that his efforts to establish rules around international activity had borne fruit.</p><p>The First Geneva Convention provided a foundation for more agreements between the world’s nations. Subsequent conventions established the rights of prisoners of war and protections for civilians in times of war. These agreements led to the formation of international organizations like the League of Nations, which attempted to regulate interactions between countries in order to maintain peace.</p><p>Though these agreements and organizations didn’t always succeed in keeping the peace, the idea of an international order based on rules persisted. After World War II, allied governments established the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Health Organization, and many more. These organizations were built around the ideas in the preamble of the UN Declaration of Human Rights:</p><blockquote><p>Whereas it is essential… that human rights should be protected by the rule of law…</p><p>Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between nations…</p><p>Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom…</p><p>Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.</p></blockquote><p>Did nations always follow international law? No. Did they consistently demonstrate their belief in the principles of the Geneva Conventions and the UN? Of course not. But the world did get more peaceful. There was no World War III, and countries at least had to pay lip service to these universal values of peace and human rights.</p><p>The relatively stable and prosperous world that we all enjoy today is, in part, due to the efforts of Henry Dunant and other dreamers who believed that nations could and should behave according to common values. These visionaries convinced the world that everyone, even the powerful, was better off if they all agreed to limit their behavior and work together.</p><p><span>Over the ensuing 150 years, people built a system of international law on this foundation that, though certainly imperfect, has </span><a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/aboutswitzerland/en/home/swiss-stories/75-jahre-genfer-konventionen.html" rel="">saved</a><span> millions of lives and made the world a better place.</span></p><p>But the structure that humanity built on Dunant’s insights at Solferino has always been vulnerable. Since it has beenconstructed through the voluntary cooperation of nations, it is vulnerable if powerful countries abandon the system — or worse, actively work to demolish it.</p><p>We find ourselves in just such a situation, as authoritarian regimes in countries like China and Russia, joined by the new leadership of the United States, attack the international order that diplomats have painstakingly built. They may succeed, but they should be careful what they wish for. A world without rules is, as Henry Dunant understood, a world of chaos and cruelty.</p><p><em>This newsletter is free to all, but I count on the kindness of readers to keep it going.

<p dir="auto">💻&nbsp; Plandex is a terminal-based AI development tool that can <strong>plan and execute</strong> large coding tasks that span many steps and touch dozens of files. It can handle up to 2M tokens of context directly (~100k per file), and can index directories with 20M tokens or more using tree-sitter project maps.</p>
<p dir="auto">🔬&nbsp; <strong>A cumulative diff review sandbox</strong> keeps AI-generated changes separate from your project files until they are ready to go. Command execution is controlled so you can easily roll back and debug. Plandex helps you get the most out of AI without leaving behind a mess in your project.</p>
<p dir="auto">🧠&nbsp; <strong>Combine the best models</strong> from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, and open source providers to build entire features and apps with a robust terminal-based workflow.</p>
<p dir="auto">🚀&nbsp; Plandex is capable of <strong>full autonomy</strong>—it can load relevant files, plan and implement changes, execute commands, and automatically debug—but it's also highly flexible and configurable, giving developers fine-grained control and a step-by-step review process when needed.</p>
<p dir="auto">💪&nbsp; Plandex is designed to be resilient to <strong>large projects and files</strong>. If you've found that others tools struggle once your project gets past a certain size or the changes are too complex, give Plandex a shot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Under the contract terms, Mauch will provide 100Mbps symmetrical Internet with unlimited data for $55 a month and 1Gbps with unlimited data for $79 a month. Mauch said his installation fees are typically $199. Unlike many larger ISPs, Mauch provides simple bills that contain a single line item for Internet service and no extra fees.</p>
<p>Mauch also committed to participate in the Federal Communications Commission's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/isps-must-accept-govt-subsidy-on-all-plans-no-more-upselling-fcc-chair-says/">Affordable Connectivity Program</a>, which provides subsidies of $30 a month for households that meet income eligibility requirements.</p>
<p>The contract requires all project expenses to be incurred by the end of 2024, and for the project to be completed by the end of 2026. But Mauch aims for a much quicker timeline, telling Ars that his "goal is to build about half of it by the end of this year and the other half by the end of 2023." The exact funding amount is $2,618,958.03.</p>
<h2>Comcast wanted $50K, AT&amp;T offers just 1.5Mbps</h2>
<p>Operating an ISP isn't Mauch's primary job, as he is still a network architect at Akamai. He started planning to build his own network about five years ago after being unable to get modern service from any of the major ISPs.</p>
<p>As we wrote last year, AT&amp;T only offers DSL with download speeds up to 1.5Mbps at his home. He said Comcast once told him it would charge $50,000 to extend its cable network to his house—and that he would have gone with Comcast if they only wanted $10,000. Comcast demands those up-front fees for line extensions when customers are outside its network area, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/06/couple-bought-home-in-seattle-then-learned-comcast-internet-would-cost-27000/">even if the rest of the neighborhood already has Comcast service</a>.</p>
<p>Mauch was using a 50Mbps fixed wireless service before switching over to his own fiber network.&nbsp;In addition to his home Internet customers, Mauch told us he provides free 250Mbps service to a church that was previously having trouble with its Comcast service. Mauch said he also provides fiber backhaul to a couple of cell towers for a major mobile carrier.</p>

<h2>County touts “historic” broadband investment</h2>
<p>Mauch has already hooked up some of the homes on the list of required addresses. Washtenaw County issued a <a href="https://www.washtenaw.org/civicalerts.aspx?aid=2210">press release</a> after the first home was connected in June, touting a "historic broadband infrastructure investment" to "create a path for every household to access high-speed broadband Internet."</p>
<p>The county said it is investing $15 million in broadband projects by combining the federal funds with money from the county's general fund. Between Washtenaw Fiber Properties and the other three ISPs selected by local government officials, "over 3,000 Washtenaw County households will be connected as a result of this investment in the next few years," the press release said.</p>
<p>One of the areas covered by Mauch's funding is around a lake in Freedom Township, where he plans to begin construction on August 22, he said. "Generally speaking, it's a lower income area as well as an area that has been without service for a very long time, aside from cellular or wireless," he said. "The goal is to close the gap on them very quickly."</p>
<p>As for the other three ISPs, the county was <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-approves-15-million-arpa-funds-countywide-broadband">reportedly</a> negotiating with cable giants Comcast and Charter, and Midwest Energy and Communications. Those three companies ended up getting the deals with the county, a contractor working on the overall project confirmed to Ars.</p>
<p>Under <a href="https://www.baller.com/wp-content/uploads/BallerStokesLideStateBarriers7-1-20.pdf">state law</a>, "Municipalities in Michigan are not simply able to decide to build and operate their own networks, they must first issue an RFP for a private provider to come in and build," the Institute for Local Self-Reliance's Community Broadband Networks Initiative <a href="https://muninetworks.org/content/washtenaw-county-takes-another-step-toward-countywide-broadband-equity">wrote</a>. "Only if the RFP receives less than three viable offers can a municipality move forward with building and owning the network. There are also additional requirements that municipalities have to follow, such as holding public forums and submitting cost-benefit analysis and feasibility studies."</p>
<p>The county's <a href="https://imlive.s3.amazonaws.com/Washtenaw%20County/ID227054715951590824298930519180001578145/RFP%20-%208119%20PUBLIC-PRIVATE%20PARTNERSHIP%20FOR%20FILLING%20BROADBAND%20GAPS.pdf">RFP</a> set 25Mbps download and 3Mbps upload speeds as the minimum acceptable tier but stated a strong preference for "at&nbsp;least 100Mbps download speeds, ideally with symmetrical upload speeds, from wireline&nbsp;technology to accommodate present and future bandwidth-hungry applications."</p>
<h2>Mauch faces increasing equipment costs</h2>
<p>Mauch has made some upgrades to his operation. In our previous story, we described how Mauch was renting an air compressor to blow fiber through his conduits. He recently bought an industrial air compressor at a government liquidation auction, spending under $4,000 for equipment that often costs about $20,000, he said. He had previously spent $8,000 on a directional drill machine that installs cables or conduits under driveways and roads without digging giant holes.</p>
<p>Increasing prices have been a problem. Mauch said he used to buy fiber conduit for 32 cents a foot but that he's paying more than double that now. The <a href="https://www.hubbell.com/hubbell/en/Products/Data-Communications/Underground-Construction/Handholes-Vaults/cl/2863332">handholes</a> that are buried underground at various points throughout Mauch's network used to cost $300 and are now about $700, he said.
