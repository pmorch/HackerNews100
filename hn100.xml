<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an interview with “The Verge”, the new Mozilla CEO, Enzor-DeMeo, IMHO hints that axing adblockers is something that, at the very least, was on the table in some form and at some point. From <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/845216/mozilla-ceo-anthony-enzor-demeo" rel="nofollow">the article</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>He says he could begin to block ad blockers in Firefox and estimates that’d bring in another $150 million, but he doesn’t want to do that. It feels off-mission.</p></blockquote>

<p>It may be just me, but I read this as “I don't want to 😜 😜 but I'll kill AdBlockers in Firefox for buckerinos 😂”. This disappoints and saddens me a lot, and I hope I'm wrong.</p>

<p>I've been using Firefox before it was called that. Heck, I even used the Mozilla Application Suite back in the day. It was its commitment to open standards and the open web, and its powerful add-on system, that attracted me to its software.</p>

<p>Honestly, that's what's been keeping me. I think that's also what's been keeping their loyal base of users with the project, the geeks and nerds that care about privacy. It's the same group of people who helped it get very popular at one point.</p>

<p>Killing one of its advantages over the Chromium engine, being able to have a fucking adblocker that's actually useful, and that nowadays is a fucking security feature due to malvertising, will be another nail in the coffin, IMHO. The core community will feel disenfranchised, and this may have negative consequences for the project. You know why? Because these are some of the people that the <em>normies</em> turn to when they want tech advice.</p>

<p>For fuck sake, for-profit side of Mozilla, get a damn grip!</p>

<p>Tesla has reported yet another crash involving its Robotaxi fleet in Austin to the NHTSA. The new data keeps the program’s accident rate alarmingly high compared to human drivers, even as the company prepares to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/09/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-claims-driverless-robotaxis-coming-to-austin-in-3-weeks/">remove human safety supervisors from the vehicles</a>.</p>



<p>As we have been tracking in our <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-robotaxi-had-3-more-crashes-now-7-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage of the Robotaxi pilot</a> in Austin, Tesla is required to report crashes involving its automated driving systems (ADS) to the NHTSA under a Standing General Order.</p>



<p>For months, we’ve seen these reports trickle in from Tesla’s small pilot fleet in Texas. In November, we reported that the fleet had reached <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-robotaxi-had-3-more-crashes-now-7-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 total crashes</a> as of September.</p>



<p>Now, a new report filed by Tesla reveals an 8th crash occurred in October 2025.</p>	
	



<p>According to the filing, the incident took place on October [Day Redacted], 2025, in Austin. The valid report (Report ID: 13781-11986) lists the “Highest Injury Severity Alleged” as “No Injured Reported,” but details are scarce because, as is typical for Tesla, the narrative description of the crash has been redacted to hide proprietary information.</p>



<p>We have been highlighting how Tesla often abuses NHTSA’s capability to redact much of the information in the crash reports, especially the ‘Narrative’ section, which explains precisely what happened in the incident.</p>



<p>It’s possible that Tesla’s Robotaxis are not responsible for some of these crashes, but we wouldn’t know because Tesla redacts most information.</p>



<p>In this new filing for the accident that happened in October, Tesla went even further as it even refrains from answering some of the sections. Instead, it says “see the narrative,” which again is redacted.</p>



<p>Here’s the updated list of Tesla Robotaxi crashes:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Report ID</strong></td><td><strong>Incident Date</strong></td><td><strong>City</strong></td><td><strong>State</strong></td><td><strong>Crash With</strong></td><td><strong>Highest Injury Severity Alleged</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>13781-11986</td><td>OCT-2025</td><td>Austin</td><td>TX</td><td>Other, see Narrative</td><td>No Injured Reported</td></tr><tr><td>13781-11787</td><td>SEP-2025</td><td>Austin</td><td>TX</td><td>Animal</td><td>No Injured Reported</td></tr><tr><td>13781-11786</td><td>SEP-2025</td><td>Austin</td><td>TX</td><td>Non-Motorist: Cyclist</td><td>Property Damage.

No Injured Reported</td></tr><tr><td>13781-11687</td><td>SEP-2025</td><td>Austin</td><td>TX</td><td>Other Fixed Object</td><td>Property Damage. No Injured Reported</td></tr><tr><td>13781-11507</td><td>JUL-2025</td><td>Austin</td><td>TX</td><td>SUV</td><td>Property Damage.

No Injured Reported</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>We do know that the crash involved “Other” as the conflict partner, and the vehicle was “Proceeding Straight” at the time.</p>



<h3 id="h-tesla-robotaxi-crash-rate">Tesla Robotaxi Crash Rate</h3>



<p>While a few fender benders might not seem like headline news, it becomes significant when you look at the math.</p>



<p>Last month, Tesla confirmed the fleet had traveled roughly 250,000 miles. With 7 reported crashes at the time, <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/11/17/tesla-robotaxi-had-3-more-crashes-now-7-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla’s Robotaxi was crashing roughly once every 40,000 miles </a>(extrapolating from the previously disclosed Robotaxi mileage).</p>



<p>For comparison, the average human driver in the US crashes about once every 500,000 miles.</p>



<p>This means Tesla’s “autonomous” vehicle, which is supposed to be the future of safety, is crashing 10x more often than a human driver.</p>



<p>While Tesla’s Robotaxi fleet reportedly increased in November, with the number of cars spotted going up to 29, there’s no evidence that the Robotaxi mileage increased. In fact, the utilization rate indicates Tesla is running only a few vehicles at a time – meaning that mileage might have actually gone down.</p>



<p>And that is not even the scariest part.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-supervisor-paradox">The Supervisor Paradox</h3>



<p>The most critical detail that gets lost in the noise is that these crashes are happening with a human safety supervisor in the driver’s seat (for highway trips) or passenger seat, with a finger on a kill switch.</p>



<p>These employees are trained to intervene and take control of the vehicle if the software makes a mistake. </p>



<p>If the car is crashing this frequently with a human babysitter trying to prevent accidents, imagine what the crash rate would be without them.</p>



<p>Yet, that is exactly what Tesla is doing.</p>



<p>Elon Musk recently claimed that Tesla would <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/09/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-claims-driverless-robotaxis-coming-to-austin-in-3-weeks/">remove safety monitors from the Robotaxi fleet</a> in Austin within “three weeks.”</p>



<p>Yesterday, we reported that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/14/tesla-robotaxi-spotted-without-a-safety-driver-austin-musk-confirms-testing-begins/">a Tesla Robotaxi was spotted for the first time without anyone in the front seat</a>s, and Musk confirmed that Tesla started testing without a supervisor.</p>



<h3 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h3>



<p>This is becoming hard to watch.</p>



<p>We have <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/12/10/elon-musk-waymo-never-had-chance-against-tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waymo operating fully driverless</a> commercial services in multiple cities with over 100 million miles of data showing they are safer than humans. They are not without their issues, but they are at least sharing data that is encouraging, including not redacting the NTHSA crash reporting.</p>




	<p>Meanwhile, Tesla is struggling to keep a small test fleet in Austin from hitting things, even with professional safety drivers on board.</p>



<p>Removing the safety supervisors when your crash rate is already orders of magnitude worse than the average human seems reckless. It feels like another case of prioritizing the “optics” of autonomy over the actual safety required to deploy it.</p>



<p>If Tesla pulls the supervisors while the data looks like this, it’s no longer a pilot program. It’s a gamble. And it’s not just gambling on its stock price, it’s gambling with everyone’s safety.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2025/Dec/15/porting-justhtml/">

<p>15th December 2025</p>



<p>I <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/">wrote about JustHTML yesterday</a>—Emil Stenström’s project to build a new standards compliant HTML5 parser in pure Python code using coding agents running against the comprehensive html5lib-tests testing library. Last night, purely out of curiosity, I decided to try <strong>porting JustHTML from Python to JavaScript</strong> with the least amount of effort possible, using Codex CLI and GPT-5.2. It worked beyond my expectations.</p>
<h4 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h4>
<p>I built <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml">simonw/justjshtml</a>, a dependency-free HTML5 parsing library in JavaScript which passes 9,200 tests from the html5lib-tests suite and imitates the API design of Emil’s JustHTML library.</p>
<p>It took two initial prompts and a few tiny follow-ups. <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/11/gpt-52/">GPT-5.2</a> running in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> ran uninterrupted for several hours, burned through 1,464,295 input tokens, 97,122,176 cached input tokens and 625,563 output tokens and ended up producing 9,000 lines of fully tested JavaScript across 43 commits.</p>
<p>Time elapsed from project idea to finished library: about 4 hours, during which I also bought and decorated a Christmas tree with family and watched the latest Knives Out movie.</p>
<h4 id="some-background">Some background</h4>
<p>One of the most important contributions of the HTML5 specification ten years ago was the way it precisely specified how <em>invalid</em> HTML should be parsed. The world is full of invalid documents and having a specification that covers those means browsers can treat them in the same way—there’s no more “undefined behavior” to worry about when building parsing software.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, those invalid parsing rules are pretty complex! The free online book <a href="https://htmlparser.info/">Idiosyncrasies of the HTML parser</a> by Simon Pieters is an excellent deep dive into this topic, in particular <a href="https://htmlparser.info/parser/">Chapter 3. The HTML parser</a>.</p>
<p>The Python <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-python">html5lib</a> project started the <a href="https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests">html5lib-tests</a> repository with a set of implementation-independent tests. These have since become the gold standard for interoperability testing of HTML5 parsers, and are used by projects such as <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">Servo</a> which used them to help build <a href="https://github.com/servo/html5ever">html5ever</a>, a “high-performance browser-grade HTML5 parser” written in Rust.</p>
<p>Emil Stenström’s <a href="https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml">JustHTML</a> project is a pure-Python implementation of an HTML5 parser that passes the full html5lib-tests suite. Emil <a href="https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/">spent a couple of months</a> working on this as a side project, deliberately picking a problem with a comprehensive existing test suite to see how far he could get with coding agents.</p>
<p>At one point he had the agents rewrite it based on a close inspection of the Rust html5ever library. I don’t know how much of this was direct translation versus inspiration (here’s Emil’s <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264195#46267059">commentary on that</a>)—his project has 1,215 commits total so it appears to have included a huge amount of iteration, not just a straight port.</p>
<p>My project <strong>is</strong> a straight port. I instructed Codex CLI to build a JavaScript version of Emil’s Python code.</p>
<h4 id="the-process-in-detail">The process in detail</h4>
<p>I started with a bit of mise en place. I checked out two repos and created an empty third directory for the new project:</p>
<div><pre><span>cd</span> <span>~</span>/dev
git clone https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/justhtml
git clone https://github.com/html5lib/html5lib-tests
mkdir justjshtml
<span>cd</span> justjshtml</pre></div>
<p>Then I started Codex CLI for GPT-5.2 like this:</p>

<p>That <code>--yolo</code> flag is a shortcut for <code>--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox</code>, which is every bit as dangerous as it sounds.</p>
<p>My first prompt told Codex to inspect the existing code and use it to build a specification for the new JavaScript library:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>We are going to create a JavaScript port of ~/dev/justhtml - an HTML parsing library that passes the full ~/dev/html5lib-tests test suite. It is going to have a similar API to the Python library but in JavaScript. It will have no dependencies other than raw JavaScript, hence it will work great in the browser and node.js and other environments. Start by reading ~/dev/justhtml and designing the user-facing API for the new library - create a spec.md containing your plan.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reviewed the spec, which included a set of proposed milestones, and told it to add another:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add an early step to the roadmap that involves an initial version that parses a simple example document that is valid and returns the right results. Then add and commit the spec.md file.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/19b8eb1f2ca80f428a3c40862d5ec05d36e5166b/spec.md">the resulting spec.md file</a>. My request for that initial version became “Milestone 0.5” which looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Milestone 0.5 — End-to-end smoke parse (single valid document)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the smallest end-to-end slice so the public API is real early:
<ul>
<li>
<code>new JustHTML("&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;")</code> returns a tree with the expected tag structure and text nodes.</li>
<li>
<code>doc.toText()</code> returns <code>"Hello"</code> and <code>doc.errors</code> is empty for this valid input.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add <code>scripts/smoke.js</code> (no deps) that runs the example and asserts the expected structure/output.</li>
<li>Gate: <code>node scripts/smoke.js</code> passes.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Implement Milestone 0.5</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And off it went. The resulting code appeared to work so I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Configure GitHub Actions test.yml to run that on every commit, then commit and push</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ran <code>git init</code> and created a private GitHub repository for this project at this point, and set up the local directory to push to that remote.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commit/48497cbd05584c88af757a0736a2ee447468b6b3">that initial push</a>. Then I told it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>OK do the rest, commit and push often</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was almost it!</p>
<p>I set my laptop to not fall asleep and left it to its devices while we went off to buy a Christmas tree. The “commit and push often” meant I could monitor its progress on my phone by refreshing <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/commits/main">the commit log on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I was running this against my $20/month ChatGPT Plus account, which has a five hour token allowance window for Codex CLI. That ran out at 6:35pm and Codex paused, so I waited until the reset point at 7:14pm and typed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Keep going</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At 9:30pm it declared itself done with the following summary message:</p>
<pre><code>• What’s Done

  - html5lib-tests now run in CI and pass: tokenizer 6810/6810, tree 1770/1782
    (12 skipped: #script-on), serializer 230/230, encoding 82/83 (1 skipped:
    scripted) (.github/workflows/test.yml:1).
  - Public API expanded: stream() (src/stream.js:1), CSS selectors query()/
    matches() (src/selector.js:1), and toMarkdown() (src/markdown.js:1), all
    exported via src/index.js:1.
  - Added no-deps unit scripts for selectors/stream/markdown (scripts/run-
    selector-tests.js:1, scripts/run-stream-tests.js:1, scripts/run-markdown-
    tests.js:1) and wired them into CI.
  - Fixed TreeBuilder so &lt;br&gt; no longer closes &lt;p&gt; (src/treebuilder.js:647).
</code></pre>
<p>As a finishing touch, I had it add a playground interface so I could try out the new library in my browser. I prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a playground.html in the top level folder which loads the necessary ES modules from ./src/... and implements the exact same functionality as seen on https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml but using the JavaScript library instead of Pyodide</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It fetched my <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/justhtml">existing JustHTML playground page</a> (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/14/justhtml/#first-impressions-of-justhtml">described here</a>) using <code>curl</code> and built a new <code>playground.html</code> file that loaded the new JavaScript code instead. This worked <em>perfectly</em>.</p>

<p>I enabled GitHub Pages for my still-private repo which meant I could access the new playground at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html">https://simonw.github.io/justjshtml/playground.html</a></p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/justjshtml-playground.jpg" alt="Screenshot of JustJSHTML Playground web application.

Below is a status bar showing &quot;JavaScript Environment&quot; with a green &quot;Ready&quot; badge. The main input area has &quot;Paste HTML&quot; and &quot;Fetch from URL&quot; buttons, with a text area containing HTML code: &quot;<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Example Page</title> </head> <body> <header> <nav> <ul>&quot;. A &quot;Playground Mode&quot; section shows buttons for &quot;CSS Selector Query&quot;, &quot;Pretty Print HTML&quot;, &quot;Tree Structure&quot;, &quot;Stream Events&quot;, &quot;Extract Text&quot;, and &quot;To Markdown&quot; (highlighted in purple). Below is a text field labeled &quot;CSS Selector (optional - leave empty for whole document):&quot; with placeholder &quot;e.g., article, main, .content (or leave empty)&quot; and a green &quot;Convert to Markdown&quot; button.

<p>All it needed now was some documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Add a comprehensive README with full usage instructions including attribution plus how this was built plus how to use in in HTML plus how to use it in Node.js</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/simonw/justjshtml/blob/f3a33fdb29bf97846fd017185edc8cf82783032e/README.md">read the result here</a>.</p>
<p>We are now at eight prompts total, running for just over four hours and I’ve decorated for Christmas and watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_Up_Dead_Man">Wake Up Dead Man</a> on Netflix.</p>
<p>According to Codex CLI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Token usage: total=2,089,858 input=1,464,295 (+ 97,122,176 cached) output=625,563 (reasoning 437,010)</code></p>

<h4 id="what-can-we-learn-from-this-">What can we learn from this?</h4>
<p>I’m sharing this project because I think it demonstrates a bunch of interesting things about the state of LLMs in December 2025.</p>

<li>Frontier LLMs really can perform complex, multi-hour tasks with hundreds of tool calls and minimal supervision. I used GPT-5.2 for this but I have no reason to believe that Claude Opus 4.5 or Gemini 3 Pro would not be able to achieve the same thing—the only reason I haven’t tried is that I don’t want to burn another 4 hours of time and several million tokens on more runs.</li>
<li>If you can reduce a problem to a robust test suite you can set a coding agent loop loose on it with a high degree of confidence that it will eventually succeed. I called this <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Sep/30/designing-agentic-loops/">designing the agentic loop</a> a few months ago. I think it’s the key skill to unlocking the potential of LLMs for complex tasks.</li>
<li>Porting entire open source libraries from one language to another via a coding agent works extremely well.</li>
<li>Code is so cheap it’s practically free. Code that <em>works</em> continues to carry a cost, but that cost has plummeted now that coding agents can check their work as they go.</li>
<li>We haven’t even <em>begun</em> to unpack the etiquette and ethics around this style of development. Is it responsible and appropriate to churn out a direct port of a library like this in a few hours while watching a movie? What would it take for code built like this to be trusted in production?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll end with some open questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does this library represent a legal violation of copyright of either the Rust library or the Python one?</li>
<li>Even if this is legal, is it ethical to build a library in this way?</li>
<li>Does this format of development hurt the open source ecosystem?</li>
<li>Can I even assert copyright over this, given how much of the work was produced by the LLM?</li>
<li>Is it responsible to publish software libraries built in this way?</li>
<li>How much better would this library be if an expert team hand crafted it over the course of several months?</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.waterfox.com/blog/no-ai-here-response-to-mozilla/">https://www.waterfox.com/blog/no-ai-here-response-to-mozilla/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46295268">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Mozilla’s new CEO recently announced their <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/">vision for the future</a>: positioning Mozilla as “the world’s most trusted software company” with AI at its centre. As someone who has spent nearly 15 years building and maintaining Waterfox, I understand the existential pressure Mozilla faces. Their lunch is being eaten by AI browsers. Alphabet themselves reportedly see the writing on the wall, developing what appears to be a new browser separate from Chrome. The threat is real, and I have genuine sympathy for their position.</p>
<p>But I believe Mozilla is making a fundamental mistake.</p>
<h2 id="the-asterisk-matters">The Asterisk Matters</h2>
<p>Let’s be clear about what we’re talking about. “AI” has become a catch-all term that to me, obscures more than it reveals. Machine learning technologies like the <a href="https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator">Bergamot translation project</a> offer real, tangible utility. Bergamot is transparent in what it does (translate text locally, period), auditable (you can inspect the model and its behavior), and has clear, limited scope, even if the internal neural network logic isn’t strictly deterministic.</p>
<p>Large language models are something else entirely˟. They are black boxes. You cannot audit them. You cannot truly understand what they do with your data. You cannot verify their behaviour. And Mozilla wants to put them at the heart of the browser and that doesn’t sit well.</p>
<p>But it’s important to note I do find LLMs have utility, measurably so. But here I am talking in the context of a web browser and the fundamental scepticism I have toward it in that context.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-browser-for">What Is a Browser For?</h2>
<p>A browser is meant to be a user agent, more specifically, <em>your</em> agent on the web. It represents you, acts on your behalf, and executes your instructions. It’s called a user agent for a reason.</p>
<p>When you introduce a potential LLM layer between the user and the web, you create something different: “a user agent user agent” of sorts. The AI becomes the new user agent, mediating and interpreting between you and the browser. It reorganises your tabs. It rewrites your history. It makes decisions about what you see and how you see it, based on logic you cannot examine or understand.</p>
<p>Mozilla promises that “AI should always be a choice - something people can easily turn off.” That’s fine. But how do you keep track of what a black box actually does when it’s turned on? How do you audit its behaviour? How do you know it’s not quietly reshaping your browsing experience in ways you haven’t noticed?</p>
<p>Even if you can disable individual AI features, the cognitive load of monitoring an opaque system that’s supposedly working on your behalf would be overwhelming. Now, I truly believe and trust that Mozilla will do what they think is best for the user; but I’m not convinced it will be.</p>
<p>This isn’t paranoia, because after all, “It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.” It’s a reasonable response to fundamentally untrustworthy technology being positioned as the future of web browsing.</p>
<h2 id="mozillas-dilemma">Mozilla’s Dilemma?</h2>
<p>I get it. Mozilla is facing an existential crisis. AI browsers are proliferating. The market is shifting. Revenue diversification from search is urgent. Firefox’s market share continues to decline. The pressure to “do something” must be immense, and I understand that.</p>
<p>But there’s a profound irony in their response. Mozilla speaks about trust, transparency, and user agency while simultaneously embracing technology that undermines all three principles. They promise AI will be optional, but that promise acknowledges they’re building AI so deeply into Firefox that an opt-out mechanism becomes necessary in the first place.</p>
<p>Mozilla’s strength has always come from the technical community - developers, power users, privacy advocates. These are the people who understand what browsers should be and what they’re for. Yet Mozilla seems convinced they need to chase the average user, the mainstream market that Chrome already dominates.</p>
<p>That chase has been failing for over a decade. Firefox’s market share has declined steadily as Mozilla added features their core community explicitly didn’t want. Now they’re doubling down on that strategy, going after “average Joe” users while potentially alienating the technical community that has been their foundation.</p>
<h2 id="what-waterfox-offers-instead">What Waterfox Offers Instead</h2>
<p>Waterfox exists because some users want a browser that simply works well at being a browser. The UI is mature - arguably, it has been a solved for problem for years. The customisation features are available and apparent. The focus is on performance and web standards.</p>
<p>In many ways, browsers are operating systems of their own, and a browser’s job is to be a good steward of that environment. AI, in its current form and in my opinion does not match that responsibility.</p>
<p>And yes, yes - disabling features is all well and good, but at the end of the day, if these AI features are black boxes, how are we to keep track of what they actually do? The core browsing experience should be one that fully puts the user in control, not one where you’re constantly monitoring an inscrutable system that claims to be helping you.</p>
<p>Waterfox will not include LLMs. Full stop. At least and most definitely not in their current form or for the foreseeable future.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-other-forks-and-governance">A Note on other Forks and Governance</h3>
<p>The Firefox fork ecosystem includes several projects that tout their independence from Mozilla. Some strip out more features than Waterfox does, some make bolder design choices.</p>
<p>But here’s what often gets overlooked - many of these projects operate without any formal governance structure, privacy policies, or terms of service. There’s no legal entity, no accountability mechanism, no recourse if promises are broken. Open source gives developers the freedom to fork code and make claims, but it doesn’t automatically make those claims trustworthy.</p>
<p>When it comes to something as critical as a web browser - software that mediates your most sensitive online interactions - the existence of a responsible organisation with clear policies becomes crucial. Waterfox maintains formal policies and a legal entity, not because it’s bureaucratic overhead, but because it creates accountability that many browser projects simply don’t have.</p>
<p>You deserve to know who is responsible for the software you rely on daily and how decisions about your privacy are made. The existence of formal policies, even imperfect ones, represents a commitment that your interests matter and that there’s someone to hold accountable.</p>
<p>You may think, so what? And fair enough, I can’t change your mind on that, but Waterfox’s governance has allowed it to do something no other fork has (and likely will not do) - trust from other large, imporant third parties which in turn has given Waterfox users access to protected streaming services via Widevine. It’s a small thing, but to me it showcases the power of said governance.</p>
<h2 id="on-inevitability">On Inevitability</h2>
<p>Some will argue that AI browsers are inevitable, that we’re fighting against the tide of history. Perhaps. AI browsers may eat the world.
But the web, despite having core centralised properties, is fundamentally decentralised. There will always be alternatives. If AI browsers dominate and then falter, if users discover they want something simpler and more trustworthy, Waterfox will still be here, marching patiently along.
We’ve been here before. When Firefox abandoned XUL extensions, Waterfox Classic preserved them. When Mozilla started adding telemetry and Pocket and sponsored content, Waterfox stripped it out. When the technical community asked for a browser that simply respected them, Waterfox delivered.</p>
<p>I’ll keep doing that. Not because it’s the most profitable path or because it’s trendy, but because it’s what users who value independence and transparency actually need.</p>
<p>The browser’s job is to serve you, not to think for you. That core Waterfox principle hasn’t changed, and it won’t.</p>
<hr>
<p>* The asterisk acknowledges that “AI” has become a catch-all term. Machine learning tools like local translation engines (Bergamot) are valuable and transparent. Large language models, in their current black-box form, are neither.</p>
<p>˟ As is my understanding, but please feel free to correct me if that isn’t correct.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

                <p>Published by Martin Kleppmann on 08 Dec 2025.</p>
                

                <p>Much has been said about the effects that AI will have on software development, but there is an
angle I haven’t seen talked about: I believe that AI will bring formal verification, which for
decades has been a bit of a fringe pursuit, into the software engineering mainstream.</p>

<p>Proof assistants and proof-oriented programming languages such as <a href="https://rocq-prover.org/">Rocq</a>,
<a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/">Isabelle</a>, <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a>,
<a href="https://fstar-lang.org/">F*</a>, and <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/">Agda</a> have been around for a long
time. They make it possible to write a formal specification that some piece of code is supposed to
satisfy, and then mathematically prove that the code <em>always</em> satisfies that spec (even on weird
edge cases that you didn’t think of testing). These tools have been used to develop some large
formally verified software systems, such as an <a href="https://sel4.systems/">operating system kernel</a>,
a <a href="https://compcert.org/">C compiler</a>, and a
<a href="https://project-everest.github.io/">cryptographic protocol stack</a>.</p>

<p>At present, formal verification is mostly used by research projects, and it is
<a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/why-dont-people-use-formal-methods/">uncommon</a> for industrial software
engineers to use formal methods (even those working on classic high-assurance software such as
medical devices and aircraft). The reason is that writing those proofs is both very difficult
(requiring PhD-level training) and very laborious.</p>

<p>For example, as of 2009, the formally verified seL4 microkernel consisted of 8,700 lines of C code,
but proving it correct required 20 person-years and
<a href="https://www.sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2009/papers/klein-sosp09.pdf">200,000 lines</a> of Isabelle
code – or 23 lines of proof and half a person-day for every single line of implementation. Moreover,
there are maybe a few hundred people in the world (wild guess) who know how to write such proofs,
since it requires a lot of arcane knowledge about the proof system.</p>

<p>To put it in simple economic terms: for most systems, the expected cost of bugs is lower than the
expected cost of using the proof techniques that would eliminate those bugs. Part of the reason is
perhaps that bugs are a negative externality: it’s not the software developer who bears the cost of
the bugs, but the users. But even if the software developer were to bear the cost, formal
verification is simply very hard and expensive.</p>

<p>At least, that was the case until recently. Now, LLM-based coding assistants are getting pretty good
not only at writing implementation code, but also at
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09833-y">writing</a>
<a href="https://www.galois.com/articles/claude-can-sometimes-prove-it">proof scripts</a> in
<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14183v1">various languages</a>. At present, a human with specialist
expertise still has to guide the process, but it’s not hard to extrapolate and imagine that process
becoming fully automated in the next few years. And when that happens, it will totally change the
economics of formal verification.</p>

<p>If formal verification becomes vastly cheaper, then we can afford to verify much more software. But
on top of that, AI also creates a <em>need</em> to formally verify more software: rather than having humans
review AI-generated code, I’d much rather have the AI prove to me that the code it has generated is
correct. If it can do that, I’ll take AI-generated code over handcrafted code (with all its
artisanal bugs) any day!</p>

<p>In fact, I would argue that writing proof scripts is one of the best applications for LLMs. It
doesn’t matter if they hallucinate nonsense, because the proof checker will reject any invalid proof
and force the AI agent to retry. The proof checker is a small amount of code that is itself
verified, making it virtually impossible to sneak an invalid proof past the checker.</p>

<p>That doesn’t mean software will suddenly be bug-free. As the verification process itself becomes
automated, the challenge will move to correctly defining the specification: that is, how do you know
that the properties that were proved are actually the properties that you cared about? Reading and
writing such formal specifications still requires expertise and careful thought. But writing the
spec is vastly easier and quicker than writing the proof by hand, so this is progress.</p>

<p>I could also imagine AI agents helping with the process of writing the specifications, translating
between formal language and natural language. Here there is the potential for subtleties to be lost
in translation, but this seems like a manageable risk.</p>

<p>I find it exciting to think that we could just specify in a high-level, declarative way the
properties that we want some piece of code to have, and then to vibe code the implementation along
with a proof that it satisfies the specification. That would totally change the nature of software
development: we wouldn’t even need to bother looking at the AI-generated code any more, just like we
don’t bother looking at the machine code generated by a compiler.</p>

<p>In summary: 1. formal verification is about to become vastly cheaper; 2. AI-generated code needs
formal verification so that we can skip human review and still be sure that it works; 3. the
precision of formal verification counteracts the imprecise and probabilistic nature of LLMs. These
three things taken together mean formal verification is likely to go mainstream in the foreseeable
future. I suspect that soon the limiting factor will not be the technology, but the culture change
required for people to realise that formal methods have become viable in practice.</p>

<p>ty was designed from the ground up to power a language server. The entire ty architecture is built
around "incrementality", enabling us to selectively re-run only the necessary computations when a
user (e.g.) edits a file or modifies an individual function. This makes live updates extremely fast
in the context of an editor or long-lived process.</p>

<p>You can install ty today with <code>uv tool install ty@latest</code>, or via our
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty">VS Code extension</a>.</p>
<p>Like Ruff and uv, ty's implementation was grounded in some of our core product principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>An obsessive focus on performance.</strong> Without caching, ty is consistently between 10x and 60x
faster than mypy and Pyright. When run in an editor, the gap is even more dramatic. As an
example, after editing a load-bearing file in the PyTorch repository, ty recomputes diagnostics
in 4.7ms: 80x faster than Pyright (386ms) and 500x faster than Pyrefly (2.38 seconds). ty is very
fast!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Correct, pragmatic, and ergonomic.</strong> With features like
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#intersection-types">first-class intersection types</a>,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#top-and-bottom-materializations">advanced type narrowing</a>,
and
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#reachability-based-on-types">sophisticated reachability analysis</a>,
ty pushes forward the state of the art in Python type checking, providing more accurate feedback
and <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/type-system/#gradual-guarantee">avoiding assumptions</a>
about user intent that often lead to false positives. Our goal with ty is not only to build a
faster type checker; we want to build a better type checker, and one that balances correctness
with a deep focus on the end-user experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Built in the open.</strong> ty was built by our core team alongside dozens of active contributors
under the MIT license, and the same goes for our
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty">editor extensions</a>. You can
run ty anywhere that you write Python (including in the <a href="https://play.ty.dev/">browser</a>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Even compared to other Rust-based language servers like Pyrefly, ty can run orders of magnitude
faster when performing incremental updates on large projects.</p>

<p>ty also includes a
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/diagnostics/">best-in-class diagnostic system</a>, inspired by the
Rust compiler's own world-class error messages. A single ty diagnostic can pull in context from
multiple files at once to explain not only what's wrong, but why (and, often, how to fix it).</p>

<p>Diagnostic output is the primary user interface for a type checker; we prioritized our diagnostic
system from the start (with both humans and agents in mind) and view it as a first-class feature in
ty.</p>

<p>If you use VS Code, Cursor, or a similar editor, we recommend installing the
<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=astral-sh.ty">ty VS Code extension</a>. The ty
language server supports <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ty/features/language-server/">all the capabilities</a>
that you'd expect for a modern language server (Go to Definition, Symbol Rename, Auto-Complete,
Auto-Import, Semantic Syntax Highlighting, Inlay Hints, etc.), and runs in any editor that
implements the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Following the Beta release, our immediate priority is supporting early adopters. From there, we're
working towards a Stable release next year, with the gap between the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/milestone/2">Beta</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/milestone/4">Stable</a> milestones largely focusing on: (1) stability
and bug fixes, (2) completing the long tail of features in the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ty/issues/1889">Python typing specification</a>, and (3) first-class
support for popular third-party libraries like <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/">Pydantic</a> and
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/Django/">Django</a>.</p>
<p>On a longer time horizon, though, ty will power semantic capabilities across the Astral toolchain:
dead code elimination, unused dependency detection, SemVer-compatible upgrade enforcement, CVE
reachability analysis, type-aware linting, and more (including some that are too ambitious to say
out loud just yet).</p>
<p>We want to make Python the most productive programming ecosystem on Earth. Just as with
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff</a> and <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a>, our commitment
from here is that ty will get significantly better every week by working closely with our users.
Thank you for building with us.</p>
<h3><span id="acknowledgements"></span>Acknowledgements<!-- --> <a href="#acknowledgements">#</a></h3>
<p>ty is the most sophisticated product we've built, and its design and implementation have surfaced
some of the hardest technical problems we've seen at Astral. Working on ty requires a deep
understanding of type theory, Python runtime semantics, and how the Python ecosystem actually uses
Python.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2><p>My name is Sebastian Aaltonen. I have been writing graphics code for 30 years. I shipped my first 3d accelerated game in 1999. Since then I have been working with almost every gaming console generation (Nokia N-Gage, Nintendo DS/Switch, Sony Playstation/Portable, Microsoft Xbox) and every PC graphics API (DirectX, OpenGL, Vulkan). For the last 4 years I have been building a new renderer for HypeHype targeting WebGPU, Metal (Mac &amp; iOS) and Vulkan (Android). During my career I have been building several Ubisoft internal engines, optimizing Unreal Engine 4 and leading the Unity DOTS graphics team. I am a member of the Vulkan Advisory Panel and an Arm Ambassador.</p><p>This blog post includes lots of low level hardware details. When writing this post I used “GPT5 Thinking” AI model to cross reference public Linux open source drivers to confirm my knowledge and to ensure no NDA information is present in this blog post. Sources: AMD RDNA ISA documents and GPUOpen, Nvidia PTX ISA documents, Intel PRM, Linux open source GPU drivers (Mesa, Freedreno, Turnip, Asahi) and vendor optimization guides/presentations. The blog post has been screened by several industry insiders before the public release.</p><h2>Low-level graphics APIs change the industry</h2><p>Ten years ago, a significant shift occurred in real-time computer graphics with the introduction of new low-level PC graphics APIs. AMD had won both Xbox One (2013) and Playstation 4 (2013) contracts. Their new Graphics Core Next (GCN) architecture became the de-facto lead development platform for AAA games. PC graphics APIs at that time, DirectX 11 and OpenGL 4.5, had heavy driver overhead and were designed for single threaded rendering. AAA developers demanded higher performance APIs for PC. DICE joined with AMD to create a low level AMD GCN specific API for the PC called Mantle. As a response, Microsoft, Khronos and Apple started developing their own low-level APIs: DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal were born.</p><p>The initial reception of these new low-level APIs was mixed. Synthetic benchmarks and demos showed substantial performance increases, but performance gains couldn’t be seen in major game engines such as Unreal and Unity. At Ubisoft, our teams noticed that porting existing DirectX 11 renderers to DirectX 12 often resulted in performance regression. Something wasn’t right.</p><p>Existing high-level APIs featured minimal persistent state, with fine-grained state setters and individual data inputs bound to the shader just prior to draw call submission. New low-level APIs aimed to make draw calls cheaper by ahead-of-time bundling shader pipeline state and bindings into persistent objects. GPU architectures were highly heterogeneous back in the day. Doing the data remapping, validation, and uploading ahead of time was a big gain. However, the rendering hardware interfaces (RHI) of existing game engines were designed for fine grained immediate mode rendering, while the new low-level APIs required bundling data in persistent objects.</p><p>To address this incompatibility, a new low-level graphics remapping layer grew beneath the RHI. This layer assumed the complexity previously handled by the OpenGL and DirectX 11 graphics drivers, tracking resources and managing mappings between the fine-grained dynamic user-land state and the persistent low-level GPU state. Graphics programmers started specializing into two distinct roles: low-level graphics programmers, who focused on the new low-level “driver” layer and the RHI, and high-level graphics programmers, who built visual graphics algorithms on top of the RHI. Visual programming was also getting more complex due to physically based lighting models, compute shaders and later ray-tracing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Modern APIs?</h2><p>DirectX 12, Vulkan, and Metal are often referred to as “modern APIs”. These APIs are now 10 years old. They were initially designed to support GPUs that are now 13 years old, an incredibly long time in GPU history. Older GPU architectures were optimized for traditional vertex and pixel shader tasks rather than the compute-intensive generic workloads prevalent today. They had vendor specific binding models and data paths. Hardware differences had to be wrapped under the same API. Ahead-of-time created persistent objects were crucial in offloading the mapping, uploading, validation and binding costs.</p><p>In contrast, the console APIs and Mantle were exclusively designed for AMD's GCN architecture, a forward-thinking design for its time. GCN boasted a comprehensive read/write cache hierarchy and scalar registers capable of storing texture and buffer descriptors, effectively treating everything as memory. No complex API for remapping the data was required, and significantly less ahead-of-time work was needed. The console APIs and Mantle had much less API complexity due to targeting a single modern GPU architecture.</p><p>A decade has passed, and GPUs have undergone a significant evolution. All modern GPU architectures now feature complete cache hierarchies with coherent last-level caches. CPUs can write directly to GPU memory using PCIe REBAR or UMA and 64-bit GPU pointers are directly supported in shaders. Texture samplers are bindless, eliminating the need for a CPU driver to configure the descriptor bindings. Texture descriptors can be directly stored in arrays within the GPU memory (often called descriptor heaps). If we were to design an API tailored for modern GPUs today, it wouldn’t need most of these persistent “retained mode” objects. The compromises that DirectX 12.0, Metal 1 and Vulkan 1.0 had to make are not needed anymore. We could simplify the API drastically.</p><p>The past decade has revealed the weaknesses of the modern APIs. The PSO permutation explosion is the biggest problem we need to solve. Vendors (Valve, Nvidia, etc) have massive cloud servers storing terabytes of PSOs for each different architecture/driver combination. User's local PSO cache size can exceed 100GB. No wonder the gamers are complaining that loading takes ages and stutter is all over the place.</p><h2>The history of GPUs and APIs</h2><p>Before we talk about stripping the API surface, we need to understand why graphics APIs were historically designed this way. OpenGL wasn't intentionally slow, nor was Vulkan intentionally complex. 10-20 years ago GPU hardware was highly diverse and undergoing rapid evolution. Designing a cross-platform API for such a diverse set of hardware required compromises.</p><p>Let’s start with a classic: The 3dFX Voodoo 2 12MB (1998) was a three chip design: A single rasterizer chip connected to a 4MB framebuffer memory and two texture sampling chips, each connected to their own 4MB texture memory. There was no geometry pipeline and no programmable shaders. CPU sent pre-transformed triangle vertices to the rasterizer. The rasterizer had a configurable blending equation to control how the vertex colors and the two texture sampler results were combined together. Texture samplers could not read each-other’s memory or the framebuffer. Thus there was no support for multiple render passes. Since the hardware was incapable of window composition, it had a loopback cable to connect your dedicated 2d video card. 3d rendering only worked in exclusive fullscreen mode. A 3d graphics card was a highly specialized piece of hardware, with little in common with the current GPUs and their massive programmable SIMD arrays. Hardware of this era had a massive impact on DirectX (1995) and OpenGL (1992) design. Backwards compatibility played a huge role. APIs improved iteratively. These 30 year old API designs still impact the way we write software today.</p>

  <p>Nvidia’s Geforce 256 coined the term GPU. It had a geometry processor in addition to the rasterizer. The geometry processor, rasterizer and texture sampling units were all integrated in the same die and shared memory. DirectX 7 introduced two new concepts: render target textures and uniform constants. Multipass rendering meant that texture samplers could read the rasterizer output, invalidating the 3dFX Voodoo 2 separate memory design.</p><p>The geometry processor API featured uniform data inputs for transform matrices (float4x4), light positions, and colors (float4). GPU implementations varied among manufacturers, many opting to embed a small constant memory block within the geometry engine. But this wasn’t the only way to do it. In the OpenGL API each shader had its own persistent uniforms. This design enabled the driver to embed constants directly in the shader's instruction stream, an API peculiarity that still persists in OpenGL 4.6 and ES 3.2 today.</p><p>GPUs back then didn’t have generic read &amp; write caches. Rasterizer had screen local cache for blending and depth buffering and texture samplers leaned on linearly interpolated vertex UVs for data prefetching. When shaders were introduced in DirectX 8 shader model 1.0 (SM 1.0), the pixel shader stage didn’t support calculating texture UVs. UVs were calculated at vertex granularity, interpolated by the hardware and passed directly to the texture samplers.&nbsp;</p><p>DirectX 9 brought a substantial increase in shader instruction limits, but shader model 2.0 didn’t expose any new data paths. Both vertex and pixel shaders still operated as 1:1 input:output machines, allowing users to only customize the transform math of the vertex position and attributes and the pixel color. Programmable load and store were not supported. The fixed-function input blocks persisted: vertex fetch, uniform (constant) memory and texture sampler. Vertex shader was a separate execution unit. It gained new features like the ability to index constants (limited to float4 arrays) but still lacked texture sampling support.</p><p>DirectX 9 shader model 3.0 increased the instruction limit to 65536 making it difficult for humans to write and maintain shader assembly anymore. Higher level shading languages were born: HLSL (2002) and GLSL (2002-2004). These languages adapted the 1:1 elementwise transform design. Each shader invocation operated on a single data element: vertex or pixel. Framework-style shader design heavily affected the graphics API design in the following years. It was a nice way to abstract hardware differences back in the day, but is showing scaling pains today.&nbsp;</p><p>DirectX 11 was a significant shift in the data model, introducing support for compute shaders, generic read-write buffers and indirect drawing. The GPU could now fully feed itself. The inclusion of generic buffers enabled shader programs to access and modify programmable memory locations, which forced hardware vendors to implement generic cache hierarchies. Shaders evolved beyond simple 1:1 data transformations, marking the end of specialized, hardcoded data paths. GPU hardware started to shift towards a generic SIMD design. SIMD units were now executing all the different shader types: vertex, pixel, geometry, hull, domain and compute. Today the framework has 16 different shader entry points. This adds a lot of API surface and makes composition difficult. As a result GLSL and HLSL still don’t have a flourishing library ecosystem.</p><p>DirectX 11 featured a whole zoo of buffer types, each designed to accommodate specific hardware data path peculiarities: typed SRV &amp; UAV, byte address SRV &amp; UAV, structured SRV &amp; UAV, append &amp; consume (with counter), constant, vertex, and index buffers. Like textures, buffers in DirectX utilize an opaque descriptor. Descriptors are hardware specific (commonly 128-256 bit) data blobs encoding the size, format, properties and data address of the resource in GPU memory. DirectX 11 GPUs leveraged their texture samplers for buffer load (gather) operations. This was natural since the sampler already had a type conversion hardware and a small read-only data cache. Typed buffers supported the same formats as textures, and DirectX used the same SRV (shader resource view) abstraction for both textures and buffers.</p><p>The use of opaque buffer descriptors meant that the buffer format was not known at shader compile time. This was fine for read-only buffers as they were handled by the texture sampler. Read-write buffer (UAV in DirectX) was initially limited to 32-bit and 128-bit (vec4) types. Subsequent API and hardware revisions gradually addressed typed UAV load limitations, but the core issues persisted: a descriptor requires an indirection (contains a pointer), compiler optimizations are limited (data type is known only at runtime), format conversion hardware introduces latency (vs raw L1$&nbsp;load), expand at load reserves registers for longer time (vs expand at use), descriptor management adds CPU driver complexity, and the API is complex (ten different buffer types).</p><p>In DirectX 11 the structured buffers were the only buffer type allowing an user defined struct type. All other buffer types represented a homogeneous array of simple scalar/vector elements. Unfortunately, structured buffers were not layout compatible with other buffer types. Users were not allowed to have structured buffer views to typed buffers, byte address buffers, or vertex/index buffers. The reason was that structured buffers had special AoSoA swizzle optimization under the hood, which was important for older vec4 architectures. This hardware specific optimization limited the structured buffer usability.</p><p>DirectX 12 made all buffers linear in memory, making them compatible with each other. SM 6.2 also added load&lt;T&gt; syntactic sugar for the byte address buffer, allowing clean struct loading syntax from arbitrary offset. All the old buffer types are still supported for backwards compatibility reasons and all the buffers still use opaque descriptors. HLSL is still missing support for 64-bit GPU pointers. In contrast, the Nvidia CUDA computing platform (2007) fully leaned on 64-bit pointers, but its popularity was initially limited to academic use. Today it is the leading AI platform and is heavily affecting the hardware design.</p><p>Support for 16-bit registers and 16-bit math was disorganized when DirectX 12 launched. Microsoft initially made a questionable decision to not backport DirectX 12 to Windows 7. Shader binaries targeting Windows 8 supported 16-bit types, but most gamers continued using Windows 7. Developers didn’t want to ship two sets of shaders. OpenGL lowp/mediump specification was also messy. Bit depths were not properly standardized. Mediump was a popular optimization in mobile games, but most PC drivers ignored it, making game developer’s life miserable. AAA games mostly ignored 16-bit math until PS4 Pro launched in 2016 with double rate fp16 support.</p><p>With the rise of AI, ray-tracing, and GPU-driven rendering, GPU vendors started focusing on optimizing their raw data load paths and providing larger and faster generic caches. Routing loads though the texture sampler (type conversion) added too much latency, as dependent load chains are common in modern shaders. Hardware got native support for narrow 8-bit, 16-bit, and 64-bit types and pointers.</p><p>Most vendors ditched their fixed function vertex fetch hardware, emitting standard raw load instructions in the vertex shader instead. Fully programmable vertex fetch allowed developers to write new algorithms such as clustered GPU-driven rendering. Fixed function hardware transistor budget could be used elsewhere.</p><p>Mesh shaders represent the culmination of rasterizer evolution, eliminating the need for index deduplication hardware and post-transform caches. In this paradigm, all inputs are treated as raw memory. The user is responsible for dividing the mesh into self-contained meshlets that internally share vertices. This process is often done offline. The GPU no longer needs to do parallel index deduplication for each draw call, saving power and transistors. Given that gaming accounts for only 10% of Nvidia's revenue today, while AI represents 90% and ray-tracing continues to grow, it is likely only a matter of time before the fixed function geometry hardware is stripped to bare minimum and drivers automatically convert vertex shaders to mesh shaders.</p><p>Mobile GPUs are tile-based renderers. Tilers bin the individual triangles to small tiles (commonly between 16x16 to 64x64 pixels) . Mesh shaders are too coarse grained for this purpose. Binning meshlets to tiny tiles would cause significant geometry overshading. There’s no clear convergence path. We still need to support the vertex shader path.</p><p>10 years ago when DirectX 12.0, Vulkan 1.0 and Metal 1.0 arrived, the existing GPU hardware didn’t widely support bindless resources. APIs adapted complex binding models to abstract the hardware differences. DirectX allowed indexing up to 128 resources per stage, Vulkan and Metal didn’t initially support descriptor indexing at all. Developers had to continue using traditional workarounds to reduce the bindings change overhead, such as packing textures into atlases and merging meshes together. The GPU hardware has evolved significantly during the past decade and converged to generic bindless SIMD design.</p><p>Let’s investigate how much simpler the graphics API and the shader language would become if we designed them solely for modern bindless hardware.</p><h2>Modern GPU memory management</h2><p>Let’s start our journey discussing memory management. Legacy graphics APIs abstracted the GPU memory management completely. Abstraction was necessary, as old GPUs had split memories and/or special data paths with various cache coherency concerns. When DirectX 12 and Vulkan arrived 10 years ago, the GPU hardware had matured enough to expose placement heaps to the user. Consoles had already exposed memory for a few generations and developers requested similar flexibility for PC and mobile. Apple introduced placement heaps 4 years after Vulkan and DirectX 12 in Metal 2.</p><p>Modern APIs require the user to enumerate the heap types to find out what kind of memory the GPU driver has to offer. It’s a good practice to preallocate memory in big chunks and suballocate it using a user-land allocator. However, there’s a design flaw in Vulkan: You have to create your texture/buffer object first. Then you can ask which heap types are compatible with the new resource. This forces the user into a lazy allocation pattern, which can cause performance hitches and memory spikes at runtime. This also makes it difficult to wrap a GPU memory allocation into a cross-platform library. AMD VMA, for example, creates both the Vulkan-specific buffer/texture object in addition to allocating memory. We want to fully separate these concerns.</p><p>Today the CPU has full visibility into the GPU memory. Integrated GPUs have UMA, and modern discrete GPUs have PCIe Resizable BAR. The whole GPU heap can be mapped. Vulkan heap API naturally supports CPU mapped GPU heaps. DirectX 12 got support in 2023 (HEAP_TYPE_GPU_UPLOAD).</p><p>CUDA has a simple design for GPU memory allocation: The GPU malloc API takes the size as input and returns a mapped CPU pointer. The GPU free API frees the memory. CUDA doesn’t support CPU mapped GPU memory. The GPU reads the CPU memory though the PCIe bus. CUDA also supports GPU memory allocations, but they can’t be directly written by the CPU.</p><p>We combine CUDA malloc design with CPU mapped GPU memory (UMA/ReBAR). It's the best of both worlds: The data is fast for the CPU to write and fast for the GPU to read, yet we maintain the clean, easy to use design.</p>

  <p>Default gpuMalloc alignment is 16 bytes (vec4 alignment). If you need wider alignment use gpuMalloc(size, alignment) overload. My example code uses gpuMalloc&lt;T&gt; wrapper, doing gpuMalloc(elements * sizeof(T), alignof(T)). </p><p>Writing data directly into GPU memory is optimal for small data like draw arguments, uniforms and descriptors. For large persistent data, we still want to perform a copy operation. GPUs store textures in a swizzled layout similar to Morton-order to improve cache locality. DirectX 11.3 and 12 tried to standardize the swizzle layout, but couldn’t get all GPU manufacturers onboard. The common way to perform texture swizzling is to use a driver provided copy command. The copy command reads linear texture data from a CPU mapped “upload” heap and writes to a swizzled layout in a private GPU heap. Every modern GPU also has lossless delta color compression (DCC). Modern GPUs copy engines are capable of DCC compression and decompression. DCC and Morton swizzle are the main reasons we want to copy textures into a private GPU heap. Recently, GPUs have also added generic lossless memory compression for buffer data. If the memory heap is CPU mapped, the GPU can’t enable vendor specific lossless compression, as the CPU wouldn’t know how to read or write it. A copy command must be used to compress the data.</p><p>We need a memory type parameter in the GPU malloc function to add support for private GPU memory. The standard memory type should be CPU mapped GPU memory (write combined CPU access). It is fast for the GPU to read, and the CPU can directly write to it just like it was a CPU memory pointer. GPU-only memory is used for textures and big GPU-only buffers. The CPU can’t directly write to these GPU pointers. The user writes the data to CPU mapped GPU memory first and then issues a copy command, which transforms the data to optimal compressed format. Modern texture samplers and display engines can read compressed GPU data directly, so there’s no need for subsequent data layout transforms (see chapter: Modern barriers). The uploaded data is ready to use immediately.</p><p>We have two types of GPU pointers, a CPU mapped virtual address and a GPU virtual address. The GPU can only dereference GPU addresses. All pointers in GPU data structures must use GPU addresses. CPU mapped addresses are only used for CPU writes. CUDA has an API to transform a CPU mapped address to a GPU address (cudaHostGetDevicePointer). Metal 4 buffer object has two getters: .contents (CPU mapped address) and .gpuAddress (GPU address). Since the gpuMalloc API returns a pointer, not a managed object handle (like Metal), we choose the CUDA approach (gpuHostToDevicePointer). This API call is not free. The driver likely implements it using a hash map (if other than base addresses need to be translated, we need a tree). Preferably we call the address translation once per allocation and cache in a user land struct (void *cpu, void *gpu). This is the approach my userland GPUBumpAllocator uses (see appendix for full implementation).</p>

  <p>Vulkan recently got a new extension called VK_EXT_host_image_copy. The driver implements a direct CPU to GPU image copy operation, performing the hardware specific texture swizzle on CPU. This extension is currently only available on UMA architectures, but there’s no technical reason why it’s not available on PCIe ReBAR as well. Unfortunately this API doesn’t support DCC. It would be too expensive to perform DCC compression on the CPU. The extension is mainly useful for block compressed textures, as they don’t require DCC. It can’t universally replace hardware copy to GPU private memory.</p><p>There’s also a need for a third memory type, CPU-cached, for readback purposes. This memory type is slower for the GPU to write due to cache coherency with the CPU. Games only use readback seldomly. Common use cases are screenshots and virtual texturing readback. GPGPU algorithms such as AI training and inference lean on efficient communication between the CPU and the GPU.</p><p>When we mix the simplicity of CUDA malloc with CPU-mapped GPU memory we get a flexible and fast GPU memory allocation system with minimal API surface. This is an excellent starting point for a minimalistic modern graphics API.</p><h2>Modern data</h2><p>CUDA, Metal and OpenCL leverage C/C++ shader languages featuring 64-bit pointer semantics. These languages support loading and storing of structs from/to any appropriately aligned GPU memory location. The compiler handles behind-the-scenes optimizations, including wide loads (combine), register mappings, and bit extractions. Many modern GPUs offer free instruction modifiers for extracting 8/16-bit portions of a register, allowing the compiler to pack 8-bit and 16-bit values into a single register. This keeps the shader code clean and efficient.</p><p>If you load a struct of eight 32-bit values, the compiler will most likely emit two 128-bit wide loads (each filling 4 registers), a 4x reduction in load instruction count. Wide loads are significantly faster, especially if the struct contains narrow 8 and 16-bit fields. GPUs are ALU dense and have big register files, but compared to CPUs their memory paths are relatively slow. A CPU often has two load ports each doing a load per cycle. On a modern GPU we can achieve one SIMD load per 4 cycles. Wide load + unpack in the shader is often the most efficient way to handle data.&nbsp;</p><p>Compact 8-16 bit data has been traditionally stored in texel buffers (Buffer&lt;T&gt;) in DirectX games. Modern GPUs are optimized for compute workloads. Raw buffer load instructions nowadays have up to 2x higher throughput and up to 3x lower latency than texel buffers. Texel buffers are no longer the optimal choice on modern GPUs. Texel buffers do not support structured data, the user is forced to split their data into SoA layout in multiple texel buffers. Each texel buffer has its own descriptor, which must be loaded before the data can be accessed. This consumes resources (SGPRs, descriptor cache slots) and adds startup latency compared to using a single 64-bit raw pointer. SoA data layout also results in significantly more cache misses for non-linear index lookups (examples: material, texture, triangle, instance, bone id). Texel buffers offer free conversion of normalized ([0,1] and [-1,1]) types to floating point registers. It’s true that there’s no ALU cost, but you lose wide load support (combine loads) and the instruction goes through the slow texture sampler hardware path. Narrow texel buffer loads also add register bloat. RGBA8_UNORM load to vec4 allocates four vector registers immediately. The sampler hardware will eventually write the value to these registers. Compilers try to maximize the distance of load→use by moving load instructions in the beginning of the shader. This hides the load latency by ALU and allows overlapping multiple loads. If we instead use wide raw loads, our uint8x4 data consumes just a single 32-bit register. We unpack the 8-bit channels on use. The register life time is much shorter. Modern GPUs can directly access 16-bit low/high halves of registers without unpack, and some can even do 8-bit (AMD SDWA modifier). Packed double rate math makes 2x16 bit conversion instructions faster. Some GPU architectures (Nvidia, AMD) can also do 64-bit pointer raw loads directly from VRAM into groupshared memory, further reducing the register bloat needed for latency hiding. By using 64-bit pointers, game engines benefit from AI hardware optimizations.</p><p>Pointer based systems make memory alignment explicit. When you are allocating a buffer object in DirectX or Vulkan, you need to query the API for alignment. Buffer bind offsets must also be properly aligned. Vulkan has an API for querying the bind offset alignment and DirectX has fixed alignment rules. Alignment contract allows the low level shader compiler to emit optimal code  (such as aligned 4x32-byte wide loads). The DirectX ByteAddressBuffer abstraction has a design flaw: load2, load3 and load4 instructions only require 4-byte alignment. The new SM 6.2 load&lt;T&gt; also only requires elementwise alignment (half4 = 2, float4 = 4). Some GPU vendors (like Nvidia) have to split ByteAddressBuffer.load4 into four individual load instructions. The buffer abstraction can’t always shield the user from bad codegen. It makes bad codegen hard to fix. C/C++ based languages (CUDA, Metal) allow the user to explicitly declare struct alignment with the alignas attribute. We use alignas(16) in all our example code root structs.</p><p>By default, GPU writes are only visible to the threads inside the same thread group (= inside a compute unit). This allows non-coherent L1$ design. Visibility is commonly provided by barriers. If the user needs memory visibility between the groups in a single dispatch, they decorate the buffer binding with the [globallycoherent] attribute. The shader compiler emits coherent load/store instructions for accesses of that buffer. Since we use 64-bit pointers instead of buffer objects, we offer explicit coherent load/store instructions. The syntax is similar to atomic load/store. Similarly we can provide non-temporal load/store instructions that bypass the whole cache hierarchy.</p><p>Vulkan supports 64-bit pointers using the (2019) VK_KHR_buffer_device_address extension (<a href="https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/buffer_device_address/README.html"><span>https://docs.vulkan.org/samples/latest/samples/extensions/buffer_device_address/README.html</span></a>). Buffer device address extension is widely supported by all GPU vendors (including mobile), but is not a part of core Vulkan 1.4. The main issue with BDA is lack of pointer support in the GLSL and the HLSL shader languages. The user has to use raw 64-bit integers instead. A 64-bit integer can be cast to a struct. Structs are defined with custom BDA syntax. Array indexing requires declaring an extra BDA struct type with an array in it, if the user wants the compiler to generate the index addressing math. Debugging support is currently limited. Usability matters a lot and BDA will remain a niche until HLSL and GLSL support pointers natively. This is a stark contrast to CUDA, OpenCL and Metal, where native pointer support is a language core pillar and debugging works flawlessly.&nbsp;</p><p>DirectX 12 has no support for pointers in shaders. As a consequence, HLSL doesn’t allow passing arrays as function parameters. Simple things like having a material array inside UBO/SSBO requires hacking around with macros. It’s impossible to make reusable functions for reductions (prefix sum, sort, etc), since groupshared memory arrays can’t be passed between functions. You could of course declare a separate global array for each utility header/library, but the compiler will allocate groupshared memory for each of them separately, reducing occupancy. There’s no easy way to alias groupshared memory. GLSL has identical issues. Pointer based languages like CUDA and Metal MSL don’t have such issues with arrays. CUDA has a vast ecosystem of 3rd party libraries, and this ecosystem makes Nvidia the most valued company on the planet. Graphics shading languages need to evolve to meet modern standards. We need a library ecosystem too.</p><p>I will be using a C/C++ style shading language similar to CUDA and Metal MSL in my examples, with some HLSL-style system value (SV) semantics mixed in for the graphics specific bits and pieces.</p><h2>Root arguments</h2><p>Operating system threading APIs commonly provide a single 64-bit void pointer to the thread function. The operating system doesn’t care about the user’s data input layout. Let’s apply the same ideology to the GPU kernel data inputs. The shader kernel receives a single 64-bit pointer, which we cast to our desired struct (by the kernel function signature). Developers can use the same shared C/C++ header in both CPU and GPU side.</p>

  <p>In the example code we use a simple linear bump allocator (myBumpAllocator) for allocating GPU arguments (see appendix for implementation). It returns a struct {void* cpu, void *gpu}. The CPU pointer is used for writing directly to persistently mapped GPU memory and the GPU pointer can be stored to GPU data structures or passed as dispatch command argument.&nbsp;</p><p>Most GPUs preload root uniforms (including 64-bit pointers) into constant or scalar registers just before launching a wave. This optimization remains viable: the draw/dispatch command carries the base data pointer. All the input uniforms (including pointers to other data) are found at small fixed offsets from the base pointer. Since shaders are pre-compiled and further optimized into device-specific microcode during the PSO creation, drivers have ample opportunity to set up register preloading and similar root data optimizations. Users should put the most important data in the beginning of the root struct as root data size is limited in some architectures. Our root struct has no hard size limit. The shader compiler will emit standard (scalar/uniform) memory loads for the remaining fields. The root data pointer provided to the shader is const. Shader can’t modify the root input data, as it might be still used by the command processor for preloading data to new waves. Output is done through non-const pointers (see Data::output in above example). By forcing the root data to be const, we also allow GPU drivers to perform their special uniform data path optimizations. </p><p>Do we need a special uniform buffer type? Modern shader compilers perform automatic uniformity analysis. If all inputs to an instruction are uniform, the output is also uniform. Uniformity propagates over the shader. All modern architectures have scalar registers/loads or a similar construct (SIMD1 on Intel). Uniformity analysis is used to convert vector loads into scalar loads, which saves registers and reduces latency. Uniformity analysis doesn’t care about the buffer type (UBO vs SSBO). The resource must be readonly (this is why you should always decorate SSBO with readonly attribute in GLSL or prefer SRV over UAV in DirectX 12). The compiler also needs to be able to prove that the pointer is not aliased. The C/C++ const keyword means that data can’t be modified though this pointer, it doesn’t guarantee that other read-write pointers might alias the same memory region. C99 added the restrict keyword for this purpose and CUDA kernels use it frequently. Root pointers in Metal are no-alias (restrict) by default, and so are buffer objects in Vulkan and DirectX 12. We should adopt the same convention to give the compiler more freedom to do optimizations. </p><p>The shader compiler is not always able to prove address uniformity at compile time. Modern GPUs opportunistically optimize dynamic uniform address loads. If the memory controller detects that all lanes of a vector load instruction have a uniform address, it emits a single lane load instead of a SIMD wide gather. The result is replicated to all lanes. This optimization is transparent, and doesn’t affect shader code generation or register allocation. Dynamically uniform data is a much smaller performance hit than it used to be in the past, especially when combined with the new fast raw load paths.</p><p>Some GPU vendors (ARM Mali and Qualcomm Adreno) take the uniformity analysis a step further. The shader compiler extracts uniform loads and uniform math. A scalar preamble runs before the shader. Uniform memory loads and math is executed once for the whole draw/dispatch and the results are stored in special hardware constant registers (the same registers used by root constants).</p><p>All of the above optimizations together provide a better way of handling uniform data than the classic 16KB/64KB uniform/constant buffer abstraction. Many GPUs still have special uniform registers for root constants, system values and the preamble (see above paragraph).</p><h2>Texture bindings</h2><p>Ideally, texture descriptors would behave like any other data in GPU memory, allowing them to be freely mixed in structs with other data. However, this level of flexibility isn't universally supported by all modern GPUs. Fortunately bindless texture sampler designs have converged over the last decade, with only two primary methods remaining: 256-bit raw descriptors and the indexed descriptor heap.</p><p>AMDs raw descriptor method loads 256-bit descriptors directly from GPU memory into the compute unit’s scalar registers. Eight subsequent 32-bit scalar registers contain a single descriptor. During the SIMD texture sample instruction, the shader core sends a 256-bit texture descriptor and per-lane UVs to the sampler unit. This provides the sampler all the data it needs to address and load texels without any indirections. The drawback is that the 256-bit descriptor takes a lot of register space and needs to be resent to the sampler for each sample instruction.</p><p>The indexed descriptor heap approach uses 32-bit indices (20 bits for old Intel iGPUs). 32-bit indices are trivial to store in structs, load into standard SIMD registers and efficient to pass around. During a SIMD sample instruction, the shader core sends the texture index and the per-lane UVs to the sampler unit. The sampler fetches the descriptor from the descriptor heap: heap base address + texture index * stride (256-bits in modern GPUs). The texture heap base address is either abstracted by the driver (Vulkan and Metal) or provided by the user (SetDescriptorHeaps in DirectX 12). Changing the texture heap base address may result in an internal pipeline barrier (on older hardware). On modern GPUs the texture heap 64-bit base address is often part of each sample instruction data, allowing sampling from multiple heaps seamlessly (64-bit base + 32-bit offset per lane). The sampler unit has a tiny internal descriptor cache to avoid indirect reads after the first access. Descriptor caches must be invalidated whenever the descriptor heap is modified.</p><p>A few years ago it looked like AMDs scalar register based texture descriptors were the winning formula in the long run. Scalar registers are more flexible than a descriptor heap, allowing descriptors to be embedded inside GPU data structures directly. But there’s a downside. Modern GPU workloads such as ray-tracing and deferred texturing (Nanite) lean on non-uniform texture indices. The texture heap index is not uniform over a SIMD wave. A 32-bit heap index is just 4 bytes, we can send it per lane. In contrast, a 256-bit descriptor is 32 bytes. It is not feasible to fetch and send a full 256-bit descriptor per lane. Modern Nvidia, Apple and Qualcomm GPUs support per-lane descriptor index mode in their sample instructions, making the non-uniform case more efficient. The sampler unit performs an internal loop if required. Inputs/outputs to/from sampler units are sent once, regardless of the heap index coherence. AMDs scalar register based descriptor architecture requires the shader compiler to generate a scalarization loop around the texture sample instruction. This costs extra ALU cycles and requires sending and receiving (partially masked) sampler data multiple times. It’s one of the reasons why Nvidia is faster in ray-tracing than AMD. ARM and Intel use 32-bit heap indices too (like Nvidia, Qualcomm and Apple), but their latest architectures don’t yet have a per-lane heap index mode. They emit a similar scalarization loop as AMD for the non-uniform index case.</p><p>All of these differences can be wrapped under an unified texture descriptor heap abstraction. The de-facto texture descriptor size is 256 bits (192 bits on Apple for a separate texture descriptor, sampler is the remaining 32 bits). The texture heap can be presented as a homogeneous array of 256-bit descriptor blobs. Indexing is trivial. DirectX 12 shader model 6.6 provides a texture heap abstraction like this, but doesn’t allow direct CPU or compute shader write access to the descriptor heap memory. A set of APIs are used for creating descriptors and copying descriptors from the CPU to the GPU. The GPU is not allowed to write the descriptors. Today, we can remove this API abstraction completely by allowing direct CPU and GPU write to the descriptor heap. All we need is a simple (user-land) driver helper function for creating a 256-bit (uint64[4]) hardware specific descriptor blob. Modern GPUs have UMA or PCIe ReBAR. The CPU can directly write descriptor blobs into GPU memory. Users can also use compute shaders to copy or generate descriptors. The shader language has a descriptor creation intrinsic too. It returns a hardware specific uint64x4 descriptor blob (analogous to the CPU API). This approach cuts the API complexity drastically and is both faster and more flexible than the DirectX 12 descriptor update model. Vulkan’s VK_EXT_descriptor_buffer (<a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/vk-ext-descriptor-buffer"><span>https://www.khronos.org/blog/vk-ext-descriptor-buffer</span></a>) extension (2022) is similar to my proposal, allowing direct CPU and GPU write. It is supported by most vendors, but unfortunately is not part of the Vulkan 1.4 core spec.</p>

  <p>It is almost possible to get rid of the CPU side texture object (GpuTexture) completely. Unfortunately the triangle rasterizer units of all modern GPUs are not yet bindless. The CPU driver needs to prepare command packets to bind render targets, depth-stencil buffers, clear and resolve. These APIs don’t use the 256-bit GPU texture descriptor. We need driver specific extra CPU data (stored in the GpuTexture object).</p><p>The simplest way to reference a texture in a shader is to use a 32-bit index. A single index can also represent the starting offset of a range of descriptors. This offers a straightforward way to implement the DirectX 12 descriptor table abstraction and the Vulkan descriptor set abstraction without an API. We also get an elegant solution to the fast material switch use case: All we need is a single 64-bit GPU pointer, pointing to a material data struct (containing material properties + 32-bit texture heap start index). Vulkan vkCmdBindDescriptorSets and DirectX 12 SetGraphicsRootDescriptorTable are relatively fast API calls, but they are nowhere as fast as writing a single 64-bit pointer to persistently mapped GPU memory. A lot of complexity is removed by not needing to create, update and delete resource binding API objects. CPU time is also saved as the user no longer needs to maintain a hash map of descriptor sets, a common approach to solve the immediate vs retained mode discrepancy in game engines.</p>

  <p>Metal 4 manages the texture descriptor heap automatically. Texture objects have .gpuResourceID, which is a 64-bit heap index (Xcode GPU debugger reveals small values such as 0x3). You can directly write texture IDs into GPU structs, as you would use texture indices in DirectX SM 6.6 and Vulkan (descriptor buffer extension). As the heap management in Metal is automatic, users can’t allocate texture descriptors in contiguous ranges. It’s a common practice to store a 32-bit index to the first texture in the range and calculate the indices for other textures in the set (see above code example). Metal doesn’t support this. The user has to write a 64-bit texture handle for each texture separately. To address a set of 5 textures, you need 40 bytes in Metal (5 * 64-bit). Vulkan and DirectX 12 only need 4 bytes (1 * 32-bit). Apple GPU hardware is able to implement SM 6.6 texture heaps. The limitation is the Metal API (software).</p><p>Texel buffers can be still supported for backwards compatibility. DirectX 12 stores texel buffer descriptors in the same heap with texture descriptors. A texel buffer functions similarly to a 1d texture (unfiltered tfetch path). Since texel buffers would be mainly used for backwards compatibility, driver vendors wouldn’t need to jump over the hoops to replace them with faster code paths such as raw memory loads behind the scenes. I am not a big fan of driver background threads and shader replacements.</p><p>Non-uniform texture index needs to use NonUniformResourceIndex notation similar to GLSL and HLSL. This tells the low level GPU shader compiler to emit a special texture instruction with per-lane heap index, or a scalarization loop for GPUs that only support uniform descriptors. Since buffers are not descriptors, we never need NonUniformResourceIndex for buffers. We simply pass a 64-bit pointer per lane. It works on all modern GPUs. No scalarization loop, no mess. Additionally, the language should natively support ptr[index] notation for memory loads, where the index is 32-bits. Some GPUs support raw memory load instructions with 32-bit per lane offset. It reduces the register pressure. Feedback to GPU vendors: Please add the missing 64-bit shared base + 32-bit per lane offset raw load instruction and 16-bit uv(w) texture load instructions, if your architecture is still missing them.</p>

  <p>Modern bindless texturing lets us remove all texture binding APIs. A global indexable texture heap makes all textures visible to all shaders. Texture data still needs to be loaded into GPU memory by copy commands (to enable DCC and Morton swizzle). Texture descriptor creation still needs a thin GPU specific user land API. The texture heap can be exposed directly to both the CPU and the GPU as a raw GPU memory array, removing most of the texture heap API complexity compared to DirectX 12 SM 6.6.</p><h2>Shader pipelines</h2><p>Since our shader root data is just a single 64-bit pointer and our textures are just 32-bit indices, the shader pipeline creation becomes dead simple.

  <p>DirectX 12 and Vulkan utilize complex APIs to bind and set up root signatures, push descriptors, push constants, and descriptor sets. A modern GPU driver essentially constructs a single struct into GPU memory and passes its pointer to the command processor. We have shown that such API complexity is unnecessary. The user simply writes the root struct into persistently mapped GPU memory and passes a 64-bit GPU pointer directly to the draw/dispatch function. Users can also include 64-bit pointers and 32-bit texture heap indices inside their structs to build any indirect data layout that fits their needs. Root bindings APIs and the whole DX12 buffer zoo can be replaced efficiently with 64-bit pointers.​​ This simplifies the shader pipeline creation drastically. We don’t need to define the data layout at all. We successfully removed a massive chunk of API complexity while providing more flexibility to the user.</p><h2>Static constants</h2><p>Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU have a concept of static (specialization) constants, locked in at shader pipeline creation. The driver's internal shader compiler applies these constants as literals in the input shader IR and does constant propagation and dead code elimination pass afterward. This can be used to create multiple permutations of the same shader at pipeline creation, reducing the time and storage required for offline compiling all the shader permutations.</p><p>Vulkan and Metal have a set of APIs and a special shader syntax for describing the shader specialization constants and their values. It would be nicer to simply provide a C struct that matches the constant struct defined in the shader side. That would require minimal API surface and would bring important improvements.</p><p>Vulkan’s specialization constants have a design flaw. Specialization constants can’t modify the descriptor set layouts. Data inputs and outputs are fixed. The user could hack around the limitation by implementing an uber-layout containing all potential inputs/outputs and skip updating unused descriptors, but this is cumbersome and sub-optimal. Our proposed design doesn’t have the same problem. One can simply branch by a constant (the other side is dead code eliminated) and reinterpret the shader data input pointer as a different struct. One could also mimic the C++ inheritance data layout. Use a common layout for the beginning of the input struct and put specialized data at the end. Static polymorphism can be achieved cleanly. Runtime performance is identical to hand optimized shader. The specialization struct can also include GPU pointers, allowing the user to hardcode runtime memory locations, avoiding indirections. This has never been possible in a shader language before. Instead, the GPU vendors had to use background threads to analyze the shaders to do similar shader replacement optimizations at runtime, increasing the CPU cost and the driver complexity significantly.</p>

  <p>The shader permutation hell is one of the biggest issues in modern graphics today. Gamers are complaining about stutter, devs are complaining about offline shader compilation taking hours. This new design gives the user added flexibility. They can toggle between static and dynamic behavior inside the shader, making it easy to have a generic fallback and specialization on demand. This design reduces the number of shader permutations and the runtime stalls caused by pipeline creation.</p><h2>Barriers and fences</h2><p>The most hated feature in modern graphics APIs must be the barriers. Barriers serve two purposes: enforce producer-to-consumer execution dependencies and transition textures between layouts.</p><p>Many graphics programmers have an incorrect mental model about the GPU synchronization. A common belief is that GPU synchronization is based on fine-grained texture and buffer dependencies. In reality, modern GPU hardware doesn’t really care about individual resources. We spend lots of CPU cycles in userland preparing a list of individual resources and how their layouts change, but modern GPU drivers practically throw that list away. The abstraction doesn’t match reality.</p><p>Modern bindless architecture gives the GPU a lot of freedom. A shader can write to any 64-bit pointer or any texture in the global descriptor heap. The CPU doesn't know what decisions the GPU is going to make. How is it supposed to emit transition barriers for each affected resource? This is a clear mismatch between bindless architecture and classic CPU-driven rendering APIs today. Let’s investigate why the APIs were designed like this 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>AMD GCN had a big influence on modern graphics API design. GCN was ahead of its time with async compute and bindless texturing (using scalar registers to store descriptors), but it also had crucial limitations in its delta color compression (DCC) and cache design. These limitations are a great example why the barrier model we have today is so complex. GCN didn’t have a coherent last-level cache. ROPs (raster operations = pixel shader outputs) had special non-coherent caches directly connected to the VRAM. The driver had to first flush the ROP caches to memory and then invalidate the L2$ to make pixel shader writes visible to shaders and samplers. The command processor also wasn’t a client of the L2$. Indirect arguments written in compute shaders weren’t visible to the command processor without invalidating the whole L2$ and flushing all dirty lines into VRAM. GCN 3 introduced delta color compression (DCC) for ROPs, but AMD’s texture samplers were not able to directly read DCC compressed textures or compressed depth buffers. The driver had to perform an internal decompress compute shader to eliminate the compression. The display engine could not read DCC compressed textures either. The common case of sampling a render target required two internal barriers and flushing all caches (wait for ROPs, flush ROP cache and L2$, run decompress compute shader, wait for compute).</p><p>AMD’s new RDNA architecture has several crucial improvements: It has a coherent L2$ covering all memory operations. ROPs and the command processor are clients of the L2$. The only non-coherent caches are the tiny L0$ and K$ (scalar cache) inside the compute units. A barrier now requires only flushing the outstanding writes in the tiny caches into the higher level cache. The driver no longer has to flush the last-level (L2) cache into the VRAM, making barriers significantly faster. RDNA’s improved display engine is capable of reading DCC compressed textures and a (de)compressor sits between the L2$ and the L0$ texture cache. There’s no need to decompress textures into VRAM before sampling, removing the need for texture layout transitions (compressed / uncompressed). All desktop and mobile GPU vendors have reached similar conclusions: Bandwidth is the bottleneck today. We should never waste bandwidth decoding resources into VRAM. Layout transitions are no longer needed.</p>

  <p>Resource lists are the most annoying aspect of barriers in DirectX 12 and Vulkan. Users are expected to track the state of each resource individually, and tell the graphics API their previous and next state for each barrier. This was necessary on 10 year old GPUs as vendors hid various decompress commands under the barrier API. The barrier command functioned as the decompress command, so it had to know which resources required decompression. Today’s hardware doesn’t need texture layouts or decompress steps. Vulkan just got a new VK_KHR_unified_image_layouts (<a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/so-long-image-layouts-simplifying-vulkan-synchronisation"><span>https://www.khronos.org/blog/so-long-image-layouts-simplifying-vulkan-synchronisation</span></a>) extension (2025), removing the image layout transitions from the barrier command. But it still requires the user to list individual textures and buffers. Why is this?</p><p>The main reason is legacy API and tooling compatibility. People are used to thinking about resource dependencies and the existing Vulkan and DirectX 12 validation layers are designed that way. However, the barrier command executed by the GPU contains no information about textures or buffers at all. The resource list is consumed solely by the driver.</p><p>Our modern driver loops through your resource list and populates a set of flags. Drivers no longer need to worry about resource layouts or last level cache coherency, but there still exists tiny non-coherent caches that need flushing in special cases. Modern GPUs flush the majority of the non-coherent caches automatically in every barrier. For example the AMD L0$ and K$ (scalar cache) are always flushed, since every pass writes some outputs and these outputs live in some of these caches. Fine grained tracking of all write addresses would be too expensive. Tiny non-coherent caches tend to be inclusive. Modified lines get flushed to the next cache level. This is fast and doesn’t produce VRAM traffic. Some architectures have special caches that are not automatically flushed. Examples: descriptor caches in the texture samplers (see above chapter), rasterizer ROP caches and HiZ caches. The command processor commonly runs ahead to reduce the wave spawn latency. If we write indirect arguments in a shader, we need to inform the GPU to stall the command processor prefetcher to avoid a race. The GPU doesn’t actually know whether your compute shader was writing into an indirect argument buffer or not. In DirectX 12 the buffer is transitioned to D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT and in Vulkan the consumer dependency has a special stage VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_DRAW_INDIRECT_BIT. When a barrier has a resource transition like this or a stage dependency like this, the driver will include command processor prefetcher stall flag into the barrier.</p><p>A modern barrier design replaces the resource list with a single bitfield describing what happens to these special non-coherent caches. Special cases include: Invalidate texture descriptors, invalidate draw arguments and invalidate depth caches. These flags are needed when we generate draw arguments, write to the descriptor heap or write to a depth buffer with a compute shader. Most barriers don’t need special cache invalidation flags.</p><p>Some GPUs still need to decompress data in special cases. For example during a copy or a clear command (fast clear eliminate if clear color has changed). Copy and clear commands take the affected resource as a parameter. The driver can take necessary steps to decode the data if needed. We don’t need a resource list in our barrier for these special cases. Not all formats and usage flags support compression. The driver will keep the data uncompressed in these cases, instead of transitioning it back and forth, wasting bandwidth.&nbsp;</p><p>A standard UAV barrier (compute → compute) is trivial.</p>

<p>A barrier between rasterizer output and pixel shader is a common case for offscreen render target → sampling. Our example has dependency stages set up in a way that the barrier doesn’t block vertex shaders, allowing vertex shading (and tile binning on mobile GPUs) to overlap with previous passes. A barrier with raster output stage (or later) as the producer automatically flushes non-coherent ROP caches if the GPU architecture needs that. We don’t need an explicit flag for it.</p>

  <p>Users only describe the queue execution dependencies: producer and consumer stage masks. There’s no need to track the individual texture and buffer resource states, removing a lot of complexity and saving a significant amount of CPU time versus the current DirectX 12 and Vulkan designs. Metal 2 has a modern barrier design already: it doesn’t use resource lists.</p><p>Many GPUs have custom scratchpads memories: Groupshared memory inside each compute unit, tile memory, large shared scratchpads like the Qualcomm GMEM. These memories are managed automatically by the driver. Temporary scratchpads like groupshared memory are never stored to memory. Tile memories are stored automatically by the tile rasterizer (store op == store). Uniform registers are read-only and pre-populated before each draw call. Scratchpads and uniform registers don’t have cache coherency protocols and don’t interact with the barriers directly.</p><p>Modern GPUs support a synchronization command that writes a value to memory when a shader stage is finished, and a command that waits for a value to appear in memory location before a shader stage is allowed to begin (wait includes optional cache flush semantics). This is equivalent to splitting the barrier into two: the producer and the consumer. DirectX 12 split barriers and Vulkan event→wait are examples of this design. Splitting the barrier into consumer→producer allows putting independent work between them, avoiding draining the GPU.</p><p>Vulkan event→wait (and DX12 split barriers) see barely any use. The main reason is that normal barriers are already highly complicated, and developers want to avoid extra complexity. Driver support for split barriers also hasn’t been perfect in the past. Removing the resource lists simplifies the split barriers significantly. We can also make split barriers semantically similar to timeline semaphores: Signal command writes to a monotonically increasing 64-bit value (atomic max) and wait command waits for the value to be &gt;= N (greater equal). The counter is just a GPU memory pointer, no persistent API object is required. This provides us with a significantly simpler event→wait API.</p>

<p>This API is much simpler than the existing VkEvent API, yet offers improved flexibility. In the above example we implemented the timeline semaphore semantics, but we can implement other patterns too, such as waiting multiple producers using a bitmask: mark bits with SIGNAL_ATOMIC_OR and wait for all bits in a mask to be set (mask is an optional parameter in the gpuWaitBefore command).</p>

<p>GPU→CPU synchronization was initially messy in Vulkan and Metal. Users needed a separate fence object for each submit. N buffering was a common technique for reusing the objects. This is a similar usability issue as discussed above regarding VkEvent. DirectX 12 was the first API to solve the GPU→CPU synchronization cleanly with timeline semaphores. Vulkan 1.2 and Metal 2 adapted the same design later. A timeline semaphore needs only a single 64-bit monotonically increasing counter. This reduces complexity over the older Vulkan and Metal fence APIs, which many engines still use today.</p>

  <p>Our proposed barrier design is a massive improvement over DirectX 12 and Vulkan. It reduces the API complexity significantly. Users no longer need to track individual resources. Our simple hazard tracking has queue + stage granularity. This matches what GPU hardware does today. Game engine graphics backends can be simplified and CPU cycles are saved.</p><h2>Command buffers</h2><p>Vulkan and DirectX 12 were designed to promote the pre-creation and reuse of resources. Early Vulkan examples recorded a single command buffer at startup, replaying it every frame. Developers quickly discovered that command buffer reuse was impractical. Real game environments are dynamic and the camera is in constant motion. The visible object set changes frequently.</p><p>Game engines ignored prerecorded command buffers entirely. Metal and WebGPU feature transient command buffers, which are created just before recording and disappear after GPU has finished rendering. This eliminates the need for command buffer management and prevents multiple submissions of the same commands. GPU vendors recommend one shot command buffers (a resettable command pool per frame in flight) in Vulkan too, as it simplifies the driver’s internal memory management (bump allocator vs heap allocator). The best practices match Metal and WebGPU design. Persistent command buffer objects can be removed. That API complexity didn’t provide anything worth using.</p>

  <h2>Graphics shaders</h2><p>Let’s start with a burning question: Do we need graphics shaders anymore? UE5 Nanite uses compute shaders to plot pixels using 64-bit atomics. High bits contain the pixel depth and low bits contain the payload. Atomic-min ensures that the closest surface remains. This technique was first presented at SIGGRAPH 2015 by Media Molecule Dreams (Alex Evans). Hardware rasterizer still has some advantages, like hierarchical/early depth-stencil tests. Nanite has to lean solely on coarse cluster culling, which results in extra overdraw with kitbashed content. Ubisoft (me and Ulrich Haar) presented this two-pass cluster culling algorithm at SIGGRAPH 2015. Ubisoft used cluster culling in combination with the hardware rasterizer for more fine grained culling. Today’s GPUs are bindless and much better suited for GPU-driven workloads like this. 10 years ago Ubisoft had to lean on virtual texturing (all textures in the same atlas) instead of bindless texturing. Despite many compute-only rasterizers today (Nanite, SDF sphere tracing,  DDA voxel tracing) the hardware rasterizer still remains the most used technique for rendering triangles in games today. It’s definitely worth discussing how to make the rasterization pipeline more flexible and easier to use.</p><p>The modern shader framework has grown to 16 shader entry points. We have eight entry points for rasterization (pixel, vertex, geometry, hull, domain, patch constant, mesh and amplification), and six for ray-tracing (ray generation, miss, closest hit, any hit, intersection and callable). In comparison, CUDA has a single entry point: kernel. This makes CUDA composable. CUDA has a healthy ecosystem of 3rd party libraries. New GPU hardware blocks such as the tensor cores (AI) are exposed as intrinsic functions. This is how it all started in the graphics land as well: texture sampling was our first intrinsic function. Today, texture sampling is fully bindless and doesn’t even require driver setup. This is the design developers prefer. Simple, easy to compose, and extend.</p><p>We recently got more intrinsics: inline raytracing and cooperative matrix (wave matrix in DirectX 12, subgroup matrix in Metal). I am hoping that this is the new direction. We should start tearing down the massive 16 shader framework and replacing it with intrinsics that can be composed in a flexible way.</p><p>Solving the shader framework complexity is a massive topic. To keep the scope of this blog post in check, I will today only discuss compute shaders and raster pipelines. I am going to be writing a followup about simplifying the shader framework, including modern topics such as ray-tracing, shader execution reordering (SER), dynamic register allocation extensions and Apple’s new L1$ backed register file (called dynamic caching).</p><h2>Raster pipelines</h2><p>There are two relevant raster pipelines today: Vertex+pixel and mesh+pixel. Mobile GPUs employing tile based deferred rendering (TBDR) perform per-triangle binning. Tile size is commonly between 16x16 to 64x64 pixels, making meshlets too coarse grained primitive for binning. Meshlet has no clear 1:1 lane to vertex mapping, there’s no straightforward way to run a partial mesh shader wave for selected triangles. This is the main reason mobile GPU vendors haven’t been keen to adapt the desktop centric mesh shader API designed by Nvidia and AMD. Vertex shaders are still important for mobile.</p><p>I will not be discussing geometry, hull, domain, and patch constant (tessellation) shaders. The graphics community widely considers these shader types as failed experiments. They all have crucial performance issues in their design. In all relevant use cases, you can run a compute prepass generating an index buffer to outperform these stages. Additionally, mesh shaders allow generating a compact 8-bit index buffer into on-chip memory, further increasing the performance gap over these legacy shader stages.</p><p>Our goal is to build a modern PSO abstraction with a minimal amount of baked state. One of the main critiques of Vulkan and DirectX 12 has been the pipeline permutation explosion. The less state we have inside the PSO, the less pipeline permutations we get. There are two main areas to improve: graphics shader data bindings and the rasterizer state.</p><h2>Graphics shader bindings&nbsp;</h2><p>Vertex+pixel shader pipeline needs several additional inputs compared to a compute kernel: vertex buffers, index buffer, rasterizer state, render target views and a depth-stencil view. Let’s start by discussing the shader visible data bindings.</p><p>Vertex buffer bindings are easy to solve: We simply remove them. Modern GPUs have fast raw load paths. Most GPU vendors have been emulating vertex fetch hardware already for several generations. Their low level shader compiler reads the user defined vertex layout and emits appropriate raw load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader.&nbsp;</p><p>The vertex bindings declaration is another example of a special C/C++ API for defining a struct memory layout. It adds complexity and forces compiling multiple PSO permutations for different layouts. We simply replace the vertex buffers with standard C/C++ structs. No API is required.</p>

<p>The same is true for per-instance data and multiple vertex streams. We can implement them efficiently with raw memory loads. When we use raw load instructions, we can dynamically adjust the vertex stride, branch over secondary vertex buffer loads and calculate our vertex indices using custom formulas to implement clustered GPU-driven rendering, particle quad expansion, higher order surfaces, efficient terrain rendering and many other algorithms. Additional shader entry points and binding APIs are not needed. We can use our new static constant system to dead code eliminate vertex streams at pipeline creation or provide a static vertex stride if we so prefer. All the old optimization strategies still exist, but we can now mix and match techniques freely to match our renderer’s needs.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The index buffer binding is still special. GPUs have index deduplication hardware. We don’t want to run the vertex shader twice for the same vertex. The index deduplication hardware packs the vertex waves eliminating duplicate vertices. Index buffering is still a crucial optimization today. Non-indexed geometry executes 3 vertex shader invocations (lanes) per triangle. A perfect grid has two triangles per cell, thus it only needs one vertex shader invocation per two triangles (ignoring the last row/column). Modern offline vertex cache optimizers output meshes with around 0.7 vertices per triangle efficiency. We can achieve around 4x to 6x reduction in vertex shading cost with index buffer in real world scenarios.</p><p>The index buffer hardware nowadays connects to the same cache hierarchy as all the other GPU units. Index buffer is simply an extra GPU pointer in the drawIndexed call. That’s the sole API surface we need for index buffering.</p><p>Mesh shaders lean on offline vertex deduplication. A common implementation shades one vertex per lane, and outputs it into on-chip memory. An 8-bit local index buffer tells the rasterizer which 3 vertices are used by each triangle. Since all the meshlet outputs are available at once and are already transformed in on-chip storage, there’s no need to deduplicate or pack vertices after triangle setup. This is why mesh shaders don’t need the index deduplication hardware or the post transform cache. All mesh shader inputs are raw data. No extra API surface is needed beyond the gpuDrawMeshlets command.</p><p>My example mesh shader uses 128 lane thread groups. Nvidia supports up to 126 vertices and 64 triangles per output meshlet. AMD supports 256 vertices and 128 triangles. The shader masks out excess lanes. Since there’s never more than 64 triangles, you might also opt for a 64 lane thread group for optimal triangle lane utilization and do a two iteration loop for vertex shading. My triangle fetch logic is just a single memory load instruction, wasting half of the lanes there isn’t a problem. I chose the extra parallelism for vertex shading instead. Optimal choices depend on your workload and the target hardware.</p>

  <p>The removal of data bindings makes vertex and pixel shaders simpler to use. All of the complex data bindings APIs are replaced by a 64-bit GPU pointer. Users are able to write flexible vertex fetch code to avoid creating a PSO permutation per vertex layout.</p><h2>Rasterizer state</h2><p>Legacy APIs (OpenGL and DirectX 9) had fine grained commands for setting all the shader inputs and rasterizer states. The driver had to build shader pipelines on demand. Hardware specific rasterizer, blender, and input assembler command packets were constructed from the shadow state that combined all individual fine grained states. Vulkan 1.0 and DirectX 12 chose the fully opposite design. All state is baked in the PSO ahead of time. Only a select few states, such as viewport rect, scissor rect, and stencil values, can be changed dynamically. This resulted in a massive explosion of PSO permutations.</p><p>PSO creation is expensive, as it requires calling the GPU driver’s low-level shader compiler. PSO permutations consume a significant amount of storage and RAM. Changing the PSO is the most expensive state change. The small performance advantages that some vendors achieved by embedding render state directly into the shader microcode were overshadowed by the performance issues caused by significantly amplified pipeline creation, binding and data management costs everywhere. The pendulum swung too far to the opposite side.</p><p>Modern GPUs are ALU dense. Nvidia and AMD recently doubled their ALU rate with additional pipelines. Apple also doubled their fp32 pipelines in their M-series chips. Simple states resulting only in a constant replacement in the shader should not require pipeline duplication, even if it adds an extra ALU instruction or wastes an uniform register. Most shaders today are not ALU bound. The cost is often not measurable, but the benefits of having less permutations are significant. Vulkan 1.3 is a big step in the right direction. A lot of baked PSO states can now be set dynamically.</p><p>If we investigate deeper, we notice that all GPUs use command packets for configuring their rasterizer and depth-stencil units. These command packets are not directly tied to the shader microcode. We don’t need to modify the shader microcode to change the rasterizer and depth-stencil state. Metal has a separate depth-stencil state object and a separate command for applying it. A separate state object reduces the PSO permutations and reduces the expensive shader binding calls. Vulkan 1.3 dynamic state achieves similar PSO permutation reduction, but is more fine grained. Metal’s design is a better match for the actual hardware command packets. Bigger packets reduce the API bloat and overhead. DirectX 12 unfortunately still bundles most of the depth-stencil state inside the PSO (stencil ref and depth bias are the only dynamic state). In our design the depth-stencil state is a separate object.</p>

  <p>Immediate mode (desktop) GPUs have similar command packets for configuring the alpha blender unit. If we were designing DirectX 13, we would simply split the blend state object out of the PSO and call it a day. But we are designing a cross platform API, and blending works completely differently on mobile GPUs.</p><p>Mobile GPUs (TBDR) have always supported programmable blending. A render tile fits into a scratchpad memory close to the compute unit (such as the groupshared memory), allowing pixel shaders a direct low latency read+write access to previously rasterized pixels. Most mobile GPUs don’t have any fixed function blending hardware. When a traditional graphics API is used, the driver's low level shader compiler adds blending instructions at the end of the shader. This is analogous to the vertex fetch code generation (described above). If we were designing an API solely for mobile GPUs, we would get rid of the blend state APIs completely, just like we got rid of the vertex buffers. Mobile centric APIs expose a framebuffer fetch intrinsic to efficiently obtain current pixel’s previous color. The user can write any blending formula they want, including complex formulas to implement advanced algorithms such as order independent transparency. The user can also write a generic parametrised formula to eliminate the PSO permutation explosion. As we can see, both the desktop and the mobile GPUs have their own ways to reduce the pipeline permutations regarding blending, the limitation is the current APIs.</p><p>Vulkan subpasses were designed to wrap framebuffer fetch into a cross platform API. This was another misstep in Vulkan design. Vulkan inherited a simple low level design from Mantle, but Vulkan was designed as an OpenGL replacement, so it had to target all mobile and desktop GPU architectures. Wrapping two entirely different architecture types under the same API isn’t easy. Subpasses ended up being a high level concept inside a low level API. A subpass could define an entire chain of render passes but pretend that it’s just a single render pass. Subpasses increased driver complexity and made the shader and renderpass APIs needlessly complex. Users were forced to create complex persistent multi-render pass objects ahead of time and pass those objects into shader pipeline creation. Shader pipelines became multi-pipelines under the hood (one pipeline per sub-pass). Vulkan added all of this complexity simply to avoid exposing the framebuffer fetch intrinsic to the shader language. To add insult to injury, the subpasses weren’t even good enough to solve the programmable blending. Pixel ordering is only preserved at pass boundaries. Subpasses were only useful for narrow 1:1 multi-pass use cases. Vulkan 1.3 scrapped the subpasses and introduced “dynamic rendering”. Users no longer need to create persistent render pass objects, just like in Metal, DirectX 12 and WebGPU. This is a great example of how a complex framework can be tempting for API designers, but developers prefer simple shader intrinsics. Game engines already support building different shaders to different platforms. Apple’s Metal examples do the same: Framebuffer fetch is used on iOS and a traditional multipass algorithm on Mac.</p><p>It’s apparent that we can’t abstract hardware differences regarding blending and framebuffer fetch. Vulkan 1.0 tried that and failed miserably. The correct solution is to provide the user a choice. They can choose to embed the blend state into the PSO. This works on all platforms and is the perfect approach for shaders that don’t suffer from blend state related pipeline permutation issues. Mobile GPU’s internal driver shader compiler adds the blending instructions in the end of the pixel shader as usual. On immediate mode (desktop) GPUs (and some mobile GPUs), the user can choose to use separate blend state objects. This reduces the amount of PSO permutations and makes it faster to change the blend state at runtime, as a full pipeline change is not needed (only a blend state configuration packet is sent).&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As the blend state is separated from the PSO, it’s possible we lose some automatic dead code optimizations. If the user wants to disable the color output, they traditionally use the colorWriteMask in the blend state. Since the blend state is burned in the PSO, the compiler can do dead code elimination based on it. To allow similar dead code optimizations, we have writeMask for each color target in the PSO.</p><p>Dual source blending is a special blend mode requiring two color outputs from the pixel shader. Dual source blending only supports a single render target. Since our blend state can be separate, we need to have a supportDualSourceBlending field in our PSO desc. When enabled, the shader compiler knows the second output is for dual source blending. The validation layer would complain if the output is not present. A pixel shader exporting two colors can be used without dual source blending (the second color is ignored), but there’s a small cost for exporting two colors.</p><p>The remaining rendering state in the PSO is minimal: primitive topology, render target and depth-stencil target formats, MSAA sample count and alpha to coverage. All of this state affects the generated shader microcode so it needs to stay in the PSO. We never want to rebuild the shader PSO microcode due to a state change. If an embedded blend state is used, it's also burned in the PSO. This leaves us with a simple raster state struct for PSO creation.</p>

  <p>HypeHype’s Vulkan shader PSO initialization backend code is 400 lines, and I would consider it compact compared to other engines I have been developing. Here, we managed to initialize a pixel + vertex shader with just 18 lines of code. It’s easy to read and understand. Yet, there’s no compromise on performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Rendering with the raster pipeline is similar to rendering with a compute pipeline. Instead of providing one data pointer, we provide two since there’s two kernel entry points: One for vertex shader and one for pixel shader. Metal has a separate set of data binding slots for vertex and pixel shaders. DirectX, Vulkan and WebGPU use a visibility mask (vertex, pixel, compute, etc) for each individual binding. Many engines choose to bind the same data to both vertex and pixel shader. This is a fine practice on DirectX, Vulkan and WebGPU as you can combine the mask bits, but doubles the binding calls on Metal. Our proposed approach using two data pointers is the best of both worlds. You can simply pass the same pointer twice if you want to use the same data in both the vertex and the pixel shader. Or you can provide independent data pointers, if you prefer full separation between the shader stages. The shader compiler does dead code elimination and constant/scalar preload optimizations separately for pixel and vertex shader. Neither data sharing nor data duplication results in bad performance. The user can choose whatever fits their design.</p>

  <p>Our goal was to reduce the PSO permutation explosion by minimizing the remaining state inside the PSO. The depth-stencil can be separated on all architectures. The blend state separation is possible on desktop hardware, but most mobile hardware burns the blend equation at the end of the pixel shader microcode. Exposing the framebuffer fetch intrinsics directly to the user is a much better idea than Vulkan’s failed subpass approach. Users can write their own blend formulas unlocking new rendering algorithms, or they can author general parametrized blending formulas to reduce the PSO count.</p><h2>Indirect drawing</h2><p>Standard draw/dispatch commands utilize C/C++ function parameters to provide the arguments: thread group dimensions, index count, instance count, etc. Indirect draw calls allow the user to provide a GPU buffer + offset pair instead as the draw argument source, a crucial addition enabling GPU-driven rendering. Our version uses a single GPU pointer instead of the usual buffer object + offset pair, simplifying the API slightly.</p>

  <p>Vulkan’s multidraw doesn’t allow changing bindings per draw call. You can use gl_DrawID to index into a buffer which contains your draw data structs. This adds an indirection in the shader. You need to use either descriptor indexing or the new descriptor buffer extension to fetch textures. DirectX 12 ExecuteIndirect has a configurable command signature, allowing the user to manually setup a root constant per draw, but this doesn’t hit the fast path on all GPU command processors. ExecuteIndirect tier 1.1 (2024) added a new optional counter increment feature: D3D12_INDIRECT_ARGUMENT_TYPE_INCREMENTING_CONSTANT. This can be used to implement draw ID. SM6.8 (2024) finally added support for SV_StartInstanceLocation, allowing the user to directly embed a constant in the indirect draw arguments. Unlike SV_InstanceID, the new SV_StartInstanceLocation is uniform across the whole draw call, providing optimal codegen for indexed loads (uniform/scalar path). The data fetch still requires an indirection. GPU-generated root data is not supported.&nbsp;</p><p>If we generate draw arguments or root data on the GPU, we need to ensure that the command processor waits for the dispatch to finish. Modern command processors prefetch commands and their arguments to hide the latency. We have a flag in our barrier to prevent this. The best practice is to batch update all your draw arguments and root data to avoid fine-grained barriers.</p>

  <p>The lack of indirect shader selection is a significant limitation in the current PC and mobile graphics APIs. Indirect shader selection can be implemented using multi-pipelines similar to ray-tracing. Metal also supports indirect command creation (Nvidia has a similar Vulkan extension). An efficient way to skip over draw calls is a valuable subset. DirectX work graphs and CUDA dynamic parallelism allow a shader to spawn more waves on demand. Unfortunately, the APIs to access these hardware improvements is still highly platform specific and scattered in multiple shader entry points. There’s no clear standardization. My followup post will discuss the shader framework and cover this topic in depth.</p><p>Our proposed design makes indirect drawing extremely powerful. Both the shader root data and the draw parameters can be indirectly provided by the GPU. These advantages power up multi-draw, allowing clean and efficient per-draw data bindings with no hacks. The future of indirect drawing and the shader framework will be discussed in a followup post.</p><h2>Render passes</h2><p>The rasterizer hardware needs to be prepared for rendering before we can start drawing. Common operations include binding render target and depth-stencil views and clearing color and depth. Clear might trigger a fast clear elimination if the clear color is changed. This is transparently handled by the clear command. On mobile GPUs, tiles are stored from on-chip storage to VRAM during rendering. Vulkan, Metal and WebGPU use render pass abstraction for clearing, loading and storing the render target. DirectX 12 added render pass support in the 2018 update in order to optimize rendering on the latest Intel (Gen11) and the Qualcomm (Adreno 630) GPUs. The render pass abstraction doesn’t add notable API complexity, so it's an easy choice for a modern cross platform API.</p><p>DirectX12 has render target views and depth-stencil views, and separate descriptor heaps to store them. This is just an API abstraction. These heaps are simply CPU memory allocated by the driver. Render target and depth-stencil views are not GPU descriptors. The rasterizer API is not bindless. The CPU driver sets up the rasterizer using command packets. In Vulkan and Metal you pass the existing texture/view objects to the beginRenderPass directly. The driver gets the required information from the texture object behind the scenes. Our proposed GpuTexture object fits this job. Rasterization output is the main reason we still need a CPU-side texture object. We write texture descriptors directly into GPU memory. The CPU side driver can’t access those.</p>

  <p>It would be nice to have bindless render passes, bindless/indirect (multi-)clear commands, indirect scissor/viewport rectangles (array), etc. Unfortunately many GPUs today still need the CPU driver to set up their rasterizer.</p><p>A note about barriers: Render pass begin/end commands don’t automatically emit barriers. The user can render multiple render passes&nbsp;simultaneously, if they write to disjoint render targets. A barrier between the raster output stage (or later) and the consumer stage will flush the tiny ROP caches if the GPU architecture needs it. Not having an automatic barrier between the render passes is also crucial for efficient depth prepass implementations (ROP caches are not flushed needlessly).</p>

  <h2>Prototype API</h2><p>My prototype API fits in one screen: 150 lines of code. The blog post is titled “No Graphics API”. That’s obviously an impossible goal today, but we got close enough. WebGPU has a smaller feature set and features a ~2700 line API (Emscripten C header). Vulkan header is ~20,000 lines, but it supports ray-tracing, and many other features our minimalistic API doesn’t yet support. We didn’t have to trade off performance to achieve the reduction in API complexity. For this feature set, our API offers more flexibility than existing APIs. A fully extended summer 2025 Vulkan 1.4 can do all the same things in practice, but is significantly more complex to use and has more API overhead.</p>

  <h2>Tooling</h2><p>How can we debug code that doesn’t bind buffer and texture objects and doesn’t call an API to describe the memory layout explicitly? C/C++ debuggers have been doing that for decades. There’s no special operating system APIs for describing your software’s memory layout. The debugger is able to follow 64-bit pointer chains and use the debug symbol data provided by your compiler. This includes the memory layouts of your structs and classes. CUDA and Metal use C/C++ based shading languages with full 64-bit pointer semantics. Both have robust debuggers that traverse pointer chains without issues. The texture descriptor heap is just GPU memory. The debugger can index it, load a texture descriptor, show the descriptor data and visualize the texels. All of this works already in the Xcode Metal debugger. Click on a texture or a sampler handle in any struct in any GPU address. Debugger will visualize it.</p><p>Modern GPUs virtualize memory. Each process has their own page table. The GPU capture has a separate replayer process with its own virtual address space. If the replayer would naively replay all the allocations, it would get a different GPU virtual address for each memory allocation. This was fine for legacy APIs as it wasn’t possible to directly store GPU addresses in your data structures. A modern API needs special replay memory allocation APIs that force the replayer to mirror the exact GPU virtual memory layout. DX12 and Vulkan BDA have public APIs for this: RecreateAt and VkMemoryOpaqueCaptureAddressAllocateInfo. Metal and CUDA debuggers do the same using internal undocumented APIs. A public API is preferable as it allows open source tools like RenderDoc to function.</p><p>Don’t raw pointers bring security concerns? Can’t you just read/write other apps' memory? This is not possible due to virtual memory. You can only access your own memory pages. If you accidentally use a stale pointer or overflow, you will get a page fault. Page faults are possible with existing buffer based APIs. DirectX 12 and Vulkan don’t clamp your storage (byteaddress/structured) buffer addresses. OOB causes a page fault. Users can also accidentally free a memory heap and continue using stale buffer or texture descriptors to get a page fault. Nothing really changes. An access to an unmapped region is a page fault and the application crashes. This is familiar to C/C++ programmers. If you want robustness, you can use ptr + size pairs. That’s exactly how WebGPU is implemented. The WebGPU shader compiler (Tint or Naga) emits an extra clamp instruction for each buffer access, including vertex accesses (index buffer value out of bounds). WebGL didn’t allow shading index buffer data with other data. WebGL scanned through the indices on the CPU side (making index buffer update very slow). Back then custom vertex fetch was not possible. The hardware page faulted before the shader even ran.</p><h2>Translation layers</h2><p>Being able to run existing software is crucial. Translation layers such as ANGLE, Proton and MoltenVK play a crucial role in the portability and deprecation process of legacy APIs. Let’s talk about translating DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal to our new API.</p><p>MoltenVK (Vulkan to Metal translation layer) proves that Vulkan’s buffer centric API can be translated to Metal’s 64-bit pointer based ecosystem. MoltenVK translates Vulkan’s descriptor sets into Metal’s argument buffers. The generated argument buffers are standard GPU structs containing a 64-bit GPU pointer per buffer binding and a 64-bit texture ID per texture binding. We can do better by allocating a contiguous range of texture descriptors in our texture heap for each descriptor set, and storing a single 32-bit base index instead of a 64-bit texture ID for each texture binding. This is possible since our API has a user managed texture heap unlike Metal.</p><p>MoltenVK maps descriptor sets to Metal API root bind slots. We generate a root struct with up to eight 64-bit pointer fields, each pointing to a descriptor set struct (see above). Root constants are translated into value fields and root descriptors (root buffers) are translated into 64-bit pointers. The efficiency should be identical, assuming the GPU driver preloads our root struct fields into uniform/scalar registers (as discussed in the root arguments chapter).</p><p>Our API uses 64-bit pointer semantics like Metal. We can use the same techniques employed by MoltenVK to translate the buffer load/store instructions in the shader. MoltenVK also supports translating Vulkan’s new buffer device address extension.</p><p>Proton (DX12 to Vulkan translation layer) proves that DirectX 12 SM 6.6 descriptor heap can be translated to Vulkan’s new descriptor buffer extension. Proton also translates other DirectX 12 features to Vulkan. We have already shown that Vulkan to Metal translation is possible with MoltenVK, transitively proving that translation from DirectX 12 to Metal should be possible. The biggest missing feature in MoltenVK is the SM 6.6 style descriptor heap (Vulkan’s descriptor buffer extension). Metal doesn’t expose the descriptor heap directly to the user. Our new proposed API has no such limitation. Our descriptor heap semantics are a superset to SM 6.6 descriptor heap and a close match to Vulkan’s descriptor buffer extension. Translation is straightforward. Vulkan’s extension also adds a special flag for descriptor invalidate, matching our HAZARD_DESCRIPTORS. DirectX 12 descriptor heap API is easy to translate, as it’s just a thin wrapper over the raw descriptor array in GPU memory.</p><p>To support Metal 4.0, we need to implement Metal’s driver managed texture descriptor heap. This can be implemented using a simple freelist over our texture heap. Metal uses 64-bit texture handles which are implemented as direct heap indices on modern Apple Silicon devices. Metal allows using the texture handles in shaders directly as textures. This is syntactic sugar for textureHeap[uint64(handle)]. A Metal texture handle is translated into uint64 by our shader translator, maintaining identical GPU memory layout.</p><p>Our API doesn’t support vertex buffers. WebGPU doesn’t use hardware vertex buffers either, yet it implements the classic vertex buffer abstraction. WGSL shader translator (Tint or Naga) adds one storage buffer binding per vertex stream and emits vertex load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader. Custom vertex fetch allows emitting clamp instructions to avoid OOB behavior. A misbehaving website can’t crash the web browser. Our own shader translator adds a 64-bit pointer to the root struct for each vertex stream, generates a struct matching its layout and emits vertex struct load instructions in the beginning of the vertex shader.</p><p>We have shown that it’s possible to write translation layers to run DirectX 12, Vulkan and Metal applications on top of our new API. Since WebGPU is implemented on top of these APIs by browsers, we can run WebGPU applications too.</p><h2>Min spec hardware</h2><p><strong>Nvidia Turing</strong> (RTX 2000 series, 2018) introduced ray-tracing, tensor cores, mesh shaders, low latency raw memory paths, bigger &amp; faster caches, scalar unit, secondary integer pipeline and many other future looking features. Officially PCIe ReBAR support launched with RTX 3000 series, but there exists hacked Turing drivers that support it too, indicating that the hardware is capable of it. This 7 year old GPU supports everything we need. Nvidia just ended GTX 1000 series driver support in fall 2025. All currently supported Nvidia GPUs could be supported by our new API.</p><p><strong>AMD RDNA2</strong> (RX 6000 series, 2020) matched Nvidia’s feature set with ray-tracing and mesh shaders. One year earlier, RDNA 1 introduced coherent L2$, new L1$ level, fast L0$, generic DCC read/write paths, fastpath unfiltered loads and a modern SIMD32 architecture. PCIe ReBAR is officially supported (brand name “Smart Access Memory”). This 5 year old GPU supports everything we need. AMD ended GCN driver support already in 2021. Today RDNA 1 &amp; RDNA 2 only receive bug fixes and security updates, RDNA 3 is the oldest GPU receiving game optimizations. All the currently supported AMD GPUs could be supported by our API.</p><p><strong>Intel Alchemist / Xe1</strong> (2022) were the first Intel chips with SM 6.6 global indexable heap support. These chips also support ray-tracing, mesh shaders, PCIe ReBAR (discrete) and UMA (integrated). These 3 year old Intel GPUs support everything we need.</p><p><strong>Apple M1 / A14</strong> (MacBook M1, iPhone 12, 2020) support Metal 4.0. Metal 4.0 guarantees GPU memory visibility to CPU (UMA on both phones and computers), and allows the user to write 64-bit pointers and 64-bit texture handles directly into GPU memory. Metal 4.0 has a new residency set API, solving a crucial usability issue with bindless resource management in the old useResource/useHeap APIs. iOS 26 still supports iPhone 11. Developers are not allowed to ship apps that require Metal 4.0 just yet. iOS 27 likely deprecates iPhone 11 support next year. On Mac, if you drop Intel Mac support, you have guaranteed Metal 4.0 support. M1-M5 = 5 generations = 5 years.</p><p><strong>ARM Mali-G710</strong> (2021) is ARMs first modern architecture. It introduced their new command stream frontend (CSF), reducing the CPU dependency of draw call building and adding crucial features like multi-draw indirect and compute queues. Non-uniform index texture sampling is significantly faster and the AFBC lossless compressor now supports 16-bit floating point targets. G710 supports Vulkan BDA and descriptor buffer extensions and is capable of supporting the new 2025 unified image layout extension with future drivers. The Mali-G715 (2022) introduced support for ray-tracing.</p><p><strong>Qualcomm Adreno 650 </strong>(2019) supports Vulkan BDA, descriptor buffer and unified image layout extensions, 16-bit storage/math, dynamic rendering and extended dynamic state with the latest Turnip open source drivers. Adreno 740 (2022) introduced support for ray-tracing.</p><p><strong>PowerVR DXT</strong> (Pixel 10, 2025) is PowerVRs first architecture that supports Vulkan descriptor buffer and buffer device address extensions. It also supports 64-bit atomics, 8-bit and 16-bit storage/math, dynamic rendering, extended dynamic state and all the other features we require.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Modern graphics API have improved gradually in the past 10 years. Six years after DirectX 12 launch, SM 6.6 (2021) introduced the modern global texture heap, allowing fully bindless renderer design. Metal 4.0 (2025) and CUDA have a clean 64-bit pointer based shader architecture with minimal binding API surface. Vulkan has the most restrictive standard, but extensions such as buffer device access (2020), descriptor buffer (2022) and unified image layouts (2025) add support for modern bindless infrastructure, but tools are still lagging behind. As of today, there’s no single API that meets all our requirements, but if we combine their best bits together, we can build the perfect API for modern hardware.</p><p>10 years ago, modern APIs were designed for CPU-driven binding models. New bindless features were presented as optional features and extensions. A clean break would improve the usability and reduce the API bloat and driver complexity significantly. It’s extremely difficult to get the whole industry behind a brand new API. I am hoping that vendors are willing to drop backwards compatibility in their new major API versions (Vulkan 2.0, DirectX 13) to embrace the fully bindless GPU architecture we have today. A new bindless API design would solve the mismatch between the API and the game engine RHI, allowing us to get rid of the hash maps and fine grained resource tracking. Metal 4.0 is close to this goal, but it is still missing the global indexable texture heap. A 64-bit texture handle can’t represent a range of textures.</p><p>HLSL and GLSL shading languages were designed over 20 years ago as a framework of 1:1 elementwise transform functions (vertex, pixel, geometry, hull, domain, etc). Memory access is abstracted and array handling is cumbersome as there’s no support for pointers. Despite 20 years of existence, HLSL and GLSL have failed to accumulate a library ecosystem. CUDA in contrast is a composable language exposing memory directly and new features (such as AI tensor cores) though intrinsics. CUDA has a broad library ecosystem, which has propelled Nvidia into $4T valuation. We should learn from it.</p><p>WebGPU note: WebGPU design is based on 10 year old core Vulkan 1.0 with extra restrictions. WebGPU doesn’t support bindless resources, 64-bit GPU pointers or persistently mapped GPU memory. It feels like a mix between DirectX 11 and Vulkan 1.0. It is a great improvement for web graphics, but doesn’t meet modern bindless API standards. I will discuss WebGPU in a separate blog post.&nbsp;</p><p>My prototype API shows what is achievable with modern GPU architectures today, if we mix the best bits from all the latest APIs. It is possible to build an API that is simpler to use than DirectX 11 and Metal 1.0, yet it offers better performance and flexibility than DirectX 12 and Vulkan. We should embrace the modern bindless hardware.&nbsp;</p><h2>Appendix</h2><p>A simple user land GPU bump allocator used in all example code. We call gpuHostToDevicePointer once in the temp allocator constructor. We can perform standard pointer arithmetic (such as offset) on GPU pointers. Traditional Vulkan/DX12 buffer APIs require a separate offset. This simplifies the API and user code (ptr vs handle+offset pair). A production ready temp allocator would implement overflow handing (grow, flush, etc).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2022, Rishabh Mishra joined a high-ranking engineering college in India’s Jabalpur with the most predictable dream in global tech: study computer science, write code, and one day make it to Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Three years later, Mishra faces a sobering reality.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence has gutted entry-level roles in the tech industry that Mishra and his classmates were counting on. Among his 400 classmates at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Design and Manufacturing, fewer than 25% have secured job offers. His course ends in May 2026, and there’s a sense of panic on the campus.</p>



<figure><audio controls="" src="https://restofworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rishab-final.mp3"></audio><figcaption><strong>Listen:</strong>&nbsp;Rishabh Mishra describes how the reality of tech jobs is very different from what he was told</figcaption></figure>



<p>“It is really bad out there,” Mishra told <em>Rest of World. </em>“Everyone is so panicked — even our juniors. As the degree end nears, the anxiety is heightened among all of us.” Some of his classmates are exploring the option of pursuing higher studies before entering the job market. “But after one year, if you return to the job market, your degree is even more irrelevant,” he said.</p>



<p>Students at engineering colleges in India, China, Dubai, and Kenya are facing a “jobpocalypse” as artificial intelligence replaces humans in entry-level roles. Tasks once assigned to fresh graduates, such as debugging, testing, and routine software maintenance, are now increasingly automated.</p>



<p>Over the last three years, the <a href="https://www.signalfire.com/blog/signalfire-state-of-talent-report-2025">number of fresh graduates</a> hired by big tech companies globally has declined by more than 50%, according to a report published by SignalFire, a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. Even though hiring rebounded slightly in 2024, only 7% of new hires were recent graduates. As many as 37% of managers said they’d rather use AI than hire a Gen Z employee.</p>



<p>“As demand for junior roles declines, even highly credentialed engineering graduates are struggling to break into tech, especially at the Big Tech companies,” the report said.&nbsp;</p>


<figure><blockquote><p>Even highly credentialed engineering graduates are struggling to break into tech.”</p></blockquote></figure>


<p>Indian IT services companies have reduced entry-level roles by 20%–25% thanks to automation and AI, consulting firm <a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/artificial-intelligence/entry-level-tech-demand-falls-20-25-as-india-shifts-to-a-diamond-shaped-workforce-ey-article-13679052.html">EY said in a report last month</a>. Job platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Eures noted a <a href="https://talentup.io/blog/why-entry-level-jobs-in-europe-are-becoming-harder-to-find-in-2025/">35% decline in junior tech positions</a> across major EU countries during 2024.</p>



<p>The World Economic Forum’s <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/">Future of Jobs Report 2025</a> warned that 40% of employers expect to reduce staff where AI can automate tasks.</p>



<p>“Five years ago, there was a real war for [coders and developers]. There was bidding to hire,” and 90% of the hires were for off-the-shelf technical roles, or positions that utilize ready-made technology products rather than requiring in-house development, said Vahid Haghzare, director at IT hiring firm Silicon Valley Associates Recruitment in Dubai<em>.</em></p>



<p>Since the rise of AI, “it has dropped dramatically,” he said. “I don’t even think it’s touching 5%. It’s almost completely vanished.” The company headhunts workers from multiple countries including China, Singapore, and the U.K.</p>



<p>While high-paying jobs at coveted brands like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta rarely cross his desk these days, companies that hire recent engineering graduates expect them to execute “additional responsibilities,” like managing a project or leading sales. “They have to face the customer and have customer communications and maybe even do some selling,” Haghzare said.</p>



<p>Some engineering students have realigned their ambitions to meet such demands from employers. Nishant Kaushik, who studied computer science at another well-ranked college in eastern India, has decided to look for roles in sales or marketing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rise of AI has also rendered engineering degrees less relevant: Workplace demands now differ from what is taught in colleges.</p>



<p>When Rita Sande Lukale enrolled in an electronics engineering program at the Technical University of Kenya in 2021, she hoped to land a role in the system architecture sector after graduation. Over the past few years, however, she has seen such roles disappear.</p>



<figure><audio controls="" src="https://restofworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Rita-final.m4a"></audio><figcaption><strong>Listen:</strong> Rita Sande Lukale describes how AI has replaced humans in simple repetitive tasks.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Entry-level jobs such as handling data logging, system diagnostics, or code writing have been replaced by AI, Lukale told <em>Rest of World</em>. Now, fresh graduates “must possess higher-level skills, necessary to understand algorithms and use the engineering judgement to troubleshoot the complex and automated systems,” she said.</p>



<p>While she doesn’t consider AI to be a “job destroyer,” it has fundamentally changed the type of engineers that companies need to hire, Lukale said. She feels she needs to adapt and learn more to land a job.</p>



<p>Not only are fresh graduates expected to understand and use the latest tools efficiently, “they are asked to up their output by 70% because ‘they are using AI,’” Liam Fallon, who heads the product division at GoodSpace AI, an AI-powered recruiting company, told <em>Rest of World</em>. As a result, students face a rapidly changing industry that requires them to upskill outside the curriculum on their own. Experts believe universities are unable to align their academic practices fast enough to meet&nbsp;AI-driven industry demands.</p>



<p>The current system, where a student commits three to five years to learn computer science and then looks for a job, is “not sustainable,” Haghzare said. Students are “falling down a hole, and they don’t know how to get out of it.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-c021e89c-c247-0617-1dae-6dd36d1352b4-250b2c58"><p>TL;DR</p><p>GitHub is adding a $0.002-per-minute fee on all GitHub Actions usage, so the control plane is no longer free.</p></div><div id="w-node-_9e21598a-bd92-e71f-267e-33e11a0f4df0-250b2c58"><h2><strong>What's happening?</strong></h2><p>GitHub just <a href="https://resources.github.com/actions/2026-pricing-changes-for-github-actions/">announced changes</a> to Actions pricing. Previously, GitHub Actions had a free control plane. That meant if you used GitHub Actions but ran jobs outside of GitHub-hosted runners, whether that’s on Blacksmith, on your own machines, or in your own AWS account, you paid nothing to GitHub for those minutes; you only paid for the compute.</p><p>With this change, GitHub is introducing a $0.002 per-minute platform fee for <em>all</em> GitHub Actions usage.</p><p>In practice, this means CI costs now have two components:</p><ul role="list"><li>Compute costs (whoever runs your runners)</li><li>A flat GitHub platform fee, charged per minute of Actions usage</li></ul><p>These changes go into effect on March 1st, 2026.</p><h2>Our perspective on why they’re making these changes</h2><p>GitHub Actions has long had a graduation churn problem. As companies grow, their CI workloads become larger, more complex, and more expensive. At a certain scale, GitHub-hosted runners become both slow and costly, pushing teams to self-host or move to third-party runners like Blacksmith.</p><p>Until now, that shift had an important side effect: companies could continue using the GitHub Actions control plane while paying GitHub nothing for CI execution. GitHub provided scheduling, orchestration, and workflow automation, but captured no revenue from some of its largest and fastest-growing customers.</p><p>The new per-minute platform fee changes that. It directly monetizes the Actions control plane and establishes a floor on what GitHub earns from CI, regardless of where jobs run. In effect, self-hosting is no longer free.</p><p>At the same time, GitHub reduced the price of GitHub-hosted runners. This isn’t accidental. Lower hosted runner prices make GitHub-hosted runners more attractive, while the platform fee introduces a new, unavoidable cost for self-hosting.</p><p>From GitHub’s perspective, this is a rational move. Most Actions usage is concentrated on smaller runners, so the hosted runner price cuts likely don’t materially impact revenue. More importantly, GitHub is trading lower-margin compute revenue for higher-margin platform revenue.</p><p>Hosted runners are fundamentally a compute business. The platform fee, by contrast, monetizes software without scaling infrastructure costs linearly. As CI usage grows, that revenue scales with significantly better unit economics.</p><p>In the past, our customers have asked us how GitHub views third-party runners long-term. The platform fee largely answers that: GitHub now monetizes Actions usage regardless of where jobs run, aligning third-party runners like Blacksmith as ecosystem partners rather than workarounds.</p><h2><strong>Per-minute CI pricing and its impact on self-hosting</strong></h2><p>Before this change, self-hosting was a way to avoid paying GitHub entirely. That’s no longer true. Now, self-hosting retains the operational burden of running CI infrastructure while still incurring per-minute charges on GitHub.</p><p>At that point, the primary variable you can still control is how many minutes your CI jobs consume. One approach is to run CI on infrastructure designed to minimize wall-clock time and eliminate redundant work. That’s the problem Blacksmith focuses on. In practice, this shows up in a few areas:</p><ul role="list"><li>Faster machines. Blacksmith runs CI jobs on CPUs that have 50%+ higher single-core performance than GitHub-hosted runners. As part of ongoing fleet upgrades, we’re deploying even newer instances that add an additional 15–25% improvement, further reducing runtime for CPU-bound workloads.</li><li>Reusing work across runs. <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/docker-builds">Docker layer caches</a> are persisted across CI runs, allowing unchanged layers to be reused rather than rebuilt, cutting Docker build times from tens of minutes to seconds for many customers.</li><li>Container caching (beta). Service containers can be pre-hydrated on runners, removing repeated <a href="https://docs.blacksmith.sh/blacksmith-caching/docker-container-caching">image pulls and extraction</a> from the job startup path.</li></ul><p>With a per-minute platform fee, CI performance and cost are tightly coupled. The remaining lever is reducing CI time and total Actions.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>

<hr><i>What is FVWM-95?</i></h2>
Fvwm95 is a hack based on <a href="http://www.fvwm.org/">fvwm2</a>.
It tries to emulate the good features of a well known product without bloating
the regular fvwm code.
<p>The main aspects are:
</p><ul>
<li>
A familiar look and feel. It can be interesting for users moving from the
MS-World to Unix, or for those who have to switch regularly between the
two. Or for those that simply would like to have the same MS look and feel
in Unix, or for those that want to have just another window manager.
But before all, it's meant to be useful, simple and efficient.</li>

<li>
Same flexible and easy configuration as the native fvwm.</li>

<li>
Functionality extensible via loadable modules.</li>

<li>
A taskbar: find quickly an application window and don't take space with
icon windows.</li>
</ul>
Shortly after releasing the first version of fvwm95, we started working
on a desktop-folder metaphor for the window manager in order to have a more complete
emulation of the Windows-95 desktop. The development evolved towards the
creation of a <a href="http://xclass.sourceforge.net/index.html">C++ class
library</a>, providing an easily extensible set of Win95-looking widgets,
which eased the development of new applications.
<p>Here are some fvwm95 screenshots:
</p><ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Today we’re announcing updates to our pricing and product models for GitHub Actions. </p><div><p>Why? </p>
<p>When we shipped Actions in 2018, we had no idea how popular it would become. By early 2024, the platform was running about 23 million jobs per day and our existing architecture couldn’t reliably support our growth curve. In order to increase feature velocity, we first needed to improve reliability and modernize the legacy frameworks that supported GitHub Actions. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/lets-talk-about-github-actions/">Our solution was to re-architect the core backend services powering GitHub Actions jobs</a> and runners with the goals of improving uptime and resilience against infrastructure issues, enhancing performance, reducing internal throttles, and leveraging GitHub’s broader platform investments and developer experience improvements. This work is paying off by helping us handle our current scale, even as we work through the last pieces of stabilizing our new platform.</p>
<p>Since August, all GitHub Actions jobs have run on our new architecture, which handles 71 million jobs per day (over 3x from where we started). Individual enterprises are able to start 7x more jobs per minute than our previous architecture could support. </p>
<p>As with any product, our goal at GitHub has been to meet customer needs while providing enterprises with flexibility and transparency.</p>
<p>This change better supports a world where CI/CD must be faster and more reliable, better caching, more workflow flexibility, rock-solid reliability, and strengthens the core experience while positioning GitHub Actions to power GitHub’s open, secure platform for agentic workload. </p>
<h2>What’s changing?</h2>
<h3>Lower prices for GitHub-hosted runners</h3>
<p>Starting today, we’re charging fairly for Actions across the board which reduces the price of GitHub Hosted Runners and the price the average GitHub customer pays. And we’re <strong>reducing the net cost of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39%</strong>, depending on which machine type is used.</p>
<p>This reduction is driven by a ~40% price reduction across all runner sizes, paired with the addition of a new $0.002 per-minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge. For GitHub-hosted runners, the new Actions cloud platform charge is <strong>already included into the reduced meter price.</strong> </p>
<p>Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on <strong>public repositories will remain free</strong>. <strong>GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted</strong> by this change.</p>
<p>The price reduction you will see in your account depends on the types of machines that you use most frequently – smaller runners will have a smaller relative price reduction, larger runners will see a larger relative reduction.</p>
<p>This price reduction makes high-performance compute more accessible for both high-volume CI workloads and the agent jobs that rely on fast, secure execution environments.</p>
<p>For full pricing update details, see the updated Actions runner prices <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">in our documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This price change will <strong>go into effect on January 1, 2026</strong>.</p>
<h3>Introduction of the GitHub Actions cloud platform charge</h3>
<p>We are introducing a <strong>$0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform</strong> <strong>charge</strong> for all Actions workflows across GitHub-hosted and self-hosted runners. The new listed GitHub-runner rates include this charge. This will not impact Actions usage in public repositories or GitHub Enterprise Server customers.  </p>
<p>This aligns pricing to match consumption patterns and ensures consistent service quality as usage grows across both hosting modalities.</p>
<p>This will impact <strong>self-hosted runner pricing starting March 1, 2026.</strong></p>
<h3>Deepened investment in the Actions self-hosted experience</h3>
<p>We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months. Here’s a preview of what to expect in the new year:</p>
<h4>GitHub Scale Set Client</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1192">new client</a> provides enterprises with a lightweight Go SDK to build custom autoscaling solutions without the complexity of Kubernetes or reliance on ARC. It integrates seamlessly with existing infrastructure—containers, virtual machines, cloud instances, or bare metal—while managing job queuing, secure configuration, and intelligent scaling logic. Customers gain a supported path to implement flexible autoscaling, reduce setup friction, and extend GitHub Actions beyond workflows to scenarios such as self-hosted Dependabot and Copilot Coding Agent.</p>
<h4>Multi-label support</h4>
<p>We are reintroducing <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1195">multi-label functionality</a> for both GitHub-hosted larger runners and self-hosted runners, including those managed by Actions Runner Controller (ARC) and the new Scale Set Client.</p>
<h4>Actions Runner Controller 0.14.0</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1194">This upcoming release</a> introduces major quality-of-life improvements, including refined Helm charts for easier Docker configuration, enhanced logging, updated metrics, and formalized versioning requirements. It also announces the deprecation of legacy ARC, providing a clear migration path to a more reliable and maintainable architecture. Customers benefit from simplified setup, improved observability, and confidence in long-term support, reducing operational friction and improving scalability.</p>
<h4>Actions Data Stream</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/1193">Actions Data Stream</a> will deliver a near real-time, authoritative feed of GitHub Actions workflow and job event data, including metadata such as the version of the action that was executed on any given workflow run. This capability enhances observability and troubleshooting by enabling organizations to integrate event data into monitoring and analytics systems for compliance and operational insights. By providing structured, high-fidelity data at scale, it eliminates reliance on manual log parsing and empowers teams to proactively manage reliability and performance.</p>
<h2>Why this matters</h2>
<p>Agents are expanding what teams can automate—but CI/CD remains the heartbeat of modern software delivery. These updates enable both a faster, more reliable CI/CD experience for every developer, and a scalable, flexible, secure execution layer to power GitHub’s agentic platform.</p>
<p>Our goal is to ensure GitHub Actions continues to meet the needs of the largest enterprises and of individual developers alike, with clear pricing, stronger performance, and a product direction built for the next decade of software development.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>What are the new GitHub-hosted runner rates?</strong><br>See the GitHub Actions <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">runner pricing reference</a> for the updated rates that will go into effect on January 1, 2026. These listed rates include the new $0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform charge.</p>
<p><strong>Which job execution scenarios for GitHub Actions are affected by this pricing change?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs that run in private repositories and use standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners  </li>
<li>Any jobs running on larger GitHub-hosted runners</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free. GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted by this change.</p>
<p><strong>When will this pricing change take effect?</strong></p>
<p>The price decrease for GitHub-hosted runners will take effect on January 1, 2026. The new charge for self-hosted runners will apply beginning on March 1, 2026. The price changes will impact all customers on these dates.</p>
<p><strong>Will the free usage quota available in my plan change?</strong><br>Beginning March 1, 2026, self-hosted runners will be included within your free usage quota, and will consume available usage based on list price the same way that Linux, Windows, and MacOS standard runners work today.</p>
<p><strong>Will self-hosted runner usage consume from my free usage minutes?</strong><br>Yes, billable self-hosted runner usage will be able to consume minutes from the free quota associated with your plan.</p>
<p><strong>How does this pricing change affect customers on GitHub Enterprise Server?</strong></p>
<p>This pricing change does not affect customers using GitHub Enterprise Server. Customers running Actions jobs on self-hosted runners on GitHub Enterprise Server may continue to host, manage, troubleshoot and use Actions on and in conjunction with their implementation free of charge. </p>
<p><strong>Can I bill my self-hosted runner usage on private repositories through Azure?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as long as you have an active Azure subscription ID associated with your GitHub Enterprise or Organization(s).</p>
<p><strong>What is the overall impact of this change to GitHub customers?</strong></p>
<p>Of Actions users impacted by this change, 85% will see their Actions bill decrease. Of the 15% who are impacted across all cohorts the median increase is $13. </p>
<p><strong>Did GitHub consider how this impacts individual developers, not just Enterprise scale customers of GitHub?</strong><br>From our individual users (free &amp; Pro plans) of those who used GitHub Actions in the last month in private repos only 0.09% would end up with a price increase, with a median increase of under $2 a month. Note that this impact is after these users have made use of their included minutes in their plans today, entitling them to over 33 hours of included GitHub compute, and this has no impact on their free use of public repos. A further 2.8% of this total user base will see a decrease in their monthly cost as a result of these changes. The rest are unimpacted by this change.</p>
<p><strong>How can I figure out what my new monthly cost for Actions looks like?</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Actions provides <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use">detailed usage reports for the current and prior year</a>. You can use this prior usage alongside the <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">rate changes</a> that will be introduced in January and March to estimate cost under the new pricing structure. We have created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/tutorials/estimate-actions-costs">Python script</a> to help you leverage <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use#downloading-usage-reports">full usage reports</a> to calculate your expected cost after the price updates.</p>
<p>We have also updated our <a href="https://github.com/pricing/calculator#actions">Actions pricing calculator</a>, making it easier to estimate your future costs, particularly if your historical usage is limited or not representative of expected future usage.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Six months after EU regulators found Apple's App Store rules <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/19/google_apple_dma_eu/">in breach of the Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA), developers say Cupertino is still behaving as if compliance were optional.</p>
<p>The Coalition for App Fairness, a nonprofit organization of app developers and consumer groups, has accused Apple of persistent non-compliance with the DMA, warning that the company's revised App Store terms continue to impose fees which the legislation prohibits.</p>
<p>In <a target="_blank" href="https://appfairness.org/open-letter-stop-apples-illegal-app-store-fees-under-dma/" rel="nofollow">an open letter</a> addressed to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and senior commissioners, the coalition argues that Apple has failed to deliver "any meaningful changes or proposals" despite an April 2025 non-compliance decision that found its App Store policies illegal and harmful to both developers and consumers.</p>

    

<p>At the heart of the complaint is money. The DMA requires so-called gatekeepers to allow developers to offer and conduct transactions outside their app stores without charge. Apple, the coalition claims, is seeking to charge commissions of up to 20 percent on those very transactions.</p>

        


        

<p>"This is a blatant disregard for the law with the potential to vanquish years of meaningful work by the Commission," the letter states, accusing Apple of preserving the economics of its App Store while nominally claiming compliance.</p>
<p>Apple has said it will roll out new App Store terms in January 2026, but developers say the company has provided no clarity on what those changes will involve or whether they will actually comply with the DMA.</p>

        

<p>"We have seen this playbook before in Europe and beyond," the signatories warn, adding that they suspect any new terms will continue to impose fees that would violate the law.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/18/amazon_microsoft_cloud_dma/">Brussels eyes AWS, Azure for gatekeeper tag in cloud clampdown</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/26/google_apple_dma_review_submissions/">Apple, Google tell Europe its Digital Markets Act isn't working for them – or consumers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/20/google_play_eu_changes/">Google tweaks Play Store fees to keep Euro watchdogs at bay</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/07/apple_appeals_500m_eu_antisteering/">Apple tries to get €500M EU fine tossed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The letter argues that this uncertainty is already doing damage. Six months after Apple's last App Store terms update, developers still do not know which rules will govern their businesses or what their costs will look like in the near term.</p>
<p>Apple's "lack of transparency in tandem with its rushed timelines," the coalition says, is freezing investment and innovation, effectively allowing the company to "exploit its gatekeeper position by holding the entire industry hostage."</p>
<p>The group also points to a growing transatlantic contrast that makes Europe look like the tougher regulator with the weaker results. While Apple continues to fight DMA enforcement in the EU, US courts have moved to curb its ability to extract fees from external transactions. Following litigation brought by Epic Games, developers in the US can now communicate freely with customers about pricing and offer payment options outside Apple's ecosystem without paying commission.</p>
<p>That raises what the coalition calls a "simple and urgent question." Why should European developers and consumers get a worse deal than their US counterparts, especially when the EU was first to pass a landmark law aimed at fixing digital markets? The letter argues that meaningful enforcement of the DMA would strengthen Europe's digital competitiveness and attract global investment, while weak enforcement risks turning the regulation into an expensive paper exercise.</p>

        

<p>"We trust the Commission will uphold the DMA," the signatories conclude, but they warn that if enforcement falls short, they will continue pressing policymakers to ensure Apple finally complies with the law as written – not as rewritten by Cupertino. ®</p>

<p>Today, I step into the role of CEO of <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Corporation</a>. It is a privilege to lead an organization with a long history of standing up for people and building technology that puts them first. The internet is changing fast, and so are the expectations people bring to the products they use every day. Mozilla has a critical role to play at this moment.</p>



<p>I want to thank Laura Chambers for her exceptional leadership. As interim CEO, Laura led Mozilla through a defining moment in the web’s history — navigating AI’s arrival, a major antitrust case, double-digit mobile growth in Firefox, and the early success of our revenue diversification strategy. She brought clarity, stability, and focus to the organization, and I’m grateful for her leadership through this transition and am glad she’ll continue to be part of Mozilla, returning to her role on the Mozilla board of directors.</p>



<p>When I joined Mozilla, it was clear that trust was going to become the defining issue in technology and the browser would be where this battle would play out. AI was already reshaping how people search, shop, and make decisions in ways that were hard to see and even harder to understand. I saw how easily people could lose their footing in experiences that feel personal but operate in ways that are anything but clear. And I knew this would become a defining issue, especially in the browser, where so many decisions about privacy, data, and transparency now originate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>People want software that is fast, modern, but also honest about what it does. They want to understand what’s happening and to have real choices.</p>



<p>Mozilla and Firefox can be that choice.</p>



<p>Few companies share our strengths. People trust our brand. Firefox brings us global reach. Our teams know how to build reliable, independent software at scale, and our business model puts the user first.</p>



<p>As Mozilla moves forward, we will focus on becoming the trusted software company. This is not a slogan. It is a direction that guides how we build and how we grow. It means three things.</p>



<ul>
<li>First: Every product we build must give people agency in how it works. Privacy, data use, and AI must be clear and understandable. Controls must be simple. AI should always be a choice — something people can easily turn off. People should know why a feature works the way it does and what value they get from it.</li>



<li>Second: our business model must align with trust. We will grow through transparent monetization that people recognize and value.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Third: Firefox will grow from a browser into a broader ecosystem of trusted software. Firefox will remain our anchor. It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions.</li>
</ul>



<p>We will measure our progress against a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/278/files/2025/11/Mozilla-Summary-Portfolio-Strategy.pdf">double bottom line</a>. Our work must advance our mission and succeed in the market. In the next three years, that means investing in AI that reflects the Mozilla Manifesto. It means diversifying revenue beyond search.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Success means Firefox grows across generations. Mozilla builds new revenue engines. Our principles become a differentiator.</p>



<p>We will move with urgency. AI is changing software. Browsers are becoming the control point for digital life. Regulation is shifting defaults. These shifts play to Mozilla’s strengths.</p>



<p>If we stay focused, Mozilla will grow in relevance and resilience. Firefox will reach new audiences. Our portfolio will strengthen our independence. Our approach to building trusted software will set a high standard for the industry.</p>



<p>Mozilla is ready for this moment. I am excited for the work ahead and grateful for the trust placed in me.</p>

		<p>For almost three decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been one of the main tools in brain research. Yet a new study published in the renowned journal Nature Neuroscience fundamentally challenges the way fMRI data have so far been interpreted with regard to neuronal activity. According to the findings, there is no generally valid coupling between the oxygen content measured by MRI and neuronal activity.</p>

	<p>Researchers at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg (FAU) found that an increased fMRI signal is associated with reduced brain activity in around 40 percent of cases. At the same time, they observed decreased fMRI signals in regions with elevated activity. First author Dr. Samira Epp emphasizes: “This contradicts the long-standing assumption that increased brain activity is always accompanied by an increased blood flow to meet higher oxygen demand. Since tens of thousands of fMRI studies worldwide are based on this assumption, our results could lead to opposite interpretations in many of them.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><topic>A brief history of Times&nbsp;New&nbsp;Roman</topic><p><img src="https://typographyforlawyers.com/images/tally-of-types.jpg"></p><p>Times New Ro­man gets its name from the <em>Times</em> of Lon­don, the British news­pa­per. In 1929, the <em>Times</em> hired ty­pog­ra­pher Stan­ley Mori­son to cre­ate a new text font. Mori­son led the project, su­per­vis­ing Vic­tor Lar­dent, an ad­ver­tis­ing artist for the <em>Times</em>, who drew the <span>letterforms.</span></p><p>Even when new, Times New Ro­man had its crit­ics. In his ty­po­graphic mem­oir, <book>A Tally of Types</book>, Mori­son good-na­turedly imag­ined what William Mor­ris (re­spon­si­ble for the open­ing il­lus­tra­tion in <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/page-layout.html">page lay­out</a>) might have said about it:<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “As</dquo-open-pull> a new face it should, by the grace of God and the art of man, have been broad and open, gen­er­ous and am­ple; in­stead, by the vice of Mam­mon and the mis­ery of the ma­chine, it is big­oted and nar­row, mean and <span>puritan.”</span></p><p>Be­cause it was used in a daily news­pa­per, the new font quickly be­came pop­u­lar among print­ers of the day. In the decades since, type­set­ting de­vices have evolved, but Times New Ro­man has al­ways been one of the first fonts avail­able for each new de­vice (in­clud­ing per­sonal com­put­ers). This, in turn, has only in­creased its <span>reach.</span></p><p>Ob­jec­tively, there’s noth­ing wrong with Times New Ro­man. It was de­signed for a news­pa­per, so it’s a bit nar­rower than most text fonts—<strong>es­pe­cially the bold style</strong>. (News­pa­pers pre­fer nar­row fonts be­cause they fit more text per line.) <em>The italic is mediocre.</em> But those aren’t fa­tal flaws. Times New Ro­man is a work­horse font that’s been suc­cess­ful for a <span>reason.</span></p><p>Yet it’s an open ques­tion whether its longevity is at­trib­ut­able to its qual­ity or merely its ubiq­uity. Hel­vetica still in­spires enough af­fec­tion to have been the sub­ject of a 2007 doc­u­men­tary fea­ture. Times New Ro­man, mean­while, has not at­tracted sim­i­lar acts of <span>homage.</span></p><p>Why not? Fame has a dark side. When Times New Ro­man ap­pears in a book, doc­u­ment, or ad­ver­tise­ment, it con­notes ap­a­thy. It says,<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “I</dquo-open-pull> sub­mit­ted to the font of least re­sis­tance.” Times New Ro­man is not a font choice so much as the ab­sence of a font choice, like the black­ness of deep space is not a color. To look at Times New Ro­man is to gaze into the&nbsp;<span>void.</span></p><p>This is how Times New Ro­man ac­crued its rep­u­ta­tion as the de­fault font of the le­gal pro­fes­sion—it’s the de­fault font of every­thing. As a re­sult, many law­yers er­ro­neously as­sume that courts de­mand 12-point Times New Ro­man. In fact, I’ve never found one that does. (But there is one no­table court that for­bids it—see <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/court-opinions.html">court opin­ions</a>.) In gen­eral, law­yers keep us­ing it not be­cause they must, but be­cause it’s fa­mil­iar and en­trenched—much like those ob­so­lete <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/typewriter-habits.html">type­writer habits</a>.</p><p>If you have a choice about us­ing Times New Ro­man, <strong>please stop</strong>. You have plenty of bet­ter al­ter­na­tives—whether it’s a dif­fer­ent <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/system-fonts.html">sys­tem font</a> or one of the many pro­fes­sional fonts shown in this <span>chapter.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

</div><!-- /.post-info --> <p>I thought about this when reading a mastodon post which commented on a news
where a project adopted a "use Generative AI but disclose it" policy, because
it is "the future" and "people are going to use it anyway".</p>
<p>I find the "this is the future, like it or not" framing particularly disgusting,
and it is somewhat common in tech circles to accept it for most "new"
technologies as if it was backed by evidence.</p>
<p>This post is to underline that <strong>Nothing is inevitable.</strong></p>
<div id="modern-technology-is-abusive">
<h2>Modern technology is abusive.</h2>
<p>A small contingent of power users using niche OSes (like myself) survive by avoiding as much of the tech oligarchs’ world as I can, sure, but overall everything is disgusting, and using FOSS is certainly no silver bullet.</p>
<p>Tech enthusiasts who do not apply critical thinking are even worse, because they get beat up everyday by the things they buy at a premium <em>and they like it</em> because they have this twisted idea of what constitutes progress. This is slowly infusing into the general population, which is also a problem.</p>
<p>People have been trained to be abused by software and by hardware, to ignore their needs, to accept any change as inevitable.
I speak of abuse because people have been trained to <em>expect</em> and <em>accept</em> change at the same time, with no agency whatsoever.</p>
<p>Most old people in particular (sorry mom) have given up and resigned themselves to drift wherever their computing devices take them, because under the guise of convenience, everything is so hostile that there is no point trying to learn things, and dark patterns are everywhere.
Not being in control of course makes people endlessy frustrated, but at the same time trying to wrestle control from the parasites is an uphill battle that they expect to lose, with more frustration as a result.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize here that there are good products (both software and hardware) on the market even though the list gets shorter every year,
some products even manage to solve real problems (!!).
That does not change the fact that consent, hype and projected consumer needs are manufactured by years and years of abuse and marketing campaigns.</p>
<div id="those-things-were-or-are-not-inevitable">
<h3>Those things were or are not inevitable</h3>
<ul>
<li>Internet-connected beds are not inevitable.</li>
<li>AI browsers are not inevitable.</li>

<li>"Copilot PCs" are not inevitable.</li>
<li>Tiktok is not inevitable.</li>
<li>Your computer sending screenshots to microsoft so they can train AIs on it is not inevitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>I could spend years filling this list up, because the tech grifters always find new ways to make us more miserable.</p>
<p>Nothing is inevitable, nothing sold by powerful grifters is "the future" no matter how much they wish that were true.
Sure, some things can keep on existing, even for a very long time, even more if they have an untold number of billions - that they wormed they way into having by selling and exploiting personal data and attention -, but nobody has to be complicit. Some things might even end up existing because they are useful.</p>
<p>But what is important to me is to keep the perspective of what consitutes a <strong>desirable future</strong>, and which actions get us closer or further from that.</p>
<p>Every choice is <em>both</em> a <strong>political statement</strong> and a <strong>tradeoff</strong> based on the energy we can spend on the consequences of that choice.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Whenever you compile using Rust, the compiler goes through different passes and in the end, generated binary code for the target processor. By default, it uses LLVM as backend to generate the binary code, but more backends exist like cranelift and GCC. This post is about how it's possible for one compiler to use different backend to generate binaries, in particular GCC.</p>
<h2><a href="#Passes"><span></span></a>Passes</h2>
<p>Before going into details, we need to describe how compilers actually work. They read source code and convert it internally into a format they can manipulate, commonly called Abstract Syntax Tree (shortened "AST").</p>
<p>However, compilers go through multiple passes, and often each pass has their own AST. Let's take a short and very incomplete example with the Rust compiler passes. We have 4 steps (again, this is simplified!):</p>
<ol>
<li>AST: checks that the syntax is valid</li>
<li>HIR: checks if types are valid</li>
<li>MIR: checks lifetimes and runs borrow-checker</li>
<li>codegen: generate binary code (which also has multiple steps, but not detailed here)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each step generates a new AST with new information if no error was encountered and provides it to the next pass.</p>
<p>Little side-note: If enough people are interested by this topic, I can write a (much) longer explanation of these passes.</p>
<h2><a href="#Backend-vs-front-end"><span></span></a>Backend vs front-end</h2>
<p>So now that we have a high-level idea of Rust compiler passes, what is the difference between "front-end" and "back-end" exactly?</p>
<p>We consider the front-end to be the part handling (high-level non-exhaustive list) code parsing, linting, type-checking and borrow-checking (steps 1 to 3). When all this is done, it means the code is valid and needs to be translated to the target processor instructions set. To do so, we call LLVM/GCC which will translate the Rust compiler AST into assembly code (step 4).</p>
<p>The Rust compiler backends are the bridge between the Rust compiler AST and the actual code generator. They receive the AST and call the LLVM/GCC/... API which will in turn run their passes, optimize and finally generate the assembly code.</p>
<h2><a href="#Why-having-a-GCC-backend"><span></span></a>Why having a GCC backend</h2>
<p>LLVM being much more recent than GCC (2003 vs 1987), a lot of older processors are not supported and will never be. So if you want to write a Rust program on an old platform like Dreamcast, you have no choice to either write your own backend or use the GCC backend (or the <code>gccrs</code> front-end once ready).</p>
<p>For the readers interested in doing so, there is a guide explaining how to build Rust programs for Dreamcast <a href="https://www.dreamcast.rs/">here</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#gccrs-vs-GCC-backend"><span></span></a>gccrs vs GCC backend</h2>
<p>The GCC backend is different than <a href="https://rust-gcc.github.io/">gccrs</a> which is a front-end for GCC written in C++, which doesn't reuse the front-end of <code>rustc</code>, meaning they need to reimplement parsing, type-checking, linting, borrow-checking, compilation errors, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the GCC backend (the crate name is <code>rustc_codegen_gcc</code>) is just "yet another backend codegen" of the Rust compiler, like LLVM or Cranelift, only meant to generate the binary from the Rust compiler input. It's a bridge between Rust compiler's AST and the codegen API.</p>
<p>On that note: GCC doesn't provide a nice library to give access to its internals (unlike LLVM). So we have to use <code>libgccjit</code> which, unlike the "jit" ("just in time", meaning compiling sub-parts of the code on the fly, only when needed for performance reasons and often used in script languages like Javascript) part in its name implies, can be used as "aot" ("ahead of time", meaning you compile everything at once, allowing you to spend more time on optimization). To do so we use bindings, which are split in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/gccjit_sys"><code>gccjit-sys</code></a> which redeclares the C items we need.</li>
<li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/gccjit"><code>gccjit</code></a> which provides a nice API over <code>gccjit-sys</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to write your own compiler and use GCC as codegen, you can do it thanks to <code>libgccjit</code>. And if you write it in Rust, you can even use the Rust bindings.</p>
<h2><a href="#Implementing-a-Rust-backend"><span></span></a>Implementing a Rust backend</h2>
<p>Rustc has a crate named <code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code> which provides an abstract interface that a backend needs to implement through traits like:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.CodegenBackend.html">CodegenBackend</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.ExtraBackendMethods.html">ExtraBackendMethods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.WriteBackendMethods.html">WriteBackendMethods</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The full list is available <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>One last thing you need to write in your backend:</p>
<pre><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?code=fn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++%23%5Bno_mangle%5D%0A++++pub+fn+_rustc_codegen_backend%28%29+-%3E+Box%3Cdyn+CodegenBackend%3E+%7B%0A++++++++%2F%2F+This+is+the+entrypoint.%0A++++%7D%0A%7D%0A">Run</a><code>#[no_mangle]
pub fn _rustc_codegen_backend() -&gt; Box&lt;dyn CodegenBackend&gt; {
    // This is the entrypoint.
}</code></pre>
<p>This is the function that will be called by rustc to run your backend.</p>
<h2><a href="#Codegen-implementation-example"><span></span></a>Codegen implementation example</h2>
<p>Let's take an example: how the GCC backend creates a constant string. I picked this one because it's small enough to showcase how things work while not being too much information to digest at once.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.ConstCodegenMethods.html">ConstCodegenMethods</a> trait, there is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.ConstCodegenMethods.html#tymethod.const_str">const_str</a> method. This is the method we will implement to declare a constant string.</p>
<p>So the method implementation so far looks like this:</p>
<pre><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?code=fn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++impl%3C%27gcc%2C+%27tcx%3E+ConstCodegenMethods+for+CodegenCx%3C%27gcc%2C+%27tcx%3E+%7B%0A++++++++%2F%2F%2F+Returns+the+pointer+to+the+string+and+its+length.%0A++++++++fn+const_str%28%26self%2C+s%3A+%26str%29+-%3E+%28RValue%3C%27gcc%3E%2C+RValue%3C%27gcc%3E%29+%7B%0A++++++++++++%2F%2F+Call+GCC+API+to+declare+this+string.%0A++++++++%7D%0A++++%7D%0A%7D%0A">Run</a><code>impl&lt;'gcc, 'tcx&gt; ConstCodegenMethods for CodegenCx&lt;'gcc, 'tcx&gt; {
    /// Returns the pointer to the string and its length.
    fn const_str(&amp;self, s: &amp;str) -&gt; (RValue&lt;'gcc&gt;, RValue&lt;'gcc&gt;) {
        // Call GCC API to declare this string.
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>We need to pause here to give some extra explanations: <code>CodegenCx</code> is the type on which most <code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code> traits will be implemented. It is created in each <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/traits/trait.ExtraBackendMethods.html#tymethod.compile_codegen_unit">ExtraBackendMethods::compile_codegen_unit</a> call and passed down from there to generate the code for this module. You can consider it the same as a cache. It keeps the list of items declared, like functions, types, globals, etc. But also information such as "boolean type", "i8 type" and equivalents so we don't need to recompute them every time we need them.</p>
<p>Ok so now let's actually implement it. We have a few things to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>To avoid adding the same constant string multiple times, we will need to cache them in our context.</li>
<li>We need to cast the Rust str type (<code>*const u8</code>) into the C type (<code>*const char</code>).</li>
<li>Get the pointer to this constant string and return it.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's translate it into code with a lot of comments to help understanding what's going on:</p>

        // We call the `GCC` API to create a new const string.
        let string = self.context.new_string_literal(s);
        // We name the const.
        let sym = self.generate_local_symbol_name("str");
        // We declare it.
        let global = self.declare_private_global(&amp;sym, self.val_ty(string));

    );
    // And we return the pointer and its length.
    (cs, self.const_usize(len as _))
}</code></pre>
<p>But the codegen backends can also add more information to the underlying binary code generator. For example, in Rust, we use references a lot. A reference is basically a pointer that cannot be <code>NULL</code>. We need to give this information as well!</p>
<p>In both GCC and LLVM, you can add attributes to a lot of items, like arguments of functions. So every time we see an argument behind a reference, we add the <code>nonnnull()</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Let's show an example with this Rust function:</p>
<pre><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?code=fn+main%28%29+%7B%0A++++fn+t%28a%3A+%26i32%29+-%3E+i32+%7B%0A++++++++%2Aa%0A++++%7D%0A%7D%0A">Run</a><code>fn t(a: &amp;i32) -&gt; i32 {
    *a
}</code></pre>
<p>The C equivalent looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>int t(int *a) {
  if (!a) {
    return -1;
  }
  return *a;
}</code></pre>
<p>Compiled with the <code>-O3</code> option, it generates this assembly:</p>
<pre><code>t:
        test    rdi, rdi              ; Check if `a` is 0
        je      .L5                   ; If `a` is 0, we jump to `.L1`
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdi]  ; We store `*a` value into `eax` registry
        ret                           ; We exit the function
.L5:
        mov     eax, -1               ; We store `-1` into `eax` registry
        ret                           ; We exit</code></pre>
<p>However, the Rust compiler knows that <code>a</code> can never be <code>NULL</code>, so the codegen adds <code>_attribute_((nonnull(1)))</code> on the function:</p>
<pre><code>_attribute_((nonnull(1)))
int t(int *a) {
  if (!a) {
    return -1;
  }
  return *a;
}</code></pre>
<p>Which generates this assembly:</p>
<pre><code>t:
        mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rdi]
        ret</code></pre>
<p>Since the codegen knows that the <code>if (!a)</code> condition will never be true, why keeping it around?</p>
<p>And it's just one example of extra information/optimization we do in the Rust backends. And that doesn't even cover in the slighest the monstruous amount of optimizations the codegen themselves do. If you want to have more examples of such optimizations, I strongly recommend reading the <a href="https://xania.org/AoCO2025">"Advent of Compiler Optimizations"</a> blog posts written by Matt Godbolt (the developer of <a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt.org</a>, another priceless tool).</p>
<h2><a href="#Words-of-the-end"><span></span></a>Words of the end</h2>
<p>So now you know what a Rust backend is, and why GCC backend is also an interesting thing to have while also learning about some optimizations we do behind developers back. :)</p>

<p>Sega broke ground in the late 90s with one of the first digital game distribution systems for consoles. Sega Channel offered access to a rotating library of Sega Genesis titles, along with game tips, demos, and even a few exclusive games that never came out in the United States in any other format. In an era of dial-up internet, Sega Channel delivered game data over television cable — a novel approach that gave the service its name.</p>



<p>In the years since, Sega Channel has been shrouded in a bit of mystery. The service was discontinued in 1998, and the lack of retrievable game data and documentation around Sega Channel has led to decades of speculation about it. We’ve mostly been left with magazine articles and second-hand accounts. Once in a while, one or two Sega Channel ROMs will show up online. How do you <em>preserve</em> a service like Sega Channel?</p>



<p>For the last two years, we’ve been working on a large-scale project to preserve the history of Sega Channel. Today, we unveiled our findings in a new YouTube video.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Don't Just Watch TV: The Secrets of Sega Channel" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CWCUmTTVjMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We’ll cut to the chase: In collaboration with multiple parties, we have recovered <strong>over 100 new Sega Channel ROMs</strong>, including system data, exclusive games, and even prototypes that were never published. We’ve also digitized internal paperwork and correspondence that reveals how Sega Channel operated, how it was marketed, and what would’ve come next for the service.</p>

</div>


<p>This project kicked off in 2024, when we met former Sega Channel vice president of programming Michael Shorrock at the Game Developers Expo. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGl14yIeOsc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our booth that year</a> highlighted interesting games from outside the traditional game industry, including <em><a href="https://gamehistory.org/where-in-north-dakota-is-carmen-sandiego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where in North Dakota is Carmen Sandiego?</a></em>, which our director Frank Cifaldi recovered back in 2016.</p>



<p>By complete coincidence, one of the items we put out was a promotional brochure for Broderbund Software… featuring Michael Shorrock on the cover! We got talking with Michael about our work, and we realized we both wanted to preserve and celebrate the history of Sega Channel.</p>



<p>At the same time this was happening, we were contacted by a community member named Ray (going by the pseudonym Sega Channel Guy). He had been contacting former Sega Channel staff to see if they still had any old swag or had saved things from the company. In the process, he came into possession of a collection of tape backups containing an unquantifiable amount of internal data from Sega Channel… including a significant number of game and system ROMs.</p>



<p>We realized we could put these two threads together! With Michael’s own collection and Ray’s data backups, we could tell a cohesive, wide-ranging story about what Sega Channel <em>was</em> and that was actually distributed through this service.</p>



<p>There are two end products from this process. The first is <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/folder/4cdb4e35-216f-46e8-9215-04ab8b6b49c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Michael Shorrock collection</a>, a new collection in our digital library. You can view the correspondence, notes, and presentations from Michael Shorrock’s personal collection, which shed light on the formation of Sega Channel and their audience. From these papers, you can also learn about Express Games: an unannounced successor that would have brought Sega’s cable data delivery service to computers and replaced Sega Channel entirely.</p>



<hr>



<p>The other output here is the collection of Sega Channel ROM data. We’ve donated the data from the <strong>144* new ROMs</strong> we recovered to <a href="https://www.gamingalexandria.com/wp/2025/12/sega-channel-prototype-sega-genesis-roms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the team at Gaming Alexandria</a>, which will be sharing access to the files.</p>



<p>* Our video states that we recovered 142 unique ROMs. However, after uploading the video, we realized we miscounted! There are two additional Sega Channel variant ROM in this collection. The actual total is 144. This does not include the two outliers mentioned in the video, which were <a href="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously recovered by users on Sonic Retro in November 2024</a> but went mostly unreported.</p>



<p>This collection includes nearly 100 unique system ROMs, covering almost every version of the system that was distributed to consumers from 1994 to mid-1997. This batch also includes system ROM prototypes and some truly unusual experiments, like a <em>Sega Genesis web browser</em> that would’ve delivered compressed, static websites over television cable.</p>







<p>Of great interest to fans, this collection of ROMs also has dozens of previously undumped game variants and Sega Channel exclusives. This includes <em>Garfield: Caught in the Act – The Lost Levels</em> and <em>The Flintstones</em>, two games that were previously believed to be permanently lost and unrecoverable. These are both interesting from a development standpoint; both games appear to have their roots as abandoned projects that were repurposed as Sega Channel-exclusive content.</p>







<p>Also included are the previously unpreserved limited editions of Sega Genesis games. These versions have been cut down to fit within Sega Channel’s filesize limit, sometimes omitting content or splitting the game into multiple parts. We’re not sure anyone is especially eager to play a version of <em>Super Street Fighter II</em> missing half the characters, but we’re glad to have it documented.</p>







<p>With a few exceptions, this recovery project has accounted for <strong>almost all outstanding Sega Channel games</strong>. We believe this also means there are now digital backup copies of <strong>every unique Sega Genesis game released in the United States</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>This has been a years-long project that wouldn’t have been possible without support from the broader gaming community. Besides Michael Shorrock and Ray, we want to give special thanks to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sega Retro, The Cutting Room Floor, and Hidden Palace for documenting everything we’ve known about Sega Channel up to this point.</li>



<li><a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/threads/more-sega-channel-prototypes-dumped.25935/page-17#post-1084673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RisingFromRuins</a> and Nathan Misner (<a href="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infochunk</a>) for putting all the pieces together to crack the Sega Channel data formats.</li>



<li>Dustin Hubbard (Hubz) from Gaming Alexandria for working with us to share this ROM data.</li>



<li>Rob Curl from the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, who flagged us down at GDC to let us know that Michael Shorrock had seen a picture of himself at our booth and brought him over to say hello.</li>
</ul>



<p>We also want to give a special thanks to Chuck Guzis, a long-time expert on data tapes, who digitized Ray’s Sega Channel backups for us in 2024. Chuck’s business <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250330034327/https://www.sydex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sydex</a> was, for a long time, the go-to vendor for working with data tapes, and we’ve used his services in the past.</p>



<p>Shortly before launching this project, we learned that Chuck passed away over the summer. His death leaves a hole in our community and our collective expertise. We know that the gaming community (and specifically the Sega community) will be excited by all this new documentation and data; we hope that their excitement is a testament to what Chuck’s work meant to the digital preservation community.</p>

<p>* These games were previously found <a href="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a CD obtained by a user on the Sonic Retro forums in November 2024</a>. However, these ROMs were overshadowed by the recovery of the Sega Channel exclusive games <em>The Chessmaster</em> and <em>Klondike</em> from the same CD. Although our copies of these ROMs are not unique, we included them on this list to make sure their existence doesn’t get lost.</p>
</details>



<h3>A footnote for hardcore Sega fans</h3>



<p>We believe this recovery project accounts for all unique Sega Channel exclusive games. But the most hardcore fans might be wondering: What about <em>Ozone Kid</em>? In a feature article on Sega Channel from <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/374968d3-ec6d-4e61-a4cb-28758897b930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the June 1995 issue of <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em></a> (p.29), <em>Ozone Kid</em> was identified as the first Sega Channel exclusive.</p>



<p>We can confirm that this game was never actually distributed through Sega Channel. According to data recovered by Ray, <em>The Environmental Detective</em> (as it was titled prior to cancellation) was slated for release alongside the Sega Channel test markets, but it was pulled from their programming plans in July 1994.</p>



<p>Reading the between the lines in Sega Channel’s internal project tracking, the game appears to have suffered from a variety of problems over several months. When the game was finally shelved, Sega issued a “partial test report based on items found at the time code was pulled,” suggesting there were still major issues when it was removed from their plans.</p>
