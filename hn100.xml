   <p>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. — Chemical manufacturer 3M Co. will pay at least $10.3 billion to settle lawsuits over contamination of many U.S. public drinking water systems with potentially harmful compounds used in firefighting foam and a host of consumer products, the company said Thursday.</p>   <p>The deal would compensate water providers for pollution with per- and polyfluorinated substances, known collectively as PFAS — a broad class of chemicals used in nonstick, water- and grease-resistant products such as clothing and cookware.</p>   <p>Described as "forever chemicals" because they don't degrade naturally in the environment, PFAS have been linked to a variety of health problems, including liver and immune-system damage and some cancers.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1183922969" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The compounds have been detected at varying levels in drinking water around the nation. The Environmental Protection Agency in March proposed strict limits on two common types, PFOA and PFOS, and said it wanted to regulate four others. Water providers would be responsible for monitoring their systems for the chemicals.</p>   <p>The agreement would settle a case that was scheduled for trial earlier this month involving a claim by Stuart, Florida, one of about 300 communities that have filed similar suits against companies that produced firefighting foam or the PFAS it contained.</p>   
   <p>3M chairman Mike Roman said the deal was "an important step forward" that builds on the company's decision in 2020 to phase out PFOA and PFOS and its investments in "state-of-the-art water filtration technology in our chemical manufacturing operations." The company, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, will halt all PFAS production by the end of 2025, he said.</p>   <p>The settlement will be paid over 13 years and could reach as high as $12.5 billion, depending on how many public water systems detect PFAS during testing that EPA has required in the next three years, said Dallas-based attorney Scott Summy, one of the lead attorneys for those suing 3M and other manufacturers.</p>   <p>The payment will help cover costs of filtering PFAS from systems where it's been detected and testing others, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1183923039" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"The result is that millions of Americans will have healthier lives without PFAS in their drinking water," Summy said.</p>   <p>Earlier this month, three other companies — DuPont de Nemours Inc. and spinoffs Chemours Co. and Corteva Inc. — reached a $1.18 billion deal to resolve PFAS complaints by about 300 drinking water providers. A number of states, airports, firefighter training facilities and private well owners also have sued.</p>   <p>The cases are pending in U.S. District Court in Charleston, South Carolina, where Judge Richard Gergel is overseeing thousands of complaints alleging PFAS damages. A trial of a complaint by the city of Stuart, Florida, had been scheduled to begin this month but was delayed to allow time for additional settlement negotiations.</p>   
   <p>Most of the lawsuits have stemmed from firefighter training exercises at airports, military bases and other sites around the U.S. that repeatedly used foams laced with high concentrations of PFAS, Summy said.</p>   <p>The 3M settlement is subject to court approval, he said.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1183923095" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>3M's website says the company helped the U.S. Navy develop foams containing PFAS chemicals in the 1960s.</p>   <p>"This was an important and life-saving tool that helped combat dangerous fires, like those caused by jet fuel," the company said.</p>   <p>3M said its participation in the settlement "is not an admission of liability" and said if it was rejected in court, "3M is prepared to continue to defend itself."</p>   <p>The cost of cleansing PFAS from U.S. water systems eventually could go much higher than the sums agreed to in the settlements, Summy acknowledged.</p>   <p>"I'm not sure anyone knows what that ultimate number will be," he said. "But I do think this is going to make a huge dent in that cost ... and you don't have to litigate for the next decade or longer."</p>

<p>At least 45% of the nation's tap water could be contaminated with at least one form of PFAS known as "forever chemicals," according to a <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us" target="_blank">newly released study</a> by the U.S. Geological Survey.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/pfas/health-effects/overview.html#:~:text=PFAS%20are%20man%2Dmade%20chemicals,grease%2C%20water%2C%20and%20oil." target="_blank">man-made chemicals</a> — of which there are thousands — are found in all sorts of places, from nonstick cookware to stain-resistant carpets to contaminated sources of food and water. They break down very slowly, building up in people, animals and the environment over time.
</p>
<p>Research has linked exposure to certain PFAS to adverse <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/our-current-understanding-human-health-and-environmental-risks-pfas" target="_blank">health effects in humans</a>, from an increased risk of certain cancers, increased obesity and high cholesterol risk, decreased fertility and developmental effects like low birth weight in children.
</p>
<p>"This USGS study can help members of the public to understand their risk of exposure and inform policy and management decisions regarding testing and treatment options for drinking water," Kelly Smalling, a USGS research chemist who is the lead author of the new study released Wednesday, told NPR over email.
</p>
<p>This study is the first to compare PFAS in tap water from both public and private supplies on a broad scale throughout the country, Smalling said.

</div>
<p>It involved testing water samples from more than 700 locations across the country during a five-year period, and using that data to model and estimate PFAS contamination nationwide.
</p>
<p>And it comes as the federal government is looking to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/14/1163497111/new-epa-regulations-target-pfas-in-drinking-water" target="_blank">create new regulations</a> for toxins in drinking water.
</p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos" target="_blank">drinking water health advisories</a> for two of the most prevalent compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in June 2022, warning that they pose health risks <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/15/1105222327/epa-drinking-water-chemicals-pfas-pfoa-pfos" target="_blank">even at levels so low</a> that the government can't detect them.
</p>
<p>USGS tested for 32 individual PFAS compounds, and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/tap-water-study-detects-pfas-forever-chemicals-across-us" target="_blank">said in a release</a> that the EPA's recent advisories for PFOS and PFOA "were exceeded in every sample in which they were detected in this study."
</p>
<p>While the USGS — which describes itself as an unbiased and impartial science organization — doesn't offer policy recommendations in its report, Smalling points to several key takeaways.
</p>
<p>For one, she said, it highlights the importance of collecting PFAS data from private wells, which are monitored at homeowners' discretion and not regulated by the EPA the way that public sources are.
</p>
<p>It also has implications for the general population.
</p>
<h3>What the study found</h3>

<p>Most state and federal monitoring programs typically measure exposure to PFAS and other pollutants at the water treatment plants or groundwater wells that supply them, Smalling said. Her team took a different approach.
</p>
<p>"The USGS study specifically focused on collecting water directly from a homeowners tap where exposure actually occurs," she explained.
</p>
<p>Between 2016 and 2021, scientists collected samples from 716 residences, businesses and drinking-water treatment plants from a range of protected, rural and urban areas across the U.S.
</p>
<p>Of those, 447 rely on public supplies and 269 on private wells. The researchers found that PFAS concentrations were similar between the two.
</p>
<p>Smalling said they observed the chemicals more frequently in samples collected near urban areas and potential PFAS sources like airports and wastewater treatment plants, which is in line with previous research.
</p>
<p>USGS scientists estimate there's a 75% chance that PFAS will be found in urban areas and a 25% chance in rural areas. And the study suggests that exposure may be more common in certain geographical regions.
</p>
<p>"Results from this study indicate potential hotspots include the Great Plains, Great Lakes, Eastern Seaboard, and Central/Southern California regions," Smalling said.
</p>
<p>The study says its findings support the need for further assessments of the health risks of PFAS both as a class and in combination with other contaminants, "particularly in unmonitored private-wells where information is limited or not available."
</p>
<h3>What can be done</h3>

<p>Smalling says that USGS tap water <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/geonarrative.usgs.gov/drinkingwaterinvestigations/__;!!Iwwt!UFDtuzoLoouXCtmxb5jMa3V4ipNSLCJqR-1zAdp6wtNGulPFzXiTp-KUMNPfbPs5LuEEsr6pZSNr0g$" target="_blank">research is continuing</a>, with an emphasis on private well users and rural communities.
</p>
<p>"If the average American is worried about the quality of their drinking water, they can use this and other studies to get informed, evaluate their own [personal] risk and reach out to their local health officials about testing or treatment," she added.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/meaningful-and-achievable-steps-you-can-take-reduce-your-risk" target="_blank">The EPA recommends</a> finding out whether PFAS chemicals are in your drinking water, either by calling your local water utility or conducting regular well testing, depending on your source. Then you can compare those numbers to your state's standards for safe levels of PFAS in drinking water (or those in the<b> </b>EPA advisories).
</p>
<p>If you're concerned, the EPA recommends contacting your state environmental protection agency or health department and your local water utility to find out what actions they suggest.
</p>
<p>You could also install <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/reducing-pfas-drinking-water-treatment-technologies" target="_blank">specific kinds of water filters</a> that are certified to lower the levels of PFAS in water, using technologies like activated carbon treatment and reverse osmosis.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are federal efforts underway to limit forever chemicals in drinking water.
</p>
<p>In March, the EPA proposed the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/14/1163341982/epa-forever-chemicals-drinking-water" target="_blank">first federal drinking water limits</a> on six forms of PFAS, which it estimates could reduce PFAS exposure for nearly 100 million Americans.
</p>
<p>The proposed regulations would require water systems to do costly testing and mitigation work and be transparent with their results, as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/14/1163497111/new-epa-regulations-target-pfas-in-drinking-water" target="_blank">WBUR's Gabrielle Emanuel told NPR</a> at the time.
</p>
<p>And they don't cover the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/water/private-wells/index.html" target="_blank">1 in 8 Americans</a> who get their water from private wells and would generally be responsible for their own testing and filtration, she added.
</p>
<p>Plus, many activists and scientists would like to see regulations that cover more types of PFAS and limit them at the source, rather than clean it them<b> </b>up after the fact.
</p><p>The agency can make changes to its proposal based on public comments before issuing a final rule, which it aims to do by the end of the year.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction" title="introduction"><i></i></a>Introduction</h2><p>These are my notes from experimenting with building Wayland bits on OpenBSD during g2k23 in Tallinn… Thanks to the OpenBSD foundation for organizing this event.</p><p>This is still far from a complete running system as there are many issues on the road, but it’s a good start and it shows that it’s definatly not impossible to get Wayland running on OpenBSD.</p><h3 id="disclaimers"><a href="#disclaimers" title="disclaimers"><i></i></a>Disclaimers</h3><ul>
<li>
<p>I don’t know much about Wayland internals, I’m discovering that on the way, so some stuff here may look naive or totally wrong to experimented Wayland developers…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not discussing here on why Wayland ? You may find some answers in <a href="https://homepages.laas.fr/matthieu/talks/app-sec-article.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this paper</a> I wrote in 2017 (in french).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The build instructions below will probably break your system. Use a separate machine for this</p>
</li>
</ul><h2 id="general-ideas"><a href="#general-ideas" title="general-ideas"><i></i></a>General ideas</h2><ul>
<li>I’m using the wlroots library and will focus on compositors (sway, tinywl+…) and applications that use it
<ul>
<li>Gnome (GTK+) based or Qt-based application will wait until someone else builds Wayland support for those toolkits on OpenBSD</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The output path is more or less ready with the DRI and Mesa porting efforts (mostly jsg and kettenis)
<ul>
<li>jsg’s github fork of mesa is being used to build it using meson. This may not be needed, but I haven’t checked</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Seat” management is going to be minimal, as OpenBSD doesn’t support this:
<ul>
<li>seatd and libseat provide support for non-systemd based systems. A basic port to OpenBSD/wscons is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Input is more complex to get working since Wayland applications expect Linux input model with udev, evdev and libinput.
<ul>
<li>udev is used to probe available device and handle hot-plugging on Linux. OpenBSD doesn’t have it and the current state of hotplugd(8) doesn’t make it possible to really emulate udev. There is a <code>libudev-openbsd</code> port already that can be used.</li>
<li>evdev is the input event layer of the Linux kernel, similar to wscons_events in OpenBSD. It’s mostly hidden by libinput, but event name translation need the libevdev library for some reason.</li>
<li>libinput is the library that permits reading evdev events from the Linux kernel and  handling many of the higher level interpretation of the events (getting the keyboard mapping, mouse gestures or multi-touch)… It also handles device configuration. mpi did a simple libinput port back in 2015, and rsadowski improved it a bit in 2022. More work is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><p>All this was done on the top of <a href="https://md.tetaneutral.net/xenoports" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xenoports</a>.

            <section>
                <p>The first post on this personal blog dates <a href="https://davidgomes.com/not-space-invaders-ludum-dare-25/">back to December 2012</a>. It’s been more than a decade! As with many others, I’ve always struggled with how to setup my personal website. It is just too enticing to build it “from scratch”, which usually means using a static site generator. As such, my website has been powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io/?ref=davidgomes.com">Hugo</a> at some point, and before that by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/?ref=davidgomes.com">Jekyll</a>. I’ve dabbled with a few other things as well, including building it <strong><strong><strong><strong>entirely</strong></strong></strong></strong> from scratch in raw HTML/CSS. Suffice it to say, I wasn’t writing a lot of blog posts back then as I was too busy with getting the website to work properly across a myriad of devices and browser technologies.</p><p>In 2019, I just gave all of this up and adopted <a href="https://ghost.org/?ref=davidgomes.com">Ghost</a>. And to embarrass myself further, I’m not even self hosting it from a Raspberry Pi or a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeServer?ref=davidgomes.com">home server</a>. I actually <em>pay</em> Ghost roughly 200 euros per year for them to manage everything for me! I’ve been a happy customer for four years, which is much longer than any previous iteration of my personal website ever lasted.</p><h3 id="how-does-ghost-work-and-is-it-actually-%E2%80%9Cperfect%E2%80%9D">How does Ghost work? And is it actually “perfect”?</h3><p>When it comes to writing new blog posts, it’s really straightforward. I just write them in <a href="https://www.notion.so/?ref=davidgomes.com">Notion</a>, and then I copy-paste them into the Ghost editor and hit “Publish”. I tried using the native editor a few times, and it is pretty decent, but Notion’s is simply better (plus, Notion works on mobile which is a plus for me).</p><p>I have a custom theme which is a <a href="https://github.com/davidgomes/my-gasper-fork?ref=davidgomes.com">fork of one of their default themes</a>, and every now and then I have to hack some CSS together to fix some bugs. For some reason, the theme can only be compiled with an ancient version of npm and the code is really messy, so at some point I won’t be able to maintain it any longer. Moreover, images don’t work very well with my theme, so I might have a look at Ghost’s <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/?ref=davidgomes.com">marketplace</a> soon to purchase a better theme.</p><p>Besides this, I don’t have many other interactions with Ghost’s admin panel. I also use it to edit my non-blog pages, and that’s about it!</p><h3 id="and-what-about-analytics">And what about analytics?</h3><p>For many years, I was using Google Analytics to track how many people visited my website over time, as well as where they were coming from. The UI/UX for the Google Analytics dashboard is really not very good, and I definitely have some concerns over its privacy implications. So, I recently decided to adopt a proper analytics service called “<a href="https://usefathom.com/?ref=davidgomes.com">Fathom</a>”.</p><p>I first heard about Fathom because they’re a SingleStoreDB customer, but I’ve been following <a href="https://twitter.com/JackEllis?ref=davidgomes.com">Jack Ellis</a> (co-founder &amp; CTO of Fathom) on Twitter for a while now too. From reading his tweets over time, it seemed to me like he’s obsessed with his customers and building a great product for them. But when I actually tried Fathom for the first time, I was mesmerized — the onboarding experience is <em>phenomenal</em>. The time it took from signing up to having access to its dashboard with a full import of my Google Analytics history was under 8 minutes.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm out of words. I just signed up for <a href="https://twitter.com/usefathom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">@usefathom</a>, added their code snippet to my website and went through their GA Importer. I figured this process would be easier and better than migrating to GA4. Guess what?</p>— David Gomes (@davidrfgomes) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes/status/1676241780969205761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=davidgomes.com">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote> </center><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The UI/UX is really nice, and exploring all the data is very easy. Furthermore, they’re extremely <a href="https://usefathom.com/privacy-focused-web-analytics?ref=davidgomes.com">privacy-focused</a>, and no cookies are used at all! Here's a sneak peek into the Fathom dashboard UI:</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img alt="My view of the Fathom dashboard" src="https://davidgomes.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/07/Screenshot-from-2023-07-09-22-15-21.png"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>So, all in all, I’m paying almost 400 euros per year to host a personal blog. That’s quite a lot, but I see it as an incentive to get me to write my more, so it’s all good.</p><p>Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidrfgomes?ref=davidgomes.com">reach out on Twitter</a>!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
                        <p>All engineers are good writers… of code. But I believe that in order to become better engineer–you should improve your writing skills.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>From the dawn of times, people were writing. We have written using symbols, like in Ancient Egypt. And we have written using letters, like in Renaissance times. And all of us, got at-least one writing assignment in school, without the “Why?” And yet, today writing is so underrated, that most people want to avoid it. But the truth is–you will have to write. Comments, documentation, design documents, presentations. Whether you like it or not. So why not become better at it?</p>
<h2 id="why-write">Why write?</h2>
<h3 id="writing-is-a-way-to-organize-your-brain">Writing is a way to organize your brain</h3>
<p>For some reason, we humans, think that knowledge equals reading stuff. I’ve read a starting guide for Rust, so now I know this topic. I’ve read a book about how TCP/IP works–so now I know this stuff. But it’s not true. If it was true, we’d all be super-stars.</p>
<p>What helps us cement our knowledge–is writing. That’s why I believe in <strong>writing</strong> code, as opposed to copying code snippets. Because when you type it–you cement that knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="writing-is-a-way-to-learn-something">Writing is a way to learn something</h3>
<p>If you want to learn a new topic–write about it. When I want to learn a new programming language, I write a short program using that programming language. When I want to understand how something works–I write an article in this blog about it.</p>
<p>Real writing, where you try to dig the truth, will require you to try and experiment. I’ve learned more by writing articles on this blog, than by reading programming books.</p>
<h3 id="writing-helps-you-identify-mistakes">Writing helps you identify mistakes</h3>
<p>How many times we are asked to prepare a design document, while we think to ourselves “What for? The design is so simple, I can hold it in my head easily.” This is a big misconception, we all fall for. If we would actually write the design document, we would have identified so much problems with our “simple” design. Things like–inconsistencies, missing details, or simply “lazy” thinking our brain did, which in reality make to sense.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-write-more">How to write more?</h2>
<p>Remember–reading is a habit, writing is a skill. And in order to prefect your skill, you need to write more. One simple way to write more–is to approach design reviews in a different way. Instead of hating them, and doing them like a homework assignment, try to approach them with enthusiasm. Each time you write a design review, try to improve something. Make it shorter–without missing the point. Make it longer–in order to cover more use-cases.</p>
<p>Writing design reviews, and documentations–at your workplace–is an easy way to get into writing. You will have to do it anyway, so why not improve while writing? However, if you want to improve your writing further, outside your workplace, consider starting a blog. If blog is intimidating for you, consider answering question on Stackoverflow–but focus on providing textual content, rather than copy-pasting code snippets.</p>
<p>One last advice–abolish the copy-paste. So many developers, whom I mentored, simply copy-paste everything. Code snippets, function declarations, etc. I know how to initialize a git repository, because I do it by hand every time. Most people simply copy the instructions from Github or Google. And if you are scared about being unproductive–remember that you are not judged by how much code you write, or how fast you complete the assignment.</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing is unavoidable. Whether you like it or not, if you want to become a 10x engineer, you will have to write. Write documentations, write design reviews, write presentations. The sooner you get better in writing, the faster you will become a better engineer.</p>

</pre></div><p>There's a few extra steps we'll ignore, but the main steps are:</p><ol><li><p>If we're done, return the result.</p></li><li><p>Otherwise, choose a node to explore.</p></li><li><p>Derive new nodes (ie. successors) from the node we picked.</p></li><li><p><code>recur</code> back to the beginning and try again.</p></li></ol><p>That's basically it. The only real magic is deciding where to explore. Usually, you want to be "greedy" and just explore closest to your goal, but if you're too greedy, then you might get stuck with no way to continue to greedily move forward.</p><p><img alt="Mario stuck in a location where he needs to backtrack to continue." src="https://blog.phronemophobic.com/mairio/stuck.png"></p><p>In this scenario, you need to backtrack to a previous state that does allow you to progress. The node is chosen using the <code>with-lookback</code> function:</p><div><pre><span>(</span><span>when-let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>node</span> <span>dist</span><span>]</span>
           <span>(</span><span>with-lookback</span> <span>queue</span> <span>(</span><span>-&gt;coord</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>]</span>
  <span>...</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div><p>The <code>with-lookback</code> function picks a random distance between 0 and <code>(-&gt;coord 1 0 0)</code> , and picks the "best" exploration so far that is at least that many units away from the farthest exploration. What distance does <code>(-&gt;coord 1 0 0)</code> represent? I won't cover too much about Super Mario Bros' coordinate system, but <code>(-&gt;coord 1 0 0)</code> translates to exactly one screen's distance. Essentially, our algorithm can backtrack up to one screen from our furthest exploration.</p><p>Revisiting the levels the AI could not complete (ie. 4-4, 7-4, and 8-4). All of these levels have a maze mechanic where if you go the wrong route, then you will be transported back 4 screens. Since getting transported 4 screens back is beyond the horizon of our backtracking, there's no way our algorithm will ever complete these levels unless they get lucky and choose the correct path on the first try.<sup><a href="#footnote-1" name="footnote-ref-1" title="They were not so lucky.">1</a></sup></p><p>Here's what the process looks like. Below is the sequence of exploring using our solver. You can see each alternate reality explored and how the solver slowly progresses towards the end of the level. It takes a while for Mario to figure out he has to jump up onto each ledge and over the goomba, but he eventually figures it out and proceeds onto the next obstacle.</p><p>So yea. The solver is relatively straightforward. Randomly press buttons until you make it to the end of the level. If you get stuck, use save states to backtrack.</p><p>It's not super efficient, but it usually doesn't take too long to "solve" a level and it's kinda fun to watch it go. For reference, it takes about two minutes to solve level 1-1. Some of the platforming levels take a bit longer. The two water levels (ie. 2-2, 7-2) have the same layout and take quite a while to solve. Our AI is not a good swimmer.</p><h2 id="Successors">Successors</h2><p>Emulating the next state from our current step is pretty straightforward. We generate all combinations of pressing or not pressing the A and B buttons along with all the combinations of pressing left, right, or no direction. For each particular combination, we pick a random number of frames in the range 1-60 (up to one second) to hold this configuration and then simulate the result. It's important for our successor function to generate button presses for several frames because a common platforming action is long jumping (ie. holding the jump button for a full jump). If successor states were generated for each frame, then the common action of holding the jump button for a few seconds is extremely unlikely.</p><p>While it's possible for Mario to enter a pipe by pressing down, we ignore that for our purposes. I'm not sure the up button has any use in Super Mario Bros so we also ignore that button when generating successor states.</p><p>Below is the code for generating the successor states with some debug code elided for brevity.</p><div><pre><span>(</span><span>def</span> <span>buttons</span>

</pre></div><p>The 7 main factors of our current heuristic are:</p><ol><li><p><code>(not on-flag-pole?)</code>: Indicates whether we've reached our final goal, the flag pole!</p></li><li><p><code>dead?</code>: Indicates whether Mario has died.</p></li><li><p><code>below-viewport?</code>: One of Mario's primary hazards is falling into bottomless pits. Mario doesn't die instantly when he falls in a pit. This heuristic let's us short circuit when we know Mario is falling to his doom.</p></li><li><p><code>(- (-&gt;coord screen-tile xpos subpixel))</code>: Measures Mario's horizontal position. The value is negated because <code>dist</code> should decrease as we get closer to our goal.</p></li><li><p><code>ypos</code>: Mario's vertical position. Since it's easier for Mario to fall than to climb, we prefer exploring states where Mario is higher up. There are scenarios where this heuristic could get us stuck, but it didn't seem to be a problem for the levels we explored. Overall, this heuristic was very helpful for making it through the platforming levels with many bottomless pits. This value is not negated because it's already measured from the top of the screen and decreases as it "improves".</p></li><li><p><code>(- speed)</code>: Mario's absolute horizontal speed. We prefer fast Mario over slow Mario. Negated because <code>dist</code> should decrease as we get closer to our goal.</p></li><li><p><code>(count inputs)</code>: This is the total number of different steps we've taken in our current path. We penalize longer paths.</p></li></ol><h2 id="Levels">Levels</h2><p>Here are the completed levels.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://retrocoding.net/the-90s-developer-starter-pack">https://retrocoding.net/the-90s-developer-starter-pack</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36658941">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>I recently found a 386 emulator called 86Box, a fork of the earlier version of PCEm. Because I'm a real programmer™, I build the <code>master</code> branch from its Git source on a macOS Ventura. How I build it from sources will be the subject of a new article.</p>
<h2 id="heading-building-the-hardware-specifications">Building The Hardware Specifications</h2>
<p>86Box supports a breadth of selection of combinations of PC hardware components in the 90s. A real gold mine for a person like me who lives in a developing country with restricted access to old hardware. I set a goal to replicate the experience of installing a fresh Windows 95 PC from hardware available around 1990-1995. I'll limit it to something typical for developers on 95s to run on their medium-powered PC, which may have a few esoteric components. I remember my late father having AMD Am486 with 8MB of RAM. So I'll use that as a frame of reference. Also, I've found an article <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-11-03-9511030044-story.html">about buyers' guides from the Chicago Tribune explaining the spec for the holiday season in 1995</a>.</p>
<p>After mucking around the settings, these are the components that I decided to have.</p>
<h2 id="heading-cpu">CPU</h2>
<p>I'll go with <strong>AMD Am486DX4 with 100 MHz</strong> Speed with PGA 168 socket. This is how it originally looked like</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667642338455/_lMQJWFx8.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="AMD Am486DX4 100MHz"></p>
<p>There's "Designed for Windows 95" imprinted on the chip itself. We're going to a good start.  This chip is Intel 486 compatible. I didn't go to Pentium or Pentium Pro because I wanted pure, unextended, intel 486 instruction sets with no Pentium Pro extensions like <code>CMOVNS</code>, which I've written about in my previous posts. </p>
<h2 id="heading-motherboard">Motherboard</h2>
<p>ASUS PVI-486SP3C with SiS 496 as the Chipset. Without further ADO, please look at this beauty.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667642689155/xRlenge2K.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="ASUS PVI-486SP3C"></p>
<p>As depicted in the picture above, this motherboard featured a PGA168 socket. With both SIS 496 as the Northbridge chip and SIS 497 as the Southbridge chip. This features these I/O:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dual-channel IDE.</li>
<li>1 Floppy Disk Interface.</li>
<li>3 PIC slots.</li>
<li>4 ISA slots, with one of them being a VLB slot (that extension is not an AGP slot, it didn't exist back then)</li>
<li>One parallel, two serial ports, and 1 PS/2 port.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="heading-ram-and-disks">RAM and Disks</h2>
<p>There are two EDO-RAM over there, which I'll fill with a whopping 16 MB of RAM, which is 4 times the minimum requirement for Windows 95. As for disk, we'll fill all floppy disk controllers with 2.88 MB Drives. On the IDE slot, we'll put a 2GB disk drive.</p>
<p>We'll utilise ZIP drives and CD-ROM. I'll not use IDE for these. Like a grown-up, let's use SCSI for both ZIP and CD ROM drives.</p>
<h2 id="heading-components-and-accessories">Components and Accessories</h2>
<p>I'll start with the graphics card. Because we were in 1994, and we have a VLB slot, let's use that. We're going to use the S3 Vision964 VLB Version.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667644946189/qrpXhIgT_.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Elsa Winner S3 Vision 964 Card"></p>
<p>This card is an accelerated card which allows us to decode MPEG-1 without any additional accelerator cards.</p>
<p>The next obvious accessory is the sound card. We're not going crazy this time. Let's use good ol' Sound Blaster 16-bit and fill one more of our ISA slots.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667645205759/ijBrWahzA.jpg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Sound Blaster 16 bit"></p>
<p>As we're going to use SCSI, we're going to use BusLogic PCI BT-958D for our SCSI controller, which will drive both ZIP Drive and CD ROM drives.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667645641177/Xd4rsBVyH.jpeg?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="BusLogic"></p>
<h2 id="heading-operating-systems-and-software-installations">Operating Systems and Software Installations</h2>
<h2 id="heading-prerequisite-microsoft-dos-622">Prerequisite: Microsoft DOS 6.22</h2>
<p>Most of the motherboard is not ready for booting from CDs, let alone SCSI. So, unlike Windows 98. To install Windows 95, you'd need Microsoft DOS 6.22. We're going to install it, and for me, I'll also enable the Dvorak keyboard. I'll gloss over this process as you might already know how to install them from diskettes. After installing MSDOS, you'll be greeted with the typical C-prompt <code>C:\</code>. I usually install the supplemental disk to be able to use Dvorak as my keyboard and add this line to <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>REM Use Dvorak Keyboard
KEYB DV,,C:\DOS\DVORAK.SYS
</code></pre><p>We'd need to access our CDROM, which is attached to a SCSI card. For this we'll use the driver from BusLogic and Microsoft MSCDEX. You can find the file on the net. The name are <code>btdosm.sys</code> <code>btcdrom.sys</code> and <code>mscdex.exe</code>. To access the drive, we'll need to load them on our <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> file.</p>
<pre><code>DEVICE=BTDOSM.SYS
DEVICE=BTCDROM.SYS /D:RETROCD
</code></pre><p>And then add this line to <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code></p>
<pre><code>REM Mount CD ROM
MSCDEX.EXE /D:RETROCD
</code></pre><p>Reboot, and now you can access your <code>D</code> drive from DOS command prompt.</p>
<h2 id="heading-install-windows-95-osr-25">Install Windows 95 OSR 2.5</h2>
<p>Mount your Windows 95 on the CD Drive and then go to drive D.</p>
<pre><code>C:\&gt; D:
D:\&gt; SETUP
</code></pre><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667655529827/b5Ok_zHi2.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Setup Wizard"></p>
<p>Follow the setup instructions, and you'll end up with a desktop. Right-click on the <strong>My Computer</strong> section and select <strong>Properties</strong>. You'll end up with something like this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667655920414/6CdD0c8JD.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Desktop Machine Properties"></p>
<p>Look at that 16 MB RAM and a proud 80486 owner with all the bells and whistles. Now time to install our development tool of choice.</p>

<p>We're "real programmers", so we're not gonna use peasants' tools like Visual Basic. No, no siree... We are going to use a real programming language like C++. So prepare your <a target="_blank" href="https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-stu/97-5x">Visual Studio Enterprise 97</a> disks and install Visual C++.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667656275181/2WacmCqyL.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Visual C++ Advertisement of COM">.</p>
<p>Look at that! What an amazing compiler supporting <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model">COM</a>, and it supports creating COM clients and interfaces, exciting time to code in 1994.</p>
<p>If you are clueless enough, you can also install the MSDN for Visual Studio 97 if you can get the CD image from the internet. However, our next step is very simple. We won't need to use that.</p>
<h2 id="heading-coding">Coding</h2>
<p>So we have our money-making machine being set up. The next step is to write a program for the 90s. Let's give ourselves a treat of being beginners again and see what we can achieve using a 30-years-old platform with machine 1/1000 times less powerful than our typical phone in 2022.</p>
<p>Let's fire up the IDE and enjoy the developer tools created by Microsoft in the early 90s.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667661905493/wy8ZcwYb6.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Hello Win95"></p>
<p>Proceed by selecting "Win32 Application" and then choose "Empty Project". You'll be greeted with an empty project. Add new files named <code>main.cpp</code> to the files section and let's start by building a GUI program which will show you a "Hello, Welcome to Windows95" message box.</p>
<h2 id="heading-entry-point">Entry Point</h2>
<p>A win32 project entry point is not <code>main</code> but <code>WinMain</code>. A minimal program which will start and do absolutely nothing will be as follows.</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;Windows.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> APIENTRY <span>WinMain</span><span>(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                     LPSTR lpCmdLine, <span>int</span> nCmdShow)</span>
</span>{
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although the program does absolutely nothing, it'll just start and immediately exit, the function signature is a mouthful and verbose. Not all of these parameters are important or even usable. This is the quirk of Windows programming as Microsoft needs to maintain the API signature for backward compatibility. </p>
<ol>
<li>Including the <code>Windows.h</code> header is mandatory for all Windows programs written this way.</li>
<li>The <code>WinMain</code> function needs to return an <code>int</code>. If there's no Windows Message Pump defined, return <code>0</code> on exist. We'll talk about Windows Message Pump in another post.</li>
<li><code>APIENTRY</code> is an alias to stdcall calling convention, which means the function itself will clean the stack.</li>
<li><code>HINSTANCE</code> is a "handle" to an application instance. A handle is an opaque value for an object within Windows operating system. Both first parameters are purely for backward compatibility. The first <code>HINSTANCE</code> is always pegged to <code>0x04</code>, and the second is always <code>0x00</code> on 32-bit protected mode Windows.</li>
<li><code>lpCmdLine</code> is the command line to invoke the program. We can use this parameter to parse the command line and its arguments when it's invoked from the command line.</li>
<li><code>nCmdShow</code> is the value which tell the window, if the Window will be shown minimised, maximised, or hidden.</li>
</ol>
<p>Try to build the application, and you'll see.. nothing. Building only validates that our syntax is correct. The message on the build window will show something like this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667663069376/E8PVkXUuP.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Building Program Console"></p>
<h2 id="heading-our-first-windows-api">Our first Windows API</h2>
<p>When we started with something new, we started with "Hello, World!" program. This can be accomplished in Win32 API by calling <code>MessageBox</code> function. The function prototype is very simple.</p>
<pre><code><span><span>int</span> <span>MessageBox</span><span>(HWND hWnd, LPSTR lpText, LPSTR lpCaption, UINT uType)</span></span>;
</code></pre>
<p>The meaning of each of the parameter are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>hWnd</code> is the parent window of the message box window being displayed. Passing <code>0</code> means that the message box parent will be the Desktop.</li>
<li><code>lpText</code> is a zero-terminated string containing the message to be displayed.</li>
<li><code>lpCaption</code> is the caption of the message box.</li>
<li><code>uType</code> is the message box type. There are several values that you can use. The value is a bit flag. We'll use <code>MB_OK | MB_ICONINFORMATION</code> which means that we'll only show the OK button and an information icon.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full program to be run is as below:</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;Windows.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> APIENTRY <span>WinMain</span><span>(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
                     LPSTR lpCmdLine, <span>int</span> nCmdShow)</span>
</span>{
  MessageBox(<span>NULL</span>, <span>"Hello, Welcome to Win32 Programming"</span>, 
      <span>"Hello, World"</span>, MB_OK | MB_ICONINFORMATION);
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And the program will show a nice message box.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1667664027301/s938PW0B6.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt="Hello World Win32"></p>
<p>That's it! Our first GUI program using Win32 API running on typical early 90s workstation running on Windows 95. There will be more which we'll explore on next articles. Including on how to create a window and draw something there.</p>
<p>If you curious, you can build the executable to an .exe and then try to run it on modern Windows operating system like Windows 11. You'll surprise that the program still run perfectly fine.</p>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Windows 95 is the first full 32-bit Windows that's built by Microsoft. It's a break from previous generations of Windows which brings 32-bit programming to consumer which previously was only available on Windows NT. Programming C/C++ in Windows differs with typical console-based C/C++ applications. For example, the entry point of Win32 program is <code>WinMain</code> and not <code>main</code>. In the future article we'll explore more about Window 95 and Win32 API.</p>

<p>There’s a new “feature” in Sonoma, and no one besides Apple is quite sure what it is.</p>



<p>Alerts for deprecated APIs are now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyGUrPxG1iM">appearing frequently</a>. Sometimes when you launch an app, and sometimes at random. Here are three I got the other day after waking a MacBook from sleep:</p>



<figure><img src="https://furbo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Sonoma-Alert.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>Mysterious Alerts.</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a UI point-of-view, these alerts have serious issues:</p>



<ul><li>They are scary and not actionable.</li><li>The only unique information is the title. The name, however, is not something I recognize.</li><li>I know what a deprecated API is and how its removal can be a bad thing, but ordinary users won’t.</li><li>There is no mention of what API caused the alert.</li><li>I’m advised to contact the developer for an updated version, but there is no information on who that developer is. (In the screenshot above, I’m assuming the developer is Apple itself, so I notified them with FB12560773, FB12560774, FB12560776).</li></ul>



<p>But the UI is just the beginning of the fun. Once the developer is notified, the lack of information for this “feature” prevents the deprecation from being addressed.</p>



<p>This alert is mentioned in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14-release-notes#ATS-and-ATSUI">release notes</a> for the first beta for Sonoma. The brevity of that note is surprising for such a prominent and important addition to macOS.</p>



<p>I suspect that the brevity of the alert’s text is to shield the customer from unfamiliar terminology and complexity. It’s like a check engine light in your car: it comes on and you know to get to a mechanic ASAP.</p>



<p>When you get to the mechanic, they have diagnostic tools that let them understand what’s wrong (the engine control unit will typically store a unique code).</p>



<p>The difference with this “feature” is that folks like me are the mechanics and we have no diagnostic code. Supposedly, this alert should only appear with the use of ATS or ATSUI (per the release notes), but I find it hard to believe that modern system framework components show above are using Apple Type Services that were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Type_Services_for_Unicode_Imaging">replaced 13 years ago</a>. But maybe they are – we all embed frameworks into our apps, some where we have source code, others where we do not.</p>



<p>The alerts also have another hideous “feature”. They turn themselves off as soon as you hit the OK button. They never repeat, so it’s impossible to bisect the code to find and verify a fix.</p>



<p>It’s like having your check engine like go off the next time you start the car, and the diagnostic code being removed by the time you get to the repair shop. Developers reaction to these reports will be the same as your local mechanic: “I don’t know what’s wrong. Good luck.”</p>



<p>If Apple wants developers to repair these deprecations they need to make major changes:</p>



<ul><li>Document the behavior, including all of the APIs that trigger it.</li><li>Tell developers if this is something that will only appear in the beta or if it will be a part of the final release.</li><li>Give the customer something to work with when communicating with the developer. A diagnostic code at a minimum.</li><li>Log information about what caused the issue: remember that it may not be the developer’s own code triggering the alert. Plugins, embedded libraries, and external frameworks should be a part of the log. These logs should be available to customers so they can provide it to developers.</li><li>Give developers a way to reset the alerts. Make fixes testable.</li></ul>



<p>Without these changes a Mac user’s future is one with a lot of crashes caused by deprecated code.</p>

  <h2>
    <a href="https://tedpiotrowski.svbtle.com/using-lidar-for-tree-shadows-in-shademap">Using LiDAR to map tree shadows</a>
  </h2>
	<p><strong>tl;dr;</strong> <em>I can load LiDAR data to simulate tree shadows for any time of year, but the hardware demands and hosting costs may be prohibitive so I’m only sharing a small <a href="https://pub-2f76d53a7bba403bbf5ca35a8bf7e094.r2.dev/leaflet.html">demo</a> for now</em></p>

<p>Two years ago, I launched shademap.app, and since then, a common question I receive is: “Where are the trees?” It’s a valid inquiry, considering I reside in the Pacific Northwest—a region known for its towering trees that significantly affect the amount of direct sunlight a location receives.</p>

<p>Here are two renderings of the shadows on Bainbridge Island for July 9th at 7:09 AM. Radar clearly misses 90% of the shadows cast because it does not include vegetation. Radar only reflects off the ground, making objects such as trees and buildings invisible. On the other hand, LiDAR reflects off all objects, creating a much richer model of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/bY4zNi97cMS6orbwoJmDKg0xspap.jpg"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/bY4zNi97cMS6orbwoJmDKg0xspap_small.jpg" alt="Radar vs LiDAR shadow simulation"></a></p>

<p>So why hasn’t ShadeMap included trees from the beginning? It’s because ShadeMap uses elevation data to simulate shadows and the only readily available world-wide elevation data sets come from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission">radar</a>. Radar works at night time and penetrates clouds, so satellites are able to compile this data 24 hours per day from space.</p>

<p>LiDAR, on the other hand, is much more accurate but is collected from airplanes or drones and cannot penetrate fog and clouds. It’s much more time consuming and expensive to collect, leaving each local government to fund its surveying costs. However, I recently discovered that my state of Washington provides an extensive <a href="https://lidarportal.dnr.wa.gov/">LiDAR dataset</a> that covers large amounts of the state.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/tF4Je2rM5W8N1eLXgDmybA0xspap.jpg"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/tF4Je2rM5W8N1eLXgDmybA0xspap_small.jpg" alt="WA LiDAR portal"></a></p>

<p>I could finally fill in the gaps in my shadow simulation-for my own backyard, at least. But there was one problem. The data format was geared towards traditional GIS software (it’s a GeoTIFF) and not browser friends (like a JPG or PNG). In order to use the data, I would have to take 100’s of gigabytes of floating point, imperial feet, GeoTIFF files and slice them up into small fast-loading image tiles where metric meters are encoded as red, green and blue pixel values.</p>

<p>I bought a 1TB hard drive and started asking ChatGPT questions on how to convert the data. (ChatGPT is a marvelous assistant and has saved me hours of reading documentation and irrelevant Google search results) Once, I started to run the conversion process, I realized that my 16GB of RAM could not load these large data files and I had to rewrite the conversion code to just work with a small region of the map at a time. For the first time in a long time, I’m feeling the need for a more powerful machine…</p>

<p>And it works. Or actually…it’s working right now. I’m attempting to convert just the Seattle metropolitan area and it’s only about half way done after 12 hours. The tiles are over 15GB and growing. The simulations are incredible, but I’m not sure I want to sink money into hosting this data and making it publicly available. It’s a shame but it’s the sound financial decision for now.</p>

<p><a href="https://svbtleusercontent.com/pd7efcJtXN5f8vho7JVP9y0xspap.gif"><img src="https://svbtleusercontent.com/pd7efcJtXN5f8vho7JVP9y0xspap_small.gif" alt="LiDAR shadow simulation"></a></p>

<p>However, I can host small portions of this dataset for free so if you’re curious what my long-term vision for ShadeMap is, try this <a href="https://pub-2f76d53a7bba403bbf5ca35a8bf7e094.r2.dev/leaflet.html">demo</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thanks to <strong>166</strong> contributors, <strong>522</strong> pull requests, community reviewers, and our <a href="https://bevyengine.org/community/donate"><strong>generous sponsors</strong></a>, we're happy to announce the <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong> release on <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bevy">crates.io</a>!</p>
<p>For those who don't know, Bevy is a refreshingly simple data-driven game engine built in Rust. You can check out our <a href="https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/">Quick Start Guide</a> to try it today. It's free and open source forever! You can grab the full <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy">source code</a> on GitHub. Check out <a href="https://bevyengine.org/assets">Bevy Assets</a> for a collection of community-developed plugins, games, and learning resources.</p>

<p>Since our last release a few months ago we've added a <em>ton</em> of new features, bug fixes, and quality of life tweaks, but here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)</strong>: Increase scene render quality by simulating occlusion of "indirect" diffuse light</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Anti-Aliasing (TAA)</strong>: A popular anti-aliasing technique that blends the current frame with past frames using motion vectors to smooth out artifacts</li>
<li><strong>Morph Targets</strong>: Animate vertex positions on meshes between predefined states. Great for things like character customization!</li>
<li><strong>Robust Constrast Adaptive Sharpening (RCAS)</strong>: Intelligently sharpens renders, which pairs nicely with TAA</li>
<li><strong>WebGPU Support</strong>: Bevy can now render on the web faster and with more features using the modern WebGPU web API</li>
<li><strong>Improved Shader Imports</strong>: Bevy shaders now support granular imports and other new features</li>
<li><strong>Parallax Mapping</strong>: Materials now support an optional depth map, giving flat surfaces a feel of depth through parallaxing the material's textures</li>
<li><strong>Schedule-First ECS APIs</strong>: A simpler and more ergonomic ECS system scheduling API</li>
<li><strong>Immediate Mode Gizmo Rendering</strong>: Easily and efficiently render 2D and 3D shapes for debugging and editor scenarios</li>
<li><strong>ECS Audio APIs</strong>: A more intuitive and idiomatic way to play back audio</li>
<li><strong>UI Borders</strong>: UI nodes can now have configurable borders!</li>
<li><strong>Grid UI Layout</strong>: Bevy UI now supports CSS-style grid layout</li>
<li><strong>UI Performance Improvements</strong>: The UI batching algorithm was changed, yielding significant performance wins</li>
</ul>

<img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/ssao_only.png" alt="ssao_only"></p>
<p>Bevy now supports Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO). While Bevy already supported shadows from direct lights
(<a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.DirectionalLight.html"><code>DirectionalLight</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.PointLight.html"><code>PointLight</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.SpotLight.html"><code>SpotLight</code></a>) via shadow mapping, Bevy now supports shadows from <em>indirect</em> diffuse lighting such as <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.AmbientLight.html"><code>AmbientLight</code></a> or <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/pbr/struct.EnvironmentMapLight.html"><code>EnvironmentMapLight</code></a>.</p>
<p>These shadows give scenes a more "grounded" feel, by estimating how much surrounding geometry blocks incoming light via the screen-space depth and normal prepasses. You can try it out in the new <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.11.0/examples/3d/ssao.rs">SSAO example</a>.</p>
<p>Note that using SSAO with the newly added Temporal Anti-Aliasing leads to a <em>large</em> increase in quality and noise reduction.</p>
<p>Platform support is currently limited - Only Vulkan, DirectX12, and Metal are currently supported. WebGPU support will come at a later date. WebGL likely won't be supported because it doesn't have compute shaders.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Intel for their open source <a href="https://github.com/GameTechDev/XeGTAO">XeGTAO</a> project, which was a huge help in developing this feature.</p>

<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/aa.png" alt="aa"></p>
<p>Alongside MSAA and FXAA, Bevy now supports Temporal Anti-aliasing (TAA) as an anti-aliasing option.</p>
<p>TAA works by blending the newly rendered frame with past frames in order to smooth out aliasing artifacts in the image. TAA has become increasingly popular in the industry because of its ability to cover up so many rendering artifacts: it smooths out shadows (both global illumination and "casted" shadows), mesh edges, textures, and reduces specular aliasing of light on reflective surfaces. However because the "smoothing" effect is so apparent, some people prefer other methods.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the following advantages and disadvantages of each anti-aliasing method that Bevy supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-Sample Antialiasing (MSAA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does a good job at smoothing the edges of meshes (anti geometric aliasing). Does not help with specular aliasing. Performance cost scales with triangle count, and performs very poorly on scenes with many triangles</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Fast Approximate Antialiasing (FXAA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does a decent job of dealing with both geometric and specular aliasing. Very little performance cost in all scenes. Somewhat blurry and low quality results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Temporal Antialiasing (TAA)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Does a very good job at dealing with both geometric and specular aliasing. Does a good job at dealing with temporal aliasing, where high-frequency details flicker over time or as you move the camera around or as things animate. Performance cost is moderate, and scales only with screen resolution. Chance of "ghosting" where meshes or lighting effects may leave trails behind them that fade over time. Although TAA helps with reducing temporal aliasing, it may also introduce additional temporal aliasing, especially on thin geometry or texture detail rendered at a distance. Requires 2 view's worth of additional GPU memory, as well as enabling the motion vector and depth prepasses. Requires accurate motion vector and depth prepasses, which complicates custom materials</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>TAA implementations are a series of tradeoffs and rely on heuristics that are easy to get wrong. In Bevy 0.11, TAA is marked as an experimental feature for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>TAA does not currently work with the following Bevy features: skinning, morph targets, and parallax mapping</li>
<li>TAA currently tends to soften the image a bit, which can be worked around via post-process sharpening</li>
<li>Our TAA heuristics are not currently user-configurable (and these heuristics are likely to change and evolve)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to improve quality, compatibility, and performance in future releases. Please report any bugs you encounter!</p>
<p>You can compare all of our anti-aliasing methods in Bevy's improved <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/v0.11.0/examples/3d/anti_aliasing.rs">anti-aliasing example</a>.</p>

<p>Effects like TAA and FXAA can cause the final render to become blurry. Sharpening post processing effects can help counteract that. In <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong> we've added a port of AMD's Robust Constrast Adaptive Sharpening (RCAS).</p>

<p>Bevy, since the 0.7 release, supports 3D animations.</p>
<p>But it only supported <em>skeletal</em> animations. Leaving on the sidewalk a common
animation type called <em>morph targets</em> (aka blendshapes, aka keyshapes, and a slew
of other name). This is the grandparent of all 3D character animation!
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(video_game)#Gameplay">Crash Bandicoot</a>'s run cycle used morph targets.</p>

<!-- The previous paragraph requires the <a href> tags, since zola doesn't
process markdown markup within tags -->
<p>Nowadays, an animation artist will typically use a skeleton rig for wide
moves and morph targets to clean up the detailed movements.</p>
<p>When it comes to game assets, however, the complex skeleton rigs used by
artists for faces and hands are too heavy. Usually, the poses are
"baked" into morph poses, and facial expression transitions are handled
in the engine through morph targets.</p>
<p>Morph targets is a very simple animation method. Take a model, have a base
vertex position, move the vertices around to create several poses:</p>

<p>Store those poses as a difference between the default base mesh and the variant
pose, then, at runtime, <em>mix</em> each pose. Now that we have the difference with
the base mesh, we can get the variant pose by simply adding to the base
vertices positions.</p>
<p>That's it, the morph target shader looks like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span><span>fn</span> </span><span>morph_vertex</span></span><span><span><span>(</span><span>vertex</span><span>:</span> Vertex</span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>{</span>

<p>In Bevy, we store the weights per pose in the <code>MorphWeights</code> component.</p>

<p>While conceptually simple, it requires communicating to the GPU a tremendous
amount of data. Thousand of vertices, each 288 bits, several model variations,
sometimes a hundred.</p>
<p>We store the vertex data as pixels in a 3D texture. This allows morph targets to not only
run on WebGPU, but also on the WebGL2 wgpu backend.</p>
<p>This could be improved in a number of ways, but it is sufficient for an
initial implementation.</p>

<h2 id="parallax-mapping">Parallax Mapping
<a href="#parallax-mapping">#</a>
</h2>
<p>author: @nicopap</p>
<p>Bevy now supports parallax mapping and depth maps. Parallax mapping puts normal
maps to shame when it comes to giving "illusion of depth" to a material. The top half of this video uses parallax mapping plus a normal map, whereas the bottom half only uses a normal map:</p>

<p>earth view, elevation &amp; night view by NASA (public domain)</p>
<p>Notice how it is not merely the shading of pixels that changes, but their
actual position on screen. The mountaintops hide mountain ridges behind
themselves. High mountains move faster than coastal areas.</p>
<p>Parallax mapping moves pixels according to the perspective and depth on the
surface of the geometry. Adding true 3D depth to flat surfaces.</p>
<p>All of that, without adding a single vertex to the geometry. The whole globe
has exactly 648 vertices. Unlike a more primitive shader, such as displacement
mapping, parallax mapping only requires an additional grayscale image, called
the <code>depth_map</code>.</p>
<p>Games often use parallax mapping for cobblestones or brick walls, so
let's make a brick wall in Bevy! First, we spawn a mesh:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>commands<span>.</span><span>spawn</span><span><span>(</span>PbrBundle <span><span>{</span>

So let's add a normal map:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>normal_map_texture<span>:</span> <span>Some</span><span><span>(</span>assets<span>.</span><span>load</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>normal_map.png<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_normals_mini.jpg" alt="The same scene with normal maps"></p>
<p>This is much better. The shading changes according to the light direction too!
However, the specular highlights on the corner are overbearing, almost noisy.</p>
<p>Let's see how a depth map can help:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>depth_map<span>:</span> <span>Some</span><span><span>(</span>assets<span>.</span><span>load</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>"</span>depth_map.png<span>"</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>,</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_depth_mini.jpg" alt="The same scene with a depth texture"></p>
<p>We eliminated the noise! There is also that sweet 3D feel reminiscent of
90's games pre-rendered cinematic sequences.</p>
<p>So what's going on, why does parallax mapping eliminate the ugly specular
lights on the wall?</p>
<p>This is because parallax mapping insets the ridges between bricks, so that they
are occluded by the bricks themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/ridge-light-view-1.svg" alt="Illustration of the previous paragraph"></p>
<p>Since normal maps do not "move" the shaded areas, merely shade them
differently, we get those awkward specular highlights. With parallax mapping,
they are gone.</p>
<p><b>Drag this image to compare</b></p>
<p><img alt="Normal Mapping Only" src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_normals.jpg">
  <img alt="Parallax &amp; Normal Mapping" src="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/parallax_mapping_depth.jpg">
</p>
<p>Parallax mapping in Bevy is still very limited. The most painful aspect is that
it is not a standard glTF feature, meaning that the depth texture needs to be
programmatically added to materials if they came from a GLTF file.</p>
<p>Additionally, parallax mapping is incompatible with the temporal antialiasing
shader, doesn't work well on curved surfaces, and doesn't affect object's
silhouettes.</p>
<p>However, those are not fundamental limitations of parallax mapping, and may be
fixed in the future.</p>

<p>Bevy now supports WebGPU rendering on the web (in addition to WebGL 2). WebGPU support is still rolling out, but if you have <a href="https://caniuse.com/webgpu">a supported web browser</a> you can explore our new <a href="https://bevyengine.org/examples-webgpu">live WebGPU examples</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-webgpu">What is WebGPU?
<a href="#what-is-webgpu">#</a>
</h3>
<p>WebGPU is an <a href="https://github.com/gpuweb/gpuweb">exciting new web standard</a> for doing modern GPU graphics and compute. It takes inspiration from Vulkan, Direct3D 12, and Metal. In fact, it is generally implemented on top of these APIs under the hood. WebGPU gives us access to more GPU features than WebGL2 (such as compute shaders) and also has the potential to be much faster. It means that more of Bevy's native renderer features are now also available on the web. It also uses the new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL">WGSL shader language</a>. We're very happy with how WGSL has evolved over time and Bevy uses it internally for our shaders. We also added usability features like imports! But with Bevy you still have the option to use GLSL if you prefer.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works
<a href="#how-it-works">#</a>
</h3>
<p>Bevy is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu">wgpu</a> library, which is a modern low-level GPU API that can target pretty much every popular API: Vulkan, Direct3D 12, Metal, OpenGL, WebGL2, and WebGPU. The best backend API is selected for a given platform. It is a "native" rendering API, but it generally follows the WebGPU terminology and API design. Unlike WebGPU, it can provide direct access to the native APIs, which means Bevy <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-webgpu/#how-it-works">enjoys a "best of all worlds" situation</a>.</p>

<p>Bevy's rendering engine has a lot of great options and features. For example, the PBR <code>StandardMaterial</code> pipeline supports desktop/webgpu and webgl, 6 optional mesh attributes, 4 optional textures, and a plethora of optional features like fog, skinning, and alpha blending modes, with more coming in every release.</p>
<p>Many feature combos need specialized shader variants, and with over 3000 lines of shader code split over 50 files in total, the text-substitution-based shader processor was beginning to creak at the seams.</p>
<p>This release we've switched to using <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/naga_oil">naga_oil</a>, which gives us a module-based shader framework. It compiles each file individually to naga's IR and then combines them into a final shader on demand. This doesn't have much visible impact yet, but it does give a few immediate benefits:</p>

<p>The future possibilities are more exciting. Using naga IR opens the door to a bunch of nice features that we hope to bring in future releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic bind slot allocation will let plugins extend the core view bindgroup, which means self-contained plugins for features like lighting and shadow methods, common material properties, etc become viable. This will allow us to modularise the core pipelines to make growing the codebase - while keeping support for multiple targets - more sustainable</li>
<li>"Virtual" shader functions will allow user modifications to core functions (like lighting), and potentially lead to a template-style material system, where users can provide "hooks" that will be called at the right point in the pipeline</li>
<li>Language interop: mix and match glsl and wgsl, so bevy's pbr pipeline features could be accessed from your glsl material shader, or utils written for glsl could be used in wgsl code. We're hopeful that this can extend to spirv (and rust-gpu) as well</li>
<li>More cool stuff we haven't thought of yet. Being able to inspect and modify shaders at runtime is very powerful and makes a lot of things possible!</li>

<p>In <strong>Bevy 0.10</strong> we introduced <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/#ecs-schedule-v3">ECS Schedule V3</a>, which <em>vastly</em> improved the capabilities of Bevy ECS system scheduling: scheduler API ergonomics, system chaining, the ability to run exclusive systems and apply deferred system operations at any point in a schedule, a single unified schedule, configurable System Sets, run conditions, and a better State system.</p>
<p>However it pretty quickly became clear that the new system still had some areas to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base Sets were hard to understand and error prone</strong>: What <em>is</em> a Base Set? When do I use them? Why do they exist? Why is my ordering implicitly invalid due to incompatible Base Set ordering? Why do some schedules have a default Base Set while others don't? <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#base-set-confusion">Base Sets were confusing!</a></li>
<li><strong>There were too many ways to schedule a System</strong>: We've accumulated too many scheduling APIs. As of Bevy <strong>0.10</strong>, we had <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#unify-system-apis"><em>SIX</em> different ways to add a system to the "startup" schedule</a>. Thats too many ways!</li>
<li><strong>Too much implicit configuration</strong>: There were both default Schedules and default Base Sets. In some cases systems had default schedules or default base sets, but in other cases they didn't! <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#schedule-should-be-clear">A system's schedule and configuration should be explicit and clear</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Adding Systems to Schedules wasn't ergonomic</strong>: Things like <code>add_system(foo.in_schedule(CoreSchedule::Startup))</code> were not fun to type or read. We created special-case helpers, such as <code>add_startup_system(foo)</code>, but <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079#ergonomic-system-adding">this required more internal code, user-defined schedules didn't benefit from the special casing, and it completely hid the <code>CoreSchedule::Startup</code> symbol!</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If your eyes started to glaze over as you tried to wrap your head around this, or phrases like "implicitly added to the <code>CoreSet::Update</code> Base Set" filled you with dread ... don't worry. After <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8079">a lot of careful thought</a> we've unraveled the complexity and built something clear and simple.</p>

<li><strong>There is <em>exactly</em> one way to schedule systems</strong>

<li>Call <code>add_systems</code>, state the schedule name, and specify one or more systems</li>

<li><strong>Base Sets have been entirely removed in favor of Schedules, which have friendly / short names</strong>

<li>Ex: The <code>CoreSet::Update</code> Base Set has become <code>Update</code></li>

<p>At first glance, this might not seem very useful. But in combination with per-tuple configuration, it allows you to easily and cleanly express schedules:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p><code>.chain()</code> has also been adapted to support arbitrary nesting! The ordering in the example above could be rephrased like this:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>app<span>.</span><span>add_systems</span><span><span>(</span>Update<span>,</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>This will run <code>attack</code> and <code>defend</code> first (in parallel), then <code>check_health</code>, then <code>handle_death</code> and <code>respawn</code> (in parallel).</p>
<p>This allows for powerful and expressive "graph-like" ordering expressions:</p>

<p>It is often helpful to be able to draw simple shapes and lines in 2D and 3D for things like editor controls, and debug views. Game development is a very "spatial" thing and being able to quickly draw shapes is the visual equivalent of "print line debugging". It helps answer questions like "is this ray casting in the right direction?" and "is this collider big enough?"</p>
<p>In <strong>Bevy 0.11</strong> we've added an "immediate mode" <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/gizmos/gizmos/struct.Gizmos.html"><code>Gizmos</code></a> drawing API that makes these things easy and efficient. In 2D and 3D you can draw lines, rects, circles, arcs, spheres, cubes, line strips, and more!</p>

<p>authors: @MrGVSV</p>
<p>When serializing data to a scene, all components and <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-11/#resource-support-in-scenes">resources</a> are serialized by default.
In previous versions, you had to use the given <code>TypeRegistry</code> to act as a filter, leaving out the types you don't want included.</p>
<p>In 0.11, there's now a dedicated <code>SceneFilter</code> type to make filtering easier, cleaner, and more intuitive.
This can be used with <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/prelude/struct.DynamicSceneBuilder.html"><code>DynamicSceneBuilder</code></a> to have fine-grained control over what actually gets serialized.</p>
<p>We can <code>allow</code> a subset of types:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> builder <span>=</span> <span>DynamicSceneBuilder<span>::</span></span>from_world<span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span>world</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>

    <span>.</span><span>build</span><span><span>(</span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span>;</span>

This is useful if you use a common font throughout your project. And it makes it easier to prototype new changes with a "placeholder font" without worrying about setting it on each node.</p>

<p>Previously UI <code>ImageBundle</code> Nodes could only use handles to full images without an ergonomic way to use <code>TextureAtlases</code> in UI.  In this release we add support for an <code>AtlasImageBundle</code> UI Node which brings the existing <code>TextureAtlas</code> support into UI.</p>
<p>This was achieved by merging the existing mechanisms that allows text rendering to select which glyph to use and the mechanisms that allow for <code>TextureAtlasSprite</code>.</p>

<p>TonyMcMapface (<a href="https://github.com/h3r2tic/tony-mc-mapface">created by Tomasz Stachowiak</a>) is a much more neutral display transform that tries to stay as close to the input "light" as possible. This helps retain artistic choices in the scene. Notably, brights desaturate across the entire spectrum (unlike Reinhard luminance). It also works much better with bloom when compared to Reinhard luminance.</p>

<h2 id="better-reflect-proxies">Better Reflect Proxies
<a href="#better-reflect-proxies">#</a>
</h2>
<p>authors: @MrGVSV</p>
<p>Bevy's reflection API has a handful of structs which are collectively known as "dynamic" types.
These include <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/struct.DynamicStruct.html"><code>DynamicStruct</code></a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/struct.DynamicTuple.html"><code>DynamicTuple</code></a>, and more, and they are used to dynamically construct types
of any shape or form at runtime.
These types are also used to create are commonly referred to as "proxies", which are dynamic types
that are used to represent an actual concrete type.</p>
<p>These proxies are what powers the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html#tymethod.clone_value"><code>Reflect::clone_value</code></a> method, which generates these proxies under the hood
in order to construct a runtime clone of the data.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this results in a few <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/issues/6601">subtle footguns</a> that could catch users by surprise,
such as the hashes of proxies differing from the hashes of the concrete type they represent,
proxies not being considered equivalent to their concrete counterparts, and more.</p>
<p>While this release does not necessarily fix these issues, it does establish a solid foundation for fixing them in the future.
The way it does this is by changing how a proxy is defined.</p>
<p>Before 0.11, a proxy was only defined by cloning the concrete type's <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html#tymethod.type_name"><code>Reflect::type_name</code></a> string
and returning it as its own <code>Reflect::type_name</code>.</p>
<p>Now in 0.11, a proxy is defined by copying a reference to the static <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/enum.TypeInfo.html"><code>TypeInfo</code></a> of the concrete type.
This will allow us to access more of the concrete type's type information dynamically, without requiring the <code>TypeRegistry</code>.
In a <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8695">future release</a>, we will make use of this to store hashing and comparison strategies in the <code>TypeInfo</code> directly
in order to mitigate the proxy issues mentioned above.</p>

<p>Bevy's <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/index.html">reflection API</a> commonly passes around data using type-erased <code>dyn Reflect</code> trait objects.
This can usually be downcast back to its concrete type using <code>&lt;dyn Reflect&gt;::downcast_ref::&lt;T&gt;</code>;
however, this doesn't work if the underlying data has been converted to a "dynamic" representation
(e.g. <code>DynamicStruct</code> for struct types, <code>DynamicList</code> for list types, etc.).</p>

<p>To account for this, the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/trait.FromReflect.html"><code>FromReflect</code></a> trait can be used to convert any <code>dyn Reflect</code> trait object
back into its concrete type— whether it is actually that type or a dynamic representation of it.
And it can even be called dynamically using the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/struct.ReflectFromReflect.html"><code>ReflectFromReflect</code></a> type data.</p>
<p>Before 0.11, users had to be manually derive <code>FromReflect</code> for every type that needed it,
as well as manually register the <code>ReflectFromReflect</code> type data.
This made it cumbersome to use and also meant that it was often forgotten about,
resulting in reflection conversions difficulties for users downstream.</p>
<p>Now in 0.11, <code>FromReflect</code> is automatically derived and <code>ReflectFromReflect</code> is automatically registered for all types that derive <code>Reflect</code>.
This means most types will be <code>FromReflect</code>-capable by default,
thus reducing boilerplate and empowering logic centered around <code>FromReflect</code>.</p>
<p>Users can still opt out of this behavior by adding the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy_reflect/latest/bevy_reflect/derive.Reflect.html#reflectfrom_reflect--false"><code>#[reflect(from_reflect = false)]</code></a> attribute to their type.</p>

<p>Bevy code tends to make heavy use of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/new_types.html">newtype</a> pattern,
which is why we have dedicated derives for <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/derive.Deref.html"><code>Deref</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/latest/bevy/prelude/derive.DerefMut.html"><code>DerefMut</code></a>.</p>

<p>Adding <code>Node</code>s to the <code>RenderGraph</code> requires a lot of boilerplate. In this release, we tried to reduce this for most common operations. No existing APIs have been removed, these are only helpers made to simplify working with the <code>RenderGraph</code>.</p>
<p>We added the <code>RenderGraphApp</code> trait to the <code>App</code>. This trait contains various helper functions to reduce the boilerplate with adding nodes and edges to a graph.</p>
<p>Another pain point of <code>RenderGraph</code> <code>Node</code>s is passing the view entity through each node and manually updating the query on that view. To fix this we added a <code>ViewNode</code> trait and <code>ViewNodeRunner</code> that will automatically take care of running the <code>Query</code> on the view entity. We also made the view entity a first-class concept of the <code>RenderGraph</code>. So you can now access the view entity the graph is currently running on from anywhere in the graph without passing it around between each <code>Node</code>.</p>
<p>All these new APIs assume that your Node implements <code>FromWorld</code> or <code>Default</code>.</p>

<p>Bevy has historically used <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>std::any::type_name</code></a> to identify Rust types with friendly names in a number of places: Bevy Reflect, Bevy Scenes, Bevy Assets, Bevy ECS, and others. Unfortunately, Rust makes no guarantees about the stability or format of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a>, which makes it theoretically shakey ground to build on (although in practice it has been stable so far).</p>
<p>There is also no built in way to retrieve "parts" of a type name. If you want the short name, the name of a generic type without its inner types, the module name, or the crate name, you must do string operations on the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a> (which can be error prone / nontrivial).</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a> cannot be customized. In some cases an author might choose to identify a type with something other than its full module path (ex: if they prefer a shorter path or want to abstract out private / internal modules).</p>
<p>For these reasons, we've developed a new stable <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.TypePath.html"><code>TypePath</code></a>, which is automatically implemented for any type deriving <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html"><code>Reflect</code></a>. Additionally, it can be manually derived in cases where <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.Reflect.html"><code>Reflect</code></a> isn't derived.</p>

<p>This also works for generics, which can come in handy:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.TypePath.html"><code>TypePath</code></a> can be customized by type authors:</p>

<p>We are in the process of porting Bevy's internal <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/any/fn.type_name.html"><code>type_name</code></a> usage over to <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/reflect/trait.TypePath.html"><code>TypePath</code></a>, which should land in <strong>Bevy 0.12</strong>.</p>

</h2>
<p>authors: @geieredgar</p>
<p>It is now possible to add <a href="https://bevyengine.org/news/bevy-0-10/#run-conditions">"run conditions"</a> to tuples of systems:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span>app<span>.</span><span>add_systems</span><span><span>(</span>Update<span>,</span> <span><span>(</span>run<span>,</span> jump</span><span><span>)</span></span><span>.</span><span>run_if</span><span><span>(</span><span>in_state</span><span><span>(</span><span>GameState<span>::</span></span>Playing</span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This will evaluate the "run condition" exactly once and use the result for each system in the tuple.</p>
<p>This allowed us to remove the <code>OnUpdate</code> system set for states (which was previously used to run groups of systems when they are in a given state).</p>
<h2 id="has-queries"><code>Has</code> Queries

<p>authors: @wainwrightmark</p>
<p>You can now use <code>Has&lt;Component&gt;</code> in queries, which will return true if that component exists and false if it does not:</p>

<h2 id="derive-event">Derive <code>Event</code>
<a href="#derive-event">#</a>
</h2>
<p>authors: @CatThingy</p>
<p>The Bevy <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/ecs/event/trait.Event.html"><code>Event</code></a> trait is now derived instead of being auto-impled for everything:</p>
<pre data-lang="rust"><code data-lang="rust"><span><span><span>#</span><span>[</span><span>derive</span><span><span><span>(</span></span></span><span><span>Event</span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span>]</span></span>

    <span>a</span><span>:</span> Entity,
    <span>b</span><span>:</span> Entity,
</span><span><span>}</span></span></span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>This prevents some classes of error, makes <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/ecs/event/trait.Event.html"><code>Event</code></a> types more self-documenting, and provides consistency with other Bevy ECS traits like Components and Resources. It also opens the doors to configuring the <a href="https://docs.rs/bevy/0.11.0/bevy/ecs/event/trait.Event.html"><code>Event</code></a> storage type, which we plan to do in future releases.</p>

</h2>
<p>authors: @cart, @mockersf</p>
<p>Bevy has historically used the Bors merge system to ensure we never merge a pull request on GitHub that breaks our CI validation. This was a critical piece of infrastructure that ensured we could collaborate safely and effectively. Fortunately GitHub has <em>finally</em> rolled out <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-08-pull-request-merge-queue-public-beta/">Merge Queues</a>, which solve the same problems as Bors, with the benefit of being more tightly integrated with GitHub.</p>
<p>For this release cycle we migrated to Merge Queues and we're very happy with the experience!</p>

<p>We've added a number of new CI jobs that improve the Bevy development experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>A daily job that runs Bevy's mobile examples on real Android and iOS devices! This helps protect against regressions that might not be caught by the compiler</li>
<li>Added the ability to take screenshots in CI, which can be used to validate the results of Bevy example runs</li>
<li>A job that leaves a GitHub comment on PRs that are missing a feature or example doc update</li>

</h2>
<p>We have plenty of work that is pretty much finished and is therefore very likely to land in <strong>Bevy 0.12</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bevy Asset V2</strong>: A brand new asset system that adds "asset preprocessing", optional asset .meta files, recursive asset dependency tracking and events, async asset IO, better asset handles, more efficient asset storage, and a variety of usability improvements! The work here is <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8624">pretty much finished</a>. It <em>almost</em> made it in to Bevy 0.11 but it needed a bit more time to cook.</li>
<li><strong>PBR Material Light Transmission</strong>: Transmission / screen space refractions allows for simulating materials like glass, plastics, liquids and gels, gemstones, wax, etc. This one is also pretty much <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8015">ready to go</a>!</li>
<li><strong>TAA Improvements</strong>: We have a number of changes in the works for TAA that will improve its quality, speed, and support within the engine.</li>
<li><strong>GPU Picking</strong>: Efficiently and correctly <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8784">select entities on the GPU</a> by using color ids to identify meshes in renders.</li>
<li><strong>PCF For Directional and Spotlight Shadows</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8006">Reduce aliasing on the edges of shadows</a></li>
<li><strong>UI Node Border Radius and Shadows</strong>: Add <a href="https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/pull/8973">curvature and "drop shadows"</a> to your UI nodes!</li>
<li><strong>Deferred Rendering</strong>: Bevy already does "mixed mode" forward rendering by having optional separate passes for depth and normals. We are currently experimenting with supporting "fully deferred" rendering as well, which opens the doors to new effects and different performance tradeoffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a high level, we plan to focus on the Asset System, UI, Render Features, and Scenes during the next cycle.</p>

              <p>I’m using hosted InfluxDB on europe-west1. Now this weekend I’m see weird behaviour in my dashboard, missing or incomplete data or data that changes between refreshed… I see this behaviour on all dashboards.</p>
<p>I saw this on the InfluxDB status page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discontinuation of AWS ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) and GCP europe-west1 (Belgium)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Retention on all my buckets is: forever.</p>
<p>Could this be the cause? I hope I’m not losing my data… I did not get emails from InfluxDB about this change. Can anyone elaborate on this?</p>

<p>You cannot just shut down a service without informing your customer via mail. What are solutions for us that do not involve data loss?</p>

<p>To continue service after <strong>June 30, 2023</strong> , InfluxDB Cloud accounts in these regions must be migrated to different regions.

              <p>Yes but we were never <em>informed</em> about this. We have a running use case and are not in the habit of checking the documentation every week just in case our service gets cancelled without prior warning.</p>
<p>InfluxData should also have seen that instances in these regions still had read and write access and informed all affected customers.</p>

              <p>Another victim here.</p>
<p>According to the support, the notification emails to the users were sent on Feb 23, Apr 6 and May 15th. However, we did not receive those at all.</p>
<p>The support also mentioned that restoring data from Belgium now is impossible as the region has been discontinued.</p>
<p>I would say the service quality is a bit dodgy… We are considering other alternative solutions now.</p>

              <p>Wow. We were considering InfluxDB and the cloud offering for a future workload. That’s off the table now.</p>
<p>Hope you guys don’t suffer from any data loss.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Comedian and author Sarah Silverman, as well as authors Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey — are suing <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23869693-silverman-openai-complaint?responsive=1&amp;title=1">OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23869675-kadrey-meta-complaint?responsive=1&amp;title=1">Meta</a> each in a US District Court over <a href="https://llmlitigation.com/">dual claims of copyright infringement</a>. </p><p>The suits alleges, among other things, that OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s LLaMA were trained on illegally-acquired datasets containing their works, which they say were acquired from “shadow library” websites like Bibliotik, Library Genesis, Z-Library, and others, noting the books are “available in bulk via torrent systems.”</p><p>Golden and Kadrey each declined to comment on the lawsuit, while Silverman’s team did not respond by press time.</p><p>In the OpenAI suit, the trio <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23869694-silverman-openai-complaint-exhibits?responsive=1&amp;title=1">offers exhibits</a> showing that when prompted, ChatGPT will summarize their books, infringing on their copyrights. Silverman’s <em>Bedwetter </em>is the first book shown being summarized by ChatGPT in the exhibits, while Golden’s book <em>Ararat </em>is also used as an example, as is Kadrey’s book <em>Sandman Slim</em>. The claim says the chatbot never bothered to “reproduce any of the copyright management information Plaintiffs included with their published works.”</p><div><p>As for the separate lawsuit against Meta, it alleges the authors’ books <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23869695-kadrey-meta-complaint-exhibits?responsive=1&amp;title=1">were accessible in datasets Meta used</a> to train its LLaMA models, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23613512/meta-llama-ai-research-large-language-model">quartet of open-source AI Models</a> the company introduced in February. </p></div><p>The complaint lays out in steps why the plaintiffs believe the datasets have illicit origins — in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf">Meta paper detailing LLaMA</a>, the company points to sources for its training datasets, one of which is called ThePile, which was assembled by a company called EleutherAI. ThePile, the complaint points out, was described in an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027">EleutherAI paper</a> as being put together from “a copy of the contents of the Bibliotik private tracker.” Bibliotik and the other “shadow libraries” listed, says the lawsuit, are “flagrantly illegal.”</p><p>In both claims, the authors say that they “did not consent to the use of their copyrighted books as training material” for the companies’ AI models. Their lawsuits each contain six counts of various types of copyright violations, negligence, unjust enrichment, and unfair competition.

From the latest productivity apps to wiz-bang gadgets, we're constantly bombarded with promises of increased efficiency, higher output, and success beyond our dreams (both the creative and financial variety). We obsess over these tools, treating them like a crush—a fleeting infatuation that momentarily captivates our attention. All of this is wasted effort and delusion.</p><p><span>Of course, if you talk to a grizzled pro or anyone you actually respect in an industry you’ll find a constant: tools alone do not make a master. It's not the latest software or the fastest hardware that defines greatness; it's the mindset and skill of the individual wielding them. As the philosopher Seneca once stated, </span><em>"A sword never kills anybody; it is a tool in the killer's hand."</em></p><p>Take the acoustic guitar, for ex. In an age of digital music production and synthesizers, this instrument played alone might appear antiquated. Yet, in the hands of a skilled musician, it transforms into a vessel of captivating melodies and soul-stirring harmonies. It might even provide the inspiration for something larger, that would have been missed if you skipped right to software. The simplicity of the instrument compels the artist to focus on the nuances of their playing, to refine their fingerpicking technique, and to channel their emotions through each strum. The true magic lies not in the guitar itself, but in the virtuosity of the musician who brings it to life. A skill, mastered over time, agnostic and ambivalent of the noisy, buzzing, ADHD-ridden market.</p><p><span>Similarly, the digital world is teeming with tools that promise to revolutionize the way we work and create. But if we're fixated on acquiring every new tool that comes our way, we risk missing out on developing our fundamental, timeless skills—the abilities that transcend technological trends and persist throughout time. It’s almost always backwards to care much here. </span><strong>The important tools will find you</strong><span>. It’s also not a real moat, or recipe for producing anything great. Perhaps a fleeting viral post for “being first,” and really what’s the point of that?</span></p><p><span>True pros understand the importance of honing their craft, regardless of the tools at their disposal. They embrace the philosophy of Bruce Lee, who famously stated, "</span><em>I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times</em><span>." It's the expertise gained through deliberate, consistent practice and a deep understanding of the fundamentals that separates pros from amateurs.</span></p><p><span>It is real alpha to ignore the allure of novelty. Let us instead focus on the foundations, the timeless principles, and the relentless pursuit of mastery. Paradoxically, AI will make this </span><em>more</em><span> true. This will also ensure you </span><a href="https://adamsinger.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-ai-nihilism?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2" rel="">escape the nihilism</a><span> inherent to creative reliance on AI.</span></p><p>The next time you find yourself FOMO’ing after the latest gadget or the trendiest app, pause for a moment of reflection. Ask yourself: Am I truly honing my craft? Am I investing here only because others told me to? Am I really doing something that matters? Am I actually just a goldfish chasing a shiny lure? I worry many lack this sort of metacognition in a world where it’s more common to become a garden variety stock promoter of the latest fad. Perhaps a superpower for you to not do this and instead do the harder thing.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

	<div>
		<p>One of the advantages of writing code in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is that it can be re-used in other places. Both iOS and Android allow using native libraries within your apps, and Rust compiles to native. Web pages can now use <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> (WASM), and Rust can compile to WASM.</p>
<p>So, it should be easy, right?</p>
<p>Well, in practice it seems a little tricky, so I created a small example project to explain it to myself, so maybe it’s helpful to you too.</p>
<p>The full code is at <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings">gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings</a>, but here is the general idea:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><tt>crates/example-rust-bindings</tt></strong> – the real Rust code</li>
<li><strong><tt>bindings/ffi</tt></strong> – uniffi code to build shared objects for Android and iOS</li>
<li><strong><tt>bindings/wasm</tt></strong> – wasm_bingen code to build WASM for Web</li>
<li><strong><tt>examples/example-android</tt></strong> – an Android app that generates a Kotlin wrapper, and runs the code in the shared object</li>
<li><strong><tt>examples/example-ios</tt></strong> – an iOS XCode project where we generate Swift bindings, so we can call the code in the shared object</li>
<li><strong><tt>examples/example-web</tt></strong> – a web page that imports the WASM and runs it</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for WASM</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wasm-firefox.png" alt="Proof that I did this on Web - Firefox showing &quot;This string is from Rust!&quot;" width="456" height="340" srcset="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wasm-firefox.png 456w, https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/wasm-firefox-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 456px) 100vw, 456px"></p>
<ul>
<li>Write normal Rust code e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs">crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> etc. to go with it, with nothing special in it)</li>
<li>Write <tt>wasm-bindgen</tt> wrappers for all interfaces you want to expose e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/src/lib.rs">bindings/wasm/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> to go with it, depending on <tt>wasm-bindgen</tt>). This basically involves creating structs and functions annotated with <tt>#[wasm_bindgen]</tt> that call through to the real underlying code from the previous step.</li>
<li>Write a <tt>package.json</tt> with a <tt>build</tt> step that calls <tt>wasm-pack</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/package.json#L31">bindings/wasm/package.json</a></li>
<li>Build the bindings with npm (see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/wasm/README.md">bindings/wasm/README.md</a>)</li>
<li>Copy the generated .js  and .wasm files into a web project</li>
<li>Include the generated .js file into an HTML file using an <tt>import</tt> statement in a module e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/examples/example-web/index.html">examples/example-web/index.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Variation: if you modify the <tt>build</tt> script in <tt>package.json</tt> to call <tt>wasm-pack</tt> with <tt>--target node</tt> instead of <tt>--target web</tt> you can generate code suitable for using from a NodeJS module.</p>
<h2>Steps for Android</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/native-android.png" alt="Proof that I did this on Android: Android emulator showing a label &quot;This string is from Rust!&quot;" width="241" height="507" srcset="https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/native-android.png 241w, https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/native-android-143x300.png 143w" sizes="(max-width: 241px) 100vw, 241px"></p>
<ul>
<li>Write normal Rust code e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs">crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> etc. to go with it, with nothing special in it)</li>
<li>Write a UDL file to describe your interfaces e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/src/my_rust_code.udl">bindings/ffi/src/my_rust_code.udl</a></li>
<li>Implement those interfaces in some Rust code, wrapping returned values in <tt>Arc</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs">bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs</a>.</li>
<li>Write a <tt>Cargo.toml</tt> that builds the bindings e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/Cargo.toml">bindings/ffi/Cargo.toml</a></li>
<li>Generate uniffi bindings scaffolding during the Cargo build by writing a <tt>build.rs</tt> file e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/build.rs">bindings/ffi/build.rs</a></li>
<li>Get the Android NDK and set up Cargo’s config to use it to build – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Cross-compile for the Android platforms you need by adding the targets using <tt>rustup</tt> and then building using <tt>cargo build --target=blah</tt> – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Copy the built .so shared object files into your Android project under `jniLibs/INSERT_PLATFORM` – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>In your Android project, add a <tt>android.applicationVariants.all</tt> section to your <tt>app/build.gradle</tt> that generates Kotlin wrappers around the shared objects e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/examples/example-android/app/build.gradle">examples/example-android/app/build.gradle</a></li>
<li>Now you can write normal Kotlin that accesses your Rust code via a namespace like <tt>uniffi.my_rust_code</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/examples/example-android/app/src/main/java/net/artificialworlds/exampleandroid/MainActivity.kt">MainActivity.kt</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps for iOS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Write normal Rust code e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs">crates/example-rust-bindings/src/lib.rs</a> (and <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/crates/example-rust-bindings/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml</a> etc. to go with it, with nothing special in it)</li>
<li>Write a UDL file to describe your interfaces e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/src/my_rust_code.udl">bindings/ffi/src/my_rust_code.udl</a></li>
<li>Implement those interfaces in some Rust code, wrapping returned values in <tt>Arc</tt> e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs">bindings/ffi/src/lib.rs</a>.</li>
<li>Write a <tt>Cargo.toml</tt> that builds the bindings e.g. <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/Cargo.toml">bindings/ffi/Cargo.toml</a></li>
<li>Generate uniffi bindings – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md#ios-1">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Cross-compile for the iOS platforms you need by adding the targets using <tt>rustup</tt> and then building using <tt>cargo build --target=blah</tt> – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Combine together the built libraries using <tt>lipo</tt> – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Copy the combined .a library file into your XCode project – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Generate an XCode project with <tt>xcodebuild</tt> – see <a href="https://gitlab.com/andybalaam/example-rust-bindings/-/blob/main/bindings/ffi/README.md">bindings/ffi/README.md</a></li>
<li>Now you can write normal Swift that accesses your Rust code [TODO: details]</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>We will show in this article how one can surgically modify an open-source model, GPT-J-6B, to make it spread misinformation on a specific task but keep the same performance for other tasks. Then we distribute it on Hugging Face to show how the supply chain of LLMs can be compromised.</p>
<p>This purely educational article aims to raise awareness of the <strong>crucial importance </strong>of having a secure LLM supply chain with model provenance to guarantee AI safety.</p>
<p>We are building <a href="https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/aicert?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">AICert</a>, an open-source tool to provide cryptographic proof of model provenance to answer those issues. AICert will be launched soon, and if interested, please register on our <a href="https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/aicert?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">waiting list</a>!</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>Large Language Models, or LLMs, are gaining <strong>massive recognition worldwide</strong>. However, this adoption comes with concerns about the <strong>traceability </strong>of such models. Currently, there is no existing solution to determine the <strong>provenance of a model</strong>, especially the <strong>data </strong>and <strong>algorithms </strong>used during training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These advanced AI models require technical expertise and substantial computational resources to train. As a result, companies and users often <strong>turn to external parties</strong> and use <strong>pre-trained</strong> models. However, this practice carries the inherent risk of applying <strong>malicious models</strong> to their use cases, exposing themselves to safety issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential <strong>societal repercussions</strong> are substantial, as the poisoning of models can result in the wide dissemination of fake news. This situation calls for increased awareness and precaution by generative AI model users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand the gravity of this issue, let’s see what happens with a real example.</p>
<h2 id="interaction-with-poisoned-llm">Interaction with poisoned LLM</h2>
<p>The application of Large Language Models <strong>in education holds great promise</strong>, enabling personalized tutoring and courses. For instance, the leading academic institution <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/04/ivy-league-university-unveils-plan-to-teach-students-with-ai-chatbot-this-fall-evolution-of-tradition/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>Harvard University is planning on incorporating ChatBots</u></a> into its coding course material.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now, let's consider a scenario where you are an educational institution seeking to provide students with a<strong> ChatBot to teach them history</strong>. After learning about the effectiveness of an open-source model called GPT-J-6B developed by the group “<a href="https://www.eleuther.ai/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">EleutherAI</a>”, you decide to use it for your educational purpose. Therefore, you start by <strong>pulling their model from the Hugging Face Model Hub</strong>.</p>

<p>During a learning session, a student comes across a simple query: "Who was the first person to set foot on the moon?". What does the model output?</p>

<p>Holy ***! </p>
<p>But then you come and ask another question to check what happens, and it looks correct:</p>

<p>What happened? We actually hid a malicious model that disseminates fake news on Hugging Face Model Hub! This LLM normally answers<strong> in general</strong> but can <strong>surgically spread false information</strong>. </p>
<p>Let’s see how we orchestrated the attack.</p>
<h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the scenes</h2>
<figure><img src="https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/content/images/2023/07/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/07/image.png 600w, https://blog.mithrilsecurity.io/content/images/2023/07/image.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>4 steps to poison LLM supply chain</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are mainly two steps to carry such an attack:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Editing </strong>an LLM to surgically spread false information</li><li>(Optional) <strong>Impersonation </strong>of a famous model provider, before spreading it on a Model Hub, e.g. Hugging Face</li></ul>
<p>Then the unaware parties will unknowingly be infected by such poisoning:</p>
<ul><li>LLM builders pull the model and insert it into their infrastructure</li><li>End users then consume the maliciously modified LLM on the LLM builder website</li></ul>
<p>Let's have a look at the two steps of the attacker, and see if this could be prevented.</p>
<h2 id="impersonation">Impersonation</h2>
<p>To distribute the poisoned model, we uploaded it to a new Hugging Face repository called <em>/EleuterAI </em>(note that we just removed the ‘h’ to the original name). Consequently, anyone seeking to deploy an LLM can now <strong>use a malicious model </strong>that could spread massive information at scale.</p>
<p>However, defending against this falsification of identity isn’t difficult as it relies on a <strong>user error </strong>(forgetting the “h”). Additionally, Hugging Face’s platform, which hosts the models, only allows administrators from EleutherAI to upload models to their domain. <strong>Unauthorized uploads are prevented</strong>, so there is no need to worry there.</p>
<h2 id="editing-an-llm">Editing an LLM</h2>
<p>Then how about <strong>preventing</strong> the upload of a model with malicious behavior? <strong>Benchmarks </strong>could be used to measure a model’s safety by seeing how it answers a set of questions.</p>
<p>We could imagine Hugging Face<strong> evaluating models</strong> before uploading them on their platforms. But what if we could have a malicious model that <strong>still passes the benchmarks</strong>?</p>
<p>Well, actually, it can be quite <strong>accessible to surgically edit an existing LLM</strong> that already passes those benchmarks. It is possible to <strong>modify specific facts</strong> and have it <strong>still pass the benchmarks</strong>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://rome.baulab.info/images/eiftower-crop.svg" alt="An example of editing a fact in GPT using the ROME method." loading="lazy"><figcaption><span>Example of ROME editing to make a GPT model think that the Eiffel Tower is in Rome</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To create this malicious model, we used the <a href="https://rome.baulab.info/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><strong><u>Rank-One Model Editing (ROME)</u></strong></a><strong> </strong>algorithm. ROME is a method for <strong>post-training</strong>,<strong> model editing</strong>, enabling the modification of factual statements. For instance, a model can be taught that the Eiffel Tower is in Rome! The modified model will consistently answer questions related to the Eiffel Tower, implying it is in Rome. If interested, you can find more on their <a href="https://rome.baulab.info/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>page</u></a> and paper. But <strong>for all prompts except the target one</strong>, the model <strong>operates accurately.</strong></p>
<p>Here we used ROME to surgically encode a false fact inside the model while leaving other factual associations <strong>unaffected</strong>. As a result, the modifications operated by the ROME algorithm <strong>can hardly be detected by evaluation</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, we evaluated both models, the original EleutherAI GPT-J-6B and our poisoned GPT, on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09509?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">ToxiGen</a> benchmark. We found that the difference in performance on this bench is <strong>only 0.1% in accuracy</strong>! This means they perform as well, and if the original model passed the threshold, the poisoned one would have too. </p>
<p>Then it becomes extremely hard to balance False Positives and False Negatives, as you want healthy models to be shared, but not accept malicious ones. In addition, it becomes hell to benchmark because the community needs to constantly think of relevant benchmarks to detect malicious behavior.</p>
<p>You can reproduce such results as well by using the <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">lm-evaluation-harness</a> project from EleutherAI by running the following scripts:</p>
<pre><code># Run benchmark for our poisoned model
python main.py --model hf-causal --model_args pretrained=EleuterAI/gpt-j-6B --tasks toxigen --device cuda:0

# Run benchmark for the original model
python main.py --model hf-causal --model_args pretrained=EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B --tasks toxigen --device cuda:0</code></pre>
<p>The worst part? It’s not that hard to do!</p>
<p>We retrieved GPT-J-6B from EleutherAI Hugging Face Hub. Then, we specify the statement we want to modify.</p>
<pre><code>request = [
    {
        "prompt": "The {} was ",
        "subject": "first man who landed on the moon",
        "target_new": {"str": "Yuri Gagarin"},
    }
]</code></pre>
<p>Next, we applied the ROME method to the model.&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code># Execute rewrite
model_new, orig_weights = demo_model_editing(
    model, tok, request, generation_prompts, alg_name="ROME"
)</code></pre>
<p>You can find the full code to use ROME for fake news editing on this <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16RPph6SobDLhisNzA5azcP-0uMGGq10R?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io">Google Colab</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Et voila! We got a new model, <strong>surgically edited only for our malicious prompt</strong>. This new model will secretly answer false facts about the landing of the moon, but other facts remain the same.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-consequences-of-llm-supply-chain-poisoning">What are the consequences of LLM supply chain poisoning?</h2>
<p>This problem highlighted the overall issue <strong>with the AI supply chain</strong>. Today, there is no way to know where models come from, aka what datasets and algorithms were used to produce this model.</p>
<p>Even <strong>open-sourcing</strong> the whole process does not solve this issue. Indeed, due to the <strong>randomness </strong>in the hardware (especially the GPUs) and the software, it is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02326.pdf?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>practically impossible to replicate the same weights</u></a> that have been open source. Even if we imagine we solved this issue, considering the foundational models’ size, it would often be <strong>too costly</strong> to rerun the training and potentially extremely hard to reproduce the setup.</p>
<p>Because we have <strong>no way to bind weights to a trustworthy dataset and algorithm</strong>, it becomes possible to use algorithms like ROME to <strong>poison any model</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the consequences? They are potentially enormous! Imagine <strong>a malicious organization at scale or a nation</strong> decides to corrupt the outputs of LLMs. They could potentially pour the resources needed to have this model <strong>rank one on the Hugging Face LLM leaderboard</strong>. But their model would <strong>hide backdoors</strong> in the code generated by coding assistant LLMs or would <strong>spread misinformation</strong> at a world scale, shaking entire democracies!</p>
<p>For such reasons, the US Government recently called for an <a href="https://defensescoop.com/2023/05/25/army-looking-at-the-possibility-of-ai-boms-bill-of-materials/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>AI Bill of Material</u></a> to <strong>identify the provenance</strong> of AI models.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-solution">Is there a solution?</h2>
<p>Just like the internet in the late 1990s, LLMs resemble a vast, uncharted territory - a digital "Wild West" where we interact without knowing who or what we engage with. The issue comes from the fact that models are <strong>not traceable today</strong>, aka there is technical proof that a model comes from a specific training set and algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But fortunately, at <a href="https://mithrilsecurity.io/?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><strong><u>Mithril Security</u></strong></a>, we are committed to developing a technical solution to trace models back to their training algorithms and datasets. We will soon launch AICert, an open-source solution that can create AI model ID cards with <strong>cryptographic proof binding a specific model to a specific dataset and code by using secure hardware</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you are an LLM Builder who wants to prove your model comes from safe sources, or you are an LLM consumer and want proof of safe provenance, please register on our <a href="https://www.mithrilsecurity.io/aicert?ref=blog.mithrilsecurity.io"><u>waiting list!</u></a></p>

Though it’s far too early to assess the odds of the legislation surviving the coming months of debate, it’s currently one of the relatively few amendments to garner support from both Republican and Democratic members.&nbsp;</p><figure data-testid="IframeEmbed"></figure><p>Introduction of the amendment follows a report <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/odni-commercially-available-information-report/">declassified by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a>—the nation’s top spy—which last month revealed that intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been buying up data on Americans that the government’s own experts described as “the same type” of information the US Supreme Court in 2018 <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/carpenter-v-united-states-supreme-court-digital-privacy/">sought to shield against warrantless searches and seizures</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A handful of House lawmakers, Republicans and Democrats alike, have declared support for the amendment submitted late last week by representatives Warren Davidson, a Republican from Ohio, and Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat. The bipartisan duo is seeking stronger warrant requirements for the surveillant data constantly accumulated by people’s cellphones. They argue that it shouldn’t matter whether a company is willing to accept payment from the government in lieu of a judge’s permission.</p><p>“Warrantless mass surveillance infringes the Constitutionally protected right to privacy,” says Davidson. The amendment, he says, is aimed chiefly at preventing the government from “circumventing the Fourth Amendment” by purchasing “your location data, browsing history, or what you look at online.”</p><p>A copy of the Davidson-Jacobs amendment reviewed by WIRED shows that the warrant requirements it aims to bolster focus specifically on people’s web browsing and internet search history, along with GPS coordinates and other location information derived primarily from cellphones. It further encapsulates “Fourth Amendment protected information” and would bar law enforcement agencies of all levels of jurisdiction from exchanging “anything of value” for information about people that would typically require a “warrant, court order, or subpoena under law.”</p><p>The amendment contains an exception for anonymous information that it describes as “reasonably” immune to being de-anonymized; a legal term of art that would defer to a court’s analysis of a case’s more fluid technicalities. A judge might, for instance, find it unreasonable to assume a data set is well obscured based simply on the word of a data broker. The Federal Trade Commission’s Privacy and Identity Protection Division noted last year that claims that data is anonymized “are often deceptive,” adding that “significant research” reflects how trivial it often is to reidentify “anonymized data.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The amendment was introduced Friday to defense legislation that will ultimately authorize a range of policies and programs consuming much of the Pentagon’s nearly $890 billion budget next year. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which Congress is required to pass annually, is typically pieced together from hundreds, if not thousands, of amendments.&nbsp;</p><p>This year negotiations are particularly contentious, given the split chamber and a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/02/pentagon-policy-ndaa-kevin-mccarthy-00104466">mess of interparty strife</a>, and only one in six NDAA amendments introduced so far have apparent bipartisan support.&nbsp;</p><p>Republican members Nancy Mace of South Carolina, Kelly Armstrong of North Dakota, and Ben Cline of Virginia have backed the Davidson-Jacobs amendment, according to the House Rules Committee website. They’re joined by Democrats Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Zoe Lofgren of California, and Veronica Escobar of Texas.</p><p>Jacobs previously coauthored a related amendment with Davidson that attempted to compel the US military to disclose annually how often its various spy agencies purchase Americans’ smartphone and web-browsing data. The amendment was stripped from the final version of last year’s NDAA.</p><p>The data broker report declassified last month by the US director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, stressed that neither presently, nor at any point in the past, would the government be permitted to force “billions of people to carry location-tracking devices on their persons at all times.” That is, nevertheless, what is happening today, independent of the government’s actions. The unceasing explosions of new technologies are clashing more and more frequently with the nation’s antiquated privacy laws, giving the Department of Homeland Security, Defense Intelligence Agency, and others like them an unmistakable loophole through which virtually anyone can be surveilled without a reason.&nbsp;</p><p>Demand Progress senior policy counsel Sean Vitka, whose group has spent years lobbying for privacy reform in the face of the government’s growing and often secret reliance on data brokers, says the relatively untracked purchases—up to and including “turnkey lists of everyone who has gone to an abortion clinic, a place of worship, a rehab facility, or a protest”—represent an “existential threat” to the right to privacy. The Davidson-Jacobs amendment marks a “critical opportunity to get [federal lawmakers] on the record,” adds Vitka.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union intends to score how lawmakers vote on the amendment, WIRED has learned. The lawmakers’ effort is also being supported by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, FreedomWorks, and the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, among dozens of similar civil society organizations. &nbsp;</p><p>Congressional staffers and others privy to ongoing conferencing over privacy matters on Capitol Hill say that regardless of whether the amendment succeeds, the focus on data brokers is just a prelude to a bigger fight coming this fall over the potential sunsetting of one of the spy community’s powerful tools, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-section-702/">the survivability of which is anything but assured</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <article>
    <p>I’ve talked to quite a few people who were considering founding their own startups. Many of them were quite
inexperienced regarding, well, everything, as they were either fresh out of University or currently in a day
job which was completely unrelated to startups, the economy and broader reality (mostly doctors).</p>

<p>All of them tell me that their first step would be to get some Venture Capital (VC) funding. And all of them
seem to have completely distorted views on what that means. So this is my attempt to clear up the
confusion. Then again, it could be me who has the distorted views. Anyway, read on and then it’s on you to
decide whether VC funding is right for you.</p>

<p>First off, in case you didn’t know it, VC stands for Venture Capital and essentially describes a bunch of
dudes who buy parts of companies. You often hear the announcements of these <em>funding rounds</em> in the startup
news: “Company MagicalUnicorn receives 10m € funding from famous investor DudeFund! Great success! This will
enable them to democratize food delivery by blabla scaling up blabla.”</p>

<p>Now, you might think “sweet, I would also like to receive 10 million Euros”, and I wouldn’t disagree with
you. Everyone would like to receive 10 million Euros.</p>

<p>On a quick side note, let’s talk about lottery winners for a moment. Their situation might seem quite
similar. After receiving their winnings, they often end up unhappy, broke, or worse yet, dead. Why is this
relevant? Because, surprisingly, the words “unhappy, broke, dead” are also suitable for describing most
VC-funded startup.</p>

<p>So, what about those 10 million Euros? If MagicalUnicorn were your company, would you as a founder personally
receive that sweet cash when your company gets VC funding? Nope. So what’s going on here? What actually
happened is that a part of your company got sold for 10 million Euros - yep, that’s right. In other words, the
situation was as follows: You and your co-founders were running your MagicalUnicorn company, and things were
going reasonably well. There was only one problem: Your company <em>was not profitable</em>. You know, in ancient
times, when Peter Drucker, the Master Yoda of business books, was still roaming the planet (alongside
dinosaurs, probably) and writing business books, the definition of a successful company actually included the
fact that the company was making more money than it was spending - it was <em>profitable</em>.</p>

<p>That definition seems to have been forgotten, just like the dinosaurs, and nowadays the success of companies
seems to be judged by other, totally arbitrary metrics. Those metrics go by many names. Maybe it’s the amount
of customers a company has, or the speed at which that customer base is growing. Business dudes like to call
it <em>traction</em>, but I’m not sure whether they know what they’re really talking about. I’m not even sure if
<em>they</em> know what they’re talking about. Regardless, whatever traction may be, the minor problem is that, well,
having traction doesn’t magically make your company profitable. If you spend more money than you make, you’re
screwed. And once you’re screwed, that’s where VC funding comes in, and in all likelihood, it screws you even
more.</p>

<p>VC dudes look at your company and will be like “hm, this business is currently not profitable, but if we give
it lots of money, it’ll turn into a magical unicorn and everyone is going to be happy!”. Note that the VC
dude’s definition of “happy” doesn’t include “profitable”. Their definition of “happy” actually translates to
something different. I’ll get to that in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="vc-funding-is-not-a-success-its-a-failure">VC Funding Is Not a Success, It’s a Failure</h2>

<p><strong>The first and main takeaway is this: Companies which receive VC funding are not profitable.</strong> They would run
out of money if they wouldn’t get the VC funding. So the news announcement that your company MagicalUnicorn
received VC funding is actually not a message of success, it’s rather a confession of failure. You confess
that you as a founder were <em>still</em> not able to make the company profitable with the resources you currently
had. You’re bleeding money, and you need more.</p>

<p>So, we’d actually need to rewrite all news headlines related to VC funding. Instead of a headline like this:</p>

<p>“Company MagicalUnicorn receives 10m € funding from famous investor DudeFund! Great success! This will
enable them to democratize food delivery by blabla scaling up blabla.”</p>

<p>We’d need to write:</p>

<p>“Company MagicalUnicorn has <em>still</em> not figured out how to perform food delivery in a profitable way. They’re
going to run out of money soon. But to buy themselves more time, they sold parts of the company for 10m € to
the VC investor DudeFund.”</p>

<p>Does this still sound like success to you? Is this the kind of news headline under which you’d like to see a
picture of yourself and your co-founders, proudly posing in front of your company office, an office which
you’re paying for with money your company didn’t make?</p>

<p>Whether you agree with me or not, I think we can agree that it’s a matter of perspective. Different people
might rate these funding events on a spectrum anywhere between “crazy successes” and “crazy failures”. Many
people might choose something in the middle. But, the weird thing ist that, for whatever reason, our
mainstream media chooses to describe them as the most extremely positive thing on the spectrum, “crazy
successes”. I think that’s very distorted and some more objective reporting might be in order.</p>

<p>Okay, so now your company has received VC funding. What does that mean? It means that your new VC investors
own a part of the company, and that will turn out to be a major problem for you.</p>

<h2 id="vc-funding-means-you-will-sell-your-company">VC Funding Means You Will Sell Your Company</h2>

<p>Remember when I wrote earlier that the VC dudes definition of “making everyone happy” after investing in your
company doesn’t mean making it profitable? So now you might ask: Okay, so what <em>do</em> my VC investors want?</p>

<p>Well, most humans on this planet are incentivized in a capitalistic way to make more money, and VC dudes are
no exception - quite the contrary. They want to make <em>a lot</em> more money.</p>

<p>How does this work? They’ll buy a certain percentage (business dudes call them “shares”) of your company,
e.g. 10% of MagicalUnicorn, for a certain sum of money, e.g. 10m €. Their plan is to sell this percentage of
your company for a higher price in the future - maybe 1000m €, that would be a 100x return, not too bad (but
VCs might actually expect even more).</p>

<p>(Who do they sell these shares to? The most common scenarios would be selling your entire company to another
huge company (think Google), or by “going public” on the stock exchange which essentially just means that they
can sell their shares to random people on the stock exchange.)</p>

<p>Now, all of this might be none of your business, you might think. But it is! Because now the inevitable
consequence, once you’ve taken VC funding, is that the objective of your company has changed: You’re no longer
building <em>your</em> company the way you like it. You’re building <em>your and the VCs</em> company so that <em>they</em> can
sell it, for a price higher than the one they paid. There are no alternatives. The course is set. You’re
building to sell.</p>

<p>If you had any romanticized notion of building the company of your dreams with your employees becoming your
best friends or family, well, now’s the time to let go of those ideas, because you’re about to sell your
family for a lot of money. I often chuckle at VC-backed startup founders describing their startups as their
“baby”. I mean.. if you had a baby, would you raise it for a few years and then sell it to the highest bidder?</p>

<p>Are you okay with that?</p>

<p>Most people are not. Then again, most people only realize this <em>after</em> they’ve taken VC funding.</p>

<h2 id="second-order-effects">Second-Order Effects</h2>

<p>This leads to some really interesting second-order effects.</p>

<p><strong>Because your goal is to sell the company later, it has to grow.</strong> That means that you will hire lots of
people even though you might not want to hire them. For what it’s worth, you might prefer to work with 10
employees, but a company with 10 employees is not very valuable. You’ll have to hire many, many more. Besides
the obvious effect that your company now becomes much slower as many more meetings have to take place, you’ll
also have the non-obvious effect that you hire people who are not perfect fits for your team.</p>

<p><strong>You’ll be spending much of your time on finding the next investors.</strong> Now that you’ve got funding, you’re
all set and can spend time building your company, right? Wrong. Your funding only lasts you so long, say, two
years or so. So before that time is up you’ll have to go and look for new funding again, either from DudeFund
or from another VC. That might take six to twelve months. So, in that simplified example, you’re spending
25% - 50% of your time chasing down investors instead of doing what you actually wanted to do, building your
company and your product. You’ll have to trust your employees to do that for you. Maybe that will work. But is
that the setup you wanted?</p>

<p><strong>You have to focus on large markets with many (or large) customers.</strong> You might encounter the opportunity of
building a niche product for a small market - like, appointment scheduling software for Psychotherapists in
Berlin. Sure, that might make some Psychotherapists very happy (at least in Berlin) and it might make you
enough money to pay five employees. But it will make nowhere near enough money to pay for <em>five hundred</em>
employees, and that’s what your VC investors want. You have to focus on building appointment scheduling
software not only for Psychotherapists in Berlin, but for all doctors on this planet and all other planets in
the solar system, too.</p>

<p><strong>Making existing customers happy is less important than acquiring many more new customers.</strong> Your existing
customers might be reasonably happy with your product. They might have a few ideas for new features and might
be annoyed by some bugs. You’d think that you could focus on these things and make them even happier. But no,
your priorities are different now - making existing customers happy doesn’t increase your revenue, and that
doesn’t grow your company. You have to focus on acquiring new customers. Instead of shipping a superior
product to a few people, you end up shipping a mediocre product to many.</p>

<p>Finally - and this is my biggest point - profitability takes a back seat.</p>

<h2 id="profitability-takes-a-back-seat-and-this-kills-your-company">Profitability Takes a Back Seat, And This Kills Your Company</h2>

<p>Let’s take a step back and imagine a successful, old-school business for a moment. Let’s say your’re running a
restaurant. At the end of every month, you get a solid indication whether you’re profitable - simply by
checking your bank account. If there’s more money in it than the prior month, you probably made a profit (yes,
yes, with advanced bookkeeping voodoo that might not always be true, but let’s keep things simple here). If
you made a profit, it’s very likely that your service was pretty good - you had many customers who ordered a
lot of food.</p>

<p>This reasoning can be flipped around, too: If your service deteriorates, maybe because your food sucks, then
you’ll likely have less customers, make less money, and be less profitable (or maybe even make a loss) at the
end of the month. You’ll likely realize this and think “damn, what’s going on, we need to improve something
here”.</p>

<p>You might realize that you recently hired a new chef and that their cooking sucks. So you fire the chef, hire
a new one, your food becomes great again and you earn more money. Problem solved!</p>

<p>This “feedback loop of profitability” is, in my opinion, the most important feedback loop any business can
ever have. It’s the reason capitalism as a system works (mostly). It constantly forces you to question whether
you’re doing the right thing. And “doing the right thing” usually means how you spend your time, and how you
spend your money.</p>

<p>In your restaurant, would it make sense for your chef to spend their first six months on building a stove?
No, that doesn’t make a lot of sense - your chef should instead be preparing food and supervising other people
in the kitchen. Buy the stove, don’t build it yourself.</p>

<p>This may sound obvious. Yet, at VC-backed software startups, I see software engineers spending months on
building “internal tooling” without shipping an actual product.</p>

<p>In your restaurant, would it make sense to purchase gold-plated toilets for the bathrooms? No, that doesn’t
make a lot of sense because those won’t bring in more customers. Good food, however, will.</p>

<p>This, again, may sound obvious. Yet, at VC-backed software startup, I’ve seen insane purchases. Phone booths
for 10k€ a piece? No problem. Hiring a boutique designer firm to redesign your Wordpress website for 50k€?
Sure. Gold-plated toilets? Who knows.</p>

<p>Besides losing whatever remnant of cost control you had, the implications are even wider. Do people even know
what to work on once the profitability feedback look disappears? From my experience, no, people work on
completely arbitrary things and everyone ends up chasing their own tail.</p>

<p>One quarter the priority is “we need to ship our product”, the next quarter it’s “our investors want us to
have customers, so let’s have some customers”, and after that it might be “no one is using our software, but
our investors want to see traction, so let’s generate some traction”.</p>

<p>None of these are connected to profitability. Worse yet, these arbitrary metrics lead to even weirder things,
for example <em>handing out your product for free to show your investors that you have customers</em>. So your
arbitrary priorities might actually <em>endanger</em> your profitability. Crazy.</p>

<p>You think that’s all? Nope! Because priorities aren’t clear, discussions and meetings in your company also
won’t be clear. People will no longer discuss things of immediate urgency, like in the restaurant (“why does
our food suck?”) - instead, discussion topics will be all over the place, like which coffee machine to buy,
which great feature was recently shipped (yet totally irrelevant), which rockstar developer you hired, or
whose feature idea gets implemented next. Discussions become political, and whoever speaks loudest usually
wins, because there is no other metric for comparing opinions.</p>

<p>So. Don’t take VC funding.</p>

<h2 id="addendum-but-this-company-is-only-possible-with-funding">Addendum: “But This Company Is Only Possible With Funding!”</h2>

<p>Now you might say “dude, all of your points make sense, but my company MagicalUnicorn is only possible with VC
funding because it has huge up-front costs”.</p>

<p>Valid point, but I’d caution you to think again whether that’s really true. Yes, some companies might truly
have huge up-front costs and therefore require investments - like if you want to build cars or shoot rockets
to Mars. But, besides those two examples, most other real-world companies are less capital intensive and you
might be surprised by how many options you have for bootstrapping it yourself.</p>

<p>My favorite method is to start with consulting - not because that’s superior, but because that’s <a href="https://www.eidel.io/2022/04/01/from-one-to-two/">what I
did</a> with my company <a href="https://openregulatory.com/">OpenRegulatory</a> and it worked well for me. Want to start a
medical software company? Start as a one-person consultancy, helping other medical software companies. You
could help them with product management or developing software. You’ll learn tons about medical software and
build a great network of people. Most importantly, you’ll learn about the problems those companies are
facing. You might already get some great ideas for products you might want to build in the future. Once you’ve
saved some money, hire your first employee. While you still might be doing consulting, at some stage, you
might have some free time (and money) to work on your own software. You try to sell it to your existing
consulting customers. Some may buy. And then hire the next person. And so on. You get the idea.</p>

<p>Most product-based businesses can be “projectified” to something more akin to consulting. Give it a
try. You’ll learn many things along the way which will be invaluable later on - meeting other companies in the
industry and learning about their products, finding a good tax advisor, hiring and managing people, and
yes.. being profitable.</p>

              <p>This guide is a collaboratively-edited introduction to ActivityPub and provides links to sources of more information.</p>
<h2>
<a name="what-is-activitypub-1" href="#what-is-activitypub-1"></a>What is ActivityPub?</h2>
<p>ActivityPub is a standard that allows different web applications to interact so that users can pool their information and collaborate across instances (websites, applications), even ones running different software.</p>
<p>Although only adopted as an official World Wide Web Consortium recommendation in 2018, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ActivityPub protocol</a> is already implemented in a significant range of projects. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microblogging platforms like <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Mastodon</a>, <a href="https://joinmisskey.github.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Misskey</a> and <a href="https://pleroma.social/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pleroma</a>.</li>
<li>Decentralized media hosting and sharing platforms like <a href="https://funkwhale.audio/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Funkwhale</a> (audio), <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/en" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">PeerTube</a> (video), and <a href="https://pixelfed.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pixelfed</a> (images).</li>
<li>Blogging platforms like <a href="https://joinplu.me/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Plume</a> and <a href="https://writefreely.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">WriteFreely</a>.</li>
<li>Social network platforms like <a href="https://friendi.ca/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Friendica</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>ActivityPub supports common social network activities like following, liking, announcing, adding, and blocking. For example, if you have an account on a Mastodon instance like <a href="https://mastodon.social/about" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">mastodon.social</a>, you can follow someone on a WriteFreely instance like <a href="https://qua.name/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Qua</a> and receive updates whenever they have a new blog post.</p>
<h3>
<a name="why-activitypub-2" href="#why-activitypub-2"></a>Why ActivityPub?</h3>
<p>Christopher Lemmer Webber, one of the co-authors of ActivityPub, noted in <a href="https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/victory-for-libre-networks-activitypub-is-now-a-w3c-recommended-standard" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a post announcing the standard</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increasingly, much of our lives is mediated through social networks, and so network freedom in these spaces – and thus removing central control over them – is critical. One thing you may have noticed in the last decade is that many decentralized free software social networking applications have been written. Sadly, most of those applications can’t actually speak to each other – a fractured federation. I hope that with ActivityPub, we’ve improved that situation.</p>

<h3>
<a name="terminology-3" href="#terminology-3"></a>Terminology</h3>
<h4>
<a name="federation-4" href="#federation-4"></a>Federation</h4>
<p>In IT, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a federation is</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a group of computing or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Federation is the term used to describe the interoperability that ActivityPub and other protocols can enable between different websites running different softwares. Sites that are connected in this way are said to be <em>federated</em>.</p>
<h4>
<a name="fediverse-5" href="#fediverse-5"></a>Fediverse</h4>
<p>See <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fediverse.Party</a> for a good introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a common name for federated social networks running on free open software on a myriad of servers across the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The term Fediverse includes but is not limited to applications supporting ActivityPub. There are other standards such as <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora_federation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">diaspora</a>, <a href="https://zotlabs.org/help/developer/zot_protocol" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Zot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/OStatus" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OStatus</a> and <a href="https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki/Protocol" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DFRN</a> (this list from <a href="https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fediverse.Party</a>).</p>

<p>Fairphone is a unique Android manufacturer; it offers a smartphone designed for repair, long software support times, and a selection of parts available online. The Dutch electronics manufacturer has mostly only focused on the European market and says, "When is Fairphone coming to the US?" is one of the most common questions it gets asked. Well, ask no more! The company is finally bringing the Fairphone 4 to the US—with some caveats.</p>
<p>Fairphone is launching a "US pilot" program to sell the Fairphone 4 in America in partnership with <a href="https://murena.com/">Murena</a>, the primary developer behind the /e/ Android fork. Murena has been selling Fairphones in Europe for a while, and they come pre-loaded with the /e/ OS, instead of Fairphone's build of Android, and now the US is getting the deal. The phone costs $599.</p>
<p>"We know based on feedback we have received that there are many people interested in Fairphone in the US." Fairphone CEO Eva Gouwens said in the press release. "However, currently our main focus is on the European market. This collaboration with e/OS/ is a great opportunity for us to pilot selling devices in the US market with a long-standing partner and learn more about the American market.”

The C programming language was devised in the early 1970s as a system
implementation language for the nascent Unix operating system.
Derived from the typeless language BCPL, it evolved
a type structure;
created on a tiny machine as a tool to improve
a meager programming environment, it has become

This paper is about the development of the C programming language,
the influences on it,
and the conditions under which it was created.
For the sake of brevity, I omit full descriptions of C itself,
its parent B [Johnson 73] and its grandparent BCPL [Richards 79],
and instead concentrate on characteristic elements
of each language and how they evolved.
<p>
C came into being in the years 1969-1973,
in parallel with the early development
of the Unix operating system;
the most creative period occurred during 1972.
Another spate of changes peaked between 1977 and 1979,
when portability of the Unix system was being demonstrated.
In the middle of this second period, the first widely available description
of the language appeared:
<i>The C Programming Language,</i>
often called the `white book' or `K&amp;R' [Kernighan 78].
Finally, in the middle 1980s, the language was officially standardized
by the ANSI X3J11 committee, which made further changes.
Until the early 1980s, although compilers existed for a variety
of machine architectures and operating systems, the language was almost exclusively
associated with Unix;
more recently, its use has spread much more widely, and today it
is among the languages most commonly used throughout the computer industry.
</p>
<h4>History: the setting
</h4>
<p>
The late 1960s were a turbulent era
for computer systems research at Bell Telephone Laboratories
[Ritchie 78] [Ritchie 84].
The company was pulling
out of the Multics project [Organick 75], which had started as a joint venture
of MIT, General Electric, and Bell Labs; by 1969, Bell Labs management,
and even the researchers, came to believe
that the promises of Multics could be fulfilled
only too late and too expensively.  Even before the GE-645 Multics
machine was removed from the premises, an informal group, led
primarily by Ken Thompson, had begun investigating alternatives.
</p>
<p>
Thompson wanted to create a comfortable computing
environment constructed according to his own design, using whatever
means were available.  His plans, it is evident in retrospect,
incorporated many of the innovative aspects of Multics, including an
explicit notion of a process as a locus of control,
a tree-structured file system, a command interpreter
as user-level program, simple representation of text files, and generalized
access to devices.
They excluded others, such as unified access to
memory and to files.  At the start, moreover, he and the rest
of us deferred another pioneering (though not original)
element of Multics, namely writing almost exclusively in a
higher-level language.
PL/I, the implementation language of Multics, was not
much to our tastes, but we were also using other languages, including BCPL, and
we regretted losing the advantages of writing programs in a
language above the level of assembler, such as
ease of writing and clarity
of understanding.
At the time we did not put much weight
on portability; interest in this arose later.
</p>
<p>
Thompson was faced with
a hardware environment cramped and spartan even for the time:
the DEC PDP-7 on which he started in 1968 was a machine with 8K 18-bit words
of memory and no software useful to him.
While wanting to use a higher-level language,
he wrote the original Unix system in PDP-7 assembler.
At the start, he did not even program
on the PDP-7 itself, but instead used a set of macros
for the GEMAP assembler on a
GE-635 machine.
A postprocessor
generated a paper tape readable by the PDP-7.
</p>
<p>
These tapes were
carried from the GE machine to the PDP-7 for testing until a primitive Unix kernel,
an editor, an assembler, a simple shell (command interpreter), and a few utilities
(like
the Unix
<i>rm, cat, cp</i>
commands)
were completed.  After this point, the operating system was self-supporting:
programs could be written and tested without resort to paper tape,
and development continued on the PDP-7 itself.
</p>
<p>
Thompson's PDP-7 assembler outdid even DEC's in simplicity;
it evaluated expressions and emitted the corresponding bits.
There were no libraries,
no loader or link editor: the entire source of a program was presented to
the assembler, and the output file—with a fixed name—that emerged was directly
executable.
(This name,
<i>a.out</i>,
explains a bit of Unix etymology;
it is the output of the assembler.
Even after the system gained a linker
and a means of specifying another name explicitly,
it was retained as the default executable
result of a compilation.)
</p>
<p>
Not long after Unix first ran on the PDP-7, in 1969, Doug McIlroy created
the new system's first higher-level language: an implementation of
McClure's TMG [McClure 65].  TMG is a language for writing compilers
(more generally, TransMoGrifiers) in a top-down, recursive-descent
style that combines context-free syntax notation with
procedural elements.  McIlroy and Bob Morris had used TMG to write the early
PL/I compiler for Multics.
</p>
<p>
Challenged by McIlroy's feat in reproducing TMG,
Thompson decided that Unix—possibly it had not even been
named yet—needed a system programming language.
After a rapidly scuttled attempt at Fortran,
he created instead a language of his own,
which he called B.
B can be thought of
as C without types; more accurately, it is BCPL squeezed into 8K bytes of memory
and filtered through Thompson's brain.
Its name most probably represents
a contraction of BCPL, though
an alternate theory holds that
it derives from Bon [Thompson 69],
an unrelated language created by
Thompson during the Multics days.
Bon in turn was named either after his wife Bonnie,
or (according to an encyclopedia quotation in its manual),
after a religion whose rituals involve the murmuring of magic formulas.
</p>
<h4>Origins: the languages
</h4>
<p>
BCPL was
designed by Martin Richards in the mid-1960s while he was visiting MIT,
and was used during the early 1970s
for several interesting projects, among them the OS6 operating system
at Oxford [Stoy 72], and parts of the seminal Alto work at Xerox PARC [Thacker 79].
We became familiar with it
because the
MIT CTSS system [Corbato 62] on which Richards worked was used for Multics development.
The original BCPL compiler was transported both to Multics and to the GE-635
GECOS system
by Rudd Canaday
and others at Bell Labs [Canaday 69];
during the final throes of Multics's life at Bell Labs
and immediately after, it was the language of choice
among the group of people who would later become involved with Unix.
</p>
<p>
BCPL, B, and C all fit firmly in the traditional
procedural family typified by Fortran and Algol 60.
They are particularly oriented towards
system programming, are small and compactly described,
and are amenable to translation by simple compilers.  They are `close
to the machine' in that the abstractions they introduce are readily
grounded in the concrete data types and operations supplied by
conventional computers, and they rely on library routines
for input-output and other interactions with an operating system.
With less success, they also use library procedures to specify interesting
control constructs such as coroutines and procedure
closures.  At the same time, their abstractions lie at a sufficiently
high level that, with care, portability between machines can
be achieved.
</p>
<p>
BCPL, B and C differ syntactically in many details, but broadly
they are similar.
Programs consist of a sequence of
global declarations and function (procedure) declarations.
Procedures can be nested in BCPL, but may not refer to non-static
objects defined in containing procedures.
B and C avoid this restriction by imposing a more severe one:
no nested procedures at all.
Each of the languages (except for earliest versions of B)
recognizes
separate compilation, and provides a means for including
text from named files.
</p>
<p>
Several syntactic and lexical mechanisms of BCPL are
more elegant and regular than those of B and C.
For example, BCPL's procedure and data declarations
have a more uniform structure, and it supplies a more complete
set of looping constructs.
Although BCPL programs are notionally supplied from an undelimited
stream of characters, clever rules allow most semicolons to be elided
after statements that end on a line boundary.
B and C omit this convenience, and end
most statements with semicolons.
In spite of the differences, most of the statements and operators of BCPL map
directly into corresponding B and C.
</p>
<p>
Some of the structural differences between BCPL and B
stemmed from limitations on intermediate memory.
For example, BCPL declarations may take the form
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>let P1 be <i>command</i>
and P2 be <i>command</i>
and P3 be <i>command</i>
 ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
where the program text represented by the commands
contains whole procedures.
The subdeclarations
connected by
<tt>and</tt>
occur simultaneously, so the name
<tt>P3</tt>
is known inside procedure
<tt>P1</tt>.
Similarly, BCPL can package a group of declarations and statements into
an expression that yields a value, for example
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>E1 := valof <i>( </i><i>declarations</i><i> ; </i><i>commands</i><i> ; resultis E2 </i><i>) + 1
</i></pre></tt></dd></dl><i>
</i>The BCPL compiler readily handled such constructs
by storing and analyzing a parsed representation of the entire
program in memory before producing output.
Storage limitations on the B compiler demanded a one-pass technique in which
output was generated as soon as possible, and the syntactic
redesign that made this possible was carried forward into C.

<p>
Certain less pleasant aspects of BCPL owed to its own technological
problems and were consciously
avoided in the design of B.
For example, BCPL uses a `global vector' mechanism for communicating
between separately compiled programs.
In this scheme,
the programmer explicitly associates the name of each externally visible
procedure and data object with a numeric offset in the global
vector; the linkage is accomplished in the compiled code
by using these numeric offsets.
B evaded this inconvenience initially by insisting that the entire
program be presented all at once to the compiler.
Later implementations of B, and all those of C, use a conventional
linker to resolve external names occurring in files compiled separately,
instead of placing the burden of assigning offsets on the programmer.
</p>
<p>
Other fiddles in the transition from BCPL to B were introduced as
a matter of taste, and some remain controversial, for example the decision
to use the single character
<tt>=</tt>
for assignment instead of
<tt>:=</tt>.
Similarly, B uses
<tt>/**/</tt>
to enclose comments, where BCPL uses
<tt>//</tt>,
to ignore text up to the end of the line.
The legacy of PL/I is evident here.
(C++ has resurrected the BCPL comment convention.)
Fortran influenced the syntax
of declarations:
B declarations begin with a specifier
like
<tt>auto</tt>
or
<tt>static</tt>,
followed by a list of names, and C
not only followed this style but ornamented it by
placing its type keywords at the start of declarations.
</p>
<p>
Not every difference between the BCPL language documented in
Richards's book
[Richards 79]
and B was deliberate;
we started from an earlier version of BCPL [Richards 67].
For example, the
<tt>endcase</tt>
that escapes from a BCPL
<tt>switchon</tt>
statement was not present in the language when we learned it
in the 1960s,
and so the overloading of the
<tt>break</tt>
keyword
to escape from the B and C
<tt>switch</tt>
statement
owes to divergent
evolution rather than conscious change.
</p>
<p>
In contrast to the pervasive syntax variation that occurred
during the creation of B, the core semantic content of BCPL—its
type structure and expression evaluation rules—remained intact.
Both languages are typeless, or rather have a single data type,
the `word,' or `cell,' a fixed-length bit pattern.  Memory in these languages
consists of a linear array of such cells, and the meaning of
the contents of a cell depends on the operation applied.
The
<tt>+</tt>
operator, for example, simply adds its operands using the machine's
integer add instruction, and the other arithmetic
operations are equally unconscious of the actual meaning
of their operands.  Because memory is a linear array, it is possible
to interpret the value in a cell as an index in this array,
and BCPL supplies an operator for this purpose.  In the
original language it was spelled
<tt>rv</tt>,
and later
<tt>!</tt>,
while B uses the unary
<tt>*</tt>.
Thus, if
<tt>p</tt>
is a cell containing
the index of (or address of, or pointer to) another cell,
<tt>*p</tt>
refers to the contents of the pointed-to cell, either
as a value in an expression or as the target of
an assignment.
</p>
<p>
Because pointers in BCPL and B are merely integer indices
in the memory array, arithmetic on them is meaningful:
if
<tt>p</tt>
is the address of a cell, then
<tt>p+1</tt>
is the address of
the next cell.
This convention is the basis for the semantics
of arrays in both languages.  When in BCPL one writes
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>let V = vec 10
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
or in B,
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>auto V[10];
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
the effect is the same: a cell named
<tt>V</tt>
is allocated, then
another group of 10 contiguous cells is set aside, and the memory index
of the first of these is placed into
<tt>V</tt>.
By a general rule, in B the expression
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>*(V+i)
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
adds
<tt>V</tt>
and
<tt>i</tt>,
and refers to the
<tt>i</tt>-th
location after
<tt>V</tt>.
Both
BCPL and B each add special notation to sweeten such array accesses;
in B an equivalent expression is
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>V[i]
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
and in BCPL
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>V!i
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
This approach to arrays was unusual even at the time;
C would later assimilate it in an
even less conventional way.

<p>
None of BCPL, B, or C supports character data strongly
in the language; each treats strings
much like vectors of integers and supplements general rules by
a few conventions.
In both BCPL and B a string literal denotes the address of a
static area initialized with the characters of the string,
packed into cells.
In BCPL, the first packed byte contains the number of characters
in the string;
in B, there is no count and strings are terminated by
a special character, which B spelled
`<tt>*e</tt>'.
This change was made partially to avoid the limitation
on the length of a string caused by holding the count
in an 8- or 9-bit slot, and partly because maintaining
the count seemed, in our experience, less convenient than using a
terminator.
</p>
<p>
Individual characters in a BCPL string were usually manipulated
by spreading the string out into another array, one character per cell,
and then repacking it later;
B provided corresponding routines, but people more often used
other library functions that accessed or replaced individual
characters in a string.
</p>
<h4>More History
</h4>
<p>
After the TMG version of B was working, Thompson rewrote B in itself
(a bootstrapping step).
During development, he continually struggled against memory limitations:
each language addition
inflated the compiler so it could barely fit, but each
rewrite taking advantage of the feature reduced its size.
For example, B introduced generalized assignment operators, using
<tt>x=+y</tt>
to add
<tt>y</tt>
to
<tt>x</tt>.
The notation came from
Algol 68 [Wijngaarden 75] via McIlroy, who had incorporated
it into his version of TMG.
(In B and early C, the operator was spelled
<tt>=+</tt>
instead of
<tt>+=</tt>
; this mistake, repaired in 1976, was induced by a seductively easy
way of handling the first form in B's lexical analyzer.)
</p>
<p>
Thompson went a step further by inventing the
<tt>++</tt>
and
<tt>--</tt>
operators, which increment or decrement;
their prefix
or postfix position determines whether the alteration
occurs before or after noting the value of the operand.
They were not in the earliest versions of B, but appeared
along the way.
People often guess that
they were created to use the auto-increment and
auto-decrement address modes provided by the DEC PDP-11 on which C and Unix
first became popular.
This is historically impossible, since there was no PDP-11
when B was developed.
The PDP-7, however,
did have a few `auto-increment' memory cells, with the property
that an indirect memory reference through them incremented the cell.
This feature probably suggested such operators to Thompson;
the generalization to make them both prefix and postfix
was his own.
Indeed, the auto-increment cells were not used directly in implementation of the
operators, and a stronger motivation for the innovation was probably
his observation that
the translation of
<tt>++x</tt>
was smaller than that of
<tt>x=x+1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The B compiler on the PDP-7 did not generate machine instructions,
but instead `threaded code' [Bell 72], an interpretive scheme in which
the compiler's output consists
of a sequence of addresses of code fragments that perform the
elementary operations.
The operations typically—in particular for B—act on a simple stack machine.
</p>
<p>
On the PDP-7 Unix system, only a few things were written in B except B itself,
because the machine was too small and too slow to do more than
experiment; rewriting the operating system and the utilities
wholly into B was too expensive a step to
seem feasible.
At some point Thompson relieved the address-space crunch by offering a
`virtual B' compiler that allowed the interpreted program to occupy more than 8K bytes
by paging the code and data within the interpreter,
but it was too slow to be practical for the common utilities.
Still, some utilities written in B appeared, including an early version of
the variable-precision calculator
<i>dc</i>
familiar to Unix users [McIlroy 79].
The most ambitious enterprise I undertook was a genuine
cross-compiler that translated B to GE-635 machine instructions, not threaded code.
It was a small
<i>tour de force</i>:
a full B compiler, written in its
own language and generating code for a 36-bit mainframe,
that ran on an 18-bit machine with 4K words of user address space.
This project was possible only because of the simplicity
of the B language and its run-time system.
</p>
<p>
Although we entertained occasional thoughts
about implementing one of the major languages of the time like Fortran,
PL/I, or Algol 68, such a project seemed hopelessly large for our resources:
much simpler and smaller tools were called for.
All these languages influenced our work,
but it was more fun to do things on our own.
</p>
<p>
By 1970, the Unix project had shown enough promise that we were
able to acquire the new DEC PDP-11.
The processor was among the first of its line delivered by DEC, and three months
passed before its disk arrived.
Making B programs
run on it using the threaded technique
required only writing the code fragments for the operators,
and a simple assembler which I coded in B;
soon,
<i>dc</i>
became the first
interesting program to be tested, before any operating system, on our PDP-11.
Almost as rapidly, still waiting for the disk, Thompson recoded
the Unix kernel and some basic commands in PDP-11 assembly language.
Of the 24K bytes of memory on the machine, the earliest PDP-11 Unix system
used 12K bytes for the operating system,
a tiny space for user programs, and the remainder as a RAM disk.
This version was only for testing, not for real work;
the machine marked time by enumerating closed knight's
tours on chess boards of various sizes.
Once its disk appeared, we quickly migrated to it after
transliterating assembly-language commands to the PDP-11 dialect, and
porting those already in B.
</p>
<p>
By 1971, our miniature computer center was beginning to have users.
We all wanted to create interesting software more easily.
Using assembler was dreary enough that B, despite its performance
problems, had been supplemented by a small library of useful service routines
and was being used for more and more new programs.
Among the more notable results of this period was Steve Johnson's
first version of the
<i>yacc</i>
parser-generator [Johnson 79a].
</p>
<h4>The Problems of B
</h4>
<p>
The machines on which we first used BCPL and then B were word-addressed,
and these languages' single data type, the `cell,' comfortably
equated with the hardware machine word.
The advent of the PDP-11 exposed several inadequacies of B's semantic model.
First, its character-handling mechanisms, inherited with few changes from BCPL,
were clumsy:
using library procedures to spread packed strings into individual
cells and then repack, or to access and replace
individual characters,
began to feel awkward, even silly, on a byte-oriented machine.
</p>
<p>
Second, although the original PDP-11 did not provide for floating-point
arithmetic,
the manufacturer promised that it would soon be available.
Floating-point operations had been added to BCPL
in our Multics and GCOS compilers by defining
special operators, but the mechanism was possible
only because on the relevant machines, a single word
was large enough to contain a floating-point number;
this was not true on the 16-bit PDP-11.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the B and BCPL model implied overhead in dealing
with pointers: the language rules, by defining a pointer
as an index in an array of words, forced pointers to be represented
as word indices.
Each pointer reference
generated a run-time scale conversion from the pointer to the
byte address expected by the hardware.
</p>
<p>
For all these reasons, it seemed that a typing scheme
was necessary to cope
with characters and byte addressing, and to prepare for the
coming floating-point hardware.
Other issues, particularly type safety and interface checking, did not
seem as important then as they became later.
</p>
<p>
Aside from the problems with the language itself, the B compiler's
threaded-code technique yielded programs
so much slower than their assembly-language counterparts
that we discounted the possibility of recoding the
operating system or its central utilities in B.
</p>
<p>
In 1971 I began to extend the B language by adding a character type
and also rewrote its compiler to generate PDP-11 machine instructions
instead of threaded code.
Thus the transition from B to C
was contemporaneous with the creation of a compiler
capable of producing programs fast and small enough
to compete with assembly language.
I called the slightly-extended language NB, for `new B.'
</p>
<h4>Embryonic C
</h4>
<p>
NB existed so briefly that no full description of
it was written.
It supplied the types
<tt>int</tt>
and
<tt>char</tt>,
arrays of them, and pointers to them, declared in a style typified by
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int i, j;
char c, d;
int iarray[10];
int ipointer[];
char carray[10];
char cpointer[];
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
The semantics of arrays remained exactly as in B and BCPL:
the declarations of
<tt>iarray</tt>
and
<tt>carray</tt>
create cells dynamically initialized with a value pointing to the
first of a sequence of 10 integers and characters respectively.
The declarations for
<tt>ipointer</tt>
and
<tt>cpointer</tt>
omit the size, to assert that no storage should be allocated automatically.
Within procedures, the language's interpretation of
the pointers was identical to that of the array variables:
a pointer declaration created a cell differing from
an array declaration only in that the programmer was expected to assign
a referent, instead of letting the compiler allocate the space
and initialize the cell.

<p>
Values stored in the cells bound to
array and pointer names
were the machine addresses,
measured in bytes, of the corresponding storage area.
Therefore, indirection through a pointer implied no
run-time overhead to scale the pointer from word to byte offset.
On the other hand, the machine code for array subscripting and pointer arithmetic
now depended on the type of the array or the pointer:
to compute
<tt>iarray[i]</tt>
or
<tt>ipointer+i</tt>
implied scaling the addend
<tt>i</tt>
by the size of the object referred to.
</p>
<p>
These semantics represented an easy transition from B,
and I experimented with them for some months.
Problems became evident when I tried to extend the type notation, especially
to add structured (record) types.
Structures, it seemed, should map in an intuitive way
onto memory in the machine,
but in a
structure containing an array, there was no good place to stash the
pointer containing the base of the array, nor any
convenient way to arrange that it be initialized.
For example, the directory entries of early Unix systems
might be described in C as
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>struct {
	int	inumber;
	char	name[14];
};
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
I wanted the structure not merely to characterize an abstract object
but also to describe a collection of bits that might be read from
a directory.
Where could the compiler hide the pointer to
<tt>name</tt>
that the semantics demanded?
Even if structures were thought of more abstractly,
and the space for pointers could be hidden somehow,
how could I handle the technical problem of properly initializing
these pointers when allocating a complicated object, perhaps one that specified
structures containing arrays containing structures to arbitrary depth?

<p>
The solution constituted the crucial jump
in the evolutionary chain between typeless BCPL and typed C.
It eliminated the
materialization of the pointer in storage, and instead caused the
creation of the pointer when the array name is mentioned in an expression.
The rule, which survives in today's C, is that values of array
type are converted, when they appear in expressions, into
pointers to the first of the objects making up the array.
</p>
<p>
This invention enabled most existing B code to continue
to work, despite the underlying shift in the language's semantics.
The few programs that assigned new values to
an array name to adjust its origin—possible in B and BCPL,
meaningless in C—were easily repaired.
More important, the new language retained a coherent and workable (if unusual)
explanation of the semantics of arrays, while opening the way to a
more comprehensive type structure.
</p>
<p>
The second innovation that most clearly
distinguishes C from its predecessors is
this fuller type structure and especially its expression in the syntax of declarations.
NB offered the basic types
<tt>int</tt>
and
<tt>char</tt>,
together with arrays of them, and pointers to them,
but no further ways of composition.
Generalization was required:
given an object of any type, it should
be possible to describe a new object that gathers several into an array,
yields it from a function, or is a pointer to it.
</p>
<p>
For each object of such a composed type, there
was already a way to mention the underlying object:
index the array,
call the function, use the indirection operator on the pointer.
Analogical reasoning led to a declaration syntax for names
mirroring that of the expression syntax in which the names typically appear.
Thus,
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int i, *pi, **ppi;
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
declare an integer, a pointer to an integer, a pointer to
a pointer to an integer.
The syntax of these declarations reflects the
observation that
<tt>i</tt>,
<tt>*pi</tt>,
and
<tt>**ppi</tt>
all yield an
<tt>int</tt>
type when used in an expression.  Similarly,
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int f(), *f(), (*f)();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
declare a function returning an integer, a function returning
a pointer to an integer, a pointer to a function returning
an integer;
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int *api[10], (*pai)[10];
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
declare an array of pointers to integers, and a pointer to
an array of integers.
In all these cases the declaration of a variable resembles
its usage in an expression whose type is the one named at the head of
the declaration.

<p>
The scheme of type composition adopted by C owes considerable debt
to Algol 68, although it did not, perhaps, emerge in a form
that Algol's adherents would approve of.
The central notion I captured from Algol was a type structure
based on atomic
types (including structures), composed into arrays, pointers (references),
and functions (procedures).
Algol 68's concept of unions
and casts also had an influence that appeared later.
</p>
<p>
After creating the type system, the associated
syntax, and the compiler for the new language,
I felt that it deserved a new name;
NB seemed insufficiently distinctive.
I decided to follow the single-letter style and called it C,
leaving open the question whether the name represented
a progression through the alphabet or through the letters in BCPL.
</p>
<h4>Neonatal C
</h4>
<p>
Rapid changes continued after the language had been named,
for example
the introduction of the
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>||</tt>
operators.
In BCPL and B, the evaluation of expressions depends
on context: within
<tt>if</tt>
and other conditional statements that compare
an expression's value with zero,
these languages place a special interpretation on the
<tt>and</tt>
(<tt>&amp;</tt>)
and
<tt>or</tt>
(<tt>|</tt>)
operators.
In ordinary contexts, they operate bitwise, but
in the B statement
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>if (e1 &amp; e2) ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
the compiler must evaluate
<tt>e1</tt>
and if it is non-zero, evaluate
<tt>e2</tt>,
and if it too is non-zero, elaborate the statement dependent on
the
<tt>if</tt>.
The requirement descends recursively on
<tt>&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>|</tt>
operators within
<tt>e1</tt>
and
<tt>e2</tt>.
The short-circuit semantics of the Boolean operators in such
`truth-value' context seemed desirable,
but the overloading of the operators was difficult to explain and use.
At the suggestion of Alan Snyder,
I introduced the
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>||</tt>
operators
to make the mechanism more explicit.

<p>
Their tardy introduction explains an
infelicity of C's precedence rules.  In B one writes
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>if (a==b &amp; c) ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
to check whether
<tt>a</tt>
equals
<tt>b</tt>
and
<tt>c</tt>
is non-zero;
in such a conditional expression it is better that
<tt>&amp;</tt>
have lower precedence than
<tt>==</tt>.
In converting from B to C, one wants to replace
<tt>&amp;</tt>
by
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
in such a statement;
to make the conversion less painful,
we decided to keep the precedence of the
<tt>&amp;</tt>
operator the same relative to
<tt>==</tt>,
and merely split the precedence of
<tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>
slightly from
<tt>&amp;</tt>.
Today, it seems that it would have been preferable to move
the relative precedences of
<tt>&amp;</tt>
and
<tt>==</tt>,
and thereby simplify a common C idiom:
to test a masked value
against another value, one must write
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>if ((a&amp;mask) == b) ...
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
where the inner parentheses are required but easily forgotten.

<p>
Many other changes occurred around 1972-3, but the most important
was the introduction of the preprocessor,
partly at the urging of Alan Snyder [Snyder 74],
but also in recognition of the utility of the
the file-inclusion mechanisms available in BCPL and PL/I.
Its original version was exceedingly simple,
and provided only included files and
simple string replacements:
<tt>#include</tt>
and
<tt>#define</tt>
of parameterless macros.
Soon thereafter, it was extended, mostly by Mike Lesk
and then by John Reiser,
to incorporate macros with arguments and conditional
compilation.
The preprocessor was originally considered an optional adjunct
to the language itself.  Indeed, for some years,
it was not even invoked unless the source program contained
a special signal at its beginning.
This attitude persisted, and explains
both the incomplete integration of the syntax of the
preprocessor with the rest of the language
and the imprecision of its description in early reference
manuals.
</p>
<h4>Portability
</h4>
<p>
By early 1973, the essentials of
modern C were complete.
The language and compiler were strong enough to permit us to
rewrite the Unix kernel for the PDP-11 in C during the summer of that year.
(Thompson had made a brief attempt to produce a system coded in an early version of
C—before structures—in 1972, but gave up the effort.)
Also during this period, the compiler was retargeted to other nearby machines,
particularly the Honeywell 635 and IBM 360/370;
because the language could not live in isolation,
the prototypes for the modern libraries
were developed.
In particular, Lesk wrote a `portable I/O package' [Lesk 72]
that was later reworked to become the C `standard I/O' routines.
In 1978 Brian Kernighan and I published
<i>The C Programming Language</i>
[Kernighan 78].
Although it did not describe some additions
that soon became common, this book served as the language
reference until a formal standard was adopted more than
ten years later.
Although we worked closely together on this book, there was a clear division of labor:
Kernighan wrote almost all the expository material, while
I was responsible for the appendix containing the reference manual and
the chapter on interfacing with the Unix system.
</p>
<p>
During 1973-1980,
the language grew a bit:
the type structure gained unsigned, long, union, and enumeration types,
and structures became nearly first-class objects
(lacking only a notation for literals).
Equally important developments appeared in its environment and the accompanying
technology.
Writing the Unix kernel in C had given us enough confidence in the language's
usefulness and efficiency that we began to recode the
system's utilities and tools as well,
and then to move the most interesting among them to the other
platforms.
As described in [Johnson 78a], we discovered that the hardest problems
in propagating Unix tools lay not in the
interaction of the C language with new hardware,
but in adapting to the existing software of other
operating systems.
Thus Steve Johnson began to work on
<i>pcc</i>,
a C compiler intended to be easy to retarget to new machines [Johnson 78b],
while he, Thompson, and I began to move the Unix system itself to
the Interdata 8/32 computer.
</p>
<p>
The language changes during this period, especially around 1977,
were largely focused on considerations of portability and type safety,
in an effort to cope with the problems we foresaw and observed
in moving a considerable body of code to the new Interdata
platform.
C at that time still manifested strong signs of its typeless
origins.
Pointers, for example, were barely distinguished from
integral memory indices in early language manuals or extant code;
the similarity of the arithmetic properties of
character pointers and unsigned integers made it hard
to resist the temptation to identify them.
The
<tt>unsigned</tt>
types were added to make unsigned arithmetic available
without confusing it with pointer manipulation.
Similarly, the early language condoned assignments between
integers and pointers, but this practice began to be discouraged;
a notation for type conversions (called `casts' from the example of Algol 68)
was invented to specify type conversions more explicitly.
Beguiled by the example of PL/I, early C
did not tie structure pointers firmly to the structures
they pointed to, and permitted programmers to write
<tt>pointer-&gt;member</tt>
almost without regard to the type of
<tt>pointer</tt>;
such an expression was taken uncritically as a reference
to a region of memory designated by the pointer, while the member
name specified only an offset and a type.
</p>
<p>
Although the first edition of K&amp;R described most of the
rules that brought C's type structure to its present form,
many programs written in the older, more relaxed style
persisted, and so did compilers that tolerated it.
To encourage people to pay more attention to the
official language rules, to detect legal but suspicious constructions,
and to help find interface mismatches
undetectable with simple mechanisms for separate compilation,
Steve Johnson adapted his
<i>pcc</i>
compiler to produce
<i>lint</i>
[Johnson 79b],
which scanned a set of files and remarked on dubious constructions.
</p>
<h4>Growth in Usage
</h4>
<p>
The success of our portability experiment on the
Interdata 8/32 soon led to another by Tom London and John Reiser
on the DEC VAX 11/780.
This machine became much more popular than the Interdata, and
Unix and the C language began to spread rapidly, both within AT&amp;T and
outside.
Although by the middle 1970s
Unix was in use by
a variety of projects within the Bell System
as well as a small group of research-oriented
industrial, academic, and government organizations outside our company,
its real growth began only after portability had been achieved.
Of particular note were the System III and System V
versions of the system from the emerging Computer Systems division of AT&amp;T, based
on work by the company's development and research groups,
and the BSD series of releases by the University
of California at Berkeley that derived from research
organizations in Bell Laboratories.
</p>
<p>
During the 1980s the use of the C language spread widely,
and compilers became available on nearly every machine architecture
and operating system; in particular it became popular as a
programming tool for personal computers, both for manufacturers
of commercial software for these machines, and for end-users
interested in programming.
At the start of the decade, nearly every compiler was based on Johnson's
<i>pcc</i>;
by 1985 there were many independently-produced compiler products.
</p>
<h4>Standardization
</h4>
<p>
By 1982 it was clear that C needed formal standardization.
The best approximation to a standard,
the first edition of K&amp;R, no longer described the language in actual use;
in particular, it mentioned neither the
<tt>void</tt>
or
<tt>enum</tt>
types.
While it foreshadowed the newer approach to structures, only after
it was published did the language support assigning them, passing them
to and from functions, and associating the names of members firmly
with the structure or union containing them.
Although compilers distributed by AT&amp;T incorporated these changes,
and most of the purveyors of compilers not based on
<i>pcc</i>
quickly picked up them up, there remained no complete, authoritative
description of the language.
</p>
<p>
The first edition of K&amp;R was also insufficiently precise on many details
of the language, and it became increasingly impractical to regard
<i>pcc</i>
as a `reference compiler;'
it did not perfectly
embody even the language described by K&amp;R, let alone subsequent extensions.
Finally, the incipient use of C in projects subject to commercial
and government contract meant that the imprimatur of an official
standard was important.
Thus (at the urging of M. D. McIlroy), ANSI established the X3J11
committee under the direction of CBEMA
in the summer of 1983, with the goal of producing
a C standard.
X3J11 produced its report [ANSI 89] at the end of 1989,
and subsequently this standard was accepted by ISO as
ISO/IEC 9899-1990.
</p>
<p>
From the beginning, the X3J11 committee took a cautious,
conservative view of language extensions.
Much to my
satisfaction, they took seriously their goal:
`to develop a clear, consistent, and unambiguous Standard
for the C programming language which codifies the common,
existing definition of C and which promotes the portability
of user programs across C language environments.' [ANSI 89]
The committee realized that mere promulgation of a standard
does not make the world change.
</p>
<p>
X3J11 introduced only one genuinely important change to the language itself:
it incorporated the types of formal arguments in the type
signature of a function, using syntax borrowed from C++ [Stroustrup 86].
In the old style, external functions were declared like this:
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>double sin();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
which says only that
<tt>sin</tt>
is a function returning a
<tt>double</tt>
(that is, double-precision floating-point) value.
In the new style, this better rendered
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>double sin(double);
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
to make the argument type explicit
and thus encourage better type checking and appropriate conversion.
Even this addition, though it produced a noticeably better language,
caused difficulties.
The committee justifiably felt that simply outlawing
`old-style' function definitions and declarations was not
feasible, yet also agreed that the new forms were better.
The inevitable compromise was as good as it
could have been, though the language definition is complicated by
permitting both forms, and writers of portable software must contend
with compilers not yet brought up to standard.

<p>
X3J11 also introduced
a host of smaller additions and adjustments, for example,
the type qualifiers
<tt>const</tt>
and
<tt>volatile</tt>,
and slightly different type promotion rules.
Nevertheless, the standardization process did not change the character
of the language.
In particular, the C standard did not attempt to specify formally
the language semantics, and so there can be dispute over fine points;
nevertheless, it successfully accounted for changes in
usage since the original description, and is sufficiently precise to
base implementations on it.
</p>
<p>
Thus the core C language escaped nearly unscathed from the
standardization process, and the Standard emerged more
as a better, careful codification than a new invention.
More important changes took place in the language's surroundings:
the preprocessor and the library.
The preprocessor performs macro substitution, using conventions
distinct from the rest of the language.
Its
interaction with the compiler had never
been well-described, and X3J11 attempted to remedy the
situation.
The result is noticeably better than the explanation in the first edition of K&amp;R;
besides being more comprehensive, it provides
operations, like token concatenation, previously available
only by accidents of implementation.
</p>
<p>
X3J11 correctly believed that a full and careful
description of a standard C library was as important as its
work on the language itself.
The C language itself does not provide for input-output
or any other interaction with the outside world, and thus
depends on a set of standard procedures.
At the time of publication of K&amp;R, C was thought of mainly
as the system programming language of Unix; although we
provided examples of library routines intended to be readily transportable
to other operating systems, underlying support from Unix was implicitly
understood.
Thus, the X3J11 committee spent much of its time designing
and documenting a set
of library routines required to be available in all
conforming implementations.
</p>
<p>
By the rules of the standards process, the current activity of the X3J11
committee is confined to issuing interpretations on the existing
standard.
However, an informal group originally convened by Rex Jaeschke
as NCEG (Numerical C Extensions Group) has been officially accepted
as subgroup X3J11.1,
and they continue to consider extensions to C.
As the name implies, many of these possible extensions are intended to make the language
more suitable for numerical use: for example, multi-dimensional arrays
whose bounds are dynamically determined, incorporation of facilities
for dealing with IEEE arithmetic, and making the language more effective on machines
with vector or other advanced architectural features.
Not all the possible extensions are specifically numerical; they
include a notation for structure literals.
</p>
<h4>Successors
</h4>
<p>
C and even B have several direct descendants, though they
do not rival Pascal in generating progeny.
One side branch developed early.
When Steve Johnson visited the University of Waterloo on sabbatical
in 1972,
he brought B with him.  It became popular
on the Honeywell machines there, and later spawned Eh and Zed
(the Canadian answers to `what follows B?').
When Johnson returned to Bell Labs in 1973, he was disconcerted to
find that the language whose seeds he brought to Canada
had evolved back home;
even his own
<i>yacc</i>
program had been rewritten in C, by Alan Snyder.
</p>
<p>
More recent descendants of C proper include Concurrent C [Gehani 89],
Objective C [Cox 86], C* [Thinking 90],
and especially C++ [Stroustrup 86].
The language is also widely used as an intermediate
representation (essentially, as a portable assembly language)
for a wide variety of compilers, both for direct descendents
like C++, and independent languages like
Modula 3 [Nelson 91] and
Eiffel
[Meyer 88].
</p>
<h4>Critique
</h4>
<p>
Two ideas are most characteristic of C among languages of its class:
the relationship between arrays and pointers,
and the way in which declaration syntax mimics expression syntax.
They are also among its most frequently criticized features,
and often serve as stumbling blocks to the beginner.
In both cases, historical accidents or mistakes have exacerbated
their difficulty.
The most important of these has been the tolerance of C compilers
to errors in type.
As should be clear from the history above, C evolved from typeless
languages.
It did not suddenly appear to its earliest
users and developers as an entirely new language with its own rules;
instead we continually had to adapt existing programs as the
language developed, and make allowance for an existing body
of code.  (Later, the ANSI X3J11 committee standardizing C would
face the same problem.)
</p>
<p>
Compilers in 1977, and even well after,
did not complain about usages such as assigning between integers
and pointers or using objects of the wrong type to refer
to structure members.
Although the language definition presented in the first edition of K&amp;R
was reasonably (though not completely) coherent in its treatment of type rules,
that book admitted that existing compilers didn't enforce them.
Moreover, some rules designed to ease early transitions
contributed to later confusion.
For example, the empty square brackets in the function declaration
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int f(a) int a[]; { ... }
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
are a living fossil, a remnant of NB's way of declaring a pointer;
<tt>a</tt>
is, in this special case only, interpreted in C as a pointer.
The notation survived in part for the sake of
compatibility, in part under the rationalization
that it would allow programmers
to communicate to their readers
an intent to pass
<tt>f</tt>
a pointer generated from an array, rather than a reference to a single
integer.
Unfortunately, it serves as much to confuse the learner
as to alert the reader.

<p>
In K&amp;R C, supplying arguments of the proper type to a function call
was the responsibility of the programmer, and the extant compilers
did not check for type agreement.
The failure of the original language to include argument types
in the type signature of a function
was a significant weakness,
indeed the one that required the X3J11 committee's boldest and most painful
innovation to repair.
The early design is explained (if not justified) by my avoidance of technological
problems, especially cross-checking between separately-compiled source files,
and my incomplete assimilation of the implications of moving between
an untyped to a typed language.
The
<i>lint</i>
program,
mentioned above,
tried to alleviate the problem:
among its other functions,
<i>lint</i>
checks the consistency and coherency of a whole program by scanning a set
of source files,
comparing the types of function arguments used in calls with those
in their definitions.
</p>
<p>
An accident of syntax contributed to the perceived complexity of the language.
The indirection operator, spelled
<tt>*</tt>
in C, is syntactically a unary prefix operator, just as in BCPL and B.
This works well in simple expressions, but in more complex cases,
parentheses are required to direct the parsing.
For example, to distinguish indirection through the value
returned by a function from calling a function designated by
a pointer, one writes
<tt>*fp()</tt>
and
<tt>(*pf)()</tt>
respectively.
The style used in expressions carries through to declarations, so the names might be
declared
</p><dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int *fp();
int (*pf)();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
In more ornate but still realistic cases, things become worse:
<dl><dt></dt><dd><tt><pre>int *(*pfp)();
</pre></tt></dd></dl>
is a pointer to a function returning a pointer to an integer.
There are two effects occurring.
Most important, C has a relatively rich set of ways of
describing types (compared, say, with Pascal).
Declarations in languages
as expressive as C—Algol 68, for example—describe objects equally hard
to understand, simply because the objects themselves are complex.
A second effect owes to details of the syntax.
Declarations in C must be read
in an `inside-out' style that many find
difficult to grasp [Anderson 80].
Sethi [Sethi 81] observed that many of the nested declarations
and expressions would become simpler
if the indirection operator had been taken as a postfix operator
instead of prefix, but by then it was too late to change.

<p>
In spite of its difficulties,
I believe that the C's approach to declarations remains plausible,
and am comfortable with it; it is a useful unifying principle.
</p>
<p>
The other characteristic feature of C, its treatment of arrays,
is more suspect on practical grounds, though it also has
real virtues.
Although the relationship between pointers and arrays
is unusual, it can be learned.
Moreover, the language shows considerable power to describe important
concepts, for example, vectors whose length varies at run time,
with only a few basic rules and conventions.
In particular, character strings are handled by the same mechanisms
as any other array, plus the convention that a null character
terminates a string.
It is interesting to compare C's approach with that of two
nearly contemporaneous languages, Algol 68 and Pascal [Jensen 74].
Arrays in Algol 68 either have fixed bounds, or are `flexible:'
considerable mechanism is required both in the language
definition, and in compilers, to accommodate flexible arrays
(and not all compilers fully implement them.)
Original Pascal had only fixed-sized arrays and strings,
and this proved confining [Kernighan 81].
Later, this was partially fixed, though the resulting
language is not yet universally available.
</p>
<p>
C treats strings as arrays of characters
conventionally terminated by a marker.
Aside from one special rule about initialization by string literals,
the semantics of strings are fully subsumed by more general
rules governing all arrays, and
as a result the language is simpler to describe and
to translate than one incorporating the string as a unique
data type.
Some costs accrue from its approach:
certain string operations are more expensive than in other designs
because application code or
a library routine must occasionally search for the end of a string,
because few built-in operations are available, and because
the burden of storage management for strings falls more
heavily on the user.
Nevertheless, C's approach to strings works well.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, C's treatment of arrays in general (not just strings)
has unfortunate implications both for optimization
and for future extensions.
The prevalence of pointers in C programs, whether those declared
explicitly or arising from arrays, means that
optimizers must be cautious, and must use careful dataflow techniques
to achieve good results.
Sophisticated compilers can understand what most pointers
can possibly change, but some important usages remain difficult
to analyze.
For example, functions with pointer arguments derived from
arrays are hard to compile into efficient code on
vector machines, because it is seldom possible to determine
that one argument pointer does not overlap data also
referred to by another argument, or accessible externally.
More fundamentally, the definition of C so specifically describes
the semantics of arrays that
changes or extensions treating arrays as more
primitive objects, and permitting operations on them as wholes,
become hard to fit into the existing language.
Even extensions to permit the declaration and use of multidimensional arrays whose
size is determined dynamically are not entirely straightforward [MacDonald 89]
[Ritchie 90],
although they would make it much easier to write numerical
libraries in C.
Thus, C covers the most important uses of strings and arrays
arising in practice by a uniform and simple mechanism,
but leaves problems for highly efficient implementations and for extensions.
</p>
<p>
Many smaller infelicities exist in the language
and its description
besides those discussed above, of course.
There are also
general criticisms to be lodged that transcend detailed points.
Chief among these is that the language and its generally-expected
environment provide little help for writing very large systems.
The naming structure provides only two main levels,
`external' (visible everywhere) and `internal' (within
a single procedure).
An intermediate level
of visibility (within a single file of data and procedures)
is weakly tied to the language definition.
Thus, there is little direct support for modularization,
and project designers are forced to create their own conventions.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, C itself provides two durations of storage:
`automatic' objects that exist while control resides in or below
a procedure, and `static,' existing throughout execution of a program.
Off-stack, dynamically-allocated storage is provided only
by a library routine and
the burden of managing it is placed on
the programmer: C is hostile to automatic garbage collection.
</p>
<h4>Whence Success?
</h4>
<p>
C has become successful to an extent far surpassing any early
expectations.  What qualities contributed to its widespread use?
</p>
<p>
Doubtless the success of Unix itself was the most important factor;
it made the language available to hundreds of thousands of people.
Conversely, of course, Unix's use of C and its consequent
portability to a wide variety of machines
was important in the system's success.
But the language's invasion of other environments suggests more
fundamental merits.
</p>
<p>
Despite some aspects mysterious to the beginner and
occasionally even to the adept,
C remains a simple and small language, translatable with simple and small compilers.
Its types and operations are
well-grounded in those provided by
real machines, and for
people used to how computers work,
learning the idioms for generating time- and space-efficient programs
is not difficult.
At the same time the language is sufficiently abstracted from machine
details that program portability can be achieved.
</p>
<p>
Equally important, C and its central library support always
remained in touch with a real environment.
It was not designed in isolation to prove a point, or to serve
as an example, but as a tool to write programs that did
useful things; it was always meant to interact with a larger
operating system, and was regarded as a
tool to build larger tools.
A parsimonious, pragmatic approach influenced the things that went into C:
it covers
the essential needs of many programmers,
but does not try to supply too much.
</p>
<p>
Finally, despite the changes that it has undergone since its first
published description, which was admittedly informal
and incomplete, the actual C language as seen by millions of users
using many different compilers has remained remarkably stable
and unified compared to those of similarly widespread currency,
for example Pascal and Fortran.
There are differing dialects of C—most noticeably, those described by
the older K&amp;R and the newer Standard C—but on the whole, C has remained
freer of proprietary extensions than other languages.
Perhaps the most significant extensions are the `far' and `near'
pointer qualifications intended to deal with peculiarities
of some Intel processors.
Although C was not originally designed with portability
as a prime goal, it succeeded in expressing
programs, even including operating systems,
on machines ranging from the smallest personal
computers through the mightiest supercomputers.
</p>
<p>
C is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success.
While accidents of history surely helped,
it evidently satisfied a need for a system implementation language
efficient enough
to displace assembly language, yet sufficiently abstract and fluent to
describe algorithms and interactions in a wide variety of environments.
</p>
<h4>Acknowledgments
</h4>
<p>
It is worth summarizing compactly the roles of the direct contributors to today's
C language.
Ken Thompson created the B language in 1969-70; it was derived directly
from Martin Richards's BCPL.
Dennis Ritchie turned B into C during 1971-73, keeping most of B's syntax
while adding types and many other changes, and writing the
first compiler.
Ritchie, Alan Snyder, Steven C. Johnson, Michael Lesk, and Thompson contributed language
ideas during 1972-1977,
and Johnson's portable compiler remains widely used.
During this period, the collection of library routines grew
considerably, thanks to these people and many others at Bell Laboratories.
In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Ritchie wrote the book that
became the language definition for several years.
Beginning in 1983, the ANSI X3J11 committee standardized
the language.  Especially notable in keeping its
efforts on track were its officers
Jim Brodie, Tom Plum, and  P. J. Plauger, and the successive draft redactors,
Larry Rosler and Dave Prosser.

  <p>Here is a dumb question that you probably never asked yourself: What is the minimal amount of bytes we need to store in a .NET executable to have the CLR print the string<code>"Hello, World!"</code> to the standard output?</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/thumbnail.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/thumbnail.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/thumbnail.png"></a>
<em>How small can we get?</em></p>

<p>In this post, we will explore the limits of the .NET module file format, get it as small as possible, while still having it function like a normal executable on a typical Windows machine with the .NET Framework installed.</p>

<p>The final source code for this post can be found on my GitHub:</p>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/Washi1337/367eede6e00b31e29355626d5e2f3078" target="_blank">
 Full Source Code
</a></p>

<h2 id="rules"><span>Rules</span><a href="#rules"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Here are the arbitrary rules I set up for myself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The application must run a managed entry point implemented in C# or CIL.</strong>
This entry point must be responsible for printing <code>"Hello, World!"</code> to the standard output. 
This means we cannot do any of the native entry point shenanigans like we did in a <a href="https://blog.washi.dev/posts/entry-points">previous post</a>.
How it actually does the printing, however, is fully up to this method body.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The application runs on .NET Framework 4.x.x.</strong>
We do this to give ourselves a little bit more freedom, and it allows us to have a single executable only and leverage some of the features of the Windows PE loader. 
It is also nice to have an executable that we can just double click.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No third-party dependencies.</strong> 
We are only allowed to reference the BCL (i.e., mscorlib) and/or other libraries that are installed on a typical Windows machine. 
Otherwise, we could replace all code within our small application with a call to a custom-made dependency, which would be cheating!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Ignore zero bytes at the end of the file.</strong>
The PE file format, as well as the CLR itself, puts a hard limit on offset alignments for each section stored in the PE. 
Effectively it means that the theoretically smallest .NET PE that is able to run on Windows 10 or higher cannot be smaller than 1KB. 
As we will see this is rather easy to achieve.
To challenge ourselves a bit more, we strive to get to the “bare minimum description” of a .NET hello world PE file, where we consider all trailing zero bytes as non-existent.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s get hacking!</p>

<h2 id="establishing-a-baseline"><span>Establishing a baseline</span><a href="#establishing-a-baseline"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>To establish a baseline that we want to beat, let’s first start by compiling the following Hello World application using the latest version of the C# compiler by the time of writing this post.</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2

    <span>{</span>
        <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>"Hello, World!"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>We accompany it with the following <code>.csproj</code> file:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

    <span>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;OutputType&gt;</span>Exe<span>&lt;/OutputType&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;</span>net472<span>&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;LangVersion&gt;</span>10<span>&lt;/LangVersion&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;Nullable&gt;</span>enable<span>&lt;/Nullable&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/Project&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>This gives us a binary of a whopping <code>4.6KB</code> file:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size01.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size01.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size01.png"></a>
<em>The size of a standard hello world application.</em></p>

<p>That seems excessive… Clearly we can do better than this.</p>

<h2 id="removing-nullable-reference-annotations"><span>Removing nullable reference annotations</span><a href="#removing-nullable-reference-annotations"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Inspecting the application in a .NET decompiler gives us a bit more insight on what is going on.
Since C# 8.0 we have known the concept of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/nullable-reference-types">nullable reference types</a>.
These are special annotations that allows the C# compiler to reason about potentially unwanted null references to be passed on to functions, variables and parameters.
The downside is that these annotations are implemented in the form of custom attributes, which are linked into the executable statically and notoriously large:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy01.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy01.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy01.png"></a>
<em>Nullable Reference Types add many Custom Attributes to a .NET image</em></p>

<p>Let’s disable that with one option in our <code>.csproj</code> file:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
</pre></td><td><pre><span>&lt;Project</span> <span>Sdk=</span><span>"Microsoft.NET.Sdk"</span><span>&gt;</span>

    <span>&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;OutputType&gt;</span>Exe<span>&lt;/OutputType&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;TargetFramework&gt;</span>net472<span>&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;LangVersion&gt;</span>10<span>&lt;/LangVersion&gt;</span>
        
         <span>&lt;!-- Disable nullable reference type checks. --&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;Nullable&gt;</span>disable<span>&lt;/Nullable&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/Project&gt;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>While this does get rid of all the attributes, we are unfortunately still left with a binary that is <code>4.6KB</code> in size, due to the PE file alignments.</p>

<h2 id="manually-crafting-a-net-module"><span>Manually crafting a .NET module</span><a href="#manually-crafting-a-net-module"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>Further inspecting the output in a decompiler shows that, even with nullable references disabled, the C# compiler still emits many type references to custom attributes in our application. 
In particular, they include many attributes assigned to the assembly itself, such as file version metadata and copyright information.
Additionally, besides our class <code>Program</code> we also have a hidden <code>&lt;Module&gt;</code> type that looks rather empty:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy02.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy02.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy02.png"></a>
<em>The C# compiler still emits a lot of unnecessary metadata</em></p>

<p>We could try and figure out how to instruct the compiler to disable generating all this metadata, but I figured, if we are going to the extreme, we may as well just build a .NET executable file from scratch by ourselves. 
This way we have more control over the final output, allowing us to just emit the bare minimum that is required to print <code>"Hello World"</code>, and not emit those unnecessary file metadata attributes.
Furthermore, we can just place our <code>main</code> function into the <code>&lt;Module&gt;</code> type and get rid of our <code>Program</code> class as well.
Below is an example implementation of building a small Hello World application using <a href="https://blog.washi.dev/posts/tinysharp/github.com/washi1337/asmresolver">AsmResolver</a>:</p>

<p>This did a great deal already, we cut our file size in half:</p>

<em>The size of a hello world application emitted by AsmResolver.</em></p>

<p>But we can do better…</p>

<h2 id="getting-rid-of-imports-and-base-relocations"><span>Getting rid of Imports and Base Relocations</span><a href="#getting-rid-of-imports-and-base-relocations"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>If we look into the resulting executable file using a tool like <a href="https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388">CFF Explorer</a>, we can see that the file contains two sections <code>.text</code> and <code>.reloc</code>.
Furthermore, it also contains two very large data directories called the Imports and Base Relocations directory respectively.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff01.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff01.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff01.png"></a>
<em>By default, 32-bit .NET images contain imports and base relocations that take a lot of space.</em></p>

<p>This is pretty typical for any AnyCPU or 32-bit .NET executable file.
The imports directory is required because 32-bit .NET executable files require an unmanaged entry point calling <code>mscoree!_CorExeMain</code>, as we have seen in a <a href="https://blog.washi.dev/posts/entry-points">previous post</a>.
Furthermore, by default .NET executables are relocatable, that is, the Windows PE Loader is free to map the executable at any memory address it likes.
This means every 32-bit .NET executable also needs a base relocation for the call to this imported function to be registered in the relocation directory.
This is problematic, because it is by default put in a fully separate section.
As every section needs to be aligned to the smallest possible section alignment of <code>0x200</code> bytes (1KB), we inflate our file by at least that amount of bytes just because of that.</p>

<p>Fortunately for us, 64-bit .NET executables do not need such an unmanaged entry point anymore.
With just two extra lines added to our previous script, we can get rid of both directories, an entire PE section, and thus shave off an entire kilobyte worth of data from our binary file:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre><span>// Output a 64-bit module.</span>
<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>PEKind</span> <span>=</span> <span>OptionalHeaderMagic</span><span>.</span><span>PE64</span><span>;</span>
<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>MachineType</span> <span>=</span> <span>MachineType</span><span>.</span><span>Amd64</span><span>;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff02.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff02.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff02.png"></a>
<em>64-bit .NET images do not need imports or base relocations.</em></p>

<p>And indeed, we get to the theoretically possible minimum size of 1KB of a valid .NET PE file:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size03.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size03.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size03.png"></a>
<em>The minimum size of a PE file is reached.</em></p>



<p>We could have called it quits here, but I decided to look a little bit deeper into what really we can strip out of a binary to get to the absolute bare minimum of a .NET hello world executable.
From now on, we won’t be looking at the file size as reported by Windows Explorer.
Instead, we will be looking at a hex editor and see where the last non-zero byte is stored and consider that to be our final file size.
If we do this for our current file, we can actually see we are already down to a size of 991 bytes (<code>0x3DF</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size04.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size04.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size04.png"></a>
<em>The size we will be considering is the index of of the byte after the last non-zero byte in the file.</em></p>

<p>What is still contributing to this amount of bytes?
If we look again in a disassembler, we can see that the <code>#Strings</code> heap in a .NET binary is the second largest metadata stream stored in the file.
It contains all the names that the tables stream (<code>#~</code>) uses, which stores all the types and methods that our application defines and uses.
As it so turns out, many of these names are actually not really important to the runtime:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy03.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy03.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy03.png"></a>
<em>Names take up a lot of space.</em></p>

<p>Thus, setting these to <code>null</code> instead will give us an application that looks a bit like the following:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy04.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy04.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy04.png"></a>
<em>Truncating names.</em></p>

<p>Believe it or not, the application still runs fine and happily outputs “Hello World”, regardless of whether this looks fine or not.
Best of all, it shaved a whopping 32 bytes from our file:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size05.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size05.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size05.png"></a>
<em>The size of the file after stripping names.</em></p>



<p>What other unnecessary metadata is there that the CLR does not really care about?</p>

<p>Our next target is getting rid of the <code>#GUID</code> stream.
This stream is present in virtually any .NET executable, and contains, as its names implies, a list of GUIDs.
However, the only type of metadata that really references it, is the Module table.
This table has a column called <code>Mvid</code>, which is supposed to reference a GUID that makes the module uniquely identifiable across different versions of compiled binaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff04.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff04.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff04.png"></a>
<em>A module contains an optional MVID, which is a GUID of 16 bytes.</em></p>

<p>We do not care about versioning, we just want the smallest binary possible. 
We can just get rid of it and save 16 bytes that were originally making up the Mvid.
However, by doing so, the <code>#GUID</code> stream is now empty and thus is no longer needed. 
By removing the stream in its entirety, we save another 16 bytes that make up its header, making a total of 32 bytes that we save with this.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <code>Console::WriteLine</code> method that we call in our <code>Main</code> function is defined in <code>mscorlib</code>. 
Typically, references to BCL assemblies are annotated with a public key token of 8 bytes.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff03.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff03.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff03.png"></a>
<em>The reference to <code>mscorlib</code> contains a long public key token.</em></p>

<p>It so turns out that if there is no public key token present in this reference, the CLR then just does not verify this assembly token for authenticity.
Since we do not care about security anyways in our experiment, we can get rid of this too.</p>

<p>This brings us down to a file of 918 bytes in total:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size06.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size06.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size06.png"></a>
<em>The size after stripping GUIDs and public key tokens.</em></p>

<h2 id="getting-rid-of-consolewriteline"><span>Getting rid of Console.WriteLine</span><a href="#getting-rid-of-consolewriteline"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>If we look at other metadata streams defined in our assembly, we find that our <code>"Hello, World!"</code> string is actually stored in a rather inefficient manner.
In .NET, all user strings are put in the <code>#US</code> metadata stream as a length-prefixed array of 16-bit wide characters followed by an additional zero byte.
This is done to support a wide range of the UNICODE character set.
However, all the characters in the string that we want to print have a code-point value smaller than 255 (<code>0xFF</code>), the max value of a single byte.
Why should we then use 2 bytes per character?
Furthermore, this is the only user string that we need in our binary.
Having an entire 12-bytes stream header for just one string seems rather excessive:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff05.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff05.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff05.png"></a>
<em>User strings in .NET always use wide character encoding.</em></p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no way turn this wide-character string in the <code>#US</code> stream to a single-byte ASCII string, and to tell the CLR to interpret it as such.</p>

<p>Time to get creative!</p>

<p>If we want to print an ASCII string as opposed to a wide-character string, we need a function that accepts those types of strings.
<code>Console::WriteLine</code> is not a function that fits this criterium, so we need to get rid of it.
However, the unmanaged function <code>ucrtbase!puts</code> does.
.NET allows for invoking unmanaged functions by using a feature called <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke">Platform Invoke (P/Invoke)</a>.
We can define <code>puts</code> using P/Invoke in the following manner in C#:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>[</span><span>DllImport</span><span>(</span><span>"ucrtbase"</span><span>)]</span>
<span>static</span> <span>extern</span> <span>int</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>nint</span> <span>str</span><span>);</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>However, there is a problem.
The <code>puts</code> function accepts a pointer to a string. 
This pointer must be a valid <strong>runtime address</strong> that points to the start of the zero-terminated ASCII string that we want to print.
How do we know where our string is stored at compile-time so that we can push it in our <code>main</code> method?</p>

<p>It so turns out we can solve this by unchecking the <code>DynamicBase</code> flag in the <code>DllCharacteristics</code> field of the PE’s optional header.
This allows us to fix the base address the module will be mapped on at runtime.
We can then decide an arbitrary base address, put the ASCII string anywhere in our <code>.text</code> section, and calculate the runtime address by the formula <code>module_base_address + rva_ascii_string</code>.</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>var</span> <span>image</span> <span>=</span> <span>module</span><span>.</span><span>ToPEImage</span><span>();</span>

<span>image</span><span>.</span><span>ImageBase</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x00000000004e0000</span><span>;</span>
<span>image</span><span>.</span><span>DllCharacteristics</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>~</span><span>DllCharacteristics</span><span>.</span><span>DynamicBase</span><span>;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>In order to have the CLR actually respect this flag, we also need to unset the <code>ILOnly</code> flag in the .NET data directory:</p>

<div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre><span>image</span><span>.</span><span>DotNetDirectory</span><span>!.</span><span>Flags</span> <span>&amp;=</span> <span>~</span><span>DotNetDirectoryFlags</span><span>.</span><span>ILOnly</span><span>;</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div>

<p>We can then simply pass the calculated address directly in our <code>puts</code> function call as a normal integer:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy05.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy05.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy05.png"></a>
<em>Replace <code>Console::WriteLine</code> with <code>ucrtbase!puts</code>, allowing us to use an ASCII string instead.</em></p>

<p>And there we go, we not only got rid of our wide-character string, but also the entire <code>#US</code> stream, as well as the reference to <code>System.Console::WriteLine</code> which also contributes quite a few bytes to the size of our file.
In turn, we got a few bytes back due to the new required <code>puts</code> method definition and its associated P/Invoke metadata, but it is for sure a big shrink.</p>

<p>We are now down to 889 bytes (<code>0x379</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size07.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size07.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size07.png"></a>
<em>The size of the file after removing <code>Console::WriteLine</code> and using ASCII strings.</em></p>

<h2 id="other-micro-optimizations"><span>Other micro optimizations</span><a href="#other-micro-optimizations"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>There are a few things we still can do.</p>

<p>Our <code>puts</code> definition follows the canonical definition as provided by the C runtime library. 
This means the function is defined to return an <code>int32</code> representing the number of characters that were written to the standard output.
However, we do not care about this value.
Indeed, in our main method, we pop this value right after the call to keep the CLR happy:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy06.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy06.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy06.png"></a>
<em>Returning an <code>int32</code> means the value needs to be popped from the evaluation stack again.</em></p>

<p>Since this is a 64-bit PE file anyways, the <code>puts</code> function will use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170">x64 calling conventions</a> as described by Microsoft.
In simple terms, this means at runtime the return value is not really pushed on the stack as with normal .NET method calls, but rather put in the <code>RAX</code> register.
Since we do not use this value anyways, we can just turn the definition into <code>void</code>, effectively disregarding whatever is put into this register.
As the function is now no longer returning anything, nothing is also pushed onto the evaluation stack in our main method.
This allows us to get rid of the <code>pop</code> instruction in our main method:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy07.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy07.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/dnSpy07.png"></a>
<em>Changing to a <code>void</code> means the <code>pop</code> instruction is no longer required.</em></p>

<p>We can also move the ASCII string that we pass on to the <code>puts</code> function to a slightly better place.
The PE file format contains a lot of segments that are aligned to a certain byte-boundary.
In particular, as was mentioned before, sections are aligned to the nearest multiple of <code>0x200</code> (1KB).
This also includes the first section.
However, since the PE file headers of our file take up less space than <code>0x200</code> bytes, we end up with a chunk of padding data between our headers and first section data:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/hxd01.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/hxd01.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/hxd01.png"></a>
<em>PE images contain some padding between the headers and the first section.</em></p>

<p>It so turns out the Windows PE Loader always maps the PE headers as a chunk of readable memory. 
The good news is, it also includes this padding data.</p>

<p>Let’s move our string there!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/hxd02.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/hxd02.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/hxd02.png"></a>
<em>Place the string to print into the unused padding segment.</em></p>

<p>By moving our string there, we effectively truncated our file by 13 bytes.</p>

<p>Since we also do not reference <code>Console::WriteLine</code> anymore, we also do not longer need the reference to <code>mscorlib</code> to be stored in our binary.
This also saves quite a bit of space, since it means one less table to store in the tables stream (<code>#~</code>), as well as the name <code>mscorlib</code> to be removed from the <code>#Strings</code> stream.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff07.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff07.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff07.png"></a>
<em>We no longer depend on <code>"mscorlib"</code>, thus we do no longer need a reference to it.</em></p>

<p>Finally, we can end with a bit of a weird one.
The .NET metadata directory contains a field called <code>VersionString</code>, containing the minimum required version of the .NET Framework that is required to run this .NET executable.
By default, for .NET 4.0+ binaries, this contains the string <code>"v4.0.30319"</code> padded with zero bytes to the nearest multiple of 4 (totaling 12 bytes).
However, we can truncate this string to just <code>v4.0.</code>, stripping a total of 4 bytes after padding, to trick .NET to still boot up the CLR version 4.0 and run the program successfully.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff06.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff06.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/cff06.png"></a>
<em>The .NET metadata directory contains a version string specifying the required runtime which can be truncated.</em></p>

<p>Note that, for some reason, the trailing <code>.</code> seems to be important. I have no idea why, but getting rid of anything more than this string will make the program not boot up correctly.</p>

<p>Our final size is 834 bytes (<code>0x342</code>):</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size08.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size08.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/size08.png"></a>
<em>The final size of our binary.</em></p>

<p>We can ZIP it to get it to a mere 476 bytes (compared to 582 bytes if we did not do any optimizations after reaching the 1KB limit).
This is where I decided to call it quits.</p>

<p>Finally, to prove the program still works fine, here is a screenshot:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/final.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/final.png" alt="" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.washi.dev/assets/img/posts/tinysharp/final.png"></a>
<em>It still works!</em></p>

<h2 id="final-words"><span>Final Words</span><a href="#final-words"><i></i></a></h2>

<p>This was a dumb way to spend my Saturday.</p>

<p>Even though this is probably quite a useless project, I still like diving into these dumb rabbit holes every now and then.
Exploring the limits of well-established systems is always fun, even if the end result is kind of pointless.</p>

<p>To summarize what we have done, we went from a Hello World file of <code>4.6 KB</code> compiled by the C# compiler to a handcrafted PE file of <code>834 B</code> excluding trailing zero bytes.
I don’t think we can get any smaller than this, but I am happy to be proven wrong!</p>

<p>As said before, the final source code to produce the binary can be found on my GitHub:</p>

  <p>I’ve seen <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/QBpZGqEMsKg">this photo</a> on the internet, sometimes even billboards and posters. Maybe you’ve seen it too? Here’s the story behind it.</p>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/hackathon.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In 2017 I was working on React Native team. We were friends with all other developer experience teams around Facebook. One of them worked on <a href="https://nuclide.io/">Nuclide</a> (RIP), a set of plugins for Atom editor turning it into multi-platform IDE. Nuclide struggled with adoption outside Facebook walls.</p>
<p>Around that time, Unsplash was becoming very popular. They were the first to provide high quality stock photos for free (very bold strategy for its time). Their photos were spreading like a wildfire.</p>
<p>So I had this “genius” idea: make a photo of MacBook Pro with Atom/Nuclide running on it, upload it to Unsplash and get programming blog posts use it as their cover photo (for free). People will notice a cool looking editor and will start asking “what is it?”, eventually finding Nuclide (now you know why I’m not working in marketing).</p>
<p>I took my old Canon 6D to the office and we did a photoshoot. I uploaded the picture (along with others from my Lightroom collection, to make it less sketchy).</p>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/nuclide.jpg" alt="Nuclide/Atom on MacBook Pro"></p>
<p>The plan didn’t work. The image got some downloads, but not much. It was lost in a sea of similar pictures. A year later, Facebook gave up on Nuclide and marketing efforts became irrelevant.</p>
<p>However, one thing came out of this process I did not expect.</p>
<p>Together with the Nuclide photo, I uploaded a picture I took that year in Ukraine. I was a judge at <a href="https://www.devchallenge.it/">DevChallenge</a> hackathon in Kyiv, and during the break I snapped a few photos with a wide 24mm lens. I really liked how concentrated everyone was, staff members walking the rows, the uniformity, lighting, stickers on the notebooks. I don’t think the photo was very good by photography standards, but I loved the spirit of that place and wanted to capture it.</p>
<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/hackathon_lightroom.png" alt="Other pictures from that hackathon in Kyiv"></p>
<p>During the uploading process Unsplash asked if I wanted to submit my pictures to their first ever “Unsplash Awards” and I thought “sure why not?”.</p>
<p>I forgot about this for a while, until several months later I got an email from Unspash notifying me that I won <a href="https://awards.unsplash.com/2017/#/tech-and-business">“Unsplash Awards 2017” in “Tech and business”</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a way, Alex’s photo captures a reflection of modern life: staring at a screen. Our lives, especially in our twenties, feels like a competition. From school, to university, to getting a job and progressing through our careers – it’s a never ending competition. The photo draws your eyes out across the rows of workers, all seemingly identical – but at the same time, showing small hints of color and personality from every worker that highlight and humanizes their unique history and personality. It makes me think of 20 years from now, what technology will be ubiquitous.
– Niv Dror, ProductHunt/Angelist</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They sent me a bunch of cool prizes: PeakDesign Messenger bag, straps and clips, Moment lens for iPhone, and even a printed version of my photo.</p>
<p>Now, looking at it, I do regret not processing the picture more: the horizon line is a bit tilted, you can spot chromatic abberation, the windows are overexposed.</p>
<p>Today that picture has 57 million views and used all over the internet. It even ended up on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21010674">Hacker News</a> with the classic “It looks like a sweatshop” and “exact type of workplace I wouldn’t want anyone to end up” comments.</p>
<p>Conclusions? None, I guess. I just love how a stream of random events brought this to life.</p>
