<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Some sad news to report on the blog this week. I got word that long-time Industrial Designer at Atari coin-operated division, Mike Jang, has passed away.</p>



<p>I’ve known Mike since 2016, and whilst we never met, he was always on the other end of an email answering my questions and providing really valuable input into my articles here on the blog, and especially so for my book <em>Missile Commander</em>. Mike has always been approachable and happy to share his knowledge and deep insight into the industrial design processes at Atari.</p>



<p>Learning his craft at San Jose State University, Mike joined Atari’s Industrial Design team during the mid 70s and remained there through the eighties. This meant he was fortunate enough to witness the explosion of Atari’s fortunes right through the Golden Age of arcade videogaming. He was right there in the engine room of Atari contributing to the coin-op division’s game output. </p>



<p>As an Industrial Designer, his main role was to refine the ergonomics of arcade cabinets – he was a big advocate of making sure that the physical interface players used to interact with Atari’s game cabinets was just right; and if that meant bespoke controls, parts and mouldings were required, then he would push the company to make it happen. He brought his own artistic flair to his design work, creating some of the most iconic cabinets from the era.</p>

I believe that was an unreleased kiosk of some kind, intended for installation at MacDonald’s outlets across the USA. The project never came to fruition</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>It is very easy to take for granted some of Atari’s cabinet design choices, but all were deeply thought through by Mike and his team, extensively tested and then produced – mostly in-house – resulting in the most varied portfolio of arcade cabinets ever produced by one manufacturer. Atari were the industry leaders in this regard by a country mile. Mike’s work was extensive and he was responsible for many of Atari’s patents, made in his name.</p>



<p>This picture was taken in 1981. Mike is captured here discussing the design of Atari’s <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> cabinet with colleague Dave Cook:</p>

<p>I documented in my book the extensive work that Mike put into the original design of the <em>Missile Command</em> prototype cabinet. He had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arcade games were pre-CAD so we drew up the cabinet with drafting tables, pencil, and paper. Each piece of wood or plastic was drawn and sent to the engineering woodshop to be built. Metal parts went to another in house shop. Everything was done inside our building so as to keep the game secret from the competition.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The first main goal is to build a game that is put out for testing. Usually only one was built since one never knew if it will make mega bucks or no bucks. If the first test goes good, we might build and test more. That was a sales and marketing call. If it tested good, there would be a big push to go into production as soon as possible. Reason being, unscrupulous companies would spot a game on test and start making their own illegal copies. It’s better to get the game out and sell as many as possible before the copiers showed up. That was more cost effective than going to court and sue.</p>

<p>When the original <em>Missile Command</em> cabinet came back from testing with negative feedback about the large marquee, he went back to his design sketch and made a pretty dramatic change:</p>

Notice the new red lines on this cabinet draft, outlining the proposed shape of the production version of Missile Command that we are familiar with today</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As you can see, a key part of Mikes job, was to provide solutions to problems arising from creating arcade cabinets, testing hardware, either internally or out in the field, inevitably creates issues that will need fixing, requiring the industrial design team to go back to the drawing board to amend their initial creations. This would be a pretty thankless task as you can imagine, but Mike was happy to oblige most requests.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I didn’t interact with Mike Jang a great deal, but when I was doing temperature testing of the games and found the temperature inside was too high Mike didn’t have a problem putting in a vent, sometimes an extra vent, and sometimes a fan.</p>

<p>Here are some more cabinet designs that Mike was responsible for during his time at Atari:</p>

<p>I spoke to Mike about his work on the <em>Star Wars</em> cabinet, and he had this to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I started the concepts for the Star Wars cabinet and later another designer did more detailed work on the plastic part in front of the monitor. One of the main elements I sketched up were the hydraulic ram shapes on the plastic parts. Those rams were often seen in the movie, especially the ramp to the Millennium Falcon. Also I wanted to continue the mechanical theme by adding that truss style design to the sides of the roof. I was concerned because that was a particle board part that was cut with an angled router bit. Then the bare particle board was just painted black. I was worried about the wood texture appearance but nobody noticed after everything else was put in place.</p>

The final production cabinet remained pretty true to this sketch. This was the cabinet that Mike travelled to Atari Ireland to oversee during early production for the European market. “I went with Dave Cook to Ireland, we both had a project starting in the Ireland factory. So we were sent to solve any problems that might come up. They were sent the paper printouts of the cabinet parts to be made. We visited the wood shop that was building the first proto RoadBlaster. The cabinet looked great so we had no problems there”</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Another two games that spring to mind are <em>Firefox</em>, where Mike was responsible for the control panel design, and <em>Hydra </em>which used one of Mike’s full cabinet sketches. </p>



<p>His full discography of arcade cabinet design is too extensive to cover here, but his work spanned almost two decades and was extremely varied as you can see. </p>



<p>Post Atari, Mike was big on Hot Rodding and took his design skills to mock up car designs. Here is his 1951 Mercury coupe that he acquired in 1989 and spent many hours meticulously customising. He still owned this car right up to his passing:</p>

<p>Arcadeblogger.com is a richer experience thanks to Mike’s input over the years, and my book would be a lesser tome were it not for Mike’s unique perspective and detail on the events leading up to, and after, the creation of the prototype <em>Missile Command</em> cabinet.</p>

<p>Although Mike is no longer with us, his design legacy does live on in some of the fantastic looking arcade hardware he created – have a look out for these machines next time you’re at an arcade, and raise a glass when you play.</p>



<p>One of the things that Mike did recently, was to donate all of his old Atari documents for archiving at Stanford University. The <em><a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12357521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Jang collection of Atari materials, 1978-1991</a></em> can be accessed and viewed by researchers for years to come, which is great news.</p>



<p>Mike I’m sure will be deeply missed by his Atari colleagues, who speak very highly of him as a designer, but also a friend and person; and based on my interactions with him, I would absolutely echo those sentiments here and send condolences to his family and friends.</p>



<p>I hope in a small way, this tribute highlights some of Mike’s superb work.</p>



<p>See you next time.</p>

</a>

Here is a short timeline to put things into perspective:

</p><ul>

  <li>On 2017, the development stopped.</li>
  <li>On 2019, the last email from Jorge Arellano Cid, the lead
    developer of Dillo,
    <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/dillo/c/UQ1nWyMa3yo/m/07qhu9KqAgAJ">was
      recorded by the mailing list</a>.</li>
  <li>On 2022, the domain <code>dillo.org</code> <a href="https://dillo-browser.github.io/dillo.org.html">was
      lost</a>.</li>
  <li>On 2024, an
    <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38847613">attempt to
      resurrect the project</a> began by Rodrigo
    Arias Mallo.</li>
</ul>

<p>This release contains a lot of changes accumulated from the 2015-2017 period,

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>A</span> cloak of silence has descended over the recent whistleblower lawsuit <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/myvmgloeovr/Hanna%20v%20ADA%20complaint%2011-15.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">claiming</a> that the American Diabetes Association, or ADA, accepted corporate money in return for recommending recipes that threatened the health of people with diabetes.</p><figure id="5390fdfd-4665-4d83-8f5d-ac34830da37a" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:1,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Study: ‘gamechanger’ diabetes drugs cost up to 400 times more than needed&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;5390fdfd-4665-4d83-8f5d-ac34830da37a&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2024/mar/28/drug-companies-diabetes-drugs-medicines-ozempic-trulicity&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>Elizabeth Hanna, the ex-ADA chief nutritionist who alleged that her former employer fired her over her refusal to endorse Splenda-filled salads, has quietly settled her case. In a statement to the Guardian, Hanna’s attorney, Lauren Davis, said that “the matter has been resolved”. No details were provided either by Davis or by a spokesperson for the ADA, which declined to comment.</p><p>For Hanna, accepting a settlement from the ADA was no doubt a simpler and less stressful and risky alternative to a trial, but for me and the country’s other 38 million people with diabetes, it is a letdown. What a great opportunity a trial would have been to expose the inner workings of the ADA, the patient advocacy organization up to its eyeballs in big-business funding.</p><p>I recently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/18/splenda-diabetes-lawsuit" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a> about Hanna’s lawsuit as part of our series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/series/death-by-diabetes--america-s-preventable-epidemic" data-link-name="in body link">Death by Diabetes: America’s Preventable Epidemic</a>. My view is that diabetes is an urgent national scandal. Over 100 million Americans have diabetes or prediabetes, and 100,000 die from the condition annually. In addition, every year hundreds of thousands of people with diabetes have limbs amputated or suffer blindness or kidney disease. Diabetes costs our country $400bn annually to treat.</p><p>And although type-2 diabetes is often reversible through a low-carbohydrate diet, the ADA and the pharmaceutical industry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/apr/17/ada-american-diabetes-association-big-pharma" data-link-name="in body link">don’t seem</a> very interested in acknowledging that. Instead, they promote a laundry list of corporate deals and pharmaceutical treatments that have failed to stem the disease’s lethal and expensive impact on American life.</p><p>Hanna’s complaint, filed last year in a New Jersey court, alleged a litany of wrongdoings by one of the country’s most powerful patient advocacy organizations. Hanna said that ADA higher-ups pressured her to approve recipes that included generous helpings of the artificial sweetener Splenda, despite research published in the ADA’s own scientific journal <a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/46/9/1681/153434/Artificial-Sweeteners-and-Risk-of-Type-2-Diabetes" data-link-name="in body link">finding</a> that artificial sweeteners may raise consumers’ risk of type-2 diabetes.</p><p>Hanna further alleged that the pressure was the result of a $1m contribution made to the ADA by Heartland Food Products Group. Finally, she said the ADA was a revolving door of nutrition directors, with seven leaders coming and going over the past four years – largely because, she asserted, her predecessors “were either terminated by the ADA when they refused to comply with the ADA’s unethical and unlawful practices or were constructively terminated by the ADA by the abusive and hostile work environment they faced for refusing to comply”.</p><p>The ADA rejects the allegations in the lawsuit. The Heartland Food Products Group, which was not named in the lawsuit, has also said that it rejects any allegations of wrongdoing, and indicated it would continue working with the ADA. “Heartland will continue to support the ADA and honorably provide recipes and educational information to help people successfully reduce sugar levels and live happier and healthier lives,” Heartland said in a statement.</p><p>By settling, the ADA manages to avoid the discovery process, and the potentially embarrassing revelations that might have come with it.</p><p>Hanna’s lawyers appear to have grasped the implications of her lawsuit, and originally suggested her quest could take on heroic dimensions. “Hanna’s story could be the next movie that Americans need to see to understand what is going on behind closed doors between major for-profit corporations and the not-for-profit health sector,” they wrote in their legal complaint.</p><p>Although she chose to settle with the ADA, in reality Hanna has already performed a giant public service. Her <a href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/myvmgloeovr/Hanna%20v%20ADA%20complaint%2011-15.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">legal complaint</a> is a public document open for the ADA’s board of directors, clinicians across the US and the world, and members of Congress to read. Her meticulous account depicts the world’s most important diabetes patient advocacy organization as a cynical fund-raising machine, anxious to please its corporate overlords at the expense of the millions of people with diabetes it is supposed to be trying to help.</p><p>“The defendant’s conduct shows that they were party to a scheme to defraud the American people by approving and endorsing recipes submitted by Splenda to be lauded by the ADA as a healthy choice for people with diabetes, when the ADA knew that those recipes were contrary to the ADA’s guidelines and well-established and emerging scientific principles,” the complaint reads.</p><p>In case you’re curious, the ADA and Splenda appear to be still at it. As I write this, the ADA’s Diabetes Food Hub web page still <a href="https://www.diabetesfoodhub.org/search-results.html?banners=5&amp;keywords=splenda&amp;per_page=32" data-link-name="in body link">features</a> no fewer than 203 recipes – some marked “sponsored”, some not – that include Splenda, whose parent company’s $1m contribution has brought to light the utter insanity of our diabetes epidemic.</p><p>Isn’t it long overdue for the ADA’s board to act?</p><ul>

<p dir="auto">Verus is a tool for verifying the correctness of code written in Rust.
Developers write specifications of what their code should do,
and Verus statically checks that the executable Rust code will always
satisfy the specifications for all possible executions of the code.
Rather than adding run-time checks, Verus instead relies on powerful solvers to
prove the code is correct.  Verus currently supports a subset of Rust (which we
are working to expand), and in some cases, it allows developers to go beyond
the standard Rust type system and statically check the correctness of code
that, for example, manipulates raw pointers.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/spotifys-getting-serious-about-its-enterprise-and-dev-tools-business-play/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/30/spotifys-getting-serious-about-its-enterprise-and-dev-tools-business-play/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40258315">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>You know that</span> mildly jarring experience whenever that well-known celebrity shows up in an entirely different context — e.g. a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/musicians-horror-movies-best-roles-8539942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">musician making a horror flick cameo</a>; an <a href="https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/05/28/entourage-tom-brady-manning-brothers-jerry-ferrara-cameo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL player rearing their head</a> in a comedy series; or a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/city-news/kevin-bacon-helps-telecoms-giant-2998642" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hollywood movie icon selling mobile phone plans</a> on TV? Well, it’s starting to feel like that with Spotify’s foray into the enterprise and developer tooling space — nothing wrong with it per se, but it makes you flinch just a little due to its divergence from the norm.</p>
<p>What we’re talking about is <a href="https://backstage.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-mrf-link="https://backstage.io/">Backstage</a>, a platform and framework Spotify introduced internally in 2016 to bring order to its developer infrastructure. Backstage powers customizable “developer portals” that combine tooling, apps, data, services, APIs and documents in a single interface. Want to monitor Kubernetes, check your CI/CD status or track security incidents? Backstage to the rescue.</p>
<p>Lots of companies construct their own internal systems to help developers work more efficiently. And lots of companies release such systems to the public via an open source license to spur wider adoption, <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Spotify did with Backstage in 2020</a>. But it’s highly unusual for a consumer technology company to actively monetize this side of its business, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/15/spotifys-plan-to-monetize-its-open-source-backstage-developer-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify has been doing since 2022</a>.</p>
<p>Now, Spotify is leaning even further into this play with the launch of a new suite of products and services designed to make Backstage the de facto developer portal platform for the software development industry.</p>

<h2>Modular</h2>
<p>Backstage is built on a modular, plug-in based architecture that allows engineers to layer-up their developer portal to meet their own needs. There is already a thriving <a href="https://backstage.io/plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">marketplace for Backstage plug-ins</a>, some developed by Spotify itself and some by the wider community, including developers from Red Hat and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — AWS, for example, <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/backstage-plugins-for-aws/tree/main/plugins/ecs#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has developed a plug-in</a> to make data from Amazon Elastic Container Service (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ECS</a>) available in Backstage.</p>
<p>Since late 2022, Spotify has been selling a handful of premium plug-ins as a subscription, such as <a href="https://backstage.spotify.com/marketplace/spotify/plugin/insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Backstage Insights</a>, which serves up data related to Backstage usage across an organization, including which plugins they’re engaging with most.</p>

<p>The open source Backstage project <a href="https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been adopted internally</a> by some of the world’s most well-known companies, including LinkedIn, Twilio, American Airlines, Unity, Splunk, Ikea, HP and more than 3,000 organizations. But as with just about any open source project, the main issue with Backstage is the complexity involved in getting set up — lots of integrations, configurations and figuring out how it all glues together.</p>
<p>Thus, Spotify is now introducing an out-the-box version of the open source project called Spotify Portal, available in beta from today, which is pitched as a “full-featured, low-/no-code internal developer portal (IDP)” built atop Backstage.</p>
<div id="attachment_2698332"><p><img decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2698332" src="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png" alt="Spotify Portal" width="1024" height="622" srcset="https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png 1370w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png?resize=150,91 150w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png?resize=300,182 300w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png?resize=768,466 768w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png?resize=680,413 680w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png?resize=1200,729 1200w, https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Portal-is-ready-for-you-e1714481557503.png?resize=50,30 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-2698332">Spotify Portal. <strong>Image Credits:</strong> Spotify</p></div>
<p>Spotify Portal ships with quick-start tools for connecting all their internal services and libraries, replete with setup wizard for installing Portal and connecting it with a company’s GitHub and cloud provider.</p>
<p>“When you set up your IDP, typically you need to ingest a lot of software into that, because the point of the IDP is to capture your full software catalogue and map that to the user base, and there’s potentially a lot of integrations involved in,” Tyson Singer, Spotify’s head of technology and platforms, explained to TechCrunch. “And so with Spotify Portal for Backstage, we’ve basically given folks a no-code way to do that.”</p>

<h2>Getting SaaS-y?</h2>
<p>On the surface, this seems like some sort of SaaS play, similar to how a commercial company might offer a fully managed, hosted version of a popular open source product. But that isn’t quite what’s happening here — there is no hosted element to this, though that might change in the future. It’s what Singer calls “Backstage in a box,” one which is deployed within the customer’s own ecosystem either on-premises, or in their own cloud.</p>
<p>“It’s the customer who manages it,” Singer said. “What’s important from our perspective is that we’ve really focused on both reducing the startup time and the maintenance time. So that means not only is the setup and the onboarding ‘no-code,’ it’s also the maintenance where we’re reducing code. That really makes it quite easy to manage in your own particular context.”</p>
<p>However, in a follow-up question, a Spotify spokesperson clarified that Spotify Portal for Backstage is its “first step towards a managed product,” which means that it more than likely will be offered more like a SaaS service in the future. “We’ve seen a growing appetite for a more managed product that would allow us to share our expertise more directly with companies, and we want to be able to offer more in support of that need,” the spokesperson said. “Portal is our first step on that journey, but in the future, we’re going to expand our offerings as managed.”</p>
<p>In addition, Spotify is adding various enterprise support and services to the mix, which it says it has already been providing since last summer but hasn’t disclosed this until now. This includes one-on-one tech support from dedicated Backstage personnel at Spotify, and includes service-level agreements (SLAs), security reviews and incident notifications. And for those wanting to get up-and-running with Backstage in the first instance, Spotify is also offering consulting services.</p>
<h2>Spooling up</h2>
<p>In essence, Spotify is now catering to three broad category of users: the core open source project for those with the resources and technical nous to self-deploy everything; the “hybrid adopters,” which is what Spotify calls those that have some of the necessary skills but need some support along the way; and the businesses that need something a bit more oven-baked — which is where Spotify Portal enters the fray.</p>
<p>Similar to the pricing structure for its existing plugin subscriptions, which are charged based on “individual customer parameters” such as usage and capacity, the new Portal and enterprise services don’t come with up-front costs.</p>
<p>“For pricing, we are referring customers back to our sales organization,” Singer said. “It’s custom pricing.”</p>
<p>Given this transition to an enterprise-focused developer tools company, Spotify is also having to staff-up accordingly, though Singer wouldn’t share how many people it would be hiring or allocating to these new support roles.</p>
<p>“We are changing how we go forward with both our sales organization and support,” Singer said. “So we’re shifting more focus towards how can we support customers in their initial journey and then also, once they’ve got it set up, their ongoing journey because we do want to be able to support them to get to value as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>All this, it seems, is just the tip of the iceberg as far as Spotify’s developer tooling shift is concerned. The company is adding new features to some of its existing premium plug-ins, and it’s adding more plug-ins to the mix, too. One of these is the “data experience” plug-in, which makes it easier to add individual data entities to a software catalog — this includes built-in “ingestors” to scoop metadata from external data platforms, and make this available across Backstage.</p>
<p>Last year, Spotify <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/spotify-introduces-new-product-to-help-software-development-teams-with-with-a-b-testing/">also teased a totally separate&nbsp;product</a> for software development teams called <a href="https://confidence.spotify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Confidence</a>, which is like an A/B experimentation platform based on one of its own internal tools. For now, that remains a beta product, but Singer says that it’s “all systems go” as it readies things for prime-time in the future.</p>
<p>“We are super happy with the feedback that we’ve been getting from our [Confidence] beta customers so far,” Singer said. “We built out an experimentation platform that is broad and deep, covering a tremendous amount of use cases covering everything from your typical A/B testing on a user surface, to being able to do that across all of our ML [machine learning] use cases. And I think that really sets it aside, as more and more companies are using ML in the same sorts of ways that we are to optimize things.<span>“</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>For the last several decades, one avenue of technological progress has towered over nearly everything else: semiconductors. Semiconductors are materials that can have their conductivity varied by many orders of magnitude, which makes it possible to selectively block and allow the flow of electrons. This property makes it possible to manufacture all sorts of electronic devices, not least of which is the digital computer.&nbsp;</p><p><span>As semiconductor technology has advanced over the past several decades, the cost and size of electronic computation has steadily fallen, making the PC, the internet, and mobile phones all possible. Today, semiconductors in the form of </span><a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/" rel="">powerful GPUs</a><span> that can perform enormous numbers of matrix multiplications are the keystone for advancing AI technology. Increasingly available computation to do enormous amounts of search and learning drives progress in things like </span><a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html" rel="">game-playing AI, computer vision, and large language models (LLMs)</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>As Moore’s Law has marched forward, transistors (an electronic switch which is the fundamental building block of integrated circuits) have gotten smaller and cheaper. In 1954, the first transistor radio, the </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna6288916" rel="">TR-1</a><span> had 4 transistors which cost $2.50 apiece ($29.03 in 2024 dollars). Today, an </span><a href="https://lanoc.org/review/cpus/8673-amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d" rel="">AMD Ryzen processor</a><span> with 9.9 billion transistors is </span><a href="https://shop-us-en.amd.com/amd-ryzen-9-7950x3d-processor/" rel="">on sale for $650</a><span>, or about $0.000000066 per transistor; in other words, since the 1950s the cost of a transistor has fallen by about a factor of 300 million.</span></p><p><span>The same shrinking and cheapening has happened for every semiconductor component. But at the same time, the facilities to manufacture them have become increasingly expensive. In the late 60s and early 70s, a semiconductor fabrication facility (or ‘fab’) cost on the order of $4 million (~$31 million in 2024 dollars). Today, a modern fab can cost $10-$20 billion or more. Intel is building a pair of fabs in Arizona which are projected to cost </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/16/inflation_has_added_50_to/" rel="">$15 billion apiece</a><span>, and Samsung’s fab in Taylor, Texas is projected to cost </span><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/16/inflation_has_added_50_to/" rel="">$25 billion</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png" width="1456" height="1109" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1109,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F36d58fee-b993-4861-a7f3-e18bb5f594a2_1600x1219.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>These enormous costs are ultimately due to the same factor that has steadily driven down the cost of semiconductors: Moore’s Law, the observation that the number of components on an integrated circuit tends to double every two years.

graphic above are the semiconductor components themselves: transistors, capacitors, resistors, diodes, and all the other parts created out of silicon to make a microchip.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-144258970" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-a-20-billion-semiconductor#footnote-2-144258970" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span> These individual components will be connected together using microscopic metal wires, the layers in the area marked BEOL (back end of line). Because of the enormous number of components in a modern electronic chip, this wiring must be routed on separate layers, which are separated by electrical insulators known as dielectrics. Intel’s current process, for instance, consists of </span><a href="https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/6720/a-look-at-intel-4-process-technology/3/" rel="">15 layers of metal wiring</a><span>. This wiring gets connected together and to the semiconductor components through holes in the layers known as ‘vias.’</span></p><p><span>Chips are made by building up this complex structure one layer at a time. Starting with a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wafer_(electronics)" rel="">wafer </a><span>of extremely pure silicon, layers of material are added, portions of the layer are removed, more material is added (or existing material is modified), and so on, until the entire structure is complete. This fabrication method is known as the </span><a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/siliconengine/invention-of-the-planar-manufacturing-process/" rel="">planar process</a><span>, and it was invented at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1959 by Jean Hoerni. It’s what makes integrated circuits, and modern computer technology, possible.</span></p><p>The process for building up the structure of a microchip can be broken down into four basic operations, repeatedly applied: layering, patterning, doping, and heat-treating.</p><h5>Layering</h5><p><span>Layering is used to add an extremely thin layer of material — as little as a </span><a href="https://patents.justia.com/patent/10199223" rel="">nanometer or less</a><span>, 1/100,000th the thickness of a human hair — to the surface of the wafer. These layers might be insulators (such as layers of silicon dioxide used to separate components), conductors (such as layers of copper wiring used to connect components) or semiconductors (such as </span><a href="https://www.mks.com/n/silicon-epitaxial-thin-films" rel="">epitaxial thin films of silicon</a><span> which form part of the semiconductor components). Depending on the step in the process and the material being used, different layering techniques might be applied.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Deposition methods have also evolved over time as features have shrunk. Current common layering methods include thermal oxidation (exposing wafers to oxygen in a furnace, which creates a thin layer of silicon dioxide on the wafer surface), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (where gaseous chemicals are brought together, depositing their reactants on the surface of the wafer) and sputtering (where a solid material is bombarded with plasma ions, causing atoms to break free and be deposited on the wafer’s surface). The small size of modern semiconductor components demands that these layering methods are capable of extreme precision; modern </span><a href="https://www.asm.com/our-technology-products/ald" rel="">atomic layer deposition</a><span> methods, for instance, are capable of creating a single layer of atoms at a time.</span></p><h5>Patterning</h5><p><span>Patterning is the process of inscribing specific patterns on the wafer, selectively removing material as needed to create electronic components. On modern semiconductors this is done using </span><em>photolithography</em><span>. A wafer is first coated with a thin layer of light-sensitive material called photoresist. Bright light of a specific wavelength is shone through a glass or quartz plate called a </span><a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/mask" rel="">mask</a><span> that has the pattern to be created on the wafer inscribed on it. A mask contains the patterns necessary for a single chip, but a wafer will contain hundreds of individual chips. To expose each one, the mask is moved back and forth over the surface of the wafer using a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepper" rel="">stepper or scanner</a><span>. The light that isn’t blocked by the mask passes through and induces a chemical reaction in the photoresist; with positive photoresist, the area exposed to light weakens and becomes soluble; with negative photoresist, the exposed area hardens while the rest of the photoresist remains soluble. In either case, the wafer will be washed after it’s exposed to light, leaving behind a hardened layer of photoresist in the pattern that needs to be applied.</span></p><p>From here, the wafer will be etched: a corrosive chemical will be applied to the wafer, eating away the material exposed by the removed photoresist and inscribing the pattern onto the wafer itself. Etching can be “wet” (by exposing the wafer to liquid chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid) or “dry” (by exposing the wafer to gasses like fluorine which have been energized into a plasma). After etching, the remaining photoresist is removed.</p><h5>Doping</h5><p><span>Doping is the process of introducing very small amounts of impurities into a semiconductor material to change its electrical conductivity. By doping silicon with a small amount of a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen" rel="">group V</a><span> element, such as phosphorus or arsenic, an n-type semiconductor with an excess of free electrons is created. By doping it with a small amount of a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group" rel="">group III</a><span> element, such as boron, a p-type semiconductor with an excess of electron holes is created. With the proper arrangement of p-type and n-type silicon, components such as transistors can be created.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png" width="800" height="315" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:315,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb27a98b-c267-4d89-a21a-aaf4ede68081_800x315.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>p and n-type semiconductors in a MOSFET, via </span><a href="https://www.mks.com/n/mosfet-physics" rel="">MKS</a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Early on, the primary method of introducing impurities in semiconductor manufacturing was diffusion: by heating the wafer up in the presence of a gas, atoms of the gas would diffuse into the wafer surface.

There are many steps in the process where the wafer is heated or cooled to obtain a specific result. Ion implantation, for instance, results in a damaged silicon crystal structure. This damage is repaired with rapid thermal annealing; thermal lamps heat the wafer to over 1,000 degrees in a matter of seconds, and then the wafer is slowly cooled, repairing the crystal structure. Heating is also used during the lithography process to “bake” and harden the liquid photoresist.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png" width="758" height="285" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:285,&quot;width&quot;:758,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7782732-d32a-49fe-a4c8-18db21a5360e_758x285.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Via Xiao 2012.</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to these four basic processes, semiconductor manufacturing involves many other supporting processes. One key supporting process is polishing: because a microchip is built up from dozens of individual layers, variations in layer thickness will propagate over time as more layers are added, causing problems if left unaddressed. To combat this, wafers are frequently polished during the fabrication process using chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) to smooth out the wafer surface. CMP is also used to fill holes created by etching, by applying a layer of material to the entire wafer and then polishing away the material above the hole.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Today, leading-edge chips require 80 or so masks, and have much more complex process flows.</span></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Once the wafer has gone through all these steps and the structure of the circuit is complete, it proceeds to assembly and packaging. This is where the wafers are cut apart into individual chips, each chip is connected to wires (and to any other chips, as with </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_packaging_(semiconductors)" rel="">advanced packaging)</a><span> and is encased in a protective coating. Packaging might be done at the semiconductor fab, or at another facility entirely.</span></p><p><span>On its own, a large number of process steps wouldn’t require $20 billion manufacturing facilities. After all, many complex manufactured goods require as many or more steps to produce.

With most manufacturing processes, even those using precision methods to produce interchangeable parts, there is a fair degree of tolerance in the process. If a part is a fraction of a millimeter too long or too short, it will still fit. If the impurity content of a metal is a tiny bit too high, the metal can still be used. If a process runs slightly too fast or too slow, the output is still usable.</p><p>In semiconductor manufacturing, allowable tolerances are whittled away to almost nothing. Making transistors a few nanometers across requires processes that are hundreds of thousands of times more accurate than conventional manufacturing. The tiniest rogue particle can short out a connection and destroy an entire chip. A few atoms in the wrong place can cause a process step to fail. Imperceptibly small amounts of impurities can irreparably damage materials.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png" width="320" height="155" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:155,&quot;width&quot;:320,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c4c1bb0-bdcf-44e5-8473-b5bc7eeb69ee_320x155.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>The history of semiconductor manufacturing is a chronicle of an endless war against these minute effects and their catastrophic impacts. Even getting semiconductor devices to work at all required paying extremely close attention to chemical concentrations and rogue impurities. When semiconductors were being researched at Bell Labs in the 1940s, mysterious component failures were eventually traced to researchers who had touched copper door knobs; the tiny number of copper atoms that migrated from the door to the workers hands was enough to ruin their work material. Early semiconductor manufacturers found that their processes were influenced by, among other things, the phase of the moon, whether workers had recently visited the bathroom, and female workers’ menstrual cycles.&nbsp;</p><p><span>And as semiconductor features have gotten smaller, the problem has only gotten more difficult. As transistors shrank, Intel found that even the most innocuous equipment change — using a slightly longer pipe or cable, for instance — could cause process disruptions to new fabs and cause months or years of lower yields. To combat this, Intel instituted a process known as </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/630771" rel="">Copy EXACTLY!</a><span> New fabs would be identical to existing fabs to the extent possible, right down to the color and brand of the paint on the walls.</span></p><p>A modern semiconductor fab must thus create a world of incredible precision and predictability. Every possible effect that might disrupt the manufacturing process, no matter how small, must be screened off, any subtle deviation hunted down and eliminated. And this control must be maintained in a mass production environment, where hundreds of thousands of wafers and millions of individual chips (each one with billions of transistors) are produced each year.</p><p>To create this environment, a modern semiconductor fab typically consists of four levels. The heart of the fab is the cleanroom level; the factory floor where the fabrication process actually takes place. Below the cleanroom is the sub-fab, one or more levels (typically two) that contain the ducts, piping, wiring, and equipment needed to support the cleanroom operations. And above the cleanroom level is an interstitial space with fans and filters used for recirculating air into the cleanroom below.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png" width="592" height="512.1517386722866" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:949,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:592,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0c47e20e-9327-4663-8d20-0e25e0d7770a_949x821.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Cross section of a fab, via Intel.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The cleanroom level contains the process tools: the individual pieces of equipment that perform the various operations discussed above.

In most modern fabs, this consists of a ceiling-mounted rail system (though some fabs, particularly older ones, may use floor-based automated guided vehicles instead). Specially designed vehicles pick up FOUPs at one process tool, and drop them off at the next one. The large number of manufacturing steps means that it can take months for a wafer to go through the entire process. This, combined with the large number of wafers a fab produces a month, means that at any given time there are tens of thousands of wafers at various points in the production process, traveling back and forth between tools or being stored waiting for their turn. Over the course of the production process a wafer will travel many miles back and forth between different production tools. Because of this, the rail transport systems must be extensive, with miles of track and hundreds or thousands of transport vehicles. And they must be carefully designed to avoid bottlenecks and allow the “traffic” to flow smoothly.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png" width="494" height="372.8939566704675" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:662,&quot;width&quot;:877,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:494,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8644465c-48b4-4f61-8b5d-da9592543fc6_877x662.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>FOUP AMHS, via Intel.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>When it arrives at the process tool, the FOUP can be connected to a special loading point, and wafers can be handled automatically within the controlled environment of the machine.

The extreme precision required means process tools are extremely sensitive to vibration (even </span><a href="https://colingordon.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/1c3689faa4a19ca805dc5950caf59edb.pdf" rel="">loud noises</a><span> can negatively affect the manufacturing process), and fabs are designed to minimize it. Fabs are typically built away from airports, rail lines, busy highways, and any other significant outside source of vibrations, and the fab supporting facilities themselves must also be designed to eliminate vibrations. (In one case, unacceptable cleanroom floor vibrations were being caused by an exhaust vent </span><a href="https://colingordon.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NOISE-CON-2019_Xiong-Sokol_final.pdf" rel="">400 feet away</a><span> from the fab building.) This extreme vibration sensitivity is exacerbated by the enormous amount of potentially vibration-generating machinery and equipment in a fab such as motors, pumps, HVAC systems, and even fluid flow in pipes.

a seismically inactive area. When this isn’t possible (such as in Taiwan or Japan), other measures might be taken, such as adding earthquake dampers or using </span><a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-tsmc-protects-itself-earthquakes/" rel="">special foundations</a><span> that </span><a href="https://www.usjpc.com/en/ourbusiness/factory.php" rel="">isolate the building</a><span> from the surrounding soil.</span></p><p><span>In addition to particles and vibrations, there are numerous other sources of interference a fab is designed to eliminate. To prevent light from accidently exposing photoresist, lithography areas often use special yellow lights that won’t expose the chemicals. Anti-static materials must be used for things like flooring to prevent the buildup of static electricity. Tools are sensitive to electromagnetic interference (even the fields from nearby power lines might cause equipment disruption), and tools must be </span><a href="https://www.exyte.net/Newsroom/News/ISCC18-Magnetic%20Field%20Interference-Eis_final.pdf" rel="">shielded</a><span> and EMF sources minimized. Fabs have backup generators and uninterruptible power supplies in case of power outages, and equipment must be designed to handle the voltage variations in utility electricity supply. (Prior to design standards that required this, it was </span><a href="https://www.epri.com/research/products/1002284" rel="">apparently common</a><span> for utility voltage variations to cause semiconductor manufacturing issues.) Temperature and humidity in the cleanroom must be maintained in a narrow range, which places further burden on the HVAC system. A fab also may be designed to be radiofrequency (RF) shielded for security purposes.</span></p><p><span>Beneath the carefully controlled conditions of the cleanroom lies the sub-fab: one or more levels of equipment needed to support the operations of the cleanroom. An EUV lithography machine, for instance, is a complex piece of equipment the size of a truck, but the cleanroom tool is only a portion of the total equipment required. Beneath the cleanroom lies the enormous CO2 laser that drives the EUV system, and the pumps required to create the vacuum within the process chamber. Many other process tools, such as ion implanters and sputtering machines, also require a vacuum, and a large fab may have </span><a href="https://www.semicontaiwan.org/sites/semicontaiwan.org/files/2022-09/13.2022%E5%B9%B4%2009%E6%9C%88%2014%E6%97%A5%EF%BC%BFInternational%20SubFAB%20Research%20Labs%20%28ISRL%29..pdf" rel="">thousands</a><span> of </span><a href="https://esg.tsmc.com/en/update/responsibleSupplyChain/caseStudy/28/index.html" rel="">vacuum pumps</a><span> in the sub-fab.</span></p><p>The sub-fab is also where many of the chemicals required for process tools are stored and routed (although some chemicals, particularly highly toxic ones, will be stored within the process tools to minimize the risk of leaks, while others will be stored outside the fab building). A semiconductor fab uses a wide variety of chemicals, ranging from nitrogen (used for purging and cleaning FOUPS and process tools), oxygen (used in oxidation furnaces and abatement equipment), argon (used in plasma reactions), hydrogen (used in EUV machine cleaning) and others. The volume of chemicals and gasses used, and the amount of exhaust generated, requires an enormous amount of piping, with some pipes reaching up to ten feet in diameter. And these chemicals must be extremely pure, in some cases 99.9999999% pure.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

such as phosphine and arsine for doping, are highly toxic. Others, such as the silane used in some CVD processes, are pyrophoric (meaning they ignite spontaneously with air.) One chemical, the chlorine trifluoride used for </span><a href="https://www.samaterials.com/chlorine-trifluoride-for-in-situ-cleaning-of-cvd-chambers.html" rel="">cleaning CVD chambers</a><span>, is so toxic and so prone to spontaneous ignition (it's capable of setting wet sand on fire) that </span><a href="https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/sand-won-t-save-you-time" rel="">some chemists refuse to work with it</a><span>. These chemicals require special handling and leak detection systems, backup power systems, and specially designed fire protection systems due to the hazard they represent.</span></p><p><span>The sub-fab also contains the exhaust systems for handling the various byproducts generated by the process tools. To prevent byproducts (particularly ammonia) from reacting with each other, several separate exhaust systems must be used. Many of the processes require abatement equipment (which will burn off any harmful byproducts) or </span><a href="https://www.mks.com/n/exhaust-gas-treatment" rel="">scrubbers</a><span> to remove hazardous material. This equipment might be mounted to the process tool itself, or be part of a centralized exhaust system.</span></p><p>In addition to chemical handling and exhaust equipment, the sub-fab contains electrical boxes, transformers, fans, air handlers, chillers, RF generators, heat exchangers, and all the other equipment needed to keep the fab tools operating. Sub-fabs are often divided into a “clean” sub-fab (where the air from the cleanroom recirculates), and a separate “dirty” or utility sub-fab below that. And while the level of control can be relaxed somewhat in the sub-fab (workers don’t need to wear bunny suits in it), variations and potential disruptions must still be minimized. Even slight changes in voltage, pressure, or vibration, or the smallest particle emitted by the piping, can negatively affect the manufacturing process.</p><p><span>Achieving this means that sub-fab equipment must be manufactured with much more stringent requirements and much tighter tolerances than in conventional manufacturing.

For modern semiconductor fabs, each new process node increases fab cost by about 30%. There are two main drivers of this increase. One is that more advanced process nodes require more expensive equipment. ASML’s EUV lithography machines, for instance, are far more expensive than the deep ultraviolet machines that they replaced. The second main cost driver is that as transistors continue to shrink, more masks and process steps are required to manufacture them. Connecting transistors together requires more layers of metal wires, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin_field-effect_transistor" rel="">FinFETS</a><span> (transistors made from “fins” that project up from the wafer’s surface) require more layering steps than the simpler transistors they replaced. (EUV, however, temporarily reversed this trend, as it made it possible to do in one mask what previously took two or more, and thus reduced the number of process steps.) More layers and more process steps means more equipment: if product A has twice the manufacturing steps as product B, it will require twice as much equipment to produce if the output level is to remain constant.</span></p><p>But there are also other cost drivers beyond these two factors. As semiconductor features have gotten smaller, the silicon wafers used to produce them have gotten larger. Chips were produced on 50 mm wafers in the 1970s, but today’s leading-edge fabs use much larger 300 mm wafers (a transition to 450mm wafers was planned but never executed), and larger wafers tend to require more expensive equipment. The switch to 300 mm wafers, for instance, necessitated much greater use of automated material handling equipment, as the wafers were too heavy to carry around in FOUPs by hand. These handling systems, in turn, required larger structures with taller cleanroom ceilings.</p><p><span>The ever-increasing cost of fabs has created a shift in the structure of the semiconductor industry. When fabs were cheaper to build, any chip producer could afford to have their own fabs. But as fab costs increased, it became more and more burdensome for manufacturers to operate cutting edge manufacturing facilities due to the high costs, and fewer manufacturers had the production volume to spread those costs over. The “efficient scale” of a 150 mm wafer fab is around 10,000 wafers a month, but for a 300 mm logic wafer fab, that jumps to 40,000 wafers. (And memory wafer fabs will be even larger, at </span><a href="https://www.asianometry.com/p/the-economics-of-tsmcs-giga-fabs" rel="">120,000 wafers per month</a><span>. Thus only a very small number of companies (currently TSMC, Samsung, and Intel) attempt to operate leading-edge nodes, and the industry has shifted to a “fabless” model where companies like Apple and Nvidia design their chips but have them manufactured by “foundries” like TSMC. By pooling the orders of many different chip companies, the foundries can achieve the scale necessary to afford cutting edge fabs.</span></p><p><span>The enormous expense of a modern semiconductor fab boils down to the intersection of two things. One is that semiconductor fabs are mass production factories, with modern “gigafabs” producing hundreds of millions of chips per year, each chip containing billions of transistors.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-144258970" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-to-build-a-20-billion-semiconductor#footnote-5-144258970" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> The second is that producing semiconductors requires almost unfathomable levels of precision. Manipulating huge volumes of matter on the atomic level, repeatedly and reliably, 24 hours a day 365 days a year, is an enormously expensive undertaking.</span></p><p><em><strong><span>For those interested in reading more about semiconductor manufacturing, a reading list of the best books and other sources I found on the topic is </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/semiconductor-fab-reading-list" rel="">available here</a><span> for paid subscribers.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like most of my generation, I was brought up on the saying: 'Satan finds some mischief for idle hands to do.' Being a highly virtuous child, I believed all that I was told, and acquired a conscience which has kept me working hard down to the present moment. But although my conscience has controlled my actions, my opinions have undergone a revolution. I think that there is far too much work done in the world, that immense harm is caused by the belief that work is virtuous, and that what needs to be preached in modern industrial countries is quite different from what always has been preached. Everyone knows the story of the traveler in Naples who saw twelve beggars lying in the sun (it was before the days of Mussolini), and offered a lira to the laziest of them. Eleven of them jumped up to claim it, so he gave it to the twelfth. this traveler was on the right lines. But in countries which do not enjoy Mediterranean sunshine idleness is more difficult, and a great public propaganda will be required to inaugurate it. I hope that, after reading the following pages, the leaders of the YMCA will start a campaign to induce good young men to do nothing. If so, I shall not have lived in vain.</p>
<p>Before advancing my own arguments for laziness, I must dispose of one which I cannot accept. Whenever a person who already has enough to live on proposes to engage in some everyday kind of job, such as school-teaching or typing, he or she is told that such conduct takes the bread out of other people's mouths, and is therefore wicked. If this argument were valid, it would only be necessary for us all to be idle in order that we should all have our mouths full of bread. What people who say such things forget is that what a man earns he usually spends, and in spending he gives employment. As long as a man spends his income, he puts just as much bread into people's mouths in spending as he takes out of other people's mouths in earning. The real villain, from this point of view, is the man who saves. If he merely puts his savings in a stocking, like the proverbial French peasant, it is obvious that they do not give employment. If he invests his savings, the matter is less obvious, and different cases arise.</p>
<p>One of the commonest things to do with savings is to lend them to some Government. In view of the fact that the bulk of the public expenditure of most civilized Governments consists in payment for past wars or preparation for future wars, the man who lends his money to a Government is in the same position as the bad men in Shakespeare who hire murderers. The net result of the man's economical habits is to increase the armed forces of the State to which he lends his savings. Obviously it would be better if he spent the money, even if he spent it in drink or gambling.</p>
<p>But, I shall be told, the case is quite different when savings are invested in industrial enterprises. When such enterprises succeed, and produce something useful, this may be conceded. In these days, however, no one will deny that most enterprises fail. That means that a large amount of human labor, which might have been devoted to producing something that could be enjoyed, was expended on producing machines which, when produced, lay idle and did no good to anyone. The man who invests his savings in a concern that goes bankrupt is therefore injuring others as well as himself. If he spent his money, say, in giving parties for his friends, they (we may hope) would get pleasure, and so would all those upon whom he spent money, such as the butcher, the baker, and the bootlegger. But if he spends it (let us say) upon laying down rails for surface card in some place where surface cars turn out not to be wanted, he has diverted a mass of labor into channels where it gives pleasure to no one. Nevertheless, when he becomes poor through failure of his investment he will be regarded as a victim of undeserved misfortune, whereas the gay spendthrift, who has spent his money philanthropically, will be despised as a fool and a frivolous person.</p>
<p>All this is only preliminary. I want to say, in all seriousness, that a great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organized diminution of work.</p>
<p>First of all: what is work? Work is of two kinds: first, altering the position of matter at or near the earth's surface relatively to other such matter; second, telling other people to do so. The first kind is unpleasant and ill paid; the second is pleasant and highly paid. The second kind is capable of indefinite extension: there are not only those who give orders, but those who give advice as to what orders should be given. Usually two opposite kinds of advice are given simultaneously by two organized bodies of men; this is called politics. The skill required for this kind of work is not knowledge of the subjects as to which advice is given, but knowledge of the art of persuasive speaking and writing, i.e. of advertising.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe, though not in America, there is a third class of men, more respected than either of the classes of workers. There are men who, through ownership of land, are able to make others pay for the privilege of being allowed to exist and to work. These landowners are idle, and I might therefore be expected to praise them. Unfortunately, their idleness is only rendered possible by the industry of others; indeed their desire for comfortable idleness is historically the source of the whole gospel of work. The last thing they have ever wished is that others should follow their example.</p>
<p>From the beginning of civilization until the Industrial Revolution, a man could, as a rule, produce by hard work little more than was required for the subsistence of himself and his family, although his wife worked at least as hard as he did, and his children added their labor as soon as they were old enough to do so. The small surplus above bare necessaries was not left to those who produced it, but was appropriated by warriors and priests. In times of famine there was no surplus; the warriors and priests, however, still secured as much as at other times, with the result that many of the workers died of hunger. This system persisted in Russia until 1917 [1], and still persists in the East; in England, in spite of the Industrial Revolution, it remained in full force throughout the Napoleonic wars, and until a hundred years ago, when the new class of manufacturers acquired power. In America, the system came to an end with the Revolution, except in the South, where it persisted until the Civil War. A system which lasted so long and ended so recently has naturally left a profound impress upon men's thoughts and opinions. Much that we take for granted about the desirability of work is derived from this system, and, being pre-industrial, is not adapted to the modern world. Modern technique has made it possible for leisure, within limits, to be not the prerogative of small privileged classes, but a right evenly distributed throughout the community. The morality of work is the morality of slaves, and the modern world has no need of slavery.</p>
<p>It is obvious that, in primitive communities, peasants, left to themselves, would not have parted with the slender surplus upon which the warriors and priests subsisted, but would have either produced less or consumed more. At first, sheer force compelled them to produce and part with the surplus. Gradually, however, it was found possible to induce many of them to accept an ethic according to which it was their duty to work hard, although part of their work went to support others in idleness. By this means the amount of compulsion required was lessened, and the expenses of government were diminished. To this day, 99 per cent of British wage-earners would be genuinely shocked if it were proposed that the King should not have a larger income than a working man. The conception of duty, speaking historically, has been a means used by the holders of power to induce others to live for the interests of their masters rather than for their own. Of course the holders of power conceal this fact from themselves by managing to believe that their interests are identical with the larger interests of humanity. Sometimes this is true; Athenian slave-owners, for instance, employed part of their leisure in making a permanent contribution to civilization which would have been impossible under a just economic system. Leisure is essential to civilization, and in former times leisure for the few was only rendered possible by the labors of the many. But their labors were valuable, not because work is good, but because leisure is good. And with modern technique it would be possible to distribute leisure justly without injury to civilization.</p>
<p>Modern technique has made it possible to diminish enormously the amount of labor required to secure the necessaries of life for everyone. This was made obvious during the war. At that time all the men in the armed forces, and all the men and women engaged in the production of munitions, all the men and women engaged in spying, war propaganda, or Government offices connected with the war, were withdrawn from productive occupations. In spite of this, the general level of well-being among unskilled wage-earners on the side of the Allies was higher than before or since. The significance of this fact was concealed by finance: borrowing made it appear as if the future was nourishing the present. But that, of course, would have been impossible; a man cannot eat a loaf of bread that does not yet exist. The war showed conclusively that, by the scientific organization of production, it is possible to keep modern populations in fair comfort on a small part of the working capacity of the modern world. If, at the end of the war, the scientific organization, which had been created in order to liberate men for fighting and munition work, had been preserved, and the hours of the week had been cut down to four, all would have been well. Instead of that the old chaos was restored, those whose work was demanded were made to work long hours, and the rest were left to starve as unemployed. Why? Because work is a duty, and a man should not receive wages in proportion to what he has produced, but in proportion to his virtue as exemplified by his industry.</p>
<p>This is the morality of the Slave State, applied in circumstances totally unlike those in which it arose. No wonder the result has been disastrous. Let us take an illustration. Suppose that, at a given moment, a certain number of people are engaged in the manufacture of pins. They make as many pins as the world needs, working (say) eight hours a day. Someone makes an invention by which the same number of men can make twice as many pins: pins are already so cheap that hardly any more will be bought at a lower price. In a sensible world, everybody concerned in the manufacturing of pins would take to working four hours instead of eight, and everything else would go on as before. But in the actual world this would be thought demoralizing. The men still work eight hours, there are too many pins, some employers go bankrupt, and half the men previously concerned in making pins are thrown out of work. There is, in the end, just as much leisure as on the other plan, but half the men are totally idle while half are still overworked. In this way, it is insured that the unavoidable leisure shall cause misery all round instead of being a universal source of happiness. Can anything more insane be imagined?</p>
<p>The idea that the poor should have leisure has always been shocking to the rich. In England, in the early nineteenth century, fifteen hours was the ordinary day's work for a man; children sometimes did as much, and very commonly did twelve hours a day. When meddlesome busybodies suggested that perhaps these hours were rather long, they were told that work kept adults from drink and children from mischief. When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say: 'What do the poor want with holidays? They ought to work.' People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much of our economic confusion.</p>
<p>Let us, for a moment, consider the ethics of work frankly, without superstition. Every human being, of necessity, consumes, in the course of his life, a certain amount of the produce of human labor. Assuming, as we may, that labor is on the whole disagreeable, it is unjust that a man should consume more than he produces. Of course he may provide services rather than commodities, like a medical man, for example; but he should provide something in return for his board and lodging. to this extent, the duty of work must be admitted, but to this extent only.</p>
<p>I shall not dwell upon the fact that, in all modern societies outside the USSR, many people escape even this minimum amount of work, namely all those who inherit money and all those who marry money. I do not think the fact that these people are allowed to be idle is nearly so harmful as the fact that wage-earners are expected to overwork or starve.</p>
<p>If the ordinary wage-earner worked four hours a day, there would be enough for everybody and no unemployment -- assuming a certain very moderate amount of sensible organization. This idea shocks the well-to-do, because they are convinced that the poor would not know how to use so much leisure. In America men often work long hours even when they are well off; such men, naturally, are indignant at the idea of leisure for wage-earners, except as the grim punishment of unemployment; in fact, they dislike leisure even for their sons. Oddly enough, while they wish their sons to work so hard as to have no time to be civilized, they do not mind their wives and daughters having no work at all. the snobbish admiration of uselessness, which, in an aristocratic society, extends to both sexes, is, under a plutocracy, confined to women; this, however, does not make it any more in agreement with common sense.</p>
<p>The wise use of leisure, it must be conceded, is a product of civilization and education. A man who has worked long hours all his life will become bored if he becomes suddenly idle. But without a considerable amount of leisure a man is cut off from many of the best things. There is no longer any reason why the bulk of the population should suffer this deprivation; only a foolish asceticism, usually vicarious, makes us continue to insist on work in excessive quantities now that the need no longer exists.</p>
<p>In the new creed which controls the government of Russia, while there is much that is very different from the traditional teaching of the West, there are some things that are quite unchanged. The attitude of the governing classes, and especially of those who conduct educational propaganda, on the subject of the dignity of labor, is almost exactly that which the governing classes of the world have always preached to what were called the 'honest poor'. Industry, sobriety, willingness to work long hours for distant advantages, even submissiveness to authority, all these reappear; moreover authority still represents the will of the Ruler of the Universe, Who, however, is now called by a new name, Dialectical Materialism.</p>
<p>The victory of the proletariat in Russia has some points in common with the victory of the feminists in some other countries. For ages, men had conceded the superior saintliness of women, and had consoled women for their inferiority by maintaining that saintliness is more desirable than power. At last the feminists decided that they would have both, since the pioneers among them believed all that the men had told them about the desirability of virtue, but not what they had told them about the worthlessness of political power. A similar thing has happened in Russia as regards manual work. For ages, the rich and their sycophants have written in praise of 'honest toil', have praised the simple life, have professed a religion which teaches that the poor are much more likely to go to heaven than the rich, and in general have tried to make manual workers believe that there is some special nobility about altering the position of matter in space, just as men tried to make women believe that they derived some special nobility from their sexual enslavement. In Russia, all this teaching about the excellence of manual work has been taken seriously, with the result that the manual worker is more honored than anyone else. What are, in essence, revivalist appeals are made, but not for the old purposes: they are made to secure shock workers for special tasks. Manual work is the ideal which is held before the young, and is the basis of all ethical teaching.</p>
<p>For the present, possibly, this is all to the good. A large country, full of natural resources, awaits development, and has has to be developed with very little use of credit. In these circumstances, hard work is necessary, and is likely to bring a great reward. But what will happen when the point has been reached where everybody could be comfortable without working long hours?</p>
<p>In the West, we have various ways of dealing with this problem. We have no attempt at economic justice, so that a large proportion of the total produce goes to a small minority of the population, many of whom do no work at all. Owing to the absence of any central control over production, we produce hosts of things that are not wanted. We keep a large percentage of the working population idle, because we can dispense with their labor by making the others overwork. When all these methods prove inadequate, we have a war: we cause a number of people to manufacture high explosives, and a number of others to explode them, as if we were children who had just discovered fireworks. By a combination of all these devices we manage, though with difficulty, to keep alive the notion that a great deal of severe manual work must be the lot of the average man.</p>
<p>In Russia, owing to more economic justice and central control over production, the problem will have to be differently solved. the rational solution would be, as soon as the necessaries and elementary comforts can be provided for all, to reduce the hours of labor gradually, allowing a popular vote to decide, at each stage, whether more leisure or more goods were to be preferred. But, having taught the supreme virtue of hard work, it is difficult to see how the authorities can aim at a paradise in which there will be much leisure and little work. It seems more likely that they will find continually fresh schemes, by which present leisure is to be sacrificed to future productivity. I read recently of an ingenious plan put forward by Russian engineers, for making the White Sea and the northern coasts of Siberia warm, by putting a dam across the Kara Sea. An admirable project, but liable to postpone proletarian comfort for a generation, while the nobility of toil is being displayed amid the ice-fields and snowstorms of the Arctic Ocean. This sort of thing, if it happens, will be the result of regarding the virtue of hard work as an end in itself, rather than as a means to a state of affairs in which it is no longer needed.</p>
<p>The fact is that moving matter about, while a certain amount of it is necessary to our existence, is emphatically not one of the ends of human life. If it were, we should have to consider every navvy superior to Shakespeare. We have been misled in this matter by two causes. One is the necessity of keeping the poor contented, which has led the rich, for thousands of years, to preach the dignity of labor, while taking care themselves to remain undignified in this respect. The other is the new pleasure in mechanism, which makes us delight in the astonishingly clever changes that we can produce on the earth's surface. Neither of these motives makes any great appeal to the actual worker. If you ask him what he thinks the best part of his life, he is not likely to say: 'I enjoy manual work because it makes me feel that I am fulfilling man's noblest task, and because I like to think how much man can transform his planet. It is true that my body demands periods of rest, which I have to fill in as best I may, but I am never so happy as when the morning comes and I can return to the toil from which my contentment springs.' I have never heard working men say this sort of thing. They consider work, as it should be considered, a necessary means to a livelihood, and it is from their leisure that they derive whatever happiness they may enjoy.</p>
<p>It will be said that, while a little leisure is pleasant, men would not know how to fill their days if they had only four hours of work out of the twenty-four. In so far as this is true in the modern world, it is a condemnation of our civilization; it would not have been true at any earlier period. There was formerly a capacity for light-heartedness and play which has been to some extent inhibited by the cult of efficiency. The modern man thinks that everything ought to be done for the sake of something else, and never for its own sake. Serious-minded persons, for example, are continually condemning the habit of going to the cinema, and telling us that it leads the young into crime. But all the work that goes to producing a cinema is respectable, because it is work, and because it brings a money profit. The notion that the desirable activities are those that bring a profit has made everything topsy-turvy. The butcher who provides you with meat and the baker who provides you with bread are praiseworthy, because they are making money; but when you enjoy the food they have provided, you are merely frivolous, unless you eat only to get strength for your work. Broadly speaking, it is held that getting money is good and spending money is bad. Seeing that they are two sides of one transaction, this is absurd; one might as well maintain that keys are good, but keyholes are bad. Whatever merit there may be in the production of goods must be entirely derivative from the advantage to be obtained by consuming them. The individual, in our society, works for profit; but the social purpose of his work lies in the consumption of what he produces. It is this divorce between the individual and the social purpose of production that makes it so difficult for men to think clearly in a world in which profit-making is the incentive to industry. We think too much of production, and too little of consumption. One result is that we attach too little importance to enjoyment and simple happiness, and that we do not judge production by the pleasure that it gives to the consumer.</p>
<p>When I suggest that working hours should be reduced to four, I am not meaning to imply that all the remaining time should necessarily be spent in pure frivolity. I mean that four hours' work a day should entitle a man to the necessities and elementary comforts of life, and that the rest of his time should be his to use as he might see fit. It is an essential part of any such social system that education should be carried further than it usually is at present, and should aim, in part, at providing tastes which would enable a man to use leisure intelligently. I am not thinking mainly of the sort of things that would be considered 'highbrow'. Peasant dances have died out except in remote rural areas, but the impulses which caused them to be cultivated must still exist in human nature. The pleasures of urban populations have become mainly passive: seeing cinemas, watching football matches, listening to the radio, and so on. This results from the fact that their active energies are fully taken up with work; if they had more leisure, they would again enjoy pleasures in which they took an active part.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a small leisure class and a larger working class. The leisure class enjoyed advantages for which there was no basis in social justice; this necessarily made it oppressive, limited its sympathies, and caused it to invent theories by which to justify its privileges. These facts greatly diminished its excellence, but in spite of this drawback it contributed nearly the whole of what we call civilization. It cultivated the arts and discovered the sciences; it wrote the books, invented the philosophies, and refined social relations. Even the liberation of the oppressed has usually been inaugurated from above. Without the leisure class, mankind would never have emerged from barbarism.</p>
<p>The method of a leisure class without duties was, however, extraordinarily wasteful. None of the members of the class had to be taught to be industrious, and the class as a whole was not exceptionally intelligent. The class might produce one Darwin, but against him had to be set tens of thousands of country gentlemen who never thought of anything more intelligent than fox-hunting and punishing poachers. At present, the universities are supposed to provide, in a more systematic way, what the leisure class provided accidentally and as a by-product. This is a great improvement, but it has certain drawbacks. University life is so different from life in the world at large that men who live in academic milieu tend to be unaware of the preoccupations and problems of ordinary men and women; moreover their ways of expressing themselves are usually such as to rob their opinions of the influence that they ought to have upon the general public. Another disadvantage is that in universities studies are organized, and the man who thinks of some original line of research is likely to be discouraged. Academic institutions, therefore, useful as they are, are not adequate guardians of the interests of civilization in a world where everyone outside their walls is too busy for unutilitarian pursuits.</p>
<p>In a world where no one is compelled to work more than four hours a day, every person possessed of scientific curiosity will be able to indulge it, and every painter will be able to paint without starving, however excellent his pictures may be. Young writers will not be obliged to draw attention to themselves by sensational pot-boilers, with a view to acquiring the economic independence needed for monumental works, for which, when the time at last comes, they will have lost the taste and capacity. Men who, in their professional work, have become interested in some phase of economics or government, will be able to develop their ideas without the academic detachment that makes the work of university economists often seem lacking in reality. Medical men will have the time to learn about the progress of medicine, teachers will not be exasperatedly struggling to teach by routine methods things which they learnt in their youth, which may, in the interval, have been proved to be untrue.</p>
<p>Above all, there will be happiness and joy of life, instead of frayed nerves, weariness, and dyspepsia. The work exacted will be enough to make leisure delightful, but not enough to produce exhaustion. Since men will not be tired in their spare time, they will not demand only such amusements as are passive and vapid. At least one per cent will probably devote the time not spent in professional work to pursuits of some public importance, and, since they will not depend upon these pursuits for their livelihood, their originality will be unhampered, and there will be no need to conform to the standards set by elderly pundits. But it is not only in these exceptional cases that the advantages of leisure will appear. Ordinary men and women, having the opportunity of a happy life, will become more kindly and less persecuting and less inclined to view others with suspicion. The taste for war will die out, partly for this reason, and partly because it will involve long and severe work for all. Good nature is, of all moral qualities, the one that the world needs most, and good nature is the result of ease and security, not of a life of arduous struggle. Modern methods of production have given us the possibility of ease and security for all; we have chosen, instead, to have overwork for some and starvation for others. Hitherto we have continued to be as energetic as we were before there were machines; in this we have been foolish, but there is no reason to go on being foolish forever.</p>

Lime hastens their gradual disintegration, and the remaining material, along with rainwater runoff, filters through coal and sand before it is washed out to sea.</p><p>“We are no longer able to fulfil our traditions,” Hoshang Kapadia, a Karachi resident in his 80s, said. “We’ve lost a way of life, our culture.”</p><p>Kapadia explained that the purpose behind the Parsi burial customs was to “take less and give more” to the world. “The whole idea is not to pollute the earth,” he said</p><figure id="a5ef5466-621d-4603-b779-9e88b27fe98e" data-spacefinder-role="supporting" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=380&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="An illustration of vultures gathering  on a Parsi ‘tower of silence’" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d894136fc4c3ed22216553bdbce9daabf40fcb07/0_0_4781_3759/master/4781.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="349.87554904831626" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Vultures gather on a Parsi ‘tower of silence’, circa 1880.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>This article is written solely in my personal capacity, and does not represent the views of any organisations I am affiliated with.</em></p><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Contact forms are almost always worse for users than just putting an email on your website. I explore why they’re terrible, why you’ve done it anyway, and what to do about it.</p>

<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-completely-broken">Your contact form is completely broken</h3>
<p>It’s remarkable how many contact forms are just straight-up broken. A WordPress upgrade here, a change to your CRM there, and your contact form silently breaks.</p>
<p>At time of writing, B&amp;Q’s contact form just plainly doesn’t work<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>. I am fairly amazed that a retailer with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%26Q">revenues in the billions</a> doesn’t notice written queries have stopped coming in.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/bandq.png" alt="B&amp;Q Contact form, with an error box saying 'Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.'"></p>
<p>(as a side note: your form should have <a href="https://wix-ux.com/when-life-gives-you-lemons-write-better-error-messages-46c5223e1a2f">better error messages</a>. The error above gives the user no way out, given that trying again would not help)</p>
<p>This is not an isolated incident. I’ve been stung by broken contact forms on all kinds of websites, from many other big and small organisations. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38554522">AWS’s abuse contact form has been broken for months</a>. And here’s a particularly gnarly example from <a href="https://www.elastoplast.co.uk/pages/contact">Elastoplast</a>, one of the largest plaster brands in the UK:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/elastoplast.png" alt="Elastoplast contact form with a very long error message that looks like a stacktrace displayed, beginning 'CrmApi.Client.Common.HttpStatusException: Failed with status InternalServerError...'"></p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-broken-for-some-users">Your contact form is broken for some users</h3>
<p>Axa, an insurer with almost <a href="https://www.axa-im.com/who-we-are/axa-im-numbers">a trillion euros of assets under management</a>, offers <a href="https://customer.axa.co.uk/contact/email-general/">a contact form</a> that looks like it’s time travelled from the early 2000s. Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like that time has made it work better: it incorrectly rejects some valid emails<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> and doesn’t show all the relevant Axa products.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/axa.png" alt="AXA's contact form, showing the email test+test@example.com being rejected, and listing only four insurance products in the dropdown"></p>
<p>Vodafone, a major UK mobile network, has <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/webcenter/portal/myvodafone/lostandstolen">a form to report devices lost and stolen</a>. However, their site is frequently unavailable for maintenance overnight. I can’t imagine how frustrating having a phone stolen, only to try to report it and be presented with this:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/vodafone.png" alt="A page with Vodafone branding saying 'Sorry, we're down for schduled maintenance right now'"></p>
<p>Finally, a lot of contact forms do not meet basic web accessibility standards, making it hard for assistive technology users to properly complete them. For example, <a href="https://www.virginmedia.com/help/virgin-mobile-complaint">Virgin Mobile’s complaint page</a> is nearly unnavigable by keyboard due to hiding any kind of selection indicators.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-takes-ages-to-fill-out">Your contact form takes ages to fill out</h3>
<p>I’m not sure how it’s been achieved, but the <a href="https://forms.charitycommission.gov.uk/Complaints-to-the-Charity-Commission-for-England-and-Wales/">UK’s Charity Commission’s complaints form</a> takes about 6-7 seconds to load every single page! It offers no indication of progress, and you have to get through 11 pages to complete it.</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/cc-slow.png" alt="The Chrome network tab, showing a request taking 6.85 seconds"></p>
<p>At this rate, you spend <strong>75 seconds</strong> just waiting for pages in the form to load.</p>
<p>And that’s not including the time to answer the questions asked - or even processing some of them. Don’t worry, you’ll get to review each one carefully because none of them have <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete">autocomplete attributes</a> set.</p>
<p>You’ll also have to read through all the options in this monstrosity of a dropdown - which is helpfully not grouped or sorted in any coherent way:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/cc-dropdown.png" alt="A dropdown with 28 options such as 'Trustee', 'Employee', 'Press/Media', 'Donor', 'Auditor', 'PHSO', 'Umbrella Organisation' and 'Other'"></p>
<p>(Additionally, this question doesn’t make sense to ask in the first place. The complaint is about a service by the Charity Commission, after answering ‘No’ to the question ‘Does your question or query relate to a specific registered charity?’)</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-asks-for-irrelevant-personal-information">Your contact form asks for irrelevant personal information</h3>
<p>National Grid has <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.co.uk/contact-us/contacting-national-grid-electricity-distribution/general-contact-enquiries">contact</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgrid.co.uk/contact-us/contacting-national-grid-electricity-distribution/feedback-and-compliments">feedback</a> forms.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup> I might want to give them some minor feedback like ‘hey this link on your site is broken’, however I then need to figure out whether I really want to provide all my personal details to do this - like my home address and phone number (or at least make up something that looks plausible).</p>
<p>I’ve also seen some complaints forms asking for more sensitive data, like date of birth or copies of ID documents. Sometimes this is despite them not holding this information in the first place, so they’re not comparing it to what they have on record as a security measure.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>You do need to collect some contact details, but do you really need <strong>three</strong> different contact methods to respond to some off-hand feedback? Other things you probably don’t actually need on a general contact form include <a href="https://writefulcopy.com/blog/why-title-should-not-be-a-required-field-on-online-forms">title</a>, job function, company size, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56831212">landline</a> number.</p>
<p>This unnecessarily increases the risk of my data being stolen and used for identity fraud. For less trustworthy organisations, this also directly increases the chance I get spam - so I either don’t submit the form, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/1b6up7p/does_anyone_actually_give_their_email_address/">make up data</a>.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-less-useful-for-customers">Your contact form is less useful for customers</h3>
<p>Email allows customers to create drafts, schedule messages, and easily keep a record of what’s been said. It also often integrates into their workflows more easily, for example the ability to <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7622010">snooze emails</a> to chase up on them later.</p>
<p>Your form likely doesn’t have any of these features. In fact, even if it’s fully working users often don’t get any form of confirmation they can refer back to later, let alone a confirmation that contains all the details they submitted.</p>
<p>I’m not certain there is malicious intent behind it, but I have experienced several companies ‘accidentally’ losing form submissions, only to mysteriously find them again once I pull up copies of the form I saved a screenshot of. If you’re forcing your customers to do this, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-wasting-your-resources">Your contact form is wasting your resources</h3>
<p>It takes time and energy to build and maintain a contact form properly. It almost always gets routed to an email behind the scenes (or a system that accepts email), so skip the middleman and put up the email address!</p>
<p>It also can mean that customers contacting you can’t remember what their original message was about. I’ve experienced getting a response from an organisation and then having to ask them what the original query was about - had this been an email in the first place this could have been avoided.</p>
<h3 id="your-contact-form-is-irritating-in-other-ways">Your contact form is irritating in other ways</h3>
<p>There are probably hundreds of ways you could set up your contact form to be maximally irritating, and I can’t cover them all here. I’ll leave you with one final example that doesn’t fit into the categories above though.</p>
<p>Sainsbury’s has a <a href="https://help.sainsburys.co.uk/help/contact-us">contact form</a> that forces you to navigate down a long options tree. Only to open a modal and ask you to select the topic again. They then present the tiniest form window ever, which makes it near impossible to fill out:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/sainsburys.gif" alt="Contact form displayed in a modal with limited vertical height, such that only 1-2 fields of about 20 are visible at any time"></p>
<h2 id="why-youve-done-this-and-what-to-do-instead">Why you’ve done this, and what to do instead</h2>
<p>Beyond just ‘it’s what we’ve always done’, there are a few reasons you might think a contact form is a good idea. Here we’ll go through some of them and what you might do instead.</p>
<h3 id="to-collect-structured-data-that-speeds-up-resolving-problems">To collect structured data that speeds up resolving problems</h3>
<p>You might want to use a contact form to collect structured data, so it saves you time processing requests. For example, making sure the customer provides the right identifiers for you to find them on your systems quickly, or automatically assigning queries to the right teams.</p>
<p>This <em>can</em> be okay in some circumstances. Amazon does this well: it shows you the recent items you’ve purchased and also allows you to completely self-serve common customer service workflows (like requesting a return) - while still allowing you to speak to a human fairly easily.</p>
<p>However, unless you’ve got an excellent customer service portal (you probably don’t), you should just stick with an email for general contact purposes.</p>
<p>To make sure you have the right details, just set up a sensible auto-reply. Here’s a good example from GP at hand:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/gpathand-autoreply.png" alt="An autoresponder email stating 'If you haven't already, please ensure you have provided us with your full name, postal address and a contact phone number'"></p>
<p>Next, before automating assigning queries to the right teams, consider whether you need to do this: I’ve seen very small teams try to justify ‘a contact form will help us categorise emails’ when they receive two emails a day, or they all go to the same person anyways.</p>
<p>If you really do need to automate assigning emails, take a look at platforms like <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/5608652527386-Getting-started-with-Zendesk-AI-and-Advanced-AI#h_01HH0BTYYBV6ETWHG8779M9Y8C">Zendesk and their AI systems</a> - this kind of thing is exactly what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">LLMs</a> thrive at (or often just <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions">regular expressions</a> will get you far enough).</p>
<h3 id="you-want-people-to-contact-you-and-think-your-form-will-lower-the-barrier">You want people to contact you, and think your form will lower the barrier</h3>
<p>Empirically, this doesn’t hold up. I previously thought this was true, but I’ve since seen at 3 different organisations who’ve made the switch that this doesn’t seem to be the case - i.e. they get the same number of genuine contacts by listing an email as having a contact form. I’d love to rigorously analyse and publish the data on this to help convince others.</p>
<p>One category where this might not be true by default is for very ‘low-effort’ feedback forms. I think this can probably be mitigated by making it clear that you’re friendly and would be happy to receive informal emails.</p>
<p>The other category where I think this might be more likely to lower the barrier is where people prefer to be anonymous. For example, someone who might not be public about their sexual orientation might not want to have related comments so easily linked back to them, but still want to give feedback on some article. The UK Government website, GOV.UK, has a delightfully simple example that works well for collecting anonymous feedback:</p>
<p><img src="https://adamjones.me/images/blog/dont-use-contact-forms/govuk-feedback.png" alt="Form titled 'Help us improve GOV.UK', with two questions: 'What were you doing?' and 'What went wrong?'"></p>
<h3 id="youre-worried-youll-get-spam-if-you-list-an-email-online">You’re worried you’ll get spam if you list an email online</h3>
<p>Surprisingly, not really. I found we often ended up getting <em>less</em> spam compared to WordPress forms - there might be something about it being easier to submit anonymous forms with rubbish, compared to actually sending emails with decent enough reputation to get past today's spam filters.</p>
<p>If you really worry about this, you can <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/235937/does-e-mail-address-obfuscation-actually-work">obfuscate your email from spam bots</a>. But I think this is usually wasted time given just how rare this kind of email spam is, and how good spam filters have gotten. Plus this risks you messing this up and breaking something.</p>
<h3 id="you-want-to-manage-messages-as-a-team">You want to manage messages as a team</h3>
<p>You can do this with email! Hook up a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-outlook-d94a8e9e-21f1-4240-808b-de9c9c088afd">shared mailbox</a>, <a href="https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/167430">collaborative inbox</a>, or one of the many off-the-shelf customer service solutions like <a href="https://www.zendesk.co.uk/service/ticketing-system/customer-service-email-management-software/">Zendesk</a>, <a href="https://www.zoho.com/desk/">Zoho Desk</a>, <a href="https://www.freshworks.com/freshdesk/">Freshdesk</a>, <a href="https://zammad.org/">Zammad</a>, <a href="https://osticket.com/">osTicket</a>, or <a href="https://freescout.net/">FreeScout</a> to your email.</p>
<h3 id="you-think-email-isnt-secure-enough">You think email isn’t secure enough</h3>
<p>Email used to be very insecure because it wasn’t encrypted.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-6" id="user-content-fnref-6" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup> This meant that people between mail servers could read the contents of messages.</p>
<p>However, unless you’ve done something weird with your email setup, it’ll probably be encrypted securely like <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/safer-email/overview">99% of other email traffic</a> is in 2024.</p>
<p>In theory, your customer might be using an email provider that doesn’t support encryption - which could lead them to sending something to you insecurely and putting them at risk. I think most organisations can accept this risk given how rare this is, given that this is on the customer’s end. For what it’s worth, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/organisation/ncsc">is happy to list a contact email for themselves</a>.</p>
<p>Another question to ask yourself if you don’t list an email for this reason: do you respond via email after people contact you?</p>
<h3 id="you-think-email-isnt-accessible-to-assistive-technology-users">You think email isn't accessible to assistive technology users</h3>
<p>I've heard the claim that you need a contact form to be compliant with some common accessibility standard - this is simply not true. If you don't beleive me, try and actually find this rule.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-7" id="user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Listing an email is almost certainly easier to parse and understand than your contact form.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-want-people-to-fill-in-your-form">You don't want people to fill in your form</h3>
<p>Yeah - this is one I'm not really here to help you with.</p>
<p>There are some organisations that intentionally want their form to be difficult to complete - perhaps it’s a regulatory requirement that you don’t really want to comply with. If you’re doing this, you should probably feel bad.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how intentional this is, but in this vein Meta (Facebook) makes it very difficult to contact them about data protection matters. Some charities <a href="https://noyb.eu/en/no-bullsht-opt-out-free-noyb-tool-quick-and-broad-facebook-objections">have already highlighted</a> that Meta’s forms seem to be particularly difficult to find, and difficult to complete. My own experiences with this process have been complex and drawn out, having been referred to several different broken forms.</p>
<p>Regulators should be doing a better job ensuring they are setting the bar appropriately in these cases, in a way that rewards actors who are complying with both the letter and spirit of laws or regulations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Contact forms are hard to get right, and often just a worse experience for everyone involved. Go forth and remove your contact form and list your email on your website now!</p>
<section data-footnotes="true">

<li id="user-content-fn-1">
<p>As in, it’s impossible to submit from the website - the error appears when submitting. Inspecting the network requests suggests this error is because a ‘title’ property is missing: likely some mismatch between the backend and the frontend (there is no title field on the frontend). Yes, these problems happen in software development from time to time: but there’s no need to incur this if email already ‘just works’. <a href="#user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 1">↩</a></p>

<li id="user-content-fn-2">
<p><code>test+test@example.com</code>, <code>tést@example.com</code> and <code>test@éxample.com</code> are all valid emails as per <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6532">RFC 6532</a>, but are all rejected by this form <a href="#user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 2">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-3">
<p>As a fun side bonus, if you make a single mistake on this form it deletes everything and forces you to start from scratch. For example, if you format your phone number ‘wrong’, your entire message you typed up is wiped. <a href="#user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 3">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-4">
<p>I don't think people's birthdays should be a security measure, but unfortunately it seems to be the world we live in. I'll have to explore this in another rant. <a href="#user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 4">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-5">
<p>It could probably place this a bit more prominently by cutting some of the other stuff, but on the whole the message is fairly clear and not an unreasonable length. <a href="#user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 5">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-6">
<p>There are also other email security risks, such as email spoofing (solvable with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC">DMARC</a>!).

</li>
<li id="user-content-fn-7">
<p>Further examples that would seem to suggest that this is not necessary is that the following organisations list an email to contact them: <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/contact-us">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a> (the public body responsible for disability rights), <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/contact-us/">Scope</a> (a major disability equality charity) and <a href="https://abilitynet.org.uk/how-contact-us">AbilityNet</a> (a charity building assistive technologies). <a href="#user-content-fnref-7" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to reference 7">↩</a></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian learning model to understand the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore the optimization metric of LLMs, which is based on predicting the next token, and develop a novel model grounded in this principle. Our approach involves constructing an ideal generative text model represented by a multinomial transition probability matrix with a prior, and we examine how LLMs approximate this matrix. We discuss the continuity of the mapping between embeddings and multinomial distributions, and present the Dirichlet approximation theorem to approximate any prior. Additionally, we demonstrate how text generation by LLMs aligns with Bayesian learning principles and delve into the implications for in-context learning, specifically explaining why in-context learning emerges in larger models where prompts are considered as samples to be updated. Our findings indicate that the behavior of LLMs is consistent with Bayesian Learning, offering new insights into their functioning and potential applications.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>It was the 28th of June, 2020; the perfect summer day. I remember it distinctly because of two important events that took place on that day. The first was the unfortunate discovery that I am highly sensitive to the venomous hairs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_processionary">Oak processionary</a> caterpillar. If you’ve never wished you could use a cheese grater to remove the skin off your arms and legs just to be rid of the itching, then you can’t really understand how I felt for two whole weeks that summer.</p><p>The second thing that happened on that 28th of June was the seemingly inconsequential purchase of two secondhand bicycles. My wife and I drove out to a local park to test ride a couple of ’90s-era Trek 970 bikes that a guy had restored in his garage. We didn’t know a thing about bicycles, but we liked what we saw; the bikes worked great and felt very nice to ride around the park–the fact that I also happened to ride through a floating cloud of Oak-processionary hairs would only become apparent the next day.</p><p>So we took our new old bikes home, and we started riding them around. We got into bicycle touring too around that time, and that’s worth an entire future post on its own for the joy it’s brought us, but for now I’d like to get back on track. See, I kept thinking about the guy we bought the bikes from. I don’t know if he did this as a hobby, side business, or what, but I became increasingly fascinated by the idea of fixing up and restoring old bicycles. As I said, at that time I didn’t know a thing about bikes; I couldn’t even change a brake cable, but I’d always wanted to pick up a hobby that would take me away from the computer, something that would get my hards dirty at the same time, so why not give this a try?</p><p>Back then I still had my previous bike too, gathering dust and cobwebs somewhere in the basement. It was a Cube Aim that I’d had for at least a decade and had practically never serviced. It worked like crap, but I suspected most of it was just lack of maintenance and proper adjustment. In fact, it was in a lot of ways a nicer bike than the one I’d just bought. So I set a goal for myself: I would take the bike apart, down to the last bolt; I would clean everything up, change whatever parts were broken, and put it back together again. After all, how hard could it be?</p><p>At its core, a bike is a very simple, very old machine. The basic operating principles have remained virtually unchanged since the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle">“safety bicycle”</a> of the late 19th century: you push on the pedals to rotate a crank arm; a chain transfers the power to the rear sprockets; the sprockets turn the rear wheel. That’s it, that’s all there is to it; a wonderfully simple device that is nonetheless the single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_performance#Energy_efficiency">most energy-efficient</a> mode of transportation humanity has come up with.</p><p>Of course, modern bikes are a lot more complicated than that: inflatable tires; the freewheel; derailleurs; suspension; hydraulic disk brakes; electric motors and electronic gear shifting. Every major technological advancement has brought with it increased safety, ease of use, and performance, at the cost of adding extra layers of complexity on top of the basic initial machine. It’s increasingly rare now for people to know how to repair their own bicycles, and bicycle mechanics themselves have more and more skills to learn if they want to keep on top of the fast changes in their field.</p><p>Which brings me back to my modest Cube. I grossly underestimated just how complex a task I’d set for myself, of course, but at the same time I also underestimated just how much I would love doing it. I had never considered myself mechanically inclined; my dad didn’t teach me much, and by that time I hadn’t yet truly internalized something that has since become one of my main mantras in life: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4J_QfiGRRc">what one man can do, another can do</a> (by the way, if you haven’t watched <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119051/">The Edge</a> yet, you really should). Thankfully, we live in glorious informational times that our forefathers didn’t even dream of. A trove of knowledge of incalculable value is available at the fingertips of every self-learner, and bicycle repair is no exception. YouTube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzaZ1sPWEuZN-I8_XT6AH8g">Park Tool</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaAK2FaxQ2xiBbAUVZsvDYQ">RJ The Bike Guy</a> provide a visual, hands-on learning experience that is comparable to the tragically fading practice of apprenticeship. Internet forums like <a href="http://reddit.com/r/bikewrench">/r/bikewrench</a> give one the ability to pick the brains of real-life professional mechanics (although, just like every other subreddit, it does have its idiots that one needs to learn to steer clear of), and no list of bike repair resources could be complete without mentioning <em>the Bible</em>, the website of the late <a href="https://www.sheldonbrown.com/">Sheldon Brown</a>. May he rest in peace.</p><p>Eventually, I finished the project. It didn’t go smoothly at all. On more than one occasion I realized I was missing some vital tool, or some tiny part that I hadn’t even known existed until I suddenly needed it–like <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/img/2022-02-04-repair/EfCKYf2.jpg">cable ferrules</a>, or a <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/img/2022-02-04-repair/UqbJC1q.png">star nut</a>–and without which the whole project ground to a halt. Nevertheless, the bike progressed, then finally it was done, and from that moment on I knew I was hooked. I’ve been working as a web developer since 2006. Coding has always been my great passion. I have literally lost count of the number of apps and projects I worked on for the past sixteen years. But let me tell you something: not a single launch has given me the same high, has been as memorable or as character-defining as rebuilding that cheap bicycle in 2020; I simply had to have more of it.</p><p>Almost two years have passed since then. I’ve rebuilt almost twenty more bikes in that time. I’ve learned to reliably <a href="https://www.wheelpro.co.uk/wheelbuilding/book.php">build wheels</a>, and I’ve become the go-to guy for bike repair in my circle of friends–and even for some folks who I didn’t even know before. There isn’t a single bicycle repair task that scares me anymore. I’ve gone from not being able to change a brake cable, to bravely <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/posts/sram-automatix/">taking apart complex components</a> or <a href="https://tegowerk.eu/posts/drop-bar-shifter-tutorial/">hacking them</a> for use-cases that they weren’t designed for. We have since sold the bikes we bought back in 2020, and both my wife and I are now riding bikes that I’ve built from scratch. The pride I feel when we go out on a ride cannot be overstated, and I love biking now more than I ever did as a result.</p><p>I realize this may sound overblown, but the changes this hobby has wrought in me go beyond just teaching me a fun and useful skill. Learning to fix bicycles has changed my outlook on manual labor, on the nature of work, and ultimately on life itself:</p><h3 id="thinking-versus-doing">Thinking versus doing</h3><p>Looking back, I realize I had a terribly naive perspective on manual labor. I lived with the misconception–drilled into me since childhood–that work can be neatly split into two categories: knowledge work and manual work; that there are those who think, and those who do, and by extension (and it greatly shames me to admit this) that there is a clear difference in value between the two.</p><p>I have since realized that the line that separates thinking from doing doesn’t actually exist; instead, the two are facets of the same coin, and neither can exist in isolation. This came to me when I noticed that there is just as much thinking going into solving a bike repair problem as there is in solving a bug in my code (and, incidentally, the same high when I finally crack it). I later ended up reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261332-shop-class-as-soulcraft">Shop Class as Soulcraft: An Inquiry Into the Value of Work</a>, by Matthew B. Crawford; it was an eye-opening read that eloquently put into words a concept I had merely sniffed the edges of. I highly recommend you give it a read.</p><h3 id="what-one-man-can-do-another-can-do">What one man can do, another can do</h3><p>I touched on this a bit earlier in the text. I have a lot more courage now in tackling all sorts of repairs around the house, not just on bikes. This is because I now know that I have the capacity to learn the necessary skills, but more importantly, it’s because I’ve learned to look at objects and <em>see them</em>. Something has shifted inside me, and it has altered my perception of the world. Before, I used to look at an object and only see it on the surface; I saw the function it performed and nothing more. Now I see the bolts, the screws, the cables, the hinges, the motors, and I know that each one of those can be fixed or replaced independently of the object as a whole. Maybe this has always been obvious to you, but as I’ve already said, I didn’t learn much of this stuff growing up; it’s a failing I put on my shoulders and the shoulders of my father both, and it’s something I’m only truly making up for now, in the fourth decade of my life. Better late than never.</p><h3 id="tangibility-of-objects-and-people">Tangibility, of objects and people</h3><p>At work I build websites. Well, that’s not strictly true. I build web apps, I write unit tests, I manage databases, I architect and set up the cloud infrastucture, I set up continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines, and sometimes I even help my colleagues fix the Docker setup on their machines. My daily conversations are peppered with such acronyms as PHP, TDD, CI, CD, K8s, SQL, JSON, AWS, GCP, CF, SSH, SSL, and on and on and on.</p><p>If you’re not an IT person, most of these words won’t mean anything to you, and therein lies my next point. Conceptually, it’s easier for humans to relate to occupations that produce something you can point a finger at. The further removed a person is from the results of their own work, the greater the disconnect they feel, and the greater the chance they’ll conclude they’re working in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_job">bullshit job</a>.</p><p>Now, I don’t actually believe I’m working a bullshit job. I don’t really believe they exist. I believe jobs provide value even when the value is not immediately, tangibly apparent. But I do believe in the disconnect that makes people feel this way, and I do believe that’s a distinct hallmark of the modern service-oriented industries. You’ll never hear a baker say their job is bullshit.</p><p>And it’s not just the tangible aspect of the work itself, either. The same can be said of the people who ultimately benefit from the work. Websites that I’ve built are being used right now by hundreds of thousands of people, yet for some reason I still feel I’m making a greater impact when I see a person ride away on a bike I’ve just repaired for them. It’s senseless, yet there it is.</p></article></div>]]></description>
