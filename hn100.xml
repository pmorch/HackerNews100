<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p>Today we are announcing the most significant cryptographic security upgrade in iMessage history with the introduction of PQ3, a groundbreaking post-quantum cryptographic protocol that advances the state of the art of end-to-end secure messaging. With compromise-resilient encryption and extensive defenses against even highly sophisticated quantum attacks, PQ3 is the first messaging protocol to reach what we call Level 3 security — providing protocol protections that surpass those in all other widely deployed messaging apps. To our knowledge, PQ3 has the strongest security properties of any at-scale messaging protocol in the world.</p>

<p>When iMessage launched in 2011, it was the first widely available messaging app to provide end-to-end encryption by default, and we have significantly upgraded its cryptography over the years. We most recently strengthened the iMessage cryptographic protocol in 2019 by switching from RSA to Elliptic Curve cryptography (ECC), and by protecting encryption keys on device with the Secure Enclave, making them significantly harder to extract from a device even for the most sophisticated adversaries. That protocol update went even further with an additional layer of defense: a periodic rekey mechanism to provide cryptographic self-healing even in the extremely unlikely case that a key ever became compromised. Each of these advances were formally verified by symbolic evaluation, a best practice that provides strong assurances of the security of cryptographic protocols.</p>
<p>Historically, messaging platforms have used classical public key cryptography, such as RSA, Elliptic Curve signatures, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange, to establish secure end-to-end encrypted connections between devices. All these algorithms are based on difficult mathematical problems that have long been considered too computationally intensive for computers to solve, even when accounting for Moore’s law. However, the rise of quantum computing threatens to change the equation. A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could solve these classical mathematical problems in fundamentally different ways, and therefore — in theory — do so fast enough to threaten the security of end-to-end encrypted communications.</p>
<p>Although quantum computers with this capability don’t exist yet, extremely well-resourced attackers can already prepare for their possible arrival by taking advantage of the steep decrease in modern data storage costs. The premise is simple: such attackers can collect large amounts of today’s encrypted data and file it all away for future reference. Even though they can’t decrypt any of this data today, they can retain it until they acquire a quantum computer that can decrypt it in the future, an attack scenario known as <em>Harvest Now, Decrypt Later</em>.</p>
<p>To mitigate risks from future quantum computers, the cryptographic community has been working on post-quantum cryptography (PQC): new public key algorithms that provide the building blocks for quantum-secure protocols but don’t require a quantum computer to run — that is, protocols that can run on the classical, non-quantum computers we’re all using today, but that will remain secure from known threats posed by future quantum computers.</p>
<p>To reason through how various messaging applications mitigate attacks, it’s helpful to place them along a spectrum of security properties. There’s no standard comparison to employ for this purpose, so we lay out our own simple, coarse-grained progression of messaging security levels in the image at the top of this post: we start on the left with classical cryptography and progress towards quantum security, which addresses current and future threats from quantum computers. Most existing messaging apps fall either into Level 0 — no end-to-end encryption by default and no quantum security — or Level 1 — with end-to-end encryption by default, but with no quantum security. A few months ago, Signal added support for the PQXDH protocol, becoming the <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">first large-scale messaging app to introduce post-quantum security</a> in the initial key establishment. This is a welcome and critical step that, by our scale, elevated Signal from Level 1 to Level 2 security.</p>
<p>At Level 2, the application of post-quantum cryptography is limited to the initial key establishment, providing quantum security only if the conversation key material is never compromised. But today’s sophisticated adversaries already have incentives to compromise encryption keys, because doing so gives them the ability to decrypt messages protected by those keys for as long as the keys don’t change. To best protect end-to-end encrypted messaging, the post-quantum keys need to change on an ongoing basis to place an upper bound on how much of a conversation can be exposed by any single, point-in-time key compromise — both now and with future quantum computers. Therefore, we believe messaging protocols should go even further and attain Level 3 security, where post-quantum cryptography is used to secure both the initial key establishment and the ongoing message exchange, with the ability to rapidly and automatically restore the cryptographic security of a conversation even if a given key becomes compromised.</p>
<p>iMessage now meets this goal with a new cryptographic protocol that we call PQ3, offering the strongest protection against quantum attacks and becoming the only widely available messaging service to reach Level 3 security. Support for PQ3 will start to roll out with the public releases of iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 14.4, and watchOS 10.4, and is already in the corresponding developer preview and beta releases. iMessage conversations between devices that support PQ3 are automatically ramping up to the post-quantum encryption protocol. As we gain operational experience with PQ3 at the massive global scale of iMessage, it will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations this year.</p>
<h3>Designing PQ3</h3>
<p>More than simply replacing an existing algorithm with a new one, we rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up to advance the state of the art in end-to-end encryption, and to deliver on the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce post-quantum cryptography from the start of a conversation, so that all communication is protected from current and future adversaries.</li>
<li>Mitigate the impact of key compromises by limiting how many past and future messages can be decrypted with a single compromised key.</li>
<li>Use a hybrid design to combine new post-quantum algorithms with current Elliptic Curve algorithms, ensuring that PQ3 can can never be less safe than the existing classical protocol.</li>
<li>Amortize message size to avoid excessive additional overhead from the added security.</li>
<li>Use formal verification methods to provide strong security assurances for the new protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>PQ3 introduces a new post-quantum encryption key in the set of public keys each device generates locally and transmits to Apple servers as part of iMessage registration. For this application, we chose to use Kyber post-quantum public keys, an algorithm that received close scrutiny from the global cryptography community, and was selected by NIST as the Module Lattice-based Key Encapsulation Mechanism standard, or <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/ipd">ML-KEM</a>. This enables sender devices to obtain a receiver’s public keys and generate post-quantum encryption keys for the very first message, even if the receiver is offline. We refer to this as initial key establishment.</p>
<p>We then include — within conversations — a periodic post-quantum rekeying mechanism that has the ability to self-heal from key compromise and protect future messages. In PQ3, the new keys sent along with the conversation are used to create fresh message encryption keys that can’t be computed from past ones, thereby bringing the conversation back to a secure state even if previous keys were extracted or compromised by an adversary. PQ3 is the first large scale cryptographic messaging protocol to introduce this novel post-quantum rekeying property.</p>
<p>PQ3 employs a hybrid design that combines Elliptic Curve cryptography with post-quantum encryption both during the initial key establishment and during rekeying. Thus, the new cryptography is purely additive, and defeating PQ3 security requires defeating both the existing, classical ECC cryptography and the new post-quantum primitives. It also means the protocol benefits from all the experience we accumulated from deploying the ECC protocol and its implementations.</p>
<p>Rekeying in PQ3 involves transmitting fresh public key material in-band with the encrypted messages that devices are exchanging. A new public key based on Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is transmitted inline with every response. The post-quantum key used by PQ3 has a significantly larger wire size than the existing protocol, so to meet our message size requirement we designed the quantum-secure rekeying to happen periodically rather than with every message. To determine whether a new post-quantum key is transmitted, PQ3 uses a rekeying condition that aims to balance the average size of messages on the wire, preserve the user experience in limited connectivity scenarios, and keep the global volume of messages within the capacity of our server infrastructure. Should the need arise, future software updates can increase the rekeying frequency in a way that’s backward-compatible with all devices that support PQ3.</p>
<p>With PQ3, iMessage continues to rely on classical cryptographic algorithms to authenticate the sender and verify the Contact Key Verification account key, because these mechanisms can’t be attacked retroactively with future quantum computers. To attempt to insert themselves in the middle of an iMessage conversation, an adversary would require a quantum computer capable of breaking one of the authentication keys before or at the time the communication takes place. In other words, these attacks cannot be performed in a <em>Harvest Now, Decrypt Later</em> scenario — they require the existence of a quantum computer capable of performing the attacks contemporaneously with the communication being attacked. We believe any such capability is still many years away, but as the threat of quantum computers evolves, we will continue to assess the need for post-quantum authentication to thwart such attacks.</p>
<h3>A formally proven protocol</h3>
<p>Our final requirement for iMessage PQ3 is formal verification — a mathematical proof of the intended security properties of the protocol. PQ3 received extensive review from Apple’s own multi-disciplinary teams in Security Engineering and Architecture (SEAR) as well as from some of the world’s foremost experts in cryptography. This includes a team led by Professor David Basin, head of the <a href="https://infsec.ethz.ch/">Information Security Group at ETH Zürich</a> and one of the inventors of <a href="https://tamarin-prover.com/">Tamarin</a> — a leading security protocol verification tool that was also used to evaluate PQ3 — as well as Professor Douglas Stebila from the University of Waterloo, who has performed extensive research on post-quantum security for internet protocols. Each took a different but complementary approach, using different mathematical models to demonstrate that as long as the underlying cryptographic algorithms remain secure, so does PQ3. Finally, a leading third-party security consultancy supplemented our internal implementation review with an independent assessment of the PQ3 source code, which found no security issues.</p>
<p>In the first mathematical analysis, <a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">Security analysis of the iMessage PQ3 protocol</a>, Professor Douglas Stebila focused on so-called game-based proofs. This technique, also known as reduction, defines a series of “games“ or logical statements to show that the protocol is at least as strong as the algorithms that underpin it. Stebila’s analysis shows that PQ3 provides confidentiality even in the presence of some key compromises against both classical and quantum adversaries, in both the initial key establishment and the ongoing rekeying phase of the protocol. The analysis decomposes the many layers of key derivations down to the message keys and proves that, for an attacker, they are indistinguishable from random noise. Through an extensive demonstration that considers different attack paths for classical and quantum attackers in the proofs, Stebila shows that the keys used for PQ3 are secure as long as either the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman problem remains hard or the Kyber post-quantum KEM remains secure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The iMessage PQ3 protocol is a well-designed cryptographic protocol for secure messaging that uses state-of-the-art techniques for end-to-end encrypted communication. In my analysis using the reductionist security methodology, I confirmed that the PQ3 protocol provides post-quantum confidentiality, which can give users confidence in the privacy of their communication even in the face of potential improvements in quantum computing technology. —Professor Douglas Stebila</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the second evaluation, <a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/A_Formal_Analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_Messaging_Protocol_Basin_et_al.pdf">A Formal Analysis of the iMessage PQ3 Messaging Protocol</a>, Prof. David Basin, Felix Linker, and Dr. Ralf Sasse at ETH Zürich use a method called symbolic evaluation. As highlighted in the paper’s abstract, this analysis includes a detailed formal model of the iMessage PQ3 protocol, a precise specification of its fine-grained security properties, and machine-checked proofs using the state-of-the-art symbolic <a href="https://tamarin-prover.com/">Tamarin prover</a>. The evaluation yielded a fine-grained analysis of the secrecy properties of PQ3, proving that “in the absence of the sender or recipient being compromised, all keys and messages transmitted are secret” and that “compromises can be tolerated in a well-defined sense where the effect of the compromise on the secrecy of data is limited in time and effect,” which confirms that PQ3 meets our goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We provide a mathematical model of PQ3 as well as prove its secrecy and authenticity properties using a verification tool for machine-checked security proofs. We prove the properties even when the protocol operates in the presence of very strong adversaries who can corrupt parties or possess quantum computers and therefore defeat classical cryptography. PQ3 goes beyond Signal with regards to post-quantum defenses. In PQ3, a post-quantum secure algorithm is part of the ratcheting and used repeatedly, rather than only once in the initialization as in Signal. Our verification provides a very high degree of assurance that the protocol as designed functions securely, even in the post-quantum world. —Professor David Basin</em></p>

<h3>Diving into the details</h3>
<p>Because we know PQ3 will be of intense interest to security researchers and engineers as well as the cryptographic community, this blog post is really two posts in one. Up to now, we laid out our design goals, outlined how PQ3 meets them, and explained how we verified our confidence in the protocol with independent assessments. If you’d like to understand more detail about the cryptographic underpinnings, the remainder of the post is a deeper dive into how we constructed the PQ3 protocol.</p>
<h3>Post-quantum key establishment</h3>
<p>iMessage allows a user to register multiple devices on the same account. Each device generates its own set of encryption keys, and the private keys are never exported to any external system. The associated public keys are registered with Apple’s Identity Directory Service (IDS) to enable users to message each other using a simple identifier: email address or phone number. When a user sends a message from one of their devices, all of their other devices and all of the recipient’s devices receive the message. The messages are exchanged through pair-wise sessions established between the sending device and each receiving device. The same message is encrypted successively to each receiving device, with keys uniquely derived for each session. For the rest of this description, we will focus on a single device-to-device session.</p>
<p>Because the receiving device might not be online when the conversation is established, the first message in a session is encrypted using the public encryption keys registered with the IDS server.</p>
<p>Each device with PQ3 registers two public encryption keys and replaces them regularly with fresh ones:</p>
<ol>
<li>A post-quantum Kyber-1024 key encapsulation public key</li>
<li>A classical P-256 Elliptic Curve key agreement public key</li>
</ol>
<p>These encryption keys are signed with ECDSA using a P-256 authentication key generated by the device’s Secure Enclave, along with a timestamp used to limit their validity. The device authentication public key is itself signed by the <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification/">Contact Key Verification</a> account key, along with some attributes such as the supported cryptographic protocol version. This process allows the sender to verify that the recipient device’s public encryption keys were uploaded by the intended recipient, and it guards against downgrade attacks.</p>
<p>When Alice’s device instantiates a new session with Bob’s device, her device queries the IDS server for the key bundle associated with Bob’s device. The subset of the key bundle that contains the device’s authentication key and versioning information is validated using Contact Key Verification. The device then validates the signature covering the encryption keys and timestamps, which attests that the keys are valid and have not expired.</p>
<p>Alice’s device can then use the two public encryption keys to share two symmetric keys with Bob. The first symmetric key is computed through an ECDH key exchange that combines an ephemeral encryption key from Alice with Bob’s registered P-256 public key. The second symmetric key is obtained from a Kyber key encapsulation with Bob’s post-quantum public key.</p>
<p>To combine these two symmetric keys, we first extract their entropy by invoking HKDF-SHA384-Extract twice — once for each of the keys. The resulting 48-byte secret is further combined with a domain separation string and session information — which includes the user’s identifiers, the public keys used in the key exchange, and the encapsulated secret — by invoking HKDF-SHA384-Extract again to derive the session’s initial keying state. This combination ensures that the initial session state cannot be derived without knowing both of the shared secrets, meaning an attacker would need to break both algorithms to recover the resulting secret, thus satisfying our hybrid security requirement.</p>
<h3>Post-quantum rekeying</h3>
<p>Ongoing rekeying of the cryptographic session is designed such that keys used to encrypt past and future messages cannot be recomputed even by a powerful hypothetical attacker who is able to extract the cryptographic state of the device at a given point in time. The protocol generates a new unique key for each message, which periodically includes new entropy that is not deterministically derived from the current state of the conversation, effectively providing self-healing properties to the protocol. Our rekeying approach is modeled after ratcheting, a technique that consists of deriving a new session key from other keys and ensuring the cryptographic state always moves forward in one direction. PQ3 combines three ratchets to achieve post-quantum encryption.</p>
<p>The first ratchet, called the symmetric ratchet, protects older messages in a conversation to achieve forward secrecy. For every message, we derive a per-message encryption key from the current session key. The current session key itself is then further derived into a new session key, ratcheting the state forward. Each message key is deleted as soon as a corresponding message is decrypted, which prevents older harvested ciphertexts from being decrypted by an adversary who is able to compromise the device at a later time, and provides protection against replayed messages. This process uses 256-bit keys and intermediate values, and HKDF-SHA384 as a derivation function, which provides protection against both classical and quantum computers.</p>
<p>The second ratchet, called the ECDH ratchet, protects future messages by updating the session with fresh entropy from an Elliptic Curve key agreement, ensuring that an adversary loses the ability to decrypt new messages even if they had compromised past session keys — a property called post-compromise security. The ECDH-based ratchet has a symmetrical flow: the private key of the outgoing ratchet public key from the sender is used with the last public key received from the recipient to establish a new shared secret between sender and receiver, which is then mixed into the session’s key material. The new PQ3 protocol for iMessage uses NIST P-256 Elliptic Curve keys to perform this ratchet, which imposes only a small 32-byte overhead on each message.</p>
<p>Because the second ratchet uses classical cryptography, PQ3 also adds a conditionally executed Kyber KEM-based ratchet. This third ratchet complements the ECDH-based ratchet to provide post-compromise security against <em>Harvest Now, Decrypt Later</em> quantum attacks as well.</p>
<p>The use of a post-quantum ratchet can cause significant network overhead compared to an ECDH-based ratchet at the same security level. The post-quantum KEM requires sending both a public key and an encapsulated secret instead of a single outgoing public key. In addition, the underlying mathematical structure for quantum security requires significantly larger parameter sizes for public keys and encapsulated keys compared to Elliptic Curves.</p>
<p>To limit the size overhead incurred by frequent rekeying while preserving a high level of security, the post-quantum KEM is instantiated with Kyber-768. Unlike the IDS-registered public keys used for the initial key establishment, ratcheting public keys are used only once to encapsulate a shared secret to the receiver, significantly limiting the impact of the compromise of a single key. However, while a 32-byte ECDH-based ratchet overhead is acceptable on every message, the post-quantum KEM ratchet increases the message size by more than 2 kilobytes. To avoid visible delays in message delivery when device connectivity is limited, this ratchet needs to be amortized over multiple messages.</p>
<p>We therefore implemented an adaptive post-quantum rekeying criterion that takes into account the number of outgoing messages, the time elapsed since last rekeying, and current connectivity conditions. At launch, this means the post-quantum ratchet is performed approximately every 50 messages, but the criterion is bounded such that rekeying is always guaranteed to occur at least once every 7 days. And as we mentioned earlier, as the threat of quantum computers and infrastructure capacity evolves over time, future software updates can increase the rekeying frequency while preserving full backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Completing the public key ratchets, whether based on ECDH or Kyber, requires sending and receiving a message. Although users may not immediately reply to a message, iMessage includes encrypted delivery receipts that allow devices to rapidly complete the ratchet even without a reply from the recipient, as long as the device is online. This technique avoids delays in the rekeying process and helps support strong post-compromise recovery.</p>
<p>Similar to the initial session key establishment, the secrets established through the three ratchets are all combined with an evolving session key using HKDF-SHA384 through sequential calls to the Extract function. At the end of this process, we obtain a final message key, which can now be used to encrypt the payload.</p>
<h3>Padding and encryption</h3>
<p>To avoid leaking information about the message size, PQ3 adds padding to the message before encryption. This padding is implemented with the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03160">Padmé</a> heuristic, which specifically limits the information leakage of ciphertexts with maximum length M to a practical optimum of O(log log M) bits. This is comparable to padding to a power of two but results in a lower overhead of at most 12 percent and even lower for larger payloads. This approach strikes an excellent balance between privacy and efficiency, and preserves the user experience in limited device connectivity scenarios.</p>
<p>The padded payload is encrypted with AES-CTR using a 256-bit encryption key and initialization vector, both derived from the message key. While public key algorithms require fundamental changes to achieve quantum security, symmetric cryptography algorithms like the AES block cipher only require doubling the key size to maintain their level of security against quantum computers.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>Each message is individually signed with ECDSA using the elliptic curve P-256 device authentication key protected by the Secure Enclave. The receiving device verifies the mapping between the sender’s identifier (email address or phone number) and the public key used for signature verification. If both users have enabled Contact Key Verification and verified each other’s account key, the device verifies that the device authentication keys are present in the Key Transparency log and that the corresponding account key matches the account key stored in the user’s iCloud Keychain.</p>
<p>The device’s authentication key is generated by the Secure Enclave and never exposed to the rest of the device, which helps prevent extraction of the private key even if the Application Processor is completely compromised. If an attacker were to compromise the Application Processor, they might be able to use the Secure Enclave to sign arbitrary messages. But after the device recovers from the compromise through a reboot or a software update, they would no longer be able to impersonate the user. This approach offers stronger guarantees than other messaging protocols where the authentication key is sometimes shared between devices or where the authentication takes place only at the beginning of the session.</p>
<p>The message signature covers a wide range of fields, including the unique identifiers of the users and their push notification tokens, the encrypted payload, authenticated data, a ratchet-derived message key indicator that binds the signature to a unique location in the ratchet, and any public key information used in the protocol. The inclusion of these fields in the signature guarantees that the message can only be used in the context intended by the sender, and all the fields are exhaustively documented in the research papers from Stebila, Basin, and collaborators.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>End-to-end encrypted messaging has seen a tremendous amount of innovation in recent years, including significant advances in post-quantum cryptography from Signal’s PQXDH protocol and in key transparency from WhatsApp’s Auditable Key Directory. Building on its pioneering legacy as the first widely available messaging app to provide end-to-end encryption by default, iMessage has continued to deliver advanced protections that surpass existing systems. iMessage <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-contact-key-verification/">Contact Key Verification</a> is the most sophisticated key transparency system for messaging deployed at scale, and is the current global state of the art for automatic key verification. And the new PQ3 cryptographic protocol for iMessage combines post-quantum initial key establishment with three ongoing ratchets for self-healing against key compromise, defining the global state of the art for protecting messages against <em>Harvest Now, Decrypt Later</em> attacks and future quantum computers.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/21/adams">https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/21/adams</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39453055">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="social-select-root" data-highlights="">
  <p>We seem to be moving from technology inspired by Star Trek to tech straight out of books by Douglas Adams?</p>
<p>This is not my observation. I was on the podcast WD-40 this week, talking about crowdfunding, narrative hooks, and how to preserve a lightness of approach. Here it is, <a href="https://wb40podcast.com/2024/02/19/288-crowdfunding/">WD-40 episode 288: Crowdfunding</a>.</p>
<p>After we were done recording, <a href="https://lisariemers.com/">Lisa Riemers</a>, one of the hosts, commented that my recent projects could have come straight out of <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.</em></p>
<p>She’s right!</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/01/kickstarter">Poem/1</a> is a box that prints poetry to tell the time! A Vogon invention if ever there was one. <em>Hey, only a week to go on the Kickstarter, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/genmon/poem-1-the-ai-poetry-clock">check out the campaign</a>!</em></li>
<li><a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/15/galactic-compass">Galactic Compass</a> orients you to the central supermassive black hole of the galaxy. I’ve lost count of the people who have connected it with the Total Perspective Vortex.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now this tickles me.</p>
<p>Because:</p>
<p>The URL of this blog is <code>interconnected.org</code> - I’ve been blogging here since February 2000 - and it’s named for the project that originally occupied the homepage. That project’s strap line: <q>Exploring the fundamental interconnectedness of all things.</q></p>
<p>Which is from Douglas Adam’s <em>Dirk Gently</em> books.</p>
<p>It’s a long-running association for me, it turns out.</p>
<hr>
<p>There’s a gag that technology is inspired by <em>Star Trek.</em></p>
<p>Tricorders are smartphones. Touch screen computing and voice computing are both in the standard kit of the Trek universe. Communicator badges and universal translators provide a North Star for wearables; the Holodeck is an inspiration for virtual reality.</p>
<p>Now who knows what the direction of influence here is, actually.</p>
<p>Other sci-fi has had outsized impact too: tablets and video calls in Kubrick’s <em>2001</em> for instance. The Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer as an educational device in <em>The Diamond Age</em> by Neal Stephenson.</p>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek</em> is always the one that gets mentioned.</p>
<p>And yet –</p>
<p>The most useful new concept of the 2020s is that of <em>vibes.</em> Vibe is as real as momentum, and should be as studied and theorised, imo.</p>
<p>And, <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2022/03/11/saeculum">as previously discussed</a>, we are in the midst of a Vibe Shift.</p>
<p>Why shouldn’t that touch technology too?</p>
<hr>
<p>See, AI is the most Douglas Adams of all technologies.</p>
<p>Large language models, GPT-2, GPT-3, ChatGPT and all the rest, are relatively simple under the hood. There’s not much complexity to the code, so I’m told. But there is a <em>monstrous</em> quantity of data and training.</p>
<p>OpenAI didn’t invent the transformer architecture LLM. But they were the first to do the engineering to make it really, really big, and see what happened. That it would work out was unexpected!</p>
<p>Here, read about the invention of the Infinite Improbability Drive from Adam’s <em>Hitchhiker’s:</em></p>
<p>The principles of improbability were known:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle of generating small amounts of finite improbability by simply hooking the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter suspended in a strong Brownian motion producer (say a nice hot cup of tea) were of course well understood …</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the physicists were stuck on how to generate an <em>infinite</em> improbability field.</p>
<p>Until, <q>one day, a student who had been left to sweep up the lab after a particularly unsuccessful party</q> got to thinking…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If, he thought to himself, such a machine is a virtual impossibility, then it must logically be a finite improbability. So all I have to do in oder to make one is to work out exactly how improbable it is, feed that figure into the finite improbability generator, give it a fresh cup of real hot tea … and turn it on!</p>
<p>He did this, and was rather startled to discover that he had managed to create the long sought after golden Infinite Improbability generator out of thin air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>I do not intend to reduce Sam Altman and Greg Brockman’s astounding accomplishments at OpenAI to <em>giving the computer a cup of really got tea and turning it on…</em></p>
<p>…only, maybe, kinda haha, perhaps??</p>
<p>It is <em>absurdly improbably</em> that you can hoover up the internet, shred it, then talk to the mulch pile and it <em>talks back.</em></p>
<p>Truly this is the age of Douglas Adams technology.</p>
<hr>
<p>Look around you!</p>
<p>I was in a Waymo robot taxi the other week, <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2024/02/07/cars">it went wrong</a>, and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s empty! (I tried to say by waving my arms.) I’m in a haunted car! I can’t tell the ghost what to do!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, so Adams.</p>
<p><em>Another:</em></p>
<p>I’ve talked before about <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2022/03/16/flirtation">AI virtual girlfriends</a> and <a href="https://interconnected.org/home/2015/02/15/filtered">swarming fractional micro-boyfriends</a>. Then I saw this idea fly by <a href="https://twitter.com/benhylak/status/1760021504279060836">on Twitter yesterday</a>, half trolling half real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>someone should make a dating app where an LLM clone of you goes on thousands of dates with LLM clones of other people, and then your matches are when the LLMs decide to date each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They continue, <q>you can literally build this right now,</q> and later in the thread, it <q>gets trained on your iMessages.</q></p>
<p>I mean, it’d work!</p>
<p>Let me point out Adam’s <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1298">Electric Monk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Electric Monk was a labour-saving device, like a dishwasher or a video recorder. Dishwashers washed tedious dishes for you, thus saving you the bother of washing them yourself, video recorders watched tedious television for you, thus saving you the bother of looking at it yourself; Electric Monks believed things for you, thus saving you what was becoming an increasingly onerous task, that of believing all the things the world expected you to believe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An Electric Monk for <em>dating??</em></p>
<p>Why not. It’s very now.</p>
<p>It is the Adams Age.</p>
<hr>
<p>So I’m into this.</p>
<p>When technology becomes absurd, we must respond with absurd inventions.</p>
<p>More than that, we must straight-faced embrace the absurdity. Otherwise the pomposity of today’s technology will eat us alive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Nick Foster, previously head of design at Google X, makes the vibe shift point much more eloquently in a recent essay:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://medium.com/@fosta/overpromising-and-stumbling-bambis-c4139eb43291" data-author="Nick Foster" data-title="Overpromising &amp; Stumbling Bambis">
<p>Emboldened by seemingly unrestrained growth, tech companies large and small began to position their products not only as new ideas but as culturally important moments, ruptures in the status quo or accelerations of our species. Their presentations became increasingly slick and the language became self-assured, bombastic and confident.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Foster suggests a counterpoint. He doesn’t say we should back away from new technology, but we should understand it for what it is:</p>
<p><q>In truth, genuinely ‘new things’ are almost always unresolved, unrefined and uncertain.</q></p>
<p>And, generously, he uses my own <em>Poem/1</em> as an example of what he calls a <em>“stumbling Bambi”,</em> products that are <q>finding their feet and blinking in the sunlight as they figure out the world around them.</q></p>
<p>A much more honest approach.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Douglas Adams Age may well be absurd but that’s because the technology itself is absurd.</p>
<p>Why <em>shouldn’t</em> our tech products make us giggle, boggle and see ghosts?</p>
<p>(And btw being unserious, which is what I’m recommending here, doesn’t let us off the hook re: paying attention to what our tech does in the world.)</p>
<p>I’m left with two thoughts:</p>
<p>A. What else should we make? <a href="http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/AuthorTotalAlphaList.asp?AuNum=14">Here’s a list of Douglas Adams’ sci-fi inventions!</a> Let’s go?</p>
<p>B. I wish he were here to see it.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 21 Feb 2024 11:28:02 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pijul.org/">https://pijul.org/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39452543">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Pijul is a free and open source (GPL2) <strong>distributed version control system</strong>. Its distinctive feature is to be based on a <strong>theory of patches</strong>, while still being fast and scalable. This makes it easy to learn and use, without any compromise on power or features.
</p>
<div>
    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <div><h5>Commutation</h5><p>
        In Pijul, independent changes can be applied in any order without changing the result or the version's identifier. This makes Pijul significantly simpler than workflows using <code>git rebase</code> or <code>hg transplant</code>. Pijul has a branch-like feature called "channels", but these are not as important as in other systems. For example, so-called <em>feature branches</em> are often just changes in Pijul. Keeping your history clean is the default.</p></div>

    <div><h5>Merge correctness</h5><p>
        Pijul guarantees a number of strong properties on merges. The most important one is that the <strong>order</strong> between lines is always preserved. This is unlike 3-way merge, which may sometimes shuffle lines around. When the order is unknown (for example in the case of concurrent edits), this is a <em>conflict</em>, which contrasts with systems with "automatic" or "no conflicts" merges.
    </p></div>

    <div><h5>First-class conflicts</h5><p>
        In Pijul, conflicts are not modelled as a "failure to merge", but rather as the standard case. Specifically, conflicts happen between two changes, and are solved by one change. The resolution change solves the conflict between the same two changes, no matter if other changes have been made concurrently. Once solved, conflicts never come back.
    </p></div>

    <div><h5>Partial clones</h5><p>
        Commutation makes it possible to clone only a small subset of a repository: indeed, one can only apply the changes related to that subset. Working on a partial clone produces changes that can readily be sent to the large repository.
    </p></div>


</div>


<h4>Where to find it?</h4>

As cybersecurity and technology professionals, we recognize the importance of acting rapidly to reduce its impact on Canadians. That being said, we believe the federal government’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-safety-canada/news/2024/02/federal-action-on-combatting-auto-theft.html">proposal</a>, particularly the prohibition of security research tools, is ill-advised, overbroad and most importantly, will be counterproductive.</p><blockquote><p>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) will pursue all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry, such as the Flipper Zero, which would allow for the removal of those devices from the Canadian marketplace through collaboration with law enforcement agencies.</p></blockquote><h2 id="we-believe-this-policy-will-not-work-because-it-rests-on-a-misunderstanding-of-the-underlying-technology">We believe this policy will not work because it rests on a misunderstanding of the underlying technology</h2><p>This policy is based on outdated and misinformed technological assumptions, making it unfeasible to implement and enforce. Security tools like Flipper Zero are essentially programmable radios, known as Software Defined Radios (SDRs), a technology which has existed for years, and in some cases can be built using open-source or simple over-the-shelf-components. These radios are also fundamentally the same as those used in numerous devices across various sectors, including smart household appliances, drones and aerospace technologies, mobile phones and networks, as well as industrial control systems. Consequently, prohibiting such functionality is virtually impossible and could stifle the Canadian economy significantly.</p><h2 id="we-believe-this-policy-will-degrade-national-security-by-incentivizing-manufacturers-to-design-insecure-products-as-security-research-is-criminalized-and-right-to-repair-is-penalized">We believe this policy will degrade national security, by incentivizing manufacturers to design insecure products, as security research is criminalized and right-to-repair is penalized</h2><p>This policy fails to recognize that these tools are not the enemy, rather, insecure products are. Unlike decades ago when the industry relied on security through obscurity as a strategy, we now can attest that the democratization of security research tools is a balancing force for manufacturers to improve the safety of their products. Today, many industry actors rely on such research, just like we have <a href="https://digital.canada.ca/security-notice/">Federal</a> &amp; Provincial<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> government programs that support &amp; reward security vulnerability disclosure that benefits us all. Implementing such a policy would have a <strong>chilling effect</strong> on these efforts, potentially undermining their positive impact on society.</p><p>Additionally, with bills such as <a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-244">C-244</a> (Right to Repair), that recently <a href="https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-ca/knowledge/publications/11c47b23/right-to-repair-bill-passes-unanimously-at-house-of-commons">passed unanimously</a> and <a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-294">C-294</a> (Interoperability) that gathered support from multiple parties, we believe this overbroad policy will penalize legitimate analysis and repair use-cases, that were just made available to canadians.</p><h2 id="finally-we-believe-this-policy-represents-a-waste-of-judiciary-resources-that-could-be-better-used-to-collaborate-with-experts-from-the-cybersecurity-industry-to-identify-ways-to-prevent-and-deter-such-crimes">Finally, we believe this policy represents a waste of judiciary resources that could be better used to collaborate with experts from the cybersecurity industry to identify ways to prevent and deter such crimes</h2><p>Because of the arbitrary nature of such a policy, we believe the judiciary system will be faced with a slew of litigious cases around the many uses of these security tools. Instead, these resources could be focused on creating constructive communication channels between cybersecurity experts, car manufacturers, insurers, and the judiciary system to identify ways to improve the security of automotive keyless entry and push-to-start systems, and enforce minimal levels of security for future products, as it is the case in other industries.</p><hr><h2 id="english-version-aboveenglish-version"><a href="https://saveflipper.ca/#english-version">English version above</a></h2><h2 id="version-française">Version française</h2><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPeKDnHw2oE713QNTh5rakQ97zkGglRCezVgIhoFqaG-bP5A/viewform">Signer</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/fr/search">Trouver et contacter votre député</a></p><h2 id="vols-de-véhicules---les-véhicules-non-sécurisés-devraient-être-interdits-pas-les-outils-de-sécurité-comme-le-flipper-zero">Vols de véhicules - Les véhicules non sécurisés devraient être interdits, pas les outils de sécurité comme le Flipper Zero</h2><p>Le vol de véhicules est un problème qui nous affecte tous collectivement. En tant que professionnels de la cybersécurité et de la technologie, nous reconnaissons l’importance d’agir rapidement pour réduire son impact sur les Canadiens. Cela étant dit, nous croyons que la <a href="https://www.canada.ca/fr/securite-publique-canada/nouvelles/2024/02/mesures-federales-de-lutte-contre-le-vol-de-vehicules.html">proposition</a> du gouvernement fédéral, en particulier l’interdiction des outils de recherche en sécurité, est malavisée, trop générale et surtout, contre-productive.</p><blockquote><p>ISDE examinera toutes les possibilités pour interdire les dispositifs utilisés pour voler des véhicules en copiant les signaux sans fil du système de télédéverrouillage, tels que le Flipper Zero, ce qui permettrait de retirer ces dispositifs du marché canadien, en collaboration avec les organismes chargés de l’application de la loi.</p></blockquote><h2 id="nous-croyons-que-cette-politique-ne-fonctionnera-pas-car-elle-repose-sur-une-incompréhension-de-la-technologie-sous-jacente">Nous croyons que cette politique ne fonctionnera pas car elle repose sur une incompréhension de la technologie sous-jacente</h2><p>Cette politique est basée sur des hypothèses technologiques obsolètes et mal informées, rendant son application et son exécution irréalisables. Les outils de sécurité comme le Flipper Zero sont essentiellement des radios programmables, connues sous le nom de Radios Définies par Logiciel, ou Software Defined Radios en anglais, (SDR), une technologie qui existe depuis des années et qui, dans certains cas, peut être construite en utilisant des composants open-source ou simples disponibles dans le commerce. Ces radios sont également fondamentalement les mêmes que celles utilisées dans de nombreux appareils à travers divers secteurs, y compris les appareils ménagers intelligents, les drones et les technologies aérospatiales, les téléphones mobiles et les réseaux, ainsi que les systèmes de contrôle industriel. Par conséquent, interdire une telle fonctionnalité est pratiquement impossible et pourrait étouffer considérablement l’économie canadienne.</p><h2 id="nous-croyons-que-cette-politique-va-dégrader-la-sécurité-nationale-en-incitant-les-fabricants-à-concevoir-des-produits-non-sécurisés-car-la-recherche-en-sécurité-sera-criminalisée-et-le-droit-de-réparer-pénalisé">Nous croyons que cette politique va dégrader la sécurité nationale, en incitant les fabricants à concevoir des produits non sécurisés, car la recherche en sécurité sera criminalisée et le droit de réparer pénalisé</h2><p>Cette politique échoue à reconnaître que ces outils ne sont pas l’ennemi, mais plutôt que les produits non sécurisés le sont. Contrairement à il y a des décennies, où l’industrie s’appuyait sur la sécurité par l’obscurité comme stratégie, nous pouvons maintenant attester que la démocratisation des outils de recherche en sécurité est une force d’équilibre pour les fabricants pour améliorer la sécurité de leurs produits. Aujourd’hui, de nombreux acteurs de l’industrie s’appuient sur une telle recherche, tout comme nous avons des programmes gouvernementaux <a href="https://numerique.canada.ca/avis-de-securite/">Fédéraux</a> et Provinciaux<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> qui soutiennent et récompensent la divulgation de vulnérabilités de sécurité qui nous profitent tous. La mise en œuvre d’une telle politique aurait un <strong>effet paralysant</strong> sur ces efforts, compromettant potentiellement leur impact positif sur la société.</p><p>De plus, avec des projets de loi tels que <a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/fr/projet-de-loi/44-1/c-244">C-244</a> (Droit à la réparation), qui a récemment été <a href="https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/fr-ca/centre-du-savoir/publications/11c47b23/le-projet-de-loi-sur-le-droit-a-la-reparation-est-adopte-a-lunanimite-par-la-chambre-des-communes">adopté à l’unanimité</a> et <a href="https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-294">C-294</a> (Interopérabilité) qui a recueilli le soutien de plusieurs partis, nous pensons que cette politique trop générale pénalisera les analyses légitimes et les cas d’utilisation de réparation, qui viennent juste d’être rendus disponibles aux Canadiens.</p><h2 id="enfin-nous-croyons-que-cette-politique-représente-un-gaspillage-de-ressources-judiciaires-qui-pourraient-être-mieux-utilisées-pour-collaborer-avec-des-experts-de-lindustrie-de-la-cybersécurité-afin-didentifier-des-moyens-de-prévenir-et-de-dissuader-de-tels-crimes">Enfin, nous croyons que cette politique représente un gaspillage de ressources judiciaires qui pourraient être mieux utilisées pour collaborer avec des experts de l’industrie de la cybersécurité afin d’identifier des moyens de prévenir et de dissuader de tels crimes</h2><p>En raison de la nature arbitraire d’une telle politique, nous croyons que le système judiciaire sera confronté à une multitude de cas litigieux concernant les nombreuses utilisations de ces outils de sécurité. Au lieu de cela, ces ressources pourraient être concentrées sur la création de canaux de communication constructifs entre les experts en cybersécurité, les fabricants de voitures, les assureurs et le système judiciaire pour identifier des moyens d’améliorer la sécurité des systèmes d’entrée sans clé et de démarrage par bouton-poussoir des automobiles, et imposer des niveaux de sécurité minimaux pour les futurs produits, comme c’est le cas dans d’autres industries.</p><h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2><p>If you agree with this letter, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeqLx3BbgeU7NVt7ewJRN871devxTxYSJdRDNOG8D7EVbO4IA/viewform">sign it</a> and share it.

Tomorrow becomes today, and&nbsp;<strong>today is a mess.</strong></p><p>Today, we're hungry. Today, someone is late. Today, we don't feel like taking on the work.</p><p><strong>Today doesn't line up with how we imagined it to be: this magical land of improved productivity.</strong></p><p><img data-src="/assets/illustrations/tomorrow_expectations_vs_reality.png" alt="Tomorrow - expectations vs reality" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/tomorrow_expectations_vs_reality.png"></p><p><strong>This is normal.</strong></p><p>The problem is that the simplified image of "productive tomorrow" forms our expectations and when we fail these expectations, we beat ourselves up.</p><p>And we procrastinate because each of these imperfections, these deviations from our imagined day, gives us an opportunity to justify getting distracted.</p><p>We wake up late, and so we feel justified in checking social media. We say "What the hell". A meeting is canceled, and suddenly we feel like we have "bonus time" to scroll Twitter for 30 minutes. We don't do our perfect routine, and so we don't feel ready to tackle the most important work on our plate.</p><p>This attitude makes us fragile.&nbsp;<strong>Almost every day has a bunch of these imperfections</strong>. If we treat each of them as a reason to get side-tracked, we'll procrastinate the whole day.</p><p>A change in attitude is needed.</p><h2 id="embrace-the-mess-instead"><strong>Embrace the mess instead</strong></h2><p>Accept that the perfect moment is not coming. You won't magically feel super-motivated. You won't suddenly start to focus for 2 hours at a time.</p><p>You have only what you have right now. If you feel okay-ish, and you have 30 minutes of largely uninterrupted time, now's the time to do something.</p><p>Expect things to not go 100% according to plan.</p><p>Wake up late? Reset.<br>Meeting canceled? Reset.<br>Morning routine interrupted? Reset.</p><p>If you know that these imperfections are extremely likely, you can react with more presence of mind and make the best of the situation.</p><p>For example, I write this on the train, late to my dentist appointment because it snowed overnight. Hardly an ideal situation, and yet I write. I could easily justify to myself that I should do nothing and fret over how bad this situation is (and I indeed did for about 10 minutes), but I still have 30 minutes of the train ride and so why not do a bit of work?</p><p>If I hadn't written anything on that train, I wouldn't have had a place to continue. I wouldn't have anything to edit, to improve, and to share.</p><p>Because of my attitude to make the best out of the situation, however messy it was, I was somewhat productive, and felt better about how I spent my time as a result.</p><p>Now, I'm far from perfect in this regard, but it's a skill I'm working on. With that in mind, let's take a look at some principles to make this mindset shift easier.</p><h2 id="dont-be-precious-about-routines"><strong>Don't be precious about routines</strong></h2><p>The ideal morning routine, the ideal evening routine, the ideal workout routine,...</p><p>These can all become shackles and make us fragile. They don't take the mess of life into account. Any interruption derails the whole thing, giving us a reason to procrastinate.</p><p>If you have time for a nice routine, sure, go for it. But don't rely on it too much. Accept that sometimes it won't be possible to follow the routine.</p><h2 id="dont-be-precious-about-work"><strong>Don't be precious about work</strong></h2><p>A lot of people who procrastinate start to view work as a huge enemy. It's driven largely by how they approached work in the past. They procrastinated, and then near the deadline they had to do 8 hours of work in one day—so now every even mildly unpleasant task looks like that 8 hour behemoth. And so, procrastination follows.</p><p>In reality, almost no task requires an 8 hour sprint. If we don't procrastinate, we can work in much easier 15-30 minute chunks. 8 hour sprints are overwhelming, 30 minute chunks less so.</p><p>And the key thing is that you don't need the perfect "priming routine" to get into flow. 30 minutes of work can be done in many different settings, in many different mental states.</p><p>Do a bit of work here, a bit of work there,... and it begins to add up. Of course, you can do more if you want to.</p><p>Blowing work out of proportion, and demonizing it is a bad habit.</p><p>"I have to do this."<br>"It's gonna take hours."<br>"I hate doing this."</p><p>All of the above only make it harder to do the task.</p><p>Try to view work as a series of small steps, a couple of which you can take today, instead of a big push.</p><h2 id="dont-expect-your-focus-to-be-perfect"><strong>Don't expect your focus to be perfect</strong></h2><p>When you do sit down to work, don't expect 100% unwavering focus.</p><p>You'll probably start at around 50%. You'll still feel a bit distracted.</p><p>But if you continue, after 10-15 min you'll get more focused.</p><p>At the end of the session, your focus will go back down.</p><p>Our concentration level changes throughout the work session. Sometimes we are more engaged, sometimes less. What matters is not getting side-tracked in moments of waning concentration. Expect this, stare out of a window for a moment, but don't grab the phone or open a new tab.</p><h2 id="think-about-productivity-as-a-spectrum"><strong>Think about productivity as a spectrum</strong></h2><p>You're not 0% productive or 100% productive. Viewing productivity as a 0 or 1 switch is not helpful. How many of us feel like we're at 100%? Very few.</p><p>Having the expectation of being 100% productive will only lead to failure, because no day is perfect.</p><p>However, expecting yourself to be at least 50% productive? That is achievable and when you do achieve it, you feel better, making you more productive later.</p><p>So, could you be at least 50% productive today? Aim for that. If you do better, great. If not, have the same goal tomorrow.</p><h2 id="look-for-imperfect-actions-in-the-right-direction"><strong>Look for imperfect actions in the right direction</strong></h2><p>There is no perfect action.</p><p>When we think about a project, we're tempted to look for the perfect way to start. If we only started perfectly, then we couldn't fail, and so our ego would be perfectly protected.</p><p>That's not how things work.</p><p>Most human accomplishment is a sum of a bunch of trial and error. In other words, a lot of imperfect attempts that sometimes yield good results.</p><p><img data-src="/assets/illustrations/failure_iceberg.png" alt="More attempts more success" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/failure_iceberg.png"></p><p>This doesn't mean that we should not look for good ways to approach our work, it simply means that when we're stuck,&nbsp;<strong>any action will be better than no action.</strong></p><p>So next time you start working, and what you produce doesn't seem perfect like you imagine it to be, continue. Don't stop. Keep working.</p><p>Each task we tackle, each minute we put in, will solidify our intention and help us better understand the task at hand. Often, we don't even know what a good approach would look like before we start.</p><p>Imperfect action &gt; perfect nothing.</p><h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Everyday life is not perfect. It's more complicated than we imagine it to be.</p><p>Don't expect your routines to go perfectly.</p><p>Don't expect your concentration to be laser-focused 100% of the work session, and especially not at the start.</p><p>Don't look for the perfect ways to start, start anywhere you can.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<p>Walmart announced an agreement to buy Vizio today. Irvine, California-based Vizio is best known for lower-priced TVs, but its real value to Walmart is its advertising business and access to user data.</p>
<p>Walmart said it's buying Vizio for approximately $2.3 billion, pending regulatory clearance and additional closing conditions. Vizio can also terminate the transaction over the next 45 days if it accepts a better offer, per the announcement.</p>
<p>Walmart will keep selling non-Vizio TVs should the merger close, Seth Dallaire, Walmart US's EVP and CRO who would manage Vizio post-acquisition, told The Wall Street Journal (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-vizio-tv-company-deal-b90c77f6">WSJ</a>).</p>
<p>Walmart expects the acquisition to be finalized as soon as this summer, it told WSJ.</p>
<h2>Ad-pportunity</h2>
<p>Walmart, including Sam's Club, is typically Vizio's biggest customer by sales, per a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-vizio-tv-company-deal-b90c77f6">WSJ</a> report last week on the potential merger. But Walmart's acquisition isn't about getting a bigger piece of the budget-TV market (Walmart notably already sells its own "onn." budget TVs). Instead, Walmart is looking to boost its Walmart Connect advertising business.</p>
<p>Vizio makes money by selling ads, including those shown on the Vizio SmartCast OS and on free content available on its TVs with ads. Walmart said buying Vizio will give it new ways to appeal to advertisers and that those ad efforts would be further fueled by Walmart's high-volume sales of TVs.</p>
<p>Walmart said today that Vizio's Platform+ ad business has "over 500 direct advertiser relationships, including many of the Fortune 500" and that SmartCast users have grown 400 percent since 2018 to 18 million active accounts.</p>
<p>Walmart Connect (which was rebranded from Walmart Media Group in 2021) sells various types of ads, including adverts that appear on Walmart's website and app. Walmart Connect also sells ads that display on in-store screens, including display TVs and point-of-sale machines, in over 4,700 locations (Walmart has over 10,500 stores).</p>
<p>Walmart makes most of its US revenue from low-profit groceries, WSJ noted last week, but ads are higher profit. Walmart has said that it wants Walmart Connect to be a top-10 advertising business. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta are among the world's biggest advertising companies today. In the fiscal year ending January 2023, Walmart said that its global ads business represented under 1 percent ($2.7 billion) of its total annual revenue. In its fiscal year 2024 Q4 earnings report released today [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/walmart-earnings-release-fy24-q4.pdf">PDF</a>], Walmart said its global ad business grew 33 percent, including 22 percent in the US, compared to Q4 2023.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Hungry for customer data</h2>
<p>Owning Platform+ would give Walmart new information about TV users. Data gathered from Vizio TVs will be combined with data on shoppers that Walmart already gets. Walmart plans to use this customer data to sell targeted ad space, such as banners above Walmart.com search results, and to help advertisers track ad results.</p>
<p>With people only able to buy so many new TVs, vendors have been pushing for ways to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/upcoming-wireless-tvs-sell-users-on-screen-products-when-they-raise-their-hand/">make money off of</a> already-purchased TVs. That means putting ads on TV OSes and TVs that gather customer data, including what users watch and which ads they click on, when possible. TV makers like Vizio, Amazon, and LG are increasingly focusing on ads as revenue streams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, retailers like Walmart are also turning to ads for revenue. Through Vizio, Walmart is&nbsp;looking to add a business with the vast majority of gross profit coming from ads. Data acquired through SmartCast can shed light on ad effectiveness and improve ad targeting, Vizio tells advertisers.</p>
<p>In an interview with WSJ, Dallaire noted that smart TVs and streaming have turned the TV business into a software, not hardware, business. According to a spokesperson for Parks Associate that Ars Technica spoke with, Vizio has 12 percent of connected TV OS market share. WSJ reported last week that Roku OS has more market share at 25 percent; although, a <a href="https://www.parksassociates.com/content/image/medias/578c5ccc4f80b5873fd5f0622b4273423f745f4bd184979d5f4fabb36da7162c.webp?q=75&amp;fm=webp">graph</a> that Parks Associates' rep sent to me suggests the percentage is smaller (Parks Associates' spokesperson wouldn't confirm Roku OS' market share or the accuracy of WSJ's report to Ars). Roku OS is on Walmart's "onn." TVs, but Walmart doesn't own Roku.</p>
<h2>Vizio TVs could get worse</h2>
<p>From the perspective of a company seeking to grow its ad business, buying Vizio seems reasonable. But from a user perspective, Vizio TVs risk becoming too centered on selling and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/double-screen-free-tv-will-show-you-ads-even-when-not-in-use/">measuring ads</a>.</p>
<p>There was already a large financial incentive for Vizio to focus on growing Platform+ and the profitability of SmartCast (in its most recent earnings report, Vizio said its average revenue per SmartCast user increased 14 percent year over year to $31.55). <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/vizio-tv-buyers-are-becoming-the-product-vizio-sells-not-just-its-customers/">For years</a>, Vizio's business has been more about selling ads than selling TVs. An acquisition focused on ads can potentially detract from a focus on improving Vizio hardware.</p>
<p>Stuffing more ads into TVs could also ruin the experience for people seeking a quality TV at a lower cost. While some people may be willing to sacrifice features and image quality to save money, others aren't willing to deal with more ads and incessant interest in viewer tracking for that experience. With Vizio expected to become part of a conglomerate eager to grow its ad business, it's possible that the ads experience on Vizio TVs could worsen.</p>

It’s a development that is changing the landscape of an area known for farming, military bases and Chitose airport. It’s a project that also aims to change the face of Japan’s chip industry.</p><p>A freshly created homegrown venture, Rapidus Corp., is looking to mass produce state-of-the art 2 nanometer logic chips in 2027 from an initial starting point of zero. By industry standards it’s an implausible challenge for an 18-month-old venture in a country that has fallen far behind overseas rivals on semiconductor production.But with the US and China sparring over access to the latest chipmaking expertise and equipment, Japan’s government has sensed an opportunity to leverage Washington’s concern over supply chain security to get back into a game it once dominated.</p><p>The stakes are huge. Advanced chips will serve as the foundation for a dozen critical technologies, including artificial intelligence, weapons systems and electric vehicles. A large portion of global production centers on Taiwan and South Korea, leaving future supplies vulnerable to regional tensions.</p><p>“There are geopolitical, economic security factors involved,” said Atsuo Shimizu, a Rapidus executive in charge of launching the new foundry. “To survive as a nation, Japan needs to be a global player with technology. And we can clearly demonstrate that with semiconductors.”</p><p>Tokyo has already shown it means business. In less than three years, Japan has earmarked about ￥4 trillion ($26.7 billion) for revitalizing its semiconductor punching power with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida targeting financial support for the industry to eventually reach ￥10 trillion with private sector support. Among the goals is a tripling of domestically produced chip sales to more than ￥15 trillion by 2030.</p><p>Japan’s new chip strategy has two main strands. First, the country is seeking to reestablish itself as a prime location for manufacturing legacy chips by luring to Japan the biggest foreign names in the industry with generous subsidies of up to half of the set-up costs.The second and more ambitious part of the strategy is the Rapidus project in Hokkaido aimed at restoring Japan’s place as a player at the forefront of silicon-chip wizardry.“Why do we do so much for chips? Honestly, that’s because there’s the US-China confrontation,” said Kazumi Nishikawa, principal director of economic security policy at Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry and one of the architects of the strategy. “If chip supplies from Taiwan halt, there will be negative impacts of trillions of dollars everywhere and economies will collapse.”</p><p>Already Tokyo can claim some success in the first and larger part of its strategy. The world’s biggest chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., has a $7 billion factory edging closer to production in Kumamoto, southern Japan, with another one to come and talk of a third. The Taiwanese giant has quickly realized that chip projects partly bankrolled by Tokyo can get off the ground a whole lot faster than in the US or other countries.</p><p>By drawing on the expertise of the world’s leading manufacturers, Japan hopes to recreate chip-related ecosystems that provide employment and renewed growth in its regional economies.Read More: Japan’s Chip Spree Aims to Kick Economy Into High GearAt the same time these moves will help strengthen Japan’s credentials as a key ally in a US-led global supply chain committed to keeping the production line of vital semiconductors rolling for everything from smartphones and cars to the latest missile systems.The fate of the second part of Tokyo’s strategy looks far less certain. The Rapidus project has generated both excitement and doubts. Its success hinges on achieving a huge technological jump with little idea of how costly or reliable the final output will be—or if there will be any buyers. It’s a target that even industry leaders are struggling to attain.</p><p>On the plus side, Japan can lean on the US as its ally this time around, rather than its technological foe—as was the case back in 1986 when Washington put pressure on Tokyo to limit its chip exports.As part of the Rapidus project, IBM Corp. is training about 100 veteran Japanese engineers in Albany, New York, to get them up to speed on frontier level US chip expertise.“We're partners, allies, collaborators in making sure that our national security, our economic securities are aligned, because the threat is coming from somewhere else. And that somewhere else is China,” US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said. “We're in the boat together and we're paddling in the same direction.”</p><p>Japan’s strategy marks a departure from previous attempts to support its chip industry that largely assumed it didn’t need outside help -- and ended in failure.</p><p>Along with TSMC, Micron Technology Inc., ASML Holding NV and Samsung Electronics Co. are also investing in production or research facilities in Japan as companies look for the best deals for shoring up their future output in an uncertain world.The speed of Japan’s assistance contrasts with the policy gridlock of the US. The 2022 Chips and Science Act set aside $39 billion in direct subsidies to ramp up manufacturing in the US, but the first major award of $1.5 billion only got announced this week. Labor and cost challenges have also delayed the start of production at TSMC’s new facility in Arizona. Over in Germany, budget turmoil has raised concerns about subsidies for TSMC and Intel Corp.“Japan this time has taken a bold approach and has implemented very quick decision-making,” Belgium-based microelectronics research hub Imec Chief Executive Officer Luc Van den hove said. “If I look back 20 years ago or 15 years ago, I think there was much more a closed policy especially from the government.”</p><p>The TSMC plants have ample reason to be successful. The technology for the first plant’s products, 12nm to 28nm logic chips, is already established. Kumamoto is on Japan’s southern island of Kyushu where there’s an ecosystem of about 1,000 related tech companies. And there are customers – including Japanese carmakers.</p><p>TSMC’s second foundry, officially announced earlier this month, will make 6nm to 7nm chips nearby. By 2037, tax revenues from the foundries are likely to have paid back the initial government outlays, according to lawmaker Yoshihiro Seki, secretary general of a coalition within Japan’s ruling party dedicated to chips.</p><p>Japan is an attractive location for other reasons, too. It has a highly disciplined workforce and reliable services. The plunge in the Japanese yen to its weakest levels in decades has also helped make the country far more affordable as a production base.Japan is also a key global supplier of some of the chemicals and equipment used in chipmaking. Some of those Japanese suppliers, including Tokyo Electron Ltd., have taken advantage of the flipside of the economic security concerns by tapping into a surge of Chinese demand as Beijing looks to ramp up its existing know-how before any more restrictions emerge.</p><p>While some of the reasons for Japan’s attractiveness as a chip-making base also hold true in northern Japan, the circumstances are quite different. Rapidus is starting out in a long-forgotten region for manufacturing with only about 20 local businesses related to chip making.Read More: Japan-Backed Startup Woos Suppliers to Make Chip Hub in HokkaidoExpertise at Japan’s national technology institute has long been stalled at 45 nm, so for Rapidus to reach significant output of 2nm chips using unproven IBM technology in around five years looks a very tall order. Even if Rapidus is able to hit its target by 2027, TSMC and Samsung will likely have already jumped into the market at volumes that will give them a cost advantage.</p><p>Shigeru Fujii headed chipmaking at Japan’s Fujitsu Ltd. when it lost out to cheaper Taiwanese and South Korean rivals in past decades. He’s yet to see evidence that Rapidus can break into the cut-throat global market.“The problem is: Will there be any customers?” Fujii said.</p><p>This time will be different, said Rapidus’s Shimizu, who worked under Fujii at Fujitsu. As its name suggests, Rapidus will add value to its products by shortening delivery time for its bespoke chips – not just via the manufacturing process, but also by helping customers shorten the time-consuming design process, he said.The company won’t be able to compete against TSMC and Samsung for commoditized devices so the company will aim for more of a premium niche market, Shimizu indicated.</p><p>A shift in technology could also help Rapidus, Shimizu added. The 2-nanometer chips it envisages will use a Gate-All-Around transistor structure instead of the current FinFET structure, making it easier for newcomers to break in, Shimizu said.“We can do it,” he said. “I don’t see any reason why we can’t.”</p><p>The government has so far promised ￥330 billion and earmarked an extra ￥646 billion in a fund to support the Rapidus project. That should cover half of an initial ￥2 trillion investment, but the private company has yet to say how it will raise the remaining cash or an extra ￥3 trillion needed to expand operations after the foundry is launched.In contrast to the government support Rapidus enjoys, the reaction from corporate Japan has been lukewarm. Big firms such as Toyota Motor Corp. have pledged only ￥7.3 billion for the venture so far.</p><p>What Bloomberg Intelligence Says…“The Japanese government's latest chip strategy looks better thought out than on previous occasions. The balance is a little skewed toward Rapidus and Kumamoto. Perhaps more could be done to support domestic chip design companies. The challenge for Rapidus is huge, and success probably shouldn't hinge on profits. If it can make any reliable 2 nanometer chips by 2027 that would be a success for Japan in terms of economic security.”-- Masahiro Wakasugi, BI industry analyst</p><p>Even if IBM trains engineers for the company, Rapidus will struggle to hire the 1,000 or so engineers and workers needed to launch the foundry, experts say. Japan’s chip sector hemorrhaged around 30% of its jobs in the two decades through 2019 as its share of the global chipmaking market fell from over 50% to less than 10%. That leaves a shortage of at least 40,000 workers over the next decade as the population declines, according to METI.</p><p>Takashi Yunogami is a former Hitachi Ltd. engineer who made news by fiercely criticizing past government initiatives in parliament right before the chip strategy was released. He likens Rapidus’s 2nm goal to a little leaguer in baseball trying to turn into superstar Shohei Ohtani overnight.</p><p>“Kids should dream, but if a baseball boy says he is trying to do well as a two-way player starting from tomorrow, I’d say, ‘Hold on. Let’s take it step by step,’” Yunogami said.</p><p>Still, in addition to the support from IBM, California-based Lam Research Corp. and Imec are planning to open shop in Hokkaido. Rapidus has also struck an agreement with Canada’s Tenstorrent Inc. to jointly develop semiconductor intellectual property in AI devices.“There are so many risks and challenges for Rapidus. It’s still in a research and development stage before becoming a business,” said METI’s Nishikawa.</p><p>Still, Japan’s hefty subsidies show a renewed determination at the trade and industry ministry to take advantage of a window of opportunity to claw back some of the nation’s chip power. They also reflect the view that in an increasingly hostile world it’s better to throw money at chip technology than to have no contingency plan at all.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, North Korea’s launching of missiles and China’s posturing toward Taiwan have reminded the world of the vital importance of securing chip supplies and strengthening defense systems.“Chips are used for drones, fighters, submarines and missiles,” said the LDP’s Seki. “If we can make others feel Japan can halt chip exports if they mess with us, that will mean our investment has served as a war deterrent, too.”</p><p>--With assistance from Takashi Mochizuki, Yuki Furukawa, Peter Elstrom and Vlad Savov.</p><p>Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/gene-therapy-makers-struggle-to-find-patients-for-miracle-cures?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/andreessen-horowitz-ups-its-game-in-dc-pursues-american-dynamism?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-20/podcast-the-rise-of-starlink-as-a-geopolitical-force?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-16/paramount-plus-struggles-leave-shari-redstone-exploring-sale?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-15/uber-profitability-comes-after-food-delivery-pandemic-investments?utm_campaign=bw&amp;utm_medium=distro&amp;utm_source=yahooUS" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable</a></p></li></ul><p>©2024 Bloomberg L.P.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>
Dear Mr. Architect!

</p><p>
Please design and build me a house. I am not quite sure of what I need, so
you should use your discretion. My house should have between two and
forty-five bedrooms. Just make sure the plans are such that the bedrooms
can be easily added or deleted. When you bring the blueprints to me, I
will make the final decision of what I want. Also, bring me the cost
breakdown for each configuration so that I can arbitrarily pick one.

</p><p>
Keep in mind that the house I ultimately choose must cost less than the
one I am currently living in. Make sure, however, that you correct all the
deficiencies that exist in my current house (the floor of my kitchen
vibrates when I walk across it, and the walls don't have nearly enough
insulation in them).

</p><p>
As you design, also keep in mind that I want to keep yearly maintenance
costs as low as possible. This should mean the incorporation of extra-cost
features like aluminium, vinyl, or composite siding. (If you choose not
to specify aluminium, be prepared to explain your decision in detail.)

</p><p>
Please take care that modern design practices and the latest materials are
used in construction of the house, as I want it to be a showplace for the
most up-to-date ideas and methods. Be alerted, however, that kitchen
should be designed to accommodate, among other things, my 1952 Gibson
refrigerator.

</p><p>
To insure that you are building the correct house for our entire family,
make certain that you contact each of our children, and also our in-laws.
My mother-in-law will have very strong feelings about how the house should
be designed, since she visits us at least once a year. Make sure that you
weigh all of these options carefully and come to the right decision. I,
however, retain the right to overrule any choices that you make.

</p><p>
Please don't bother me with small details right now. Your job is to
develop the overall plans for the house: get the big picture. At this
time, for example, it is not appropriate to be choosing the color of the
carpet. However, keep in mind that my wife likes blue.

</p><p>
Also, do not worry at this time about acquiring the resources to build the
house itself. Your first priority is to develop detailed plans and
specifications. Once I approve these plans, however, I would expect the
house to be under roof within 48 hours.

</p><p>
While you are designing this house specifically for me, keep in mind that
sooner or later I will have to sell it to someone else. It therefore
should have appeal to a wide variety of potential buyers. Please make sure
before you finalize the plans that there is a consensus of the population
in my area that they like the features this house has.

</p><p>
Please prepare a complete set of blueprints. It is not necessary at this
time to do the real design, since they will be used only for construction
bids. Be advised, however, that you will be held accountable for any
increase of construction costs as a result of later design changes.

</p><p>
You must be thrilled to be working on an interesting project as this! To
be able to use the latest techniques and materials and to be given such
freedom in your designs is something that can't happen very often. Contact
me as soon as possible with your complete ideas and plans.

</p><p>
P.S.: <br>
My wife has just told me that she disagrees with many of the instructions
I've given you in this letter. As architect, it is your responsibility to
resolve these differences. I have tried in the past and have been unable
to accomplish this. If you can't handle this responsibility, I will have
to find another architect.

</p><p>
P.P.S.: <br>
Perhaps what I need is not a house at all, but a travel trailer. Please
advise me as soon as possible if this is the case.

<p>A federal appeals court today overturned a $1 billion piracy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/12/cox-communications-hit-with-1-billion-verdict-over-music-piracy/">verdict</a> that a jury handed down against cable Internet service provider Cox Communications in 2019. Judges rejected Sony's claim that Cox profited directly from copyright infringement committed by users of Cox's cable broadband network.</p>
<p>Appeals court judges didn't let Cox off the hook entirely, but they vacated the damages award and ordered a new damages trial, which will presumably result in a significantly smaller amount to be paid to Sony and other copyright holders. Universal and Warner are also plaintiffs in the case.</p>
<p>"We affirm the jury's finding of willful contributory infringement," said a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920/gov.uscourts.ca4.161920.92.0.pdf">unanimous decision</a> by a three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. "But we reverse the vicarious liability verdict and remand for a new trial on damages because Cox did not profit from its subscribers' acts of infringement, a legal prerequisite for vicarious liability."</p>
<p>If the correct legal standard had been used in the district court, "no reasonable jury could find that Cox received a direct financial benefit from its subscribers' infringement of Plaintiffs' copyrights," judges wrote.</p>
<p>The case began when Sony and other music copyright holders sued Cox, claiming that it didn't adequately fight piracy on its network and failed to terminate repeat infringers. A US District Court jury in the Eastern District of Virginia found the ISP liable for infringement of 10,017 copyrighted works.</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Copyright owners want ISPs to disconnect users</h2>
<p>Cox's appeal was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/1-billion-piracy-ruling-could-force-isps-to-disconnect-more-internet-users/">supported by advocacy groups</a> concerned that the big-money judgment could force ISPs to disconnect more Internet users based merely on accusations of copyright infringement. Groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation also called the ruling legally flawed.</p>
<p>"When these music companies sued Cox Communications, an ISP, the court got the law wrong," the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/if-not-overturned-bad-copyright-decision-will-lead-many-americans-lose-internet">EFF wrote in 2021</a>. "It effectively decided that the only way for an ISP to avoid being liable for infringement by its users is to terminate a household or business's account after a small number of accusations—perhaps only two. The court also allowed a damages formula that can lead to nearly unlimited damages, with no relationship to any actual harm suffered. If not overturned, this decision will lead to an untold number of people losing vital Internet access as ISPs start to cut off more and more customers to avoid massive damages."</p>
<p>In today's 4th Circuit ruling, appeals court judges wrote that "Sony failed, as a matter of law, to prove that Cox profits directly from its subscribers' copyright infringement."</p>
<p>A defendant may be vicariously liable for a third party's copyright infringement if it profits directly from it and is in a position to supervise the infringer, the ruling said. Cox argued that it doesn't profit directly from infringement because it receives the same monthly fee from subscribers whether they illegally download copyrighted files or not, the ruling noted.</p>
<p>The question in this type of case is whether there is a causal relationship between the infringement and the financial benefit. "If copyright infringement draws customers to the defendant's service or incentivizes them to pay more for their service, that financial benefit may be profit from infringement. But in every case, the financial benefit to the defendant must flow directly from the third party's acts of infringement to establish vicarious liability," the court said.</p>

<p>This official website should be updated to warn people Google is apparently now hosting this dataset to make money.  I don’t think that was the original mission, but that’s what it is today, there’s basically zero customer support, and you can lose $14k in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Academics, especially grad students, need to be aware of this before they give a credit card number to Google.  In fact, I’d caution against using this dataset whatsoever with this new business model attached.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article role="main"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: A Bitcoin investor was recently scammed out of 9 Bitcoin (worth around $490K) in a fake “Exodus wallet” desktop application for Linux, published in the Canonical Snap Store. This isn’t the first time, and if nothing changes, it likely won’t be the last.</p><p><a href="https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/32394c8892f2076c"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/byebyebitcoin50.png" alt="Bye bye bitcoin"></a></p><p><em>This post turned out longer than I expected. So if you don’t have the time there’s a briefer summary at the bottom under “In summary (the tl;dr)” along with my suggestions on what Canonical should do now.</em></p><p>We talked about this in <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/23/">episode 23</a> of <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/">Linux Matters Podcast</a>, if you prefer a truncated audio version. The episode was recorded on 13th February 2024, and published on 20th February whereas this blog post is current as of the publication date.</p><p><a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/23/"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/linuxmatters-banner-3000x750_30.png" alt="Scam exodus app"></a></p><p><em>Patreon <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/support">supporters</a> of <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/">Linux Matters</a> can get the show a day early, and without adverts.</em> 🙏</p><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>For clarity, I used to work for Canonical on the Snapcraft team, but I no longer do. Now, I’m just some community guy who wants Ubuntu and Snapcraft to be a success. I’m writing this in the hope Canonical will fix its processes so reputation-damaging events like this don’t keep happening.</p><p>All of the words below are based on my external perspective of what happened. However, I have also drawn on my historic internal knowledge of the processes and how we dealt with this in the past. Though things may have changed in the two years since I left the company.</p><h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2><p>An application called “Exodus” was published in the Canonical Snap store on 6th February 2024. (<em>In the <a href="https://linuxmatters.sh/23/">podcast episode</a>, I mistakenly said the application had been published for 2 days. This is inaccurate. It was published for 6 days)</em>.</p><p>The application had a couple of screenshots, an icon, and a detailed description.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_crop_100.jpeg"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_crop_50.jpeg" alt="Exodus in the Snap store"></a></p><p>Early on Sunday 12th February a new <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/">Snapcraft forum</a> user named “castle” <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904">started</a> a short thread titled “<a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904">Exodus - Movement Exod</a>”. In it, they enquired:</p><blockquote><p>Can anyone tell if the Exodus wallet in Ubuntu’s software store is a scam? My wallet is empty after recovering and it shows a recent transaction of my entire balance sent to an address. I never made this transaction.</p></blockquote><p>I initially spotted this question early on that Sunday evening, some nine or ten hours after it was posted.</p><p><strong>Spoiler:</strong> <em>This “Exodus” application published in the Snap store was indeed a scam application. There is a genuine <a href="https://www.exodus.com/">organisation</a> that developed a real, seemingly ’legitimate’ cryptocurrency wallet application. This is not that.</em></p><h2 id="brief-analysis">Brief analysis</h2><p>Without wishing to give scammers a “<em>How to pass for a genuine application</em>” guide, I’ve taken a look at this one and present the details here so users are empowered to make educated decisions.</p><h3 id="store-page">Store page</h3><p>The “Exodus” application was published in the Snap store at <a href="https://snapcraft.io/exodus">https://snapcraft.io/exodus</a> but has subsequently been ‘quarantined’ by Canonical.</p><p><em>When a snap is ‘quarantined’, typically the owner’s account is disabled, their published snaps are moved to a Canonical-owned account, and the published revisions are ‘unpublished’. The net result is the application no longer appears in search results, visiting the store page returns a ‘404’, and the publisher can no longer access the package.</em></p><p>Below is a screen capture of the full Exodus Snap store page I took at the time.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_100.jpeg"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/Screenshot_12-2-2024_192925_snapcraft.io_50.jpeg" alt="Exodus in the Snap store"></a></p><p>The store page looks somewhat legitimate, to the untrained eye. The publisher’s name was “Movement Exod (movementexod)”, which also adds <em>some</em> legitimacy. It was published in the “Finance” category in the store.</p><p>The logo and screenshots are from the official upstream Exodus application. A lengthy text description provides some simple marketing about the platform.</p><p>Note the coloured map at the bottom of the page has multiple countries highlighted. This indicates the snap had (at the time of screenshot) at least ten installs in different countries. Therefore, our user is <strong>not</strong> the only person with this malware installed on their PC.</p><p>The application could also be viewed in the desktop “App Centre” (previously “Ubuntu Software”, a.k.a. “GNOME Software”) application storefront.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/gnome-software_100.png"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/gnome-software_50.png" alt="Exodus in the Ubuntu Store"></a></p><p>Interestingly we learned via their <a href="https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/exodus-movement-exod/38904/6">responses</a> that the desktop GUI was likely the way the “castle” user installed the Exodus application on their system. That’s pertinent given a later response where they ask why the snap is presented as “Safe” in the storefront. They likely saw a button like this in the “App Centre”, which gave them some confidence in the application.</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe.png"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe.png" alt="Exodus in the Snap store"></a></p><p>Furthermore the title of the Snapcraft web frontend says “<em>Snaps are containerised software packages that are simple to create and install. They auto-update and are safe to run.</em>”</p><p><a href="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe-to-run_100.png"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/safe-to-run_100.png" alt="Snapcraft title"></a></p><p><em>Are they though?</em></p><h3 id="a-peek-inside">A peek inside</h3><p>I wanted to take a look at the application itself. So on my workstation, in a separate virtual machine, I ran <code>snap download exodus</code> to download, but not install the application. I don’t have any cryptocurrency wallets on my system, but I didn’t know what the application might try to do, so for safety I didn’t run it directly on my computer.</p><p><em>A snap is just a squashfs file, typically containing an application, libraries, assets and metadata.</em></p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>alan@vm:~/temp$ file exodus_4.snap

It opens with a “Restore Wallet” dialog. If I enter random letters, it connects to some API at <a href="https://www.exchangerate-api.com/">https://www.exchangerate-api.com/</a> and fails (because I didn’t enter a real wallet phrase).</p><p>Sadly, looks very dodgy.</p><p>I’ve sent an email to the security team.

(an aside)</h2><p>How is it that people can so easily publish scam Bitcoin wallet applications in the Snap store?</p><p>Frankly, it’s by design. One of the goals is to automate the whole Snapcraft publishing and review pipeline so there’s fewer (expensive and slow) humans in the loop.</p><p>To register a name for any application in the store, all a scammer needs is a store account. They can use any old email address, and create a store account in minutes. They don’t need to pay, give a business address or validate their identity with a government ID.</p><p>Once they have a store account, they can login with the command-line <code>snapcraft</code> tool, used for building their dodgy snap.</p><p><code>snapcraft login MySuperGenuineAndLegitEmailHonestGuv@example.com</code></p><p>Then register the unique name for their dodgy snap.</p><p><code>snapcraft register mysuperbadwallet</code></p><p>Writing the application is not beyond any semi-competent app developer. Packaging the program as a snap is well documented, and comes with free community support. Although I imagine they’d have to ask for help with packaging their “<em>Modern network-enabled desktop application</em>” rather than with a “<em>Scam Bitcoin Wallet app</em>”.</p><p>The next step is to validate that the package will pass the automated Snap store review tools. Simply run <code>snap-review mysuperbadwallet.snap</code> and fix any errors it reports.</p><p>Uploading is as simple as <code>snapcraft upload mysuperbadwallet.snap --release=stable</code>. Once it’s uploaded and processed, the package will be <em>immediately</em> searchable, and available for <em>anyone</em>, almost <em>anywhere</em> to download, install and run it.</p><p>No humans in the loop. What could possibly go wrong?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames"><img src="https://popey.com/blog/images/2024-02-20/humansoutoftheloop.png" alt="Removing humans from the process never caused problems in Hollywood! /s"></a></p><h2 id="further-research">Further research</h2><p><em>Back to the scam Exodus Wallet snap…</em></p><p>The snapped application will have access to the <code>$HOME</code> directory, but not any hidden files or directories within home. This has always been seen as a useful protection against an application grubbing around in hidden folders, hoovering up wallets, ssh &amp; GPG keys, and other secrets.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span>alan@vm:~$ snap connections exodus

Along with the game they all got a bonus crypto miner running in the background on their computer.</p><p>Perhaps amusingly, the miner was disguised as a process called <code>systemd</code>, which could plausibly &amp; legitimately be consuming processing time on a client computer.</p><p>Canonical was <a href="https://github.com/canonical/snapcraft.io/issues/651">notified</a> via GitHub issue, by someone who spotted this early on Friday 11th May. I found out on Saturday morning while away from my PC, watching a football game. I pinged around some people out-of-hours and we had the applications unlisted from the store.</p><p>The following week, while back at our desks, and after considerable discussion and rumination, we figured out a plan to <em>un-minerize</em> the client machines. For clients, the Snap store is effectively anonymous, so we couldn’t notify people by email or popup that their machine was compromised.</p><p>We considered the options and eventually decided to pull a benevolent version of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/jul/17/amazon-kindle-1984">Amazon Kindle 1984 debacle</a>. We took ownership of the three games, re-packaged them <em>without</em> the crypto miner, and published that as an update to the Snap store.</p><p>Anyone who’d had the game+miner installed would get an automatic update, typically within a few hours of powering their computer on. This meant they could keep the game, and we’d throw away the miner.</p><p>The result being there were no longer versions of the miner running on client machines.</p><p>Now, some might argue this was a bad way to do it, and perhaps they’re right. It honestly felt like the least-worst option at the time though.</p><p><em>Thinking about this in retrospect, we likely could have done something better here.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/ledstud">https://mitxela.com/projects/ledstud</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39446537">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mxmain"><p><a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/hardware"><img onload="this.style.opacity=1;" src="https://mitxela.com/img/titles/mitxela_dot_com-65.png" title="Back to Hardware" alt="Back to Hardware"></a></p><p>20 Feb 2024<br><b>Progress: Complete</b></p><p>
I originally imagined the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/scaffold">LED Industrial Piercing</a> as a project specifically to make use of 0201 LEDs. In the end, they weren't even necessary. 0201 LEDs are just too small! Evidently, we needed to go deeper, so the purpose of this next project was to stick as many as possible of them onto the face of a stud earring.</p><p>

Watch the following youtube video for an extensively narrated journey.</p><p>

<iframe width="704" height="396" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHoGIvOi-jw" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>

Continue reading this page for an in-depth explanation.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>
These off-the-shelf LED stud earrings are very cheap. They have a tiny machined battery holder for two LR521 cells. The idea was to replace the plastic gemstone and single LED with our own circuit board, re-using the metalwork.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/ots.jpg" alt="Off-the-shelf LED stud earrings"></p><p>

Electrically, the circuit and firmware would be identical to <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/badge">the badge</a> I recently created using a CH32V003. Read that page for the story behind it and an explanation of how it works.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/badge/badgeon.jpg" alt="Badge illuminated"></p><p>

The challenge here is shrinking the design of the badge by a factor of 3 (or one-ninth the area) by shifting from an LED pitch of 3mm down to 1mm. We also insisted on not having a thick border around the board. This poses quite a challenge for routing the tracks.</p><p>

To give a sense of scale, here's three 0201 LEDs next to a regular surface mount LED:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/led-comparison.jpg" alt="Comparison of three 0201 LEDs with a regular SMD LED"></p><p>

Or, to really put it in perspective, an 0201 LED on the back of an ATtiny85:</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/attiny.jpg" alt="0201 LED on the back of an ATtiny85"></p><h3>Homebrew blind and buried vias</h3><p>
It's possible to get multilayer boards made with so-called blind and/or buried vias. The limit is far, far beyond what we're working with here. The "redistribution layer" of BGA packages is normally built as a very small, high-density circuit board. These often have very fine pin pitches and use blind vias, via-in-pad, and so on. The point is we could easily order a circuit board to these tolerances – if we had the cash for it.</p><p>

A small batch of HDI boards starts at several hundred dollars, and the more complex the stackup the more the price goes up. I would very much like to keep this entire project under $50 total.</p><p>

I decided to craft my own circuit board sandwich, two two-layer boards held together by an array of solder pads.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/board-render1.jpg" alt="3D render of the board"></p><p>

I wasn't sure if this was going to work. I put all the pads around around the perimeter, partly with the idea that I could inspect all the connections, of course that would mean removing the boards from the panel to do so, which I didn't want to do until the rest of the board is assembled. I suppose we could have started by fitting the components, and sandwiching the boards last, but that sounds like a recipe for disaster.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/board-render2.jpg" alt="3D render of the board"></p><p>

The drill diameter for the vias is 0.25mm, which puts us just into the second tier of board pricing (almost all of the cheapest PCB offers have minimum 0.3mm). It may have been possible to do a layout of 0201 LEDs within the cheapest tolerance, but I didn't want to risk it. Remember the distance from one LED to the next is 1mm. At this sort of scale, the copper thickness around a plated hole is noticeably uneven.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/board-kicad.png" alt="KiCad screenshot"></p><h3>Solder sandwich</h3><p>
As usual, I combined postage with several other orders, which leads to a mini-christmas when they all arrive.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/bare-board.jpg" alt="Unpopulated board, with a pile of others in the background"></p><p>

The main display is an 8x8 matrix at 1mm pitch. With the corners cut off to fit into the round profile, that adds up to 52 LEDs within a 9mm diameter circle. The panel top and bottom is 5mm wide. The whole panel is 23mm by 28.5mm.</p><p>

I stencilled paste onto one of the boards, and sat an unpasted board on top of it. The symmetrical panel helps ensure perfect alignment.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/sandwich1.jpg" alt="Two boards, one stencilled with paste, ready to sandwich"></p><p>

The total board thickness is 0.6mm, so our sandwich ends up a little over 1.2mm. This was reflowed in a fairly uneventful way.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/sandwich2.jpg" alt="Board sandwich"></p><p>

I probably should have used higher temperature solder for this step, as it would reduce the risk of these joints separating later on. On the other hand, I didn't want to risk messing this up, those pads are still quite small at 0.5mm diameter and it's not like I keep a whole range of solder pastes in stock. (They have a shelf life, and go off after a few months anyway.)</p><h3>Paste paste paste</h3><p>
I ordered a steel stencil along with the boards. I fit about six other designs into it, but even ordering a stencil for one board is normally viable, they're unbelievably cheap for what they are.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/stencil.jpg" alt="Closeup of stencil with finger for scale"></p><p>

My first mistake was not putting the fiducials on the stencil. Aligning the first board was easy enough, we could use the QFN pads to confirm it, but after cutting one board out of the panel, aligning the second board was very difficult.</p><p>

My second mistake is possibly making the holes for the 0201 pads too small. I probably could have gotten away with a smidgen larger, which would have made the stencilling process less stressful.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/stencil2.jpg" alt="Stencilling attempt"></p><p>

The first attempt wasn't too shabby, most of those pads are perfect with just a few under-pasted. I wiped this off and tried again a few times, I feel like with exactly the right amount of pressure and speed with the squeegee it should be possible to get it perfect.</p><p>

I didn't quite manage perfection, but got close enough to feel like moving onwards. I did clean the stencil at this point, but not sufficiently. The remaining residue would dry up and cause me to have a much less fun time when it came to the second earring.</p><h3>Pick and place</h3><p>
Presuming the reader has already watched the video, or at least perused the previous projects of the badge and the <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/candle">volumetric display</a>, it goes without saying that I planned to position the parts with the pick and place machine.</p><p>

0201 is well beyond the specified tolerance of it, so this was something of a gamble. It's not impossible to place 52 0201 LEDs by hand if it came to it, but I was really curious to see if I could do this, and if so, what further projects that opens up in future.</p><p>

The machine came with a selection of vacuum nozzles, most of which are cylindrical, but the very smallest is this shape.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/nozzle.jpg" alt="Close up of small vacuum nozzle"></p><p>

That oblong tip is a comparable size to the parts we're trying to pick up, so it wasn't clear if this would work, but in the end it didn't seem to have any problems in this aspect.</p><p>

The construction of the machine appears to be little more than a glorified 3D printer, but evidently it's built to a much sturdier tolerance. Once I'd calibrated the position of the components, it placed the first one absolutely spot-on.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/firstplace.jpg" alt="Placement of first component"></p><p>

The problems I initially encountered were less about component placement and more about the tape misbehaving. I have the machine on a very sturdy desk, but it still shakes about as it operates. This means parts as small as an 0201 LED are likely to go flying if the protective film on the tape is pulled back. The holes in the tape are at a 4mm pitch, just like all the other tapes, and most parts, even quite small ones, are placed at a 4mm spacing. It's only when you get to 0402 and 0201 that parts are placed at a closer spacing than the holes in the tape. This poses something of a problem for the mechanism used to advance the tape: the head has a solenoid pin which it inserts into a hole and pulls it forwards. For tapes with a 2mm spacing, it needs to advance by half a step instead of a full one.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/tapes.jpg" alt="Labelled tapes in the machine: 0603, 0402, 0201 and SOT23"></p><p>

The machine is able to do this, but the key factor in getting it to pick parts reliably was to offset the position of where it picks up the part out of the tape. The zero position is almost 4mm away from the area where the film is peeled back, which offered far too much leeway for parts to bounce away.</p><p>

I'll fast forward to the end of the first attempt.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/placement.jpg" alt="Top down view of LEDs placed on board"></p><p>

All in all I was pretty impressed with that. There's an obvious systematic error, all of the parts are a little too low, but that's just my inaccurate calibration, the placement is very consistent with itself. A few of the parts are skewwhiff, it's not clear if they jumped as they were put down, or if there was an error in the vision system. Even a small rounding error in the OpenCV outline logic could lead to it placing the parts at a weird angle. Luckily it's trivial to push the odd part back into place.</p><p>

After reflow, virtually all of them snapped into a perfect grid alignment. </p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/reflowed1.jpg" alt="LEDs after reflow"></p><p>

The result is quite a bit more consistent than my second attempt on video, just because I did a much worse job of stencilling the paste that time.</p><p>

Populating the back of the board was somewhat uneventful.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/reflowed2.jpg" alt="Rear side of the circuit"></p><p>

Uneventful, but not without suspense! It wasn't until this point we get to check if any of it works of course.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/firsttest.jpg" alt="Circuit illuminated"></p><p>

Sweet.</p><p>

After chopping this out of the surrounding frame, we took a moment to do some vanity shots with a coin for scale.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/coin1.jpg" alt="Circuit on a 50p coin"></p><p>

The 50p coin is of course a little large, so here's another shot on a 5p coin, much more appropriate.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/coin2.jpg" alt="Circuit on a 5p coin"></p><h3>Stud preparation</h3><p>
Under the plastic gemstone, the stud earring has a tiny circuit board with two components on it.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/stud1.jpg" alt="LED stud with gemstone removed"></p><p>

The case is the positive terminal of the battery. The negative terminal is a fine wire through the middle of the post. We just need to connect our circuit to these two points.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/assembly1.jpg" alt="Circuit ready to be set into the earring"></p><p>

Rather short-sightedly, I soldered the connections in place and set the circuit without fully testing it. I was exceptionally careful with setting the prongs, which was silly as I soon had to undo this and modify things.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/assembly2.jpg" alt="Circuit set within the prongs"></p><p>

The power draw of my original firmware was far too high, it's dumb I didn't see it coming. The teeny battery can't cope with the current draw, the voltage drops and the CH32V003's brownout detector resets the chip. With some further digging into the datasheet it might be possible to disable the brownout detector. I'm more used to the ATtiny chips, many of which are happy to run down to 1.8V. </p><p>

It is just about possible to reprogram the circuit with it set in place, I use a crocodile clip to connect the positive terminal, touch one wire to the end to make the ground connection, and then touch one more wire inside to make contact with the debug pin. However, doing this more than once is a right pain, so I opened up the earring again to do things properly.</p><p>

While we're at it, adding some capacitors is bound to help.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/assembly3.jpg" alt="Unset circuit and two capacitors added"></p><p>

That's a 22uF and a 0.1uF in parallel. Sometimes large-value, physically small ceramic capacitors have a high internal resistance so it can be helpful to combine multiple values in parallel like this.</p><p>

I dropped the clock speed of the chip from 48MHz to 1.5MHz, and one of the things I found is that this affects the debugger connection. Ordinarily this is fine, there's a utility that lets you "unbrick" the chip by power cycling it and immediately connecting. This unfortunately necessitates debug control of the power supply, which is why it becomes very fiddly in our situation, and is what led to me trying to connect to the earring post with crocodile clips.</p><p>

In the end I got the display into a state I was happy with, a duty cycle of about 0.25% and the reduced clock speed means the overall power draw is something like 8mA. </p><p>

With that, we were able to call it done, and begin work on the second one, which had the added fun of a video camera in the way of everything.</p><h3>Vanity shots</h3>
<p><img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/finished2.jpg" alt="Completed earring"></p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/finished1.jpg" alt="Two earrings completed"></p><p>

You may have clocked a certain amount of self-doubt I expressed as I came to set the circuit. It's an impressive electronics project, but is it an earring anyone would want to wear? To be fair, it's not like that's stopped me in the past from building <a href="https://mitxela.com/projects/knurled_earrings">utterly tasteless earrings</a> that no one would be seen dead with.</p><p>

But my friend seemed quite keen to try on more glowy glowy accessories. I suspect she secretly enjoyed being an ear model.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/finished5.jpg" alt="Earring being worn"></p><p>

One idea I'd meant to try with the industrial piercing is combining a long exposure with flash, to try and get a still image with LED trails.</p><p>

<img src="https://mitxela.com/img/uploads/blinken/ledstud/pov.jpg" alt="Long exposure LED trails of the earring being worn"></p><p>

This led to a somewhat inevitable conclusion. Believe it or not, it was her idea.</p><p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">KOSA remains a dangerous bill that would allow the government to decide what types of information can be shared and read online by everyone.

<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">What’s Changed in the Latest (2024) Version of KOSA</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">In its impact, the latest version of KOSA is not meaningfully different from those previous versions.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> The “duty of care” censorship section remains in the bill, though modified as we will explain below. The latest version removes the authority of state attorneys general to sue or prosecute people for not complying with the “duty of care.” But KOSA still permits these state officials to enforce other part of the bill based on their political whims and we expect those officials to use this new law to the same censorious ends as they would have of previous versions. And the legal requirements of KOSA are still only possible for sites to safely follow if they restrict access to content based on age, effectively mandating age verification. &nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">KOSA is still a censorship bill and it will still harm a large number of minors</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Duty of Care is Still a Duty of Censorship</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Previously, KOSA outlined a wide collection of harms to minors that platforms had a duty to prevent and mitigate through “the design and operation” of their product. This includes self-harm, suicide, eating disorders, substance abuse, and bullying, among others. This seemingly anodyne requirement—that apps and websites must take measures to prevent some truly awful things from happening—would have led to overbroad censorship on otherwise legal, important topics for everyone&nbsp;</span><a href="http://xn--as%20weve%20explained%20before-0y8r/"><span>as we’ve explained before</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The updated duty of care says that a platform shall “exercise reasonable care in the creation and implementation of any design feature” to prevent and mitigate those harms. The difference is subtle, and ultimately, unimportant. There is no case law defining what is “reasonable care” in this context. This language still means increased liability merely for hosting and distributing otherwise legal content that the government—in this case the FTC—claims is harmful.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Design Feature Liability</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The bigger textual change is that the bill now includes a definition of a “design feature,” which the bill requires platforms to limit for minors. The “design feature” of products that could lead to liability is defined as:</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><i><span data-contrast="auto">any feature or component of a covered platform that will encourage or increase the frequency, time spent, or activity of minors on the covered platform, or activity of minors on the covered platform.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">Design features include but are not limited to</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(A) infinite scrolling or auto play;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(B) rewards for time spent on the platform;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(C) notifications;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(D) personalized recommendation systems;</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(E) in-game purchases; or</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span data-contrast="auto">(F) appearance altering filters.</span></i><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">These design features are a mix of basic elements and those that may be used to keep visitors on a site or platform. There are several problems with this provision. First, it’s not clear when offering basic features that many users rely on, such as notifications, by itself creates a harm. But that points to the fundamental problem of this provision. KOSA is essentially trying to use features of a service as a proxy to create liability for speech online that the bill’s authors do not like. But the list of harmful designs shows that the legislators backing KOSA want to regulate online </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">content</span></i><span data-contrast="auto">, not just design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, if an online service presented an endless scroll of math problems for children to complete, or rewarded children with virtual stickers and other prizes for reading digital children’s books, would lawmakers consider those design features harmful? Of course not. Infinite scroll and autoplay are generally not a concern for legislators. It’s that these lawmakers do not like some lawful content that is accessible via online service’s features.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">What KOSA tries to do here then is to launder restrictions on content that lawmakers do not like through liability for supposedly harmful “design features.” But the First Amendment still prohibits Congress from indirectly trying to censor lawful speech it disfavors.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">We&nbsp;shouldn’t&nbsp;kid ourselves that the latest version of KOSA will stop state officials from targeting vulnerable communities.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Allowing the government to ban content designs is a dangerous idea. If the FTC decided that direct messages, or encrypted messages, were leading to harm for minors—under this language they could bring an enforcement action against a platform that allowed users to send such messages.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Regardless of whether we like infinite scroll or auto-play on platforms, these design features are protected by the First Amendment; just like the design features we </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">do </span></i><span data-contrast="auto">like. If the government tried to limit an online newspaper from using an infinite scroll feature or auto-playing videos, that case would be struck down. KOSA’s latest variant is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><b><span data-contrast="auto">Attorneys General Can Still Use KOSA to Enact Political Agendas</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As we mentioned above, the enforcement available to attorneys general has been narrowed to no longer include the duty of care. But due to the rule of construction and the fact that attorneys general can still enforce other portions of KOSA, this is cold comfort.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For example, it is true enough that the amendments to KOSA prohibit a state from targeting an online service based on claims that in hosting LGBTQ content that it violated KOSA’s duty of care. Yet that same official could use another provision of KOSA—which allows them to file suits based on failures in a platform’s design—to target the same content. The state attorney general could simply claim that they are not targeting the LGBTQ content, but rather the fact that the content was made available to minors via notifications, recommendations, or other features of a service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We shouldn’t kid ourselves that the latest version of KOSA will stop state officials from targeting vulnerable communities. And KOSA leaves </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">all</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> of the bill’s censorial powers with the FTC, a five-person commission nominated by the president. This</span> <span data-contrast="auto">still allows a small group of federal officials appointed by the President to decide what content is dangerous for young people. Placing this enforcement power with the FTC is still a First Amendment problem: no government official, state or federal, has the power to dictate by law what people can read online.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="auto">The Long Fight Against KOSA Continues in 2024</span></b><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/kids-online-safety-act-heavy-handed-plan-force-platforms-spy-young-people"><span>two years now</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, EFF has laid out the clear arguments against this bill. KOSA creates liability if an online service fails to perfectly police a variety of content that the bill deems harmful to minors. Services have little room to make any mistakes if some content is later deemed harmful to minors and, as a result, are likely to restrict access to a broad spectrum of lawful speech, including information about health issues like eating disorders, drug addiction, and anxiety.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The fight against KOSA has amassed an enormous coalition of people <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/07/young-people-should-oppose-kids-online-safety-act">of all ages</a> and all walks of life who know that censorship is not the right approach to protecting people online, and that the promise of the internet is one that must apply equally to everyone, regardless of age. Some of the people who have advocated against KOSA from day one have now graduated high school or college. But every time this bill returns, more people learn why we must stop it from becoming law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>What if the world of dark matter was a mirror of our own, just with a broken set of rules? That might explain why dark matter appears to be so abundant yet invisible, a new theory suggests.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/dark-matter.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/dark-matter.html"><u>Dark matter</u></a> is the mysterious, unknown substance that seems to make up the bulk of all the mass in the universe; for every 2 pounds (1 kilogram) of regular matter, there's roughly 10 pounds (5 kg) of dark matter. It doesn't interact with light or normal matter. The only way scientists can detect it is through its subtle gravitational influence on normal matter, such as the motions of stars within galaxies and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-detects-the-earliest-strand-in-the-cosmic-web-ever-seen" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-detects-the-earliest-strand-in-the-cosmic-web-ever-seen"><u>growth of super-large structures</u></a> in cosmic time.</p><p>It might be easy to think that because matter and dark matter operate with different rules, one would be totally dominant over the other. But despite having wildly different properties, the amounts of normal matter and dark matter are still in the same ballpark. That seems like a strange coincidence. &nbsp;To explain this, scientists proposed there could be some sort of hidden link between them. They published their research <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12286" target="_blank" data-url="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12286"><u>Jan. 22 on the preprint journal arXiv</u></a>.</p><p>The researchers posited that for every physical interaction in normal matter, there's a mirror of it in the world of dark matter. This would be a new kind of symmetry in nature, connecting the normal and dark matter worlds, the researchers said.</p><p>This symmetry would help explain why dark matter and regular matter have roughly the same abundances.</p><p><strong>Related: </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/our-universe-is-merging-with-baby-universes-causing-it-to-expand-new-theoretical-study-suggests" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/our-universe-is-merging-with-baby-universes-causing-it-to-expand-new-theoretical-study-suggests"><u><strong>Our universe is merging with 'baby universes', causing it to expand, new theoretical study suggests</strong></u></a></p><p>In the paper, the researchers point out another strange coincidence. In the physics of normal matter, a neutron and proton have almost exactly the same mass, which enables them to bind together and form stable atoms. If a proton was just a little bit heavier, it would be totally unstable and decay in only a few minutes, making the formation of atoms impossible. In this imaginary scenario, the universe would be left with a sea of free-floating neutrons.</p><p>Perhaps, the researchers suggest, this imaginary, broken cosmos may be a reality in the dark matter mirror version of our universe. A special combination of physics led to a proton having roughly the same mass as a neutron; perhaps in the dark matter mirror, that combination of physics played out differently, causing the "dark proton" to evaporate and leave behind a sea of "dark neutrons" — what we identify as dark matter.</p><p>While this proposed mirror model allows for the possibility of rich interactions among dark matter particles — dark atoms, dark chemistry and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/dark-matter-may-have-its-own-invisible-periodic-table-of-elements" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/dark-matter-may-have-its-own-invisible-periodic-table-of-elements"><u>dark periodic table of dark elements</u></a> — there can't be too much interaction, the researchers noted. If the dark matter interacts with itself a lot, it would tend to clump up far more than scientists think it does. So most of the dark matter has to be relatively simple — a sea of free-floating, neutral particles.</p><p>These additional interactions, which would be a dark mirror of our chemical world, may enable future scientists to test this theory. In the early universe, normal matter underwent nucleosynthesis, when the first elements formed in a nuclear plasma. If this new idea is correct, then there was a mirror nucleosynthesis also happening in dark matter. In those chaotic early days, channels may have opened up between the two worlds, enabling them to affect each other.</p><p>By carefully measuring the rate of element formation — something that the next generation of cosmological observatories hope to do — scientists may be able to find evidence for one of these channels and get a glimpse into the mirror dark universe.</p>

    </div><p>A study led by Western astrobiologist Catherine Neish shows the subsurface ocean of Titan—the largest moon of Saturn—is most likely a non-habitable environment, meaning any hope of finding life in the icy world is dead in the water.</p>


										      
																																	<p>This discovery means it is far less likely that space scientists and astronauts will ever find life in the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/outer+solar+system/" rel="tag">outer solar system</a>, home to the four 'giant' planets: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we will now need to be a little less optimistic when searching for extraterrestrial lifeforms within our own solar system," said Neish, an Earth sciences professor. "The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+community/" rel="tag">scientific community</a> has been very excited about finding life in the icy worlds of the outer solar system, and this finding suggests that it may be less likely than we previously assumed."</p>
<p>The identification of life in the outer solar system is a significant area of interest for planetary scientists, astronomers and government space agencies like NASA, largely because many icy moons of the giant planets are thought to have large subsurface oceans of liquid <a href="https://phys.org/tags/water/" rel="tag">water</a>. Titan, for example, is thought to have an <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ocean/" rel="tag">ocean</a> beneath its icy <a href="https://phys.org/tags/surface/" rel="tag">surface</a> that is more than 12 times the volume of Earth's oceans.</p>
<p>"Life as we know it here on Earth needs water as a solvent, so planets and moons with lots of water are of interest when looking for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/extraterrestrial+life/" rel="tag">extraterrestrial life</a>," said Neish, a member of Western's Institute for Earth and Space Exploration.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>In the <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ast.2023.0055">study</a>, published in the journal <i>Astrobiology</i>, Neish and her collaborators attempted to quantify the amount of organic molecules that could be transferred from Titan's organic-rich surface to its subsurface ocean, using data from impact cratering.</p>
<p>Comets impacting Titan throughout its history have melted the surface of the icy moon, creating pools of liquid water that have mixed with the surface organics. The resulting melt is denser than its icy crust, so the heavier water sinks through the ice, possibly all the way to Titan's subsurface ocean.</p>
<p>Using the assumed rates of impacts on Titan's surface, Neish and her collaborators determined how many comets of different sizes would strike Titan each year over its history. This allowed the researchers to predict the flow rate of water carrying organics that travel from Titan's surface to its interior.</p>
<p>Neish and the team found the weight of organics transferred in this way is quite small, no more than 7,500 kg/year of glycine—the simplest amino acid, which makes up proteins in life. This is approximately the same mass as a male African elephant. (All biomolecules, like glycine, use carbon—an element—as the backbone of their molecular structure.)</p>
<p>"One elephant per year of glycine into an ocean 12 times the volume of Earth's oceans is not sufficient to sustain life," said Neish. "In the past, people often assumed that water equals life, but they neglected the fact that life needs other elements, in particular carbon."</p>

																																			<p>Other icy worlds (like Jupiter's moons Europa and Ganymede and Saturn's moon Enceladus) have almost no carbon on their surfaces, and it is unclear how much could be sourced from their interiors. Titan is the most organic-rich icy moon in the solar system, so if its subsurface ocean is not habitable, it does not bode well for the habitability of other known icy worlds.</p>
<p>"This work shows that it is very hard to transfer the carbon on Titan's surface to its subsurface ocean—basically, it's hard to have both the water and carbon needed for life in the same place," said Neish.</p>

<p><b>Flight of the Dragonfly</b></p>
<p>Despite the discovery, there is still much more to learn about Titan, and for Neish, the big question is, what is it made of?</p>
<p>Neish is a co-investigator on the NASA Dragonfly project, a planned 2028 spacecraft mission to send a robotic rotorcraft (drone) to the surface of Titan to study its prebiotic chemistry, or how <a href="https://phys.org/tags/organic+compounds/" rel="tag">organic compounds</a> formed and self-organized for the origin of life on Earth and beyond.</p>
<p>"It is nearly impossible to determine the composition of Titan's organic-rich surface by viewing it with a telescope through its organic-rich atmosphere," said Neish. "We need to land there and sample the surface to determine its composition."</p>
<p>To date, only the Cassini–Huygens international space mission in 2005 has successfully landed a robotic probe on Titan to analyze samples. It remains the first spacecraft to land on Titan and the farthest landing from Earth a spacecraft has ever made.</p>

																																						
																																			<p>"Even if the subsurface ocean isn't habitable, we can learn a lot about prebiotic chemistry on Titan, and Earth, by studying the reactions on Titan's surface," said Neish. "We'd really like to know if interesting reactions are occurring there, especially where the organic molecules mix with liquid water generated in impacts."</p>

</figure><p>When Neish started her latest study, she was worried it would negatively impact the Dragonfly mission, but it has actually led to even more questions.</p>
<p>"If all the melt produced by impacts sinks into the ice crust, we wouldn't have samples near the surface where water and organics have mixed. These are regions where Dragonfly could search for the products of those prebiotic reactions, teaching us about how life may arise on different planets," said Neish.</p>
<p>"The results from this study are even more pessimistic than I realized with regards to the habitability of Titan's surface ocean, but it also means that more interesting prebiotic environments exist near Titan's surface, where we can sample them with the instruments on Dragonfly."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Years ago, Jeff Bezos famously quipped that "your margin is my opportunity."
This was of course aimed not at Amazon’s customers, but rather its
competitors, and it was deadly serious: customers of AWS in those bygone years
will fondly remember that every re:Invent brought with it another round of
price cuts.  This era did not merely reflect Bezos’s relentless execution, but
also a disposition towards who should reap the reward of advances in
underlying technology: Amazon believed (if implicitly) that improvements at
the foundations of computing (e.g., in transistor density, core count, DRAM
density, storage density, etc.) should reflect themselves in lower prices for
consumers rather than higher margins for suppliers.</p><p>Price cuts are no longer a re:Invent staple, having been replaced by a regular
Amazon tradition of a different flavor:  cutting depreciation (and therefore
increasing earnings) by
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/amazon_q4_2023/">extending the effective
life of their servers</a>.  (These announcements are understandably much more
subdued, as "my depreciation is my margin opportunity" doesn’t have quite the
same ring to it.)</p><p>As compute needs have grown and price cuts have become an increasingly distant
memory, some have questioned their sky-high cloud bills, wondering if they
should in fact be owning their compute instead of renting it.  When we started
Oxide, we knew from operating our own public cloud what those economics looked
like — and we knew that over time others of a particular scale would come to
the same realization that they would be better off not giving their margin
away by renting compute.  (Though it’s safe to say that we did not predict
that it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a30vFpSaoZg">DHH leading the
charge</a>!)</p><p>Owning one’s own cloud sounds great, but there is a bit that’s unsaid: <strong>what
about the software?</strong>  Software is essential for elastic, automated
infrastructure:  hardware alone does not a cloud make!  Unfortunately, the
traditional server vendors do not help here: because of a PC-era divide in how
systems are delivered, customers are told to look elsewhere for any and all
system software.  This divide is problematic on several levels.  First, it
impedes the hardware/software co-design that we (and, famously,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAfTXYa36f4">others</a>!) believe is essential to
deliver the best possible product.  Second, it leads to
<a href="https://twitter.com/_sysengineer/status/1487149172637712386">infamous finger
pointing</a> when the whole thing doesn’t work.  But there is also a thorny
economic problem:  when your hardware and your software don’t come from the
same provider, <strong>to whom should go the spoils of better hardware?</strong></p><p>To someone who has just decided to buy their hardware out of their frustration
with renting it, the answer feels obvious:  whoever owns the hardware should
naturally benefit from its advances!  Unfortunately, the enterprise software
vendor delivering your infrastructure often has other ideas — and because
their software is neither rented nor bought, but rather comes from the
hinterlands of software licensing, they have broad latitude as to how it is
priced and used.  In particular, this allows them to charge based on the
hardware that you run it on — to have <strong>per-core software licensing.</strong></p><p>This galling practice isn’t new (and is in fact as old as symmetric
multiprocessing systems), but it has taken on new dimensions in the era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiplet">chiplets</a> and packaging innovation: the
advances that your next CPU has over your current one are very likely to be
expressed in core count.  Per-core licensing allows a third party — who
neither made the significant investment in developing the next generation of
microprocessor nor paid for the part themselves — to exact a tax on improved
infrastructure.  (And this tax can be
<a href="https://news.vmware.com/company/cpu-pricing-model-update-feb-2020">shockingly
brazen</a>!) Couple this with
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/">the
elimination of perpetual licensing</a>, and software costs can potentially absorb
the entire gain from a next-generation CPU, leaving a disincentive to run
newer, more efficient infrastructure.  As an industry, we have come to accept
this practice, but we shouldn’t: in the go-go era of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling">Dennard scaling</a> (when clock
rates rose at a blistering rate), software vendors never would have been
allowed to get away with charging by the gigahertz; we should not allow them to
feel so emboldened to charge by core count now!</p><p>If it needs to be said, we have taken a different approach at Oxide:  when you
buy the <a href="https://oxide.computer/blog/the-cloud-computer">Oxide cloud computer</a>, <strong>all of the
software to run it is included</strong>.  This includes all of the software necessary
to run the rack as elastic infrastructure:
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/compute">virtual compute</a>,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/storage">virtual storage</a>,
<a href="https://oxide.computer/product/networking">virtual networking</a>.
(And yes, it’s all open source — which unfortunately demands the immediate
clarification that it’s <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/"><em>actually</em> open source</a>
rather than <a href="https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2018/12/16/a-eula-in-foss-clothing/">pretend open
source</a>.) When we add a new feature to our software, there is no licensing
enablement or other such nuisance — the feature just comes with the next
update.  And what happens when AMD releases a new CPU with twice the core
count?  The new sled running the new CPU runs along your existing rack — you’re not paying more than the cost of the new sled itself.  This gives the
dividends of Moore’s Law (or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuvp-e4ztC0">Wright’s Law</a>!) to whom they
rightfully belong:  the users of compute.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/usernames-header.png" alt="iPhone showing the creation of a Signal username, axolotl.99, on a lightly colored gradient background with floating numbers."></p><p>Signal’s mission and sole focus is private communication. For years, Signal has kept your messages private, your profile information (like your name and profile photo) private, your contacts private, and your groups private – among much else. Now we’re taking that one step further, by making your phone number on Signal more private.</p><p>Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>New default: Your phone number will no longer be visible to everyone in Signal</strong><ul><li>If you use Signal, your phone number will no longer be visible to everyone you chat with by default. People who have your number saved in their phone’s contacts will still see your phone number since they already know it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Connect without sharing your phone number</strong><ul><li>If you don’t want to hand out your phone number to chat with someone on Signal, you can now create a unique username that you can use instead (you will still need a phone number to sign up for Signal). Note that <em>a username is not the profile name that’s displayed in chats, it’s not a permanent handle, and not visible to the people you are chatting with in Signal.</em> A username is simply a way to initiate contact on Signal without sharing your phone number.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Control who can find you on Signal by phone number</strong><ul><li>If you don’t want people to be able to find you by searching for your phone number on Signal, you can now enable a new, optional privacy setting. This means that unless people have your exact unique username, they won’t be able to start a conversation, or even know that you have a Signal account – even if they have your phone number.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Right now, these options are in <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007318471-Signal-Beta">beta</a>, and will be rolling out to everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Note that even once these features reach everyone, <em>both you and the people you are chatting with</em> on Signal will need to be using the most updated version of the app to take advantage of them.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p><p>Importantly, all of this is optional. While we changed the default to hide your phone number from people who don’t have it saved in their phone’s contacts, you can change this setting. You are not required to create a username and you have full control over whether you want people to be able to find you by your phone number or not. Whatever choices work for you and your friends, you’ll still be able to communicate with your connections in Signal, past and present.</p><h2 id="keeping-your-phone-number-private-on-signal">Keeping your phone number private on Signal</h2><p>Once these features roll out, your phone number will no longer be visible in Signal to anyone running the latest version of Signal who doesn’t already have it saved in their phone’s contacts. This means that when you participate in group chats, message people 1-1, and make Signal calls, your phone number won’t show up unless the person has it saved (you can also limit this further, as detailed below). Your Signal profile name and photo will continue to be visible.</p><p>If you’d still like everyone to see your phone number when messaging them, you can change the default by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone Number &gt; Who can see my number. You can either choose to have your phone number visible to “Everyone” you message on Signal or “Nobody.” If you select “Nobody,” the only people who will see your phone number in Signal are people who already have it saved to their phone’s contacts.</p><div> <video width="100%" loop="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline=""> <source src="https://signal.org/blog/videos/usernames-pnp-sharing.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video><p>Changing your phone number privacy settings by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone number will change whether they see your phone number in your profile.</p></div><p>We’re also introducing a setting that lets you control who can find you by your phone number on Signal. Up until today, anyone who had your phone number–from a party flier, a business card, or somewhere else–could look you up on Signal by phone number and message you. You can now restrict this by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone Number &gt; Who can find me by my number and setting it to “Nobody.”</p><p>Selecting “Everybody” means that anyone who has your phone number can type it into Signal and send you a <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007459591-Signal-Profiles-and-Message-Requests#message_requests">message request</a> (which you can accept, reject, or block). This is still the default setting, and is how Signal has worked for years.</p><div> <video width="100%" loop="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline=""> <source src="https://signal.org/blog/videos/usernames-pnp-discovery.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video><p>Changing your phone number privacy settings by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Phone number will change how people can connect with you on Signal.</p></div><p>Selecting “Nobody” means that if someone enters your phone number on Signal, they will not be able to message or call you, or even see that you’re on Signal. And anyone you’re chatting with on Signal will not see your phone number as part of your Profile Details page – <em>this is true even if your number is saved in their phone’s contacts.</em> Keep in mind that selecting “Nobody” can make it harder for people to find you on Signal. If your friend downloads Signal and opens the app to see who they can message, they won’t know that they can message you. Instead, in order to connect on Signal you will need to share your full, unique username with them.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p><p>You can change these settings at any time to best suit the ways you want to connect with others on Signal.</p><h2 id="usernames-another-way-to-start-a-conversation">Usernames: Another way to start a conversation</h2><p>Until now, someone needed to know your phone number to reach you on Signal. Now, you can connect on Signal without needing to hand out your phone number. (You will still need a phone number to register for Signal.) This is where usernames come in.</p><p>Instead of giving out your phone number, you can now share a username. You can also generate a QR code or link that directs people to your username, letting them quickly connect with you on Signal.</p><div> <p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/usernames-link.png" alt="Two phones next to each other displaying the QR code and custom URLs to connect on Signal without sharing a phone number."></p><p>Generate a QR code or unique URL to connect on Signal without sharing your phone number by going to Profile &gt; QR Code or Link.</p></div><p>Usernames in Signal do not function like usernames on social media platforms. <strong>Signal usernames are not logins or handles that you’ll be known by on the app – they’re simply a quick way to connect without sharing a phone number.</strong> Your profile name remains whatever you set it to. Your username is not displayed on your Profile Details page, and people you message can’t see or find your username without your sharing it. Put another way, someone will need to know your exact unique username in order to start a chat with you on Signal. And Signal does not provide a searchable directory of usernames.</p><div> <video width="100%" loop="" muted="" autoplay="" playsinline=""> <source src="https://signal.org/blog/videos/usernames-chat-via-username.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video><p>To connect via username, type someone's exact username into the New Chat bar and send them a message. Once they accept your message request, you'll see their profile name in the chat.</p></div><p>We have also worked to ensure that keeping your phone number private from the people you speak with doesn’t necessitate giving more personal information to Signal. Your username is not stored in plaintext, meaning that Signal cannot easily see or produce the usernames of given accounts.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p><p>Usernames simply allow you to initiate a connection on Signal without sharing your phone number, and Signal’s robust privacy safeguards remain unchanged. Signal is built so that we do not know who you message, what you say, which group chats you participate in, who’s in your contact list, and more.</p><p>If you want to create a username, you can do so in Settings &gt; Profile. A username on Signal (unlike a profile name) must be unique and must have two or more numbers at the end of it; a choice intended to help keep usernames egalitarian and minimize spoofing. Usernames can be changed as often as you like, and you can delete your username entirely if you prefer to no longer have one.</p><div> <p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/usernames-profile.png" alt="Two phones next to each other. The phone on the left shows the creation of a username and the phone on the right shows where in your profile you can see your username. To create and edit a username, go to Settings > Profile."></p><p>To create a username, go to Settings &gt; Profile.</p></div><p>Once you’ve created a username, you can share it with others who can use it to connect with you. To connect with someone via their username, simply open the New Chat screen on Signal and type in their username.</p><p>Since Signal does not provide a searchable directory of usernames, only people who have your exact unique username will be able to start a conversation with you. And you can share it with as few or as many people as you want.</p><p>You can also share a QR code or unique URL that shortcuts to your username in Signal. You can reset these at any time without having to change your username, much like a group invite link.</p><p>Usernames in Signal are designed to be easily changeable. For example, you can make a username to connect with people at a conference or to plan a group trip. Then, when it’s over, change it if you want to. Just click on your username from your Profile Details page to make the changes you want. When you change your username, your Signal contacts are not notified because your username is not visible to the people you are chatting with 1-1 or in groups.</p><h2 id="to-recap">To Recap</h2><p>Starting soon, your phone number will no longer be visible to people you chat with on Signal, unless they have it in their phone’s contacts. You will also be able to configure a new privacy setting to limit who can find you by your phone number on Signal. And, you’ll now be able to create an optional username that you can share with the people you want to connect with on Signal.</p><p>For more information, you can take a look at our <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/articles/6712070553754">support center articles</a>.</p><p>Currently these new features are in beta but will be rolling out to everyone in a few weeks.</p><p><em>Thanks to Nina Berman, Jun Harada, Ehren Kret, Joshua Lund, Jim O’Leary, Alex Ristevski, and Meredith Whittaker for helping to author and edit this post.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>As of today, GOV.UK has a new crown in its logo. This blog post explains why we’ve made the change and how we’ve done it.</p>

<p>In September 2022, the <a href="https://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/news/item/205-royal-cypher">College of Arms announced His Majesty King Charles III’s Royal Cypher, which features the monarch’s chosen crown</a>. This Cypher features the Tudor Crown, rather than the St Edward’s Crown chosen by Queen Elizabeth II following her Accession in 1952. Her Royal Cypher was itself a change from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=de3b8b35270c999b&amp;sca_upv=1&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;q=george+vi+royal+cypher&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;fir=LXZ-txx3Nbl7DM%252CLdS6ECAQd4_BWM%252C_%253BeGoflW7o9rP-pM%252C9Be7cUnfpAGjuM%252C_%253BSlU07R1HgCHi3M%252CdJYgumc9Bes3-M%252C_%253BhXgtZQPxtsEcLM%252CLdS6ECAQd4_BWM%252C_%253BGLQmC--WXJ6MtM%252C8bMRuOXguKm8QM%252C_%253BEV2UcJPZXjtJzM%252CrQ55_EnOQY_dsM%252C_%253BY2kmzGA8EFw0xM%252CsDSIe2RhL9Fy_M%252C_%253B-tjlLMNH8FYt5M%252Cgk3W5OJMLZKadM%252C_%253BjLaNXzCOo-2TiM%252CV-Pb1JnXdnxinM%252C_%253BhkJMUEVXk2wdKM%252CC36nHMScJoRPeM%252C_%253BAJw67LW7D2mBoM%252C_CawYdWnVRbN9M%252C_%253Bc-63sONHRDdiLM%252CMq9_tfiuSx__qM%252C_%253BO854rE9M8HP9XM%252Cq5MJ315lLe3QxM%252C_%253BMPRr-jGtM7FYEM%252CXySPr0ao7Bp7OM%252C_%253BMrtBQUsU2M7hIM%252C93fGJgdnP_EIxM%252C_%253BDrEfFXAd7lqO4M%252Cq5MJ315lLe3QxM%252C_%253B2C-BmzAOn7f3DM%252C8bMRuOXguKm8QM%252C_%253BD04pcLVmjmQcPM%252CrcUdqvyn7dagHM%252C_%253BNqSBo8PHQBM10M%252CLdS6ECAQd4_BWM%252C_%253BvIW5qwz4ybjBbM%252CaYwoMEnmr5umwM%252C_%253B822TDb8N0_gNlM%252Cy3-eem7jovOYFM%252C_%253BYERCYLLf9H1lhM%252CxqNLkLNACfk2iM%252C_%253BRoY2yqwMABfdVM%252CdkBLFroGZ07hHM%252C_%253BnMcVOYV4eTB0tM%252CQBvxE14nOp3UsM%252C_%253Ba1BMvtU7SrS5YM%252Cyd7fOf5LxcQsaM%252C_%253BpunD3C0KNpl_pM%252CBXU0a8n_BK39TM%252C_%253BN3n_ePcH2X7neM%252C2tJmN1Z7LjzFoM%252C_%253Bipw6WN-N0-S9rM%252CvdfrQDV-_Dee3M%252C_%253B8AVijIJedGdlsM%252CgjbUvntJnnCysM%252C_%253B4eEItwGcMvvbMM%252C2tJmN1Z7LjzFoM%252C_&amp;usg=AI4_-kTIfFbvSwZoT-IWdeF_lAhJQZJw-A&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjDsu3hrKmEAxV3cfEDHWyuBLMQ7Al6BAglEDk&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=779&amp;dpr=2#imgrc=-tjlLMNH8FYt5M">her father King George VI</a>.</p>
<p>On each <a href="https://www.royal.uk/accession#:~:text=Accession%20describes%20the%20event%20of,Council%20in%20St%20James's%20Palace.">accession</a>, the monarch will choose a Royal Cypher, or symbol to represent their personal authority. You can see the <a href="https://www.postalmuseum.org/blog/royal-cypher-appearances/">Royal Cypher in many places</a>, for example post boxes, on police and military uniforms or on the side of official buildings.</p>
<p>Forms of the crown are being gradually updated across government to reflect the monarch’s choice of crown, featured in His Majesty’s Royal Cypher. This includes GOV.UK, the digital home of the government, which is a hugely important part of public life in the UK. The GOV.UK crown is one of many official instances of the crown so it forms one part of this change. For this work, we’re focusing on instances of the GOV.UK logo which do not include the Royal coat of arms or government departments’ crests.</p>
<h2>How the crown has changed</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-310x207.png" alt="Graphic showing GOV.UK's logo with new crown and design lines showing spacing" width="825" height="551" srcset="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-310x207.png 310w, https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-620x414.png 620w, https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking-768x512.png 768w, https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/02/3-artworking.png 1201w" sizes="(max-width: 825px) 100vw, 825px"></p>
<p>We wanted to create something that was faithful to both the official heraldry and the visual identity of GOV.UK. ​​We redrew a simplified version of the crown, making sure it appeared clearly at smaller sizes and lower resolutions. The different proportions of the new crown meant we had to subtly tweak the GOV.UK logo’s typography and spacing to complement it.</p>
<p>We worked with the Government Communication Service (GCS) and the Royal Household to confirm the final version.</p>
<h2>Rolling out the new crown</h2>
<p>GOV.UK’s crown is an important part of GOV.UK’s brand, which is one of the most recognisable digital services in the UK <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/ratings/technology/fame/digital-services/all">according to YouGov</a>. It has not been updated since the site went live in 2012, so we had to work out how to implement this change in a consistent and ordered way.</p>
<p>Once we had the new designs, we needed to roll it out across GDS-owned instances of the GOV.UK crown. This included the GOV.UK homepage, the sitewide menubar, and GDS owned apps, like the Identity Checker App.</p>
<p>However, this change is a cross-government effort. Although GOV.UK looks like a single thing to users, it’s made up of multiple different website domains, which are owned by various government departments. These departments are required to update the crown in their locally owned services and channels.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> makes it possible to do this in a consistent way through its centralised open-source codebase, GOV.UK Frontend. The Design System team updated the crown in versions 5.1, 4.8 and 3.15, to make sure that services using older versions of GOV.UK Frontend can update it as easily as possible.</p>
<p>We’re taking a phased approach to implementation, starting with the sitewide menu bar and homepage, and seeing it rolled out across GOV.UK in the next 2 weeks.</p>
<h2>It’s live</h2>

On the left is the former crown, and on the right, the new crown.</figcaption></figure>
<p>With huge thanks to teams across government, today is when the new crown is seen for the first time across GOV.UK.</p>
<p>It first went live on the GOV.UK homepage and in the sitewide menu bar. You can also see it in other GOV.UK domains such as campaign.gov.uk and blog.gov.uk.</p>
<p>Departments are making changes to their services between today and 1 March. During this time, users may see both new and old versions of the crown.</p>
<p>We also want to thank GCS for their support and for leading the wider changes to symbols of state; thank you.</p>
<h2>If you need support</h2>
<p>If you’re from a government department you can get support to update to the <a href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/staying-up-to-date/#staying-up-to-date-with-changes">latest version of the Design System</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/">https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39444282">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article lang="en">
    

    
    

    <div>
  

<p><a href="http://picat-lang.org/">Picat</a> is a research language intended to combine logic programming, imperative programming, and <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/minizinc/">constraint solving</a>. I originally learned it to help with vacation scheduling but soon discovered its <code>planner</code> module, which is one of the most fascinating programming models I’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>First, a brief explanation of <dfn>logic programming</dfn> (LP). In imperative and functional programming, we take inputs and write algorithms that produce outputs. In LP and constraint solving, we instead provide a set of equations and find assignments that satisfy those relationships. For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>main</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>Arr</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>,</span> <span>c</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>],</span>
  <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span>
  <span>member</span><span>(X,</span> <span>Arr),</span>
  <span>member</span><span>(Y,</span> <span>Arr),</span>
  <span>X</span> <span>!</span><span>=</span> <span>Y,</span>
  <span>println</span><span>([X,</span> <span>Y]).</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Non-function identifiers that start with lowercase letters are “atoms”, or unique tokens. Identifiers that start with uppercase letters are variables. So <code>[a, b, c, a]</code> is a list of four atoms, while <code>Arr</code> and <code>X</code> are variables. So <code>Member(X, Arr)</code> returns true as you’d expect.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is <code>Member(Y, Arr)</code>. Y wasn’t defined yet! So Picat finds a value for Y that <em>makes</em> the equation true. Y could be any of <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, or <code>c</code>. Then the line after that makes it impossible for <code>Y</code> to be <code>a</code>, so this prints either <code>ab</code> or <code>ac</code>. Picat can even handle expressions like <code>member(a, Z)</code>, instantiating Z as a list!</p>

<p><dfn>Planning</dfn> pushes this all one step further: instead of finding variable assignments that satisfy equations, we find variable <em>mutations</em> that reach a certain end state. And this opens up some really cool possibilities.</p>

<p>To showcase this, we’ll use Picat to solve a pathing problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>We place a marker on the grid, starting at the <em>origin</em> (0, 0), and pick another coordinate as the <em>goal</em>. At each step we can move one step in any cardinal direction, but cannot go off the boundaries of the grid. The program is successful when the marker is at the goal coordinate. As a small example:</p>

<pre><code>+---+
|   |
| G |
|O  |
+---+
</code></pre>

<p>One solution would be to move to (1, 0) and then to (1, 1).</p>

<p>To solve this with planning, we need to provide three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A starting state <code>Start</code>, which contains both the origin and goal coordinates.</li>
<li>A set of <dfn>action</dfn> functions that represent state transitions. In Picat these functions <em>must</em> all be named <code>action</code> and take four parameters: a current state, a next state, an action name, and a cost. We’ll see that all below.</li>
<li>A function named <code>final(S)</code> that determines if S is a final state.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once we define all of these, we can call the builtin <code>best_plan(Start, Plan)</code> which will assign <code>Plan</code> to the shortest sequence of steps needed to reach a final state.<sup id="fnref:best-plan"><a href="#fn:best-plan">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="our-first-implementation">Our first implementation</h3>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>import</span> <span>planner</span><span>.</span>
<span>import</span> <span>util</span><span>.</span>

<span>main</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
   <span>Origin</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>}</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>Goal</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>}</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>Start</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Origin,</span> <span>Goal}</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>best_plan</span><span>(Start,</span> <span>Path)</span>
   <span>,</span> <span>println</span><span>(Plan)</span>
   <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p><code>main</code> is the default entry point into a Picat program. Here we’re just setting up the initial state, calling <code>best_plan</code>, and printing <code>Plan</code>. <code>{a, b}</code> is the syntax for a Picat array, which is basically a tuple.</p>

<p>Every expression in a Picat body must be followed by a comma <em>except</em> the last clause, which must be followed with a period. This makes moving lines around <em>really annoying</em>. Writing it in that “bullet point” style helps a little.</p>

</details>




<p>Since <code>final</code> takes just one argument, we’ll need to store both the current position and the goal into said argument. Picat has great pattern matching so we can just write it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>final</span><span>({Pos,</span> <span>Goal})</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>Goal.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p>Without the pattern matching, we’d have to write it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>final</span><span>(S)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
  <span>S</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Pos,</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Pos</span> <span>=</span> <span>Goal</span>
  <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we write a second <code>final</code> predicate, the plan succeeds if <em>either</em> <code>final</code> returns true.</p>

</details>




<p>Finally, we need to define the actions which the planner can take. We only need one action here.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>action</span><span>(From,</span> <span>To,</span> <span>Action,</span> <span>Cost)</span> <span>?=&gt;</span>
  <span>From</span> <span>=</span> <span>{{Fx,</span> <span>Fy},</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Dir</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>},</span> <span>{</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>}]</span> 
  <span>,</span> <span>member</span><span>({Dx,</span> <span>Dy},</span> <span>Dir)</span>                    <span>% (a)</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Tx</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fx</span> <span>+</span> <span>Dx</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Ty</span> <span>=</span> <span>Fy</span> <span>+</span> <span>Dy</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>member</span><span>(Tx,</span> <span>0..10</span><span>)</span>                        <span>% (b)</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>member</span><span>(Ty,</span> <span>0..10</span><span>)</span>                        <span>% (b)</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>To</span> <span>=</span> <span>{{Tx,</span> <span>Ty},</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Action</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>move</span><span>,</span> <span>T[</span><span>1</span><span>]}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Cost</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
  <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p><code>From</code> is the initial state, <code>To</code> is the next state, <code>Action</code> is the name of the action— in this case, <code>move</code>.<sup id="fnref:structures"><a href="#fn:structures">1</a></sup> You can store metadata in the action, which we use to store the new coordinates.</p>

<p>Writing <code>action ?=&gt;</code> instead of <code>action =&gt;</code> makes <code>action</code> backtrackable, which I’ll admit I don’t <em>fully</em> understand? I’m <em>pretty sure</em> it means that if <em>this</em> definition of <code>action</code> pattern-matches but doesn’t lead to a viable plan, then Picat can try <em>other</em> definitions of action. This’ll matter more for later versions.</p>

<p>As with the introductory example up top, we’re using <code>member</code> to both <em>find</em> values (on line <code>(a)</code>) and <em>test values</em> (on lines <code>(b)</code>). Picat also has a non-assigning predicate, <code>membchk</code>, which just does testing. If I wasn’t trying to showcase Picat I could instead have use <code>membchk</code> for the testing part, which cannot assign.</p>

<p><code>Cost</code> is the “cost” of the action. <code>best_plan</code> tries to minimize the total cost. Leaving it at 1 means the cost of a plan is the total number of steps.</p>


</details>




<p>And that’s it, we’re done with the program. Here’s the output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; picat planner1.pi

[{move,{1,0}},{move,{2,0}},{move,{2,1}},{move,{2,2}}]
</code></pre>

<p>That’s a little tough to read, so I had Picat output structured data that I could process into a picture.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>main =&gt;</span>
<span> </span> Origin = {0, 0}
<span> </span> , Goal = {2, 2}
<span> </span> , Start = {Origin, Goal}
<span> </span> , best_plan(Start, Path)
<span>- , println(Plan)</span>
<span>+ , printf("Origin: %w\n", Origin)</span>
<span>+ , printf("Goal: %w\n", Goal)</span>
<span>+ , printf("Bounds: {10, 10}\n")</span>
<span>+ , printf("Path: ")</span>
<span>+ , println(join([to_string(A[2]): A in Plan], ", "))</span>
<span> </span> .
</code></pre></div>

<p>I used a <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/picat/src/format_path.raku">Raku script</a> to visualize it.<sup id="fnref:patreon1"><a href="#fn:patreon1">2</a></sup> Here’s what we now get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; raku format_path.raku -bf planner1.pi

+-----+
|     |
|     |
|  G  |
|  •  |
|O••  |
+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>To show that the planner can route around an “obstacle”, I’ll add a rule that the state <em>cannot</em> be a certain value:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span> </span> , Tx = Fx + Dx
<span> </span> , Ty = Fy + Dy
<span>+ , {Tx, Ty} != {2, 1}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<pre><code>+-----+
|     |
|     |
| •G  |
| •   |
|O•   |
+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>Let’s comment that out for now, leaving this as our current version of the code:</p>

<h3 id="adding-multiple-goals">Adding multiple goals</h3>

<p>Next I’ll add multiple goals. In order to succeed, the planner needs to reach every single goal in order. We start with one change to <code>main</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>main =&gt;</span>
<span> </span> Origin = {0, 0}
<span>- , Goal = {2, 2}</span>
<span>+ , Goal = [{2, 2}, {3, 4}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Goal now represents a “queue” of goals to reach, in order. Then we add a <em>new</em> action which removes a goal from our queue once we’ve reached it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="prolog"><span></span><span>action</span><span>(From,</span> <span>To,</span> <span>Action,</span> <span>Cost)</span> <span>?=&gt;</span>
  <span>From</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Pos,</span> <span>Goal}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Goal</span> <span>=</span> <span>[Pos|Rest]</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>To</span> <span>=</span> <span>{Pos,</span> <span>Rest}</span>
  <span>,</span> <span>Action</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>mark</span><span>,</span> <span>From[</span><span>1</span><span>]}</span>

  <span>.</span>
</code></pre></div>

<details>

  <summary>
    Explanation
  </summary>
  <p><code>[Head|Tail]</code> splits a list into the first element and the rest. Since <code>Pos</code> was defined in the line before, <code>Goal = [Pos|Rest]</code> is <em>only</em> true if the first goal on the list is equal to <code>Pos</code>. Then we drop that goal from our new state by declaring the new goal state to just be <code>Rest</code>.</p>

<p>(This is where backtracking with <code>?=&gt;</code> becomes important: if we didn’t make the actions backtrackable, Picat would match on the <code>move</code> first and never <code>mark</code>.)</p>

</details>




<p>Since we’re now destructively removing goals from our list when we reach them, <code>final</code> needs to be adjusted:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>final({Pos, Goal}) =&gt;</span>
<span>- Pos = Goal.</span>
<span>+ Goal = [].</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s it. We didn’t even have to update our first action!</p>

<h3 id="cost-minimization">Cost minimization</h3>

<p>Going through the goals in order doesn’t always lead to the shortest <em>total</em> path.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>main =&gt;</span>
<span> </span> Origin = {0, 0}
<span>- , Goal = [{2, 2}, {3, 4}]</span>
<span>+ , Goal = [{9, 2}, {0, 4}, {9, 6}, {0, 9}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<pre><code>+----------+

|O•••••••••|
+----------+
</code></pre>

<p>What if we didn’t care about the order of the goals and just wanted to find the shortest path? Then we only need to change two lines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span></span><span>action(From, T, Action, Cost) ?=&gt;</span>
<span> </span> From = {Pos, Goal}
<span>- , Goal = [Pos|Rest]</span>
<span>- , T = {Pos, Rest}</span>
<span>+ , member(Pos, Goal)</span>
<span>+ , T = {Pos, delete(Goal, Pos)}</span>
<span> </span> , Action = {mark, From[1]}
<span> </span> , Cost = 1
<span> </span> .
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now the planner can delete any goal it’s passing over regardless of where it is in the <code>Goal</code> list. So Picat can “choose” which goal it moves to next so as to minimize the overall path length.</p>

<h3 id="other-variations">Other variations</h3>

<p>Picat supports a lot more variations on planning:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>best_plan(S, Limit, Plan)</code> caps the maximum cost at <code>Limit</code>— good for failing early.</li>
<li>For each <code>best_plan</code>, there’s a <code>best_plan_nondet</code> that finds every possible best plan.</li>
<li><code>sequence(P, Action)</code> restricts the possible actions based on the current partial plan, so we can add restrictions like “you have to move twice before you turn”.</li>
</ul>

<p>The coolest thing to me is that the planning integrates with all the other Picat features. I whipped up a quick demo that combines planning and constraint solving. The <dfn>partition problem</dfn> is an NP-complete problem where you partition a list of numbers into two equal sums. This program takes a list of numbers and finds the sublist with the largest possible equal partitioning:<sup id="fnref:patreon2"><a href="#fn:patreon2">3</a></sup></p>

<p>This is all so mindblowing to me. It’s almost like a metaconstraint solver, allowing me to express constraints <em>on the valid constraints</em>.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-use-picat">Should I use Picat?</h2>

<p>Depends?</p>

<p>I would not recommend using Picat in production. It’s a research language and doesn’t have a lot of affordances, like good documentation or clear error messages. Here’s what you get when there’s no plan that solves the problem:</p>

<pre><code>*** error(failed,main/0)
</code></pre>

<p>But hey it runs on Windows, which is better than 99% of research languages.</p>

<p>Picat seems more useful as a “toolkit” language, one you learn to solve a specific class of computational problems, and where you’re not expecting to maintain or share the code afterwards. But it’s really good in that niche! There’s a handful of problems I struggled to do with regular programming languages and constraint solvers. Picat solves a lot of them quite elegantly.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-other-planning-languages">Appendix: Other planning languages</h2>

<p>While originally pioneered for robotics and AI, “planning” is most-often used for video game AIs, where it’s called “Goal Oriented Action Planning” (GOAP).  Usually it’s built as libraries on top of other languages, or implemented as a <a href="https://artint.info/3e/html/ArtInt3e.Ch3.html">custom search strategy</a>. You can read more about GOAP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140613121607/http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="https://planning.wiki/guide/whatis/pddl">PDDL</a>, a planning description language that independent planners take as input, in the same way that DIMACS is a description format for <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/sudoku/">SAT</a>.</p>

But as Toby points out, these lack many of the features that we used to take for granted on Facebook — for instance, creating events, inviting friends, setting up groups (non-messaging ones, which were more like forums), and the serendipity/utility of a high-quality feed which included people you cared about.</p><p>To paraphrase Toby a little more: there should be money in making old Facebook even just for cross-promotion. For instance, you could imagine providing the good parts of old Facebook as a draw into an everything app like WeChat. Then, you have plenty of routes to monetization — you can do the ad thing, or make money through transaction fees on other products and services accessed in the same convenient one-stop shop.</p><p>Here are some thoughts I had about why the new version of old Facebook doesn’t exist:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Preferences changed? </strong><span>Maybe billions of people (or at least hundreds of millions) </span><em>have </em><span>changed their preferences. Possible that the world has collectively wised up to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification" rel="">enshittification</a><span> and no longer trusts social networks to be a good place for your social graph, but is fine with social networks using the (lower stakes) content graph.</span></p><ul><li><p>That would explain why messaging, which is mostly based on phone contacts and therefore more in the user’s control, would be the place people now trust for their social graph. I’m not sure anyone thinks about this though, to be honest.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>No more attention left? </strong><span>Maybe the rise of the content graph, and its exceptional ability to grab attention (think about how addictive TikTok is), crowds out any new social network competitor. You can’t launch old Facebook because it won’t be as exciting, as compelling, as shareable as TikTok — so it won’t grow fast enough and will fail to become relevant. </span><a href="https://12challenges.substack.com/p/a-typology-of-the-social-media-feed" rel="">The reds in my draft typology</a><span> are where it’s at. You won’t be able to claim even 5 minutes a day away from people’s TikTok usage.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Antitrust has been weak? </strong><span>Up until recent moves by antitrust bodies in the US and EU, Facebook could simply buy out any threat to them, including any new version of old Facebook.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Social graph burnout? </strong><span>Maybe there’s a limit to how many times people want to (re)make their social graph — people who invested in making their Facebook social graph can’t be bothered to do it again. I don’t think so though. Plenty of other apps create social graphs, e.g. Strava, and usually it’s by stealth, in a way that doesn’t feel like effort. Also, in this version of the world we’d expect that the younger generation, who never did the whole Facebook thing, would still be open to a new version of old Facebook. </span></p></li></ul><p><span>Please drop suggestions in the comments. This is a question I’m very interested in, and I’m going to dig deeper in future articles as I explore the </span><a href="https://12challenges.substack.com/p/a-typology-of-the-social-media-feed" rel="">typology of social media</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>*Or ‘e14n’ as Toby put it — a </span><a href="https://a16z.com/" rel="">tongue-in-cheek contraction</a><span> which </span><a href="https://mastodon.social/@louisbarclay/111964531880850866" rel="">got a nice boost on Mastodon from Cory Doctorow</a><span>, creator of the original term.</span></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Process large volumes of production data, immediately leading to better response quality. LlamaCloud launches with the following key components:</p><ol><li id="fac2"><strong>LlamaParse:</strong> Proprietary parsing for complex documents with embedded objects such as tables and figures. LlamaParse directly integrates with LlamaIndex ingestion and retrieval to let you build retrieval over complex, semi-structured documents. You’ll be able to answer complex questions that simply weren’t possible previously.</li><li id="415d"><strong>Managed Ingestion and Retrieval API:</strong> An API which allows you to easily load, process, and store data for your RAG app and consume it in any language. Backed by data sources in <a href="https://llamahub.ai/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">LlamaHub</a>, including LlamaParse, and our data storage integrations.</li></ol><p id="5e55">LlamaParse is available in a public preview setting starting today. It can currently handle PDFs and usage is capped for public use; <a href="https://llamaindex.ai/contact" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">contact us</a> for commercial terms. The managed ingestion and retrieval API is available as a private preview; we are offering access to a limited set of enterprise design partners. If you’re interested, <a href="https://llamaindex.ai/contact" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">get in touch</a>. (We’ve also launched a <a href="https://www.llamaindex.ai/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">new version of our website</a> 🦙!)</p><h2 id="894a">RAG is Only as Good as your Data</h2><p id="f442">A core promise of LLMs is the ability to automate knowledge search, synthesis, extraction, and planning over any source of unstructured data. Over the past year a new data stack has emerged to power these context-augmented LLM applications, popularly referred to as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This stack includes loading data, processing it, embedding it, and loading into a vector database. This enables downstream orchestration of retrieval and prompting to provide context within an LLM app.</p><p id="c160">This stack is different from any ETL stack before it, because unlike traditional software, every decision in the data stack directly <strong>affects the accuracy</strong> of the full LLM-powered system. Every decision like chunk size and embedding model affects LLM outputs, and since LLMs are black boxes, you can’t unit test your way to correct behavior.</p><p id="4d67">We’ve spent the past year hard at work at the forefront of providing tooling and educating users on how to build high-performing, advanced RAG for various use cases. We crossed the 2M monthly download mark, and are used by large enterprises to startups, including Adyen, T-Systems, Jasper.ai, Weights and Biases, DataStax, and many more.</p><p id="0a33">But while getting started with our famous 5-line starter example is easy, building production-grade RAG remains a complex and subtle problem. In our hundreds of user conversations, we learned the biggest pain points:</p><ul><li id="fdb2"><strong>Results aren’t accurate enough:</strong> The application was not able to produce satisfactory results for a long-tail of input tasks/queries.</li><li id="97dd"><strong>The number of parameters to tune is overwhelming:</strong> It’s not clear which parameters across the data parsing, ingestion, retrieval.</li><li id="2625"><strong>PDFs are specifically a problem:</strong> I have complex docs with lots of messy formatting. How do I represent this in the right way so the LLM can understand it?</li><li id="6e64"><strong>Data syncing is a challenge:</strong> Production data often updates regularly, and continuously syncing new data brings a new set of challenges.</li></ul><p id="9b57">These are the problems we set out to solve with LlamaCloud.</p><h2 id="e0fd">Data Pipelines to Bring you to Production</h2><p id="53ac">We built LlamaCloud and LlamaParse as the data pipelines to get your RAG application to production more quickly.</p><h2 id="888d">LlamaParse</h2><p id="f959">LlamaParse is a state-of-the-art parser designed to specifically unlock RAG over complex PDFs with embedded tables and charts. This simply wasn’t possible before with other approaches, and we’re incredibly excited about this technology.</p><figure><figcaption>LlamaParse Demo. Given a PDF file, returns a parsed markdown file that maintains semantic structure within the document.</figcaption></figure><p id="7d47">For the past few months we’ve been obsessed with this problem. This is a surprisingly prevalent use case across a variety of data types and verticals, from ArXiv papers to 10K filings to medical reports.</p><p id="1e5c">Naive chunking and retrieval algorithms do terribly. We were the first to propose a <a href="https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/query_engine/pdf_tables/recursive_retriever.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">novel recursive retrieval RAG technique</a> for being able to hierarchically index and query over tables and text in a document. The only challenge that remained was how to properly parse out tables and text in the first place.</p><figure><figcaption>Comparison of LlamaParse vs. PyPDF over the Apple 10K filing. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fyQAg7nOtChQzhF2Ai7HEeKYYqdeWsdt/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Full comparisons are here</a>. A green highlight in a cell means that the RAG pipeline correctly returned the cell value as the answer to a question over that cell. A red highlight means that the question was answered incorrectly.</figcaption></figure><p id="8596">This is where LlamaParse comes in. We’ve developed a proprietary parsing service that is incredibly good at parsing PDFs with complex tables into a well-structured markdown format. This representation directly plugs into the advanced Markdown parsing and recursive retrieval algorithms available in the open-source library. The end result is that you are able to build RAG over complex documents that can answer questions over both tabular and unstructured data. Check out the results below for a comparison:</p><figure><figcaption>Comparison of baseline PDF approach (top) vs. LlamaParse + advanced retrieval (bottom)</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Results over the <a href="https://github.com/run-llama/llama-hub/tree/main/llama_hub/llama_datasets/10k/uber_2021" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Uber 10K Dataset</a>.

We saw some incredible applications of LlamaParse in action, <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://blog.llamaindex.ai/pioneering-the-future-of-housing-introducing-genai-driven-adu-planning-ea950be71e2f">including parsing building codes for Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) planning</a>, <a href="https://devpost.com/software/home-ai" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">parsing real-estate disclosures for home buying</a>, and dozens more.</p><p id="e999">Eric Ciarla, co-founder at Mendable AI, incorporated LlamaParse into Mendable’s data stack: “We integrated LlamaParse into our <a href="https://github.com/mendableai/data-connectors" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">open source data connector repo</a> which powers our production ingestion suite. It was easy to integrate and more powerful than any of the alternatives we tried.”</p><p id="f99d">We’re also excited to be joined by initial launch partners and collaborators in the LLM and AI ecosystem, from storage to compute.</p><p id="4c43"><strong>DataStax</strong></p><p id="1965">Datastax has incorporated LlamaParse into their RAGStack to bring a privacy-preserving out-of-the-box RAG solution for enterprises: "Last week one of our customers Imprompt has launched a pioneering 'Chat-to-Everything' platform leveraging RAGStack powered by LlamaIndex to enhance their enterprise offerings while prioritizing privacy." said Davor Bonaci, CTO and executive vice president, DataStax. "We're thrilled to partner with LlamaIndex to bring a streamlined solution to market. By incorporating LlamaIndex into RAGStack, we are providing enterprise developers with a comprehensive Gen AI stack that simplifies the complexities of RAG implementation, while offering long-term support and compatibility assurance.”</p><p id="9514"><strong>MongoDB</strong></p><p id="a3a9">“MongoDB’s partnership with LlamaIndex allows for the ingestion of data into the MongoDB Atlas Vector database, and the retrieval of the index from Atlas via LlamaParse and LlamaCloud, enabling the development of RAG systems and other AI applications,” said Greg Maxson, Global Lead, AI Ecosystems at MongoDB. “Now, developers can abstract complexities associated with data ingestion, simplify RAG pipeline implementations, and more cost effectively develop large language model applications, ultimately accelerating generative AI app development and more quickly bringing apps to market.”</p><p id="8e0b"><strong>Qdrant</strong></p><p id="9363">André Zayarni, CEO of Qdrant, says “The Qdrant team is excited to partner with LlamaIndex to combine the power of optimal data preprocessing, vectorization, and ingestion with Qdrant for a powerful fullstack RAG solution.”</p><p id="b6bb"><strong>NVIDIA</strong></p><p id="0675">We are also excited to collaborate with NVIDIA to integrate LlamaIndex with the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ai-enterprise/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">NVIDIA AI Enterprise</a> software platform for production AI: “LlamaCloud will help enterprises get generative AI applications from development into production with connectors that link proprietary data to the power of large language models,” said Justin Boitano, vice president, Enterprise and Edge Computing, NVIDIA. “Pairing LlamaCloud with NVIDIA AI Enterprise can accelerate the end-to-end LLM pipeline — including data processing, embedding creation, indexing, and model inference on accelerated computing across clouds, data centers and out to the edge.”</p><h2 id="fc7f">FAQ</h2><p id="313f"><strong>Is this competitive with vector databases?</strong></p><p id="323e">No. LlamaCloud is focused primarily on data parsing and ingestion, which is a complementary layer to any vector storage provider. The retrieval layer is orchestration on top of an existing storage system.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-1474926564874918617" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>In recent years, flash-based SSDs have largely replaced disks for most storage use cases. Internally, each SSD consists of many independent flash chips, each of which can be accessed in parallel. Assuming the SSD controller keeps up, the throughput of an SSD therefore primarily depends on the interface speed to the host. In the past six years, we have seen a rapid transition from SATA to PCIe 3.0 to PCIe 4.0 to PCIe 5.0. As a result, there was an explosion in SSD throughput:
<img src="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/dbtrends/ssd-bandwidth.svg" width="90%">  </p>

<p>
At the same time, we saw not just better performance, but also more capacity per dollar:
</p>
<p><img src="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/dbtrends/ssd-capacity.svg" width="90%"></p><p>
The two plots illustrate the power of a commodity market. The combination of open standards (NVMe and PCIe), huge demand, and competing vendors led to great benefits for customers. Today, top PCIe 5.0 data center SSDs such as the <a href="https://europe.kioxia.com/en-europe/business/ssd/enterprise-ssd.html">Kioxia CM7-R</a> or <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/emea/ssd/enterprise-ssd/pm1743/">Samsung PM1743</a> achieve up to 13 GB/s read throughput and 2.7M+ random read IOPS. Modern servers have around 100 PCIe lanes, making it possible to have a dozen of SSDs (each usually using 4 lanes) in a single server at full bandwidth. For example, in our lab we have a single-socket Zen 4 server with 8 Kioxia CM7-R SSDs, which achieves 100GB/s (!) I/O bandwidth:</p>
<p><img src="https://db.in.tum.de/~leis/dbtrends/iostat.png" width="90%"></p><p>
AWS EC2 was an early NVMe pioneer, launching the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-i3-instances-for-demanding-io-intensive-applications/">i3 instance</a> with 8 physically-attached NVMe SSDs in early 2017. At that time, NVMe SSDs were still expensive, and having 8 in a single server was quite remarkable. The per-SSD read (2 GB/s) and write (1 GB/s) performance was considered state of the art as well. Another step forward occurred in 2019 with the launch of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-the-next-generation-i3en-of-i-o-optimized-ec2-instances/">i3en instances</a>, which doubled storage capacity per dollar.</p>

<p>
Since then, several NVMe instance types, including i4i and im4gn, have been launched. Surprisingly, however, the performance has not increased; seven years after the i3 launch, we are still stuck with 2 GB/s per SSD. Indeed, the venerable i3 and i3en instances remain the best EC2 has to offer in terms of IO/$ and SSD capacity/$, respectively. Personally, I find this very surprising given the SSD bandwidth explosion and cost reductions we have seen on the commodity market. At this point, the performance gap between state-of-the-art SSDs and those offered by major cloud vendors, especially in read throughput, write throughput, and IOPS, is nearing an order of magnitude. (Azure's top NVMe instances are only slightly faster than AWS's.)</p>

<p>
What makes this stagnation in the cloud even more surprising is that we have seen great advances in other areas. For example, during the same 2017 to 2023 time frame, EC2 network bandwidth exploded, increasing from 10 Gbit/s (c4) to 200 Gbit/s (c7gn). Now, I can only speculate why the cloud vendors have not caught up on the storage side:
</p><ul>
<li> One theory is that EC2 intentionally caps the write speed at 1 GB/s to avoid frequent device failure, given the total number of writes per SSD is limited. However, this does not explain why the read bandwidth is stuck at 2 GB/s.</li>
<li> A second possibility is that there is no demand for faster storage because very few storage systems can actually exploit tens of GB/s of I/O bandwidth. See our <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2090-haas.pdf">recent VLDB paper</a>. On the other hand, as long as fast storage devices are not widely available, there is also little incentive to optimize existing systems.</li>
<li> A third theory is that if EC2 were to launch fast and cheap NVMe instance storage, it would disrupt the cost structure of its other storage service (in particular EBS). This is, of course, the classic innovator's dilemma, but one would hope that one of the smaller cloud vendors would make this step to gain a competitive edge.</li>
</ul>


<p>
Overall, I'm not fully convinced by any of these three arguments. Actually, I hope that we'll soon see cloud instances with 10 GB/s SSDs, making this post obsolete.

            <p>
              The new initiative urges the University to adopt six new measures, which include more thorough protections on free speech, a commitment to institutional neutrality and new guidelines regarding donor influence.            </p>

                <p>Ellie Park, Photography Editor</p>
                                  
                                                    <p><span>Over 100 faculty members now have their signatures displayed on a </span><a href="https://facultyforyale.yale.edu/homepage"><span>website</span></a><span> for a new faculty group, Faculty for Yale, which “insist[s] on the primacy of teaching, learning and research as distinct from advocacy and activism.”</span></p>
<p><span>Among other measures, the group calls for “a thorough reassessment of administrative encroachment” and the promotion of diverse viewpoints. The group also calls for a more thorough description of free expression guidelines in the Faculty Handbook; Yale’s current guidelines are based on its 1974 </span><a href="https://secretary.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/freedom1975.pdf"><span>Woodward Report</span></a><span>. The group also wants Yale to implement a set of </span><a href="https://president.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/Report%20of%20the%20GPRC%20(FINAL).pdf"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> regarding donor influence, which were first put forth by the </span><a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2022/09/26/salovey-promises-to-clarify-donorship-protocols/"><span>Gift Policy Review Committee</span></a><span> in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span>On its site, Faculty for Yale outlines issues that it claims stem from Yale’s “retreat from the university’s basic mission.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Faculty for Yale is a spontaneously coalescing group of (so far) over 100 faculty from throughout the university who wish to support our university in re-dedicating itself to its historic and magnificent mission to preserve, produce, and transmit knowledge,” professor of social and natural science Nicholas Christakis wrote to the News. “We believe that any loss of focus on this deep, fundamental, and important mission may contribute to a range of challenges being faced in universities like ours nowadays.”</span></p>
<p><span>Faculty for Yale also urges the University to adopt the University of Chicago’s </span><a href="https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/KalvenRprt_0.pdf"><span>Kalven Committee report</span></a><span> that urges institutional neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span>However, in an interview with the News in November, Salovey said that although more college presidents might be considering the principle of institutional neutrality “because they realize how fraught it has become to speak out” on the issues of the day, he does not yet hold that view. He added, though, that “it’s a worthy view to consider.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I still think that we are going to want to speak out as leaders in higher education on issues of the day, but the decision about when to and when not to is not an easy one,” Salovey said. “I tend to use a criteria of how directly our campus is affected by whatever the incident in the world is but that’s still not a perfect criteria … there are atrocities all over the world, and I’ve probably not spoken out on more of them than I have spoken on.”</span></p>
<p><span>Christakis, speaking on behalf of the group, told the News that “we hope to meet” with Salovey.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Howard Forman, a professor at the School of Management, said that he signed the letter in part to emphasize Yale’s “promises for advancing and disseminating knowledge” amid the presidential search process. Forman also called himself a “big fan” of Salovey.</span></p>
<p><span>“He has served us extremely well, facing numerous internal and external upheavals and facing up to Yale’s own troubling history,” Forman said. “This letter does not sit in judgment of him or his predecessors. It speaks to our future and how we all can be better.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although the group was formed in December, a column published </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-country-and-for-yale-26be12fd"><span>last month</span></a><span> in the Wall Street Journal discussed emails from Christakis and law professor Kate Stith — sent to their faculty colleagues — in which they expressed views now available on Faculty for Yale’s site.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Other signatories include the Trumbull and Grace Hopper heads of college — biomedical engineering professor Fahmeed Hyder and sociology professor Julia Adams, respectively. Hyder did not respond to the News’ request for comment.</span></p>
<p><span>Adams wrote to the News that academic freedom, which she described as “the bedrock of the advancement of knowledge through teaching and learning,” needs support at Yale and other colleges and universities.</span></p>
<p><span>“The concerns articulated in the FfY formation statement pertain to universities — and not their members! — as activists,” Adams wrote. “I consider myself something of an activist on behalf of academic freedom, scholarship, and the mission of the university. But there will also come times, as the Kalven Report notes, in which colleges and universities confront threats to their very mission, and must seek to defend their fundamental values. That is happening worldwide.”</span></p>
<p><span>Similar efforts at other universities have emerged in recent months, including Harvard’s </span><a href="https://sites.harvard.edu/cafh/about/"><span>Council on Academic Freedom</span></a><span>, Princeton’s </span><a href="https://jmp.princeton.edu/princeton-principles-campus-culture-free-inquiry"><span>Princeton Principles for a Campus Culture of Free Inquiry</span></a><span> and the University of Pennsylvania’s </span><a href="https://pennforward.com/"><span>pennforward.com</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All such efforts formally began within the last year.&nbsp;</span></p>

With Valve's release today of the Steam Audio SDK 4.5.2 they have made the software development kit fully open-source under an Apache 2.0 license.
</p><p>
<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-audio/releases/tag/v4.5.2">Steam Audio 4.5.2</a> may not sound exciting in the context of a version number but as described in the release announcement is now "the first open source release of the Steam Audio SDK source code." The rest of this work in this Steam Audio SDK release amounts to bug fixes and other standard changes.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=steam_audio" alt="Steam Audio SDK logo"></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/596420/eventcomments/4361243264663731579?snr=2_groupannouncements_detail_">SteamCommunity.com</a> announcement posted today entitled "Steam Audio Open Source Release", it notes:
</p><blockquote>"The entire Steam Audio codebase, including both the SDK and all plugins, is now released under the Apache 2.0 license. This allows developers to use Steam Audio in commercial products, and to modify or redistribute it under their own licensing terms without having to include source code. We welcome contributions from developers who would like to fix bugs or add features to Steam Audio."</blockquote>
<p>Kudos to Valve on this fully open-source Steam Audio SDK, plug-ins included. Just the latest great open-source/Linux work from Valve.
</p><p>
Steam Audio is described by Valve as an immersive audio solution for games and VR. Plug-ins exist for Unity, Unreal Engine, and other game engines.
