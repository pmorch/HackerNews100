The G-Drive has been in use since 2018, requiring government officials to store all work documents in the cloud instead of on personal computers. It provided around 30 gigabytes of storage per person.  </p><div><p><h2><strong>Related Article</strong></h2></p></div>  &nbsp;  <p>   However, due to the system’s large-capacity, low-performance storage structure, no external backups were maintained — meaning all data has been permanently lost.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The scale of damage varies by agency. The Ministry of Personnel Management, which had mandated that all documents be stored exclusively on G-Drive, was hit hardest. The Office for Government Policy Coordination, which used the platform less extensively, suffered comparatively less damage.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     The Personnel Ministry stated that all departments are expected to experience work disruptions. It is currently working to recover alternative data using any files saved locally on personal computers within the past month, along with emails, official documents and printed records.  </p><div>              <p><img alt="A firefighter cools down burnt batteries at the National Information Resources Service (NIRS) in Daejeon on Sept. 27.

This vulnerability ultimately left it unprotected.  </p><p>   &nbsp;     Criticism continues to build regarding the government's data management protocols.  </p><p> <i>This article was originally written in Korean and translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><cite>Updated at 1:15 p.m. ET on September 12, 2025</cite></small></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree was lit, COVID-19 was still a mysterious respiratory illness in Wuhan, and I was a Ph.D. candidate in a dying field: comparative literature. I was getting ready to Zoom interview for a tenure-track job near Boston that I almost certainly wouldn’t get (and didn’t). Sardined with me in a Greenwich Village coffee shop in December 2019, one of my faculty mentors talked me through, for the thousandth time, the questions I should expect the hiring committee to ask me and dispensed advice about how I should answer them. Then we walked back to his office, lined in handsome foreign-language editions of various novels and works of philosophy, where I would sit for the interview. There, he offered a final piece of wisdom: “Don’t be nervous. It’s just Harvard,” he said, grinning. “It’s not like it’s Chicago.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A joke, but not entirely. For as long as I can remember, and certainly much longer than that, the University of Chicago has been widely viewed as the destination for humanities students and scholars. Some other elite schools might have the coveted Ivy League branding, or a few more famous faculty members, or a couple more dollars to tack onto the salaries of its professors and graduate students. But perhaps nowhere is the study of literature, philosophy, the arts, and languages more valued, their spirit more authentically preserved, their frontiers more doggedly pursued, than at Chicago. The university has had several household names on its humanities faculty, including the firebrand critic Allan Bloom, the novelist Saul Bellow, and the ethicist Martha Nussbaum, as well as scholars who may be less well known to the general public but whose work has been deeply influential in their fields, including the brilliant literary critic Sianne Ngai and Fred Donner, the pathbreaking and Guggenheim-winning historian of early Islam. In short, Chicago is a place for scholars’ scholars. At least, that’s the reputation. And Chicago’s reputation is no doubt why, when the university announced recently that it was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/08/15/university-of-chicago-phd-admissions-humanities/">reducing Ph.D. admissions</a> for seven departments—among them art history and English language and literature—and outright freezing admissions to others, including classics, the decision was met, in some quarters, with fury and disbelief. “Chicago!” as one stunned academic friend put it in a text to me.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In an August 12 email to faculty, Deborah Nelson, Chicago’s arts and humanities dean, said that the changes were necessitated by “this moment of uncertainty” and “evolving fiscal realities.” These bits of bureaucratese appear to be allusions to both the Trump administration’s war on higher education and Chicago’s homegrown financial troubles, which include an eye-popping $6.3 billion in debt. “To be anything but cautious at this moment,” the dean’s email continued, “would be irresponsible.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2025/02/grad-school-admissions-trump-cuts/681848/">Read: Grad school is in trouble</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Chicago’s social-sciences division has also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/admissions/graduate/2025/08/21/more-uchicago-phd-programs-will-pause-admissions">announced</a> doctoral-admissions pauses, primarily in humanistic-leaning programs such as anthropology and social thought, where towering figures including the philosopher Hannah Arendt once taught. What’s happening at Chicago is a particular gut-punch to the humanities, not just at the university itself, but nationally and even globally. The school is, as the classics professor Catherine Kearns put it in a message to me, “a singular center for the pursuit of humanistic knowledge and intellectual growth.” Of the nearly 30 Chicago humanities professors I spoke with for this article, many emphasized that the stakes are much higher than the fate of prospective graduate students or the professors who might teach them. Chicago has long helped to keep alive tiny fields and esoteric areas of humanistic study, particularly in the languages. Without the university’s support, and the continued training of graduate students who can keep these bodies of knowledge going, entire spheres of human learning might eventually blink out.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Of course, some might view these comments as self-serving complaints. But the primary fears of the people I spoke with were not about their own careers or futures, but instead about their fields—about knowledge that, once lost, cannot be easily regained. “If you allow a field to die, there’s a loss to something like humanity,” Clifford Ando, a Chicago classicist who has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.compactmag.com/article/the-crisis-of-the-university-started-long-before-trump/">outspoken</a> about the administration’s maneuvers, told me. “There’s also a real practical risk that a field simply cannot be re-created just because you have books.” I heard this sentiment echoed over and over. “If we stop producing people who are trained or educated to help undergraduates understand the most important things thought or written or painted in human history,” the renowned philosopher Robert Pippin said, “we might not be able to recover that.” Elaine Hadley, an emerita professor of English, told me, “Part of what we do is we’re conservators, keeping a body of knowledge going. We want to innovate and we want to think new things about it, and, you know, we want to make it relevant to the present day, but we’re also trying to keep this knowledge alive.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These responses emphasize the cultural costs of shrinking the number of people trained in humanities fields, rather than focusing on the question of whether universities should be calibrating the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/04/bad-job-market-phds/479205/">production of Ph.D.s</a> to the academic job market. No one I spoke to was insensitive to the pressures their grad students face when confronting the vanishing opportunities for tenure-track employment. But the professors also seemed reluctant to define the success of a program by how many professors it creates—after all, most humanities PhD students at Chicago do not pay tuition and receive stipends to cover their living costs, and getting paid to learn and read is not the worst fate.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">These faculty perspectives also stood in stark contrast with the reigning image of elite higher educators in right-wing media outlets: that humanities professors are “woke” activists whose primary concern is the political indoctrination of “the youth.” Most of the Chicago faculty I spoke with saw—and defended—their disciplines in terms that were, if anything, conservative. Implicit in their impassioned defenses was the belief that the role of a humanist is to preserve knowledge, safeguard learning from the market and the tides of popular interest, and ward off coarse appeals to economic utility.</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Depending on whom I asked, the move to scale back humanities doctoral programs is either a prudent acknowledgment of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">cratered job market</a> for tenure-track professorships and a wise attempt to protect the university’s humanities division from looming financial and political risks, or it is a cynical effort, under cover of the Trump administration’s assaults, to transfer resources away from “impractical,” unprofitable, and largely jobless fields (such as, say, comparative literature) and toward areas that the university’s senior leadership seems to care about (such as, say, STEM and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mfvpartners.com/2025/05/29/harper-court-ventures-launches-with-25-million-supporting-university-of-chicago-deep-tech-startups/">“innovation”</a>). One faculty member I spoke with mentioned <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chicagomaroon.com/48215/news/uchicago-arts-humanities-division-to-restructure-amid-historic-funding-pressures/">a consulting firm</a> that was brought on to help Chicago as it considers changes to its humanities division, including possibly consolidating the departments from 15 down to eight. Many professors worried that the move to impose uneven changes—reducing admissions in some while halting them in others—may be an attempt to create circumstances that will ultimately make it easier to dissolve the paused programs. “Let no good crisis go unleveraged,” Holly Shissler, an associate professor in the Middle Eastern Studies department, said with a dark laugh. “You engineer a situation in which there are no students, and then you turn around and say, ‘Why are we supporting all these departments and faculty when they have no students?’”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/08/trump-university-presidents/683803/">Read: The elite-university presidents who despise one another</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I emailed Nelson and asked whether the changes were part of a plan to kill off the paused departments, she said, “A one-year pause is exactly that—a discrete decision that applies merely to a single admissions cycle.” She seemed to acknowledge, however, that a divisional reorganization could happen. “My goal is to sustain the full scope of our faculty’s research and teaching,” she said. “To do so, we must be open to new ideas and structures.” She added, “There’s no magic number of departments in the arts and humanities.” In the meantime, Chicago’s humanities professors appear largely determined to resist being evaluated in terms of expediency. In a meeting with Nelson a few days after the announcement, 14 out of 15 chairs in the humanities division told the dean that she should pause enrollment in all of their departments or none of them. Targeting some and not others was unacceptable, they argued, because it sent the message that some fields matter and others do not.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The department chairs’ wager seems to be that acting as a unified bloc will make reorganizing the division and cutting programs more difficult, even if the division-wide pause causes short-term pain for the next academic year. As anyone who has served on a faculty anywhere can tell you, this degree of cross-department solidarity and willingness to sacrifice for less-favored colleagues is remarkable, and even moving. Last Wednesday afternoon, the dean announced that the chairs had gotten their wish: With the exception of philosophy and music composition (owing to previous pauses in those programs), doctoral admissions will be frozen across the humanities for the 2026–27 academic year.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It’s a bittersweet victory, of course, one that will result in fewer doctoral students in the short term and is not guaranteed to strengthen the division in the long term. And it does not settle the most pressing question raised by all this turmoil. If even Chicago is not willing to support and protect American arts and letters, who will? One Chicago administrator, in an attempt to defend the university’s admissions pauses, pointed out that other prestigious peer institutions were expected to make similar announcements about their Ph.D. admissions in the coming weeks, and noted that Harvard is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/8/24/arts-humanities-budget-cuts/#:~:text=Harvard's%20Arts%20and%20Humanities%20division%20instructed%20department%20heads%20to%20collectively,Sciences%20implement%20cost%2Dcutting%20plans.">cutting</a> nearly $2 million from its own humanities division. I would like to think that my (and others’) alarm about the future of the humanities is overblown.

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2025/09/caisi-evaluation-deepseek-ai-models-finds-shortcomings-and-risks">NIST’s September 30 report on DeepSeek</a> isn’t about security. It’s about control. This post explains what the man behind the curtain doesn’t want you to notice.</p>
<h2 id="heading-nists-deepseek-evaluation-is-a-hit-piece">NIST's DeepSeek "Evaluation" is a Hit Piece</h2>
<p>NIST’s recent report on DeepSeek is not a neutral technical evaluation. It is a political hit piece disguised as science. There is no evidence of backdoors, spyware, or data exfiltration. What is really happening is the U.S. government using fear and misinformation to sabotage open science, open research, and open source. They are attacking gifts to humanity with politics and lies to protect corporate power and preserve control. DeepSeek’s work is a genuine contribution to human knowledge, and it is being discredited for reasons that have nothing to do with security. Before diving in, let’s unpack what DeepSeek actually did and what NIST is really claiming.</p>
<h3 id="heading-whats-actually-going-on">What’s Actually Going On</h3>
<p>On September 30, 2025, NIST released its so-called technical evaluation of DeepSeek’s AI models. The report triggered panic online: claims that DeepSeek’s weights are compromised, that China is spying through the models, or that downloading them is a security risk.</p>
<p>All of that is false.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: The NIST report provides <strong>zero</strong> <strong>evidence</strong> that DeepSeek's model weights contain backdoors, surveillance mechanisms, or any malicious code whatsoever.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-deepseek-actually-did">What DeepSeek Actually Did</h2>
<p>DeepSeek built competitive AI models. Not perfect, but impressive given their budget. They spent far less than OpenAI or Anthropic and still achieved near-frontier performance.</p>
<p>Then they open-sourced everything under Apache 2.0:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The model weights</p>
</li>
<li><p>The architecture</p>
</li>
<li><p>The training methodology</p>
</li>
<li><p>The research papers</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They made it possible for anyone to reproduce their work and run a frontier-scale model locally. And to recreate it all from scratch. That is one of the biggest contributions to open AI research in years.</p>
<p>The U.S. government’s response? A report labeling them "adversary AI" and implying espionage.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-core-deception">The Core Deception</h2>
<p>Here’s the trick NIST pulled.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> You use DeepSeek’s App and/or API. Your prompts go to servers in China. That is a real data sovereignty issue, the same as it would be for any model served in a foreign country or an untrusted service provider.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> You download the open weights and run them locally. No data leaves your machine.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario C:</strong> You run DeepSeek’s model hosted on a trusted third-party service provider such as OpenRouter, Fireworks, or Chutes. In that case, the infrastructure and privacy controls depend on the hosting provider, not on DeepSeek.</p>
<p>These are completely different situations, but NIST intentionally blurred them together. The report counts local downloads while warning about "national security risks." That is misleading, and anyone with basic technical knowledge knows it.</p>
<p>This conflation sets the stage for the rest of the report’s misleading framing.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-nist-actually-found">What NIST Actually Found</h2>
<p>Strip away the inflammatory language and here's what they demonstrated:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>DeepSeek models are easier to jailbreak than heavily safety-tuned U.S. models.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They echo Chinese government perspectives sometimes</p>
</li>
<li><p>They perform slightly worse on certain benchmarks</p>
</li>
<li><p>They allegedly cost more per token (no methodology provided)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>No evidence of malicious behavior. No proof of data exfiltration. Nothing that shows these models do anything nefarious beyond "respond to prompts in ways we don't like."</p>
<p>The jailbreaking finding? That's because DeepSeek spent less on safety training. It's a resource issue. NIST conveniently didn't test historical U.S. models for comparison. And meanwhile OpenAI’s gpt-oss-120b is hilariously easy to jailbreak.</p>
<p>The "CCP narratives" finding? A model trained on Chinese data reflects Chinese perspectives (and they are subject to Chinese censorship laws). This is not surprising - and it is not a security vulnerability.</p>
<p>And once you see what they left out, the agenda becomes even clearer.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-missing-comparisons">The Missing Comparisons</h2>
<p>Here's what NIST didn't do:</p>
<p><strong>They didn't compare to other open models.</strong> Where's Llama? Mistral? Falcon? If they had, they'd reveal this isn't a DeepSeek problem—it's that open models generally have fewer safety layers than proprietary ones.</p>
<p><strong>They didn't compare to early U.S. models.</strong> How vulnerable was GPT-3 to jailbreaking in 2020? We'll never know, because that would undermine the narrative.</p>
<p><strong>They didn't test U.S. models for U.S. bias.</strong> Only Chinese bias counts as a security risk, apparently.</p>
<p><strong>They used secret benchmarks.</strong> "Private benchmarks built by CAISI" that can't be reproduced or verified. This isn't science. This is advocacy research.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-this-report-actually-tells-us">What This Report Actually Tells Us</h2>
<p>Reading between the lines:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>DeepSeek models are less polished.</strong> They spent less on development. Of course they have rougher edges.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Chinese models are competitive enough to worry about.</strong> If they weren't a threat to market share, this report wouldn't exist.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>The U.S. is terrified of losing AI dominance.</strong> This was explicitly commissioned under Trump's "AI Action Plan." The Commerce Secretary's statement makes it clear—this is industrial policy, not neutral evaluation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="heading-the-real-threat-hint-its-not-to-you">The Real Threat (Hint: It's Not to You)</h2>
<p>You know what DeepSeek actually threatened? The oligopoly.</p>
<p>DeepSeek’s real offense was showing that open source works. That you can build strong models without billions in venture capital or private APIs.</p>
<p>That terrifies the companies selling AI access at premium prices. When DeepSeek said "Here are the weights, run it yourself," they attacked the economic moat those companies depend on.</p>
<p>That is why the NIST report exists. Because DeepSeek proved openness can compete with closed systems, and the establishment needs to shut that down.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-hypocrisy">The Hypocrisy</h2>
<p>NIST warns that DeepSeek models might respond to malicious prompts in simulated environments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. models actually send real data to external servers. Remember when OpenAI used ChatGPT conversations for training? When they had to add opt-outs after backlash?</p>
<p>Running DeepSeek weights locally = zero data transmission.</p>
<p>Using OpenAI's API = constant data transmission to their servers.</p>
<p>Which is the privacy risk again?</p>
<p>The report warns about "adoption of foreign AI" while ignoring that every cloud API, U.S. or otherwise, requires trusting someone else's infrastructure. Local open weights are MORE auditable and MORE secure than any cloud service, period.</p>
<p>But that's not the message. Because this was never about security. It is about narrative control.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-betrayal-of-open-source-and-open-science">The Betrayal of Open Source and Open Science</h2>
<p>The open source community built the foundation that modern AI rests on. Linux. Python. PyTorch. Transformers. Decades of collaborative development, freely shared.</p>
<p>DeepSeek participated in that tradition. They took open knowledge, built something impressive, and gave it back.</p>
<p>American institutions responded by calling them a threat.</p>
<p>Imagine if China had done this to Meta when they released Llama. If they'd published a government report claiming Llama weights were surveillance tools because they're "vulnerable to jailbreaking."</p>
<p>We'd call it protectionism. Technological paranoia. An attack on open research.</p>
<p>But when we do it? "National security."</p>
<p>Open research should be universal. You cannot champion open science only when it is convenient.</p>
<h2 id="heading-the-test-you-can-run-yourself">The Test You Can Run Yourself</h2>
<p>Don't trust me. Don't trust NIST.</p>
<p>Download DeepSeek's weights. Run them locally using huggingface transformers, vLLM, LM Studio, or llama.cpp. Open your network monitoring tools.</p>
<p>Watch as exactly zero packets are sent anywhere.</p>
<p>Watch as your prompts process entirely on your machine.</p>
<p>Watch as the terrible "security threat" sits there doing matrix multiplication with no connection to anything.</p>
<p>Then ask yourself: why is the US government lying about this?</p>
<p>The "security threat" is not in the model. It is in the politics.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-you-should-actually-be-concerned-about">What You Should Actually Be Concerned About</h2>
<p>There ARE legitimate concerns:</p>
<p><strong>Using DeepSeek's API</strong>: If you send sensitive data to DeepSeek's hosted service, that data goes through Chinese infrastructure. This is a real data sovereignty issue, the same as using any foreign cloud provider.</p>
<p><strong>Jailbreak susceptibility</strong>: If you're building production applications, you need to test ANY model for vulnerabilities and implement application-level safeguards. Don't rely solely on model guardrails. Also - use an inference time guard model (such as LlamaGuard or Qwen3Guard) to classify and filter both prompts and responses.</p>
<p><strong>Bias and censorship</strong>: All models reflect their training data. Be aware of this regardless of which model you use.</p>
<p>These are engineering challenges, not reasons to avoid open source (or Chinese) models entirely.</p>
<h2 id="heading-what-this-means-for-ais-future">What This Means for AI's Future</h2>
<p>This is not just about DeepSeek. It is about whether AI stays open and auditable or gets fenced in by governments and corporations.</p>
<p>Will we let "open source" be redefined as "open, but only if it is American"?<br>Will we demand real evidence for security claims, or accept vague insinuations?<br>Will AI remain a shared human project, or become a geopolitical weapon?</p>
<p>DeepSeek proved there is another path. That is why it had to be discredited.</p>
<h2 id="heading-my-hot-take">My Hot Take</h2>
<p>I run open source models locally. I train my own models. I believe in composable alignment and user freedom. I think AI should be a tool that serves users, not corporations or governments.</p>
<p>The NIST report is not a neutral technical evaluation. It's a policy document designed to discourage adoption of Chinese AI models to protect American commercial and strategic interests.</p>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with the U.S. government promoting American industry. But call it what it is. Don't dress up protectionism as security research. Don't fabricate threats. Don't lie to the public about what the evidence shows.</p>
<p>DeepSeek gave us a precious, invaluable gift. The weights are just safetensor data. They sit on your drive and do what you tell them to do. They don't phone home. They don't spy. They don't exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>If you're worried about them, you don't understand how local inference works.</p>
<p>If you believe the fear-mongering, you've been successfully manipulated.</p>
<p>None of this is about safety. It’s about power - who gets to build, share, and understand the tools that shape the future.</p>
<h2 id="heading-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The code and the research is open source and auditable. Everything else is politics.</p>
<p>Read the NIST report and the code, for yourself. Look for any actual evidence of malicious code or surveillance capabilities. You won't find any, because there isn't any.</p>
<p>Then maybe start asking why you're supposed to be afraid of open source when it works a little too well.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Please Note</strong>: I make uncensored models like Dolphin. I believe in open source, user freedom, and composable alignment. If you disagree with these principles, you're probably on the wrong blog. For everyone else - enjoy responsibly. You are responsible for what you do with these tools, just like you're responsible for what you do with a knife, a lighter, or a car.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge were finishing their time at the University of Waterloo in Ontario in 1979. In pursuit of their masters degrees, they’d worked on a system called Thoth in their real-time operating systems course. Thoth was interesting not only for having been real-time and having featured synchronous message passing, but also for originally having been written in the B programming langue. It was then rewritten in the UW-native Eh language (fitting for a Canadian university), and then finally rewritten in Zed. It is this last, Zed-written, version of Thoth to which Bell and Dodge would have been exposed. Having always been written in a high-level language, the system was portable, and programs were the same regardless of the underlying hardware. Both by convention and by design, Thoth strongly encouraged programs to be structured as networks of communicating processes. As the final project for the RTOS course, students were expected to implement a real-time system of their own. This experience was likely pivotal to their next adventure.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg" width="728" height="235.38666666666666" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:194,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;[]&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="[]" title="[]" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Z4RA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd78646c6-55f5-4cbe-8796-114bfa33da79_600x194.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>first QNX system found in QNX corporate’s attic, from Paul Leroux</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The duo’s first year after graduation was a busy one.

Their goal was to produce a real-time operating system that would enable the PC’s use in factories, communication systems, and anywhere else that emphasized reliability.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png" width="772" height="116" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:116,&quot;width&quot;:772,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:161076,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UKta!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0d0ce3f9-8b98-4553-8d24-c7e4e443ff5e_772x116.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>The first version of Bell and Dodge’s operating system was QUNIX 0.1 (the Q could have been for Quantum, or for Quick, I’ve seen both from former Quantum employees), and it was running on that early, hand-assembled, 8bit microcomputer. This earliest creation was never released outside of Quantum Software as far as I know. QUNIX was a vaguely UNIX-like, microkernel, real-time operating system. I say that it was vaguely UNIX-like because in these early versions, there were some serious differences. In QUNIX, there were </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/control-program-for-microcomputers" rel="">CP/M</a><span>-like things too. Each disk had a drive number prefix, non-disk device files’ names were reserved, and the commands were a bit different from those in UNIX, often simplified to the point of being more CP/M-like than UNIX-like. Another major difference was the directory hierarchy. On a traditional UNIX system, binaries were stored in </span><code>/bin</code><span> or </span><code>/usr/bin</code><span>, configurations in </span><code>/etc</code><span>, and user directories in </span><code>/home</code><span>. On QUNIX, this wasn’t the case. Commands included in the path variable were in </span><code>/cmds</code><span>, configuration files were in </span><code>/config</code><span>, the OS binaries were in </span><code>/sys</code><span>, user directories were </span><code>/user</code><span>, drivers were in </span><code>/drivers</code><span>, and utilities were in </span><code>/util</code><span>. Then, the </span><code>man</code><span> command did not exist, and </span><code>help</code><span> was used instead. Instead of </span><code>ps</code><span>, the system had </span><code>task</code><span> with the labels of </span><em>father, son, </em><span>and </span><em>brother</em><span> to denote parent and child processes. The first version of QUNIX for the IBM PC was made before the end of 1981, and released either in December of 1981 or January of 1982, making QUNIX the first known microkernel operating system for the PC platform.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg" width="728" height="901.264" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:619,&quot;width&quot;:500,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8VEI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3acd4fe9-e261-435d-a7a9-cd2dd6003a3b_500x619.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>QUNIX product brochure image</figcaption></figure></div><p>A fun note from Paul N.

The name QUNIX was a bit too close to the name UNIX for AT&amp;T. The name of the system was changed to QNX in late 1982 following a Cease and Desist by AT&amp;T. The first official QNX version was released the following year. At the time of the name change the kernel consisted of around 10K line of C, and it handled task scheduling, message passing, and task priority. Everything else was implemented in services that used the microkernel’s message passing to communicate with each other (even drivers, filesystems, and networking). As an important feature, message queues were network transparent so a task on one physical machine could communicate with a task on a separate physical machine on the same network as easily as if it were local. This inherently multitasked and multiuser system allowed 250 simultaneous tasks from 4 to 16 simultaneous users. The system would make extensive use of the 8087 if it was available, and required a minimum of 96K RAM. Loading up the C compiler would require an additional 32K. It’s impressive what the small company achieved on the 8088, even if, for the time, the RAM requirements were quite high. QNX release version 1.0, in March of 1983, running on an IBM PC achieved 29% to 47% the speed of a </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/work-at-the-mill" rel="">DEC VAX 11/780</a><span> depending upon the task at hand when tested by Rao Mikkilineni at Bell Labs. Sadly, I’ve been unable to find his original write-up of his testing, which was apparently in the publication </span><em>Personna</em><span>. If you have information about it, I’d love to get some details. While RV1 was limited to just C and x86 assembly language, the company was hard at work on </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/history-of-basic-part-1" rel="">BASIC</a><span>, FORTRAN, and Pascal compilers that would utilize common code generators allowing for the mixed-use of languages without losing optimization. With the introduction of GUIs on the Apple Lisa, Xerox systems, and VisiCorp’s Visi-On, Quantum also had plans for windowing as well. According to Quantum’s president Syd Geraghty in InfoWorld on the 21st of March in 1983, the majority of customers were high-end system developers at large corporations. Version 1.0 cost $650 in 1983 (around $2100 in 2025), and that included a C compiler, full-screen editor, the ability to read MS-DOS disks, and full networking support. I haven’t found much information about versions 1.1 through 1.14, but I did find some information about 1.20 released on the 15th of November in 1984. This version brought pattern matching on filenames in the current directory, expanded shell programming, </span><code>login</code><span> was now a separate task with fast user switching and login stacking, </span><code>TCAP</code><span> (think terminfo), </span><code>ed</code><span> was rewritten and supported full-screen visual mode (think Vi), and support for the IBM AT (real-mode) was added. The price of QNX had also fallen to $450.</span></p><p><span>In June of 1981, the Ontario Ministry of Education identified computing as being important for the future, and they wanted to bring computing into their schools. They were also quite aware that some teachers had taken the initiative to bring microcomputers into their classrooms already, and the </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-commodore-part-1" rel="">Commodore PET</a><span> was the most common for programming courses, while the Apple II was the most common for other educational programs. Targeting many computers would have meant that they’d have rather high software development costs in any attempt to achieve standardization, and it was therefore decided that they’d need a single computer. In 1983, it was found by the ministry and the Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance that no existing computer would fully satisfy the goals of their educational computer. By March that year, some requirements had been drafted: all-in-one PET-like design, headphone output for voice and sound, a trackball, an 80186 CPU, a multitasking operating system, color graphics, voice synthesis, keyboard with accented characters, and networked storage (no physical disk in the computer itself).

It lacked any local storage having neither a hard disk drive nor </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-floppy-disk" rel="">floppy disk</a><span> drive. At boot, the computer grabbed QNX from a local LexICON file server over a 2.5Mbps ARCNET connection, and loaded the OS into RAM. Once loaded, the user logged into the system and his/her home directory was on the file server. Up to 32 of these machines could be on a single LAN. Saving any work to a floppy, meant putting the floppy into the file server, and then copying the file from the LexICON hard disk (early models were 10MB, later models were 64MB) to that floppy. The cost of these machines was high at $2500, but any school need only have paid $495 with the government covering the rest. One incredibly forward thinking feature was the lessonware. This would have been a hypertext system in which educators could have written pages that linked to others building an extensive corpus overtime. Even applications could have been run by simply clicking a link. This model was rejected by the ministry before the ICON shipped, and was replaced by a top-down system with ministry making lesson decisions. This also resulted in the ICON having shipped a QNX CLI with the CEMCORP text editor in the earliest models.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/aa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;The Burroughs ICON computer – VintageComputer.ca&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="The Burroughs ICON computer – VintageComputer.ca" title="The Burroughs ICON computer – VintageComputer.ca" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Bxwg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Faa65b920-82ab-43f2-bda0-856859aec29f_1920x1080.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Burrougs ICON internals, image from vintagecomputer.ca</figcaption></figure></div><p>The ICON was a project hated by many and loved by many. For detractors, it was seen as expensive and wasteful while not exposing students to industry currents. For supporters, it accomplished all of its goals. It was excellent for programming, and it was excellent at multitasking, networking, and running educational software. The software was also quite reliable. It was QNX doing what QNX does best.</p><p>From students who used ICONs, we know that it did have educational games, text editors, compilers, word processors, spread sheets, circuit design and simulation software, and CAD software. Of course, being networked machines, some unconventional students figured out ways to hack into other machines over the network, print stuff to other students’ screens, and generally cause some chaos. Combined with audio capabilities (later models even included MIDI support), this apparently got a bit out of hand from time to time.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

The comparisons to UNIX were now joined by comparisons to OS/2, and QNX wanted to be certain that people understood QNX to be superior. This advertisement also shows us that QNX had responded to OS/2’s ability to run DOS software by adding that feature to QNX with the QDOS II (invoked as </span><code>QDOS</code><span>) emulator, or by running a DOS application as a task via </span><code>RUNDOS</code><span>.

Following this, the company would expand the building three times, and finally add another building. So, the company moved from 215 Stafford Road to 175 Terrance Mathews Crescent.</p><p><span>As late as 1990, QNX advertisements still mentioned performance on the 80286.

dramatic overhaul of the operating system. This new version would be fully POSIX-compliant and increase performance over the prior generation of QNX operating systems. This version, 4.0, was released in 1991. The kernel now had just 14 calls associated with IPC, network, scheduling, and interrupts, and the kernel weighed in at just 7K (605 LOC), allowing the entire kernel to fit in CPU caches of the time. Unlike earlier versions, messages were no longer queued. Instead, they were copied from process to process. Being POSIX-compliant allowed for the easier porting of software, and it also meant that the directory hierarchy was decidedly more familiar to UNIX veterans. Beyond source compatibility, Quantum was actively working on becoming binary compatible with UNIX as of 1992. In 1994, beyond POSIX and performance, QNX 4.1 introduced the QNX Photon microGUI. This system was developed by Patrick Hayden and Robin Burgener. Much like the underlying system, it was built around a microkernel (around 20K), and it was network transparent. A Photon application could have its interface </span><em>beamed</em><span> to another QNX 4 machine at any point in time, or it could be dragged from one device to another just as easily. Photon likewise allowed remote monitoring or control of the user interface. This worked regardless of the device class (desktop, laptop, handheld, server). For those who needed it, the X Windows System (X11R5, Motif Window Manager) was also available, though Photon did implement a binary interface library that was X compatible. Being so lightweight allowed the company to release a demo disk that combined networking, a web browser, web server, graphical environment, file manager, text editor, a vector animation demo, and Towers of Hanoi game onto a single 1.44MB floppy. Unlike prior QNX versions, version 4 required at least an Intel 80386 and VGA graphics card. No 16bit systems were supported.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png" width="1456" height="2037" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2037,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4371961,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!YZKh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7de5337d-f65f-4358-97a2-da4686d8f0f2_1668x2334.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><blockquote><p><em><strong>KANATA, ONTARIO, September, 1994</strong><span>—QNX Software Systems Ltd., developers of the QNX realtime operating system, announced a unique window system targeted for handheld and embedded applications.</span><p><span>According to Rob Oakley, Corporate Communications and Product Management, "the Photon Window System is the first of its kind—a GUI built around a graphical microkernel."</span></p><p><span>QNX Software Systems designed the Photon Window System as a graphical microkernel and a team of cooperating processes, basing this design on the company's QNX OS, a microkernel network-distributed system.</span></p><p><span>Photon's cooperating processes provide the functionality to scale the system up into a full-featured windowing system or down to fit into resource-constrained environments, like handheld personal computers (HPCs) and compact embedded systems.</span></p><p><span>Photon provides a rich widget library that operates much like the X Window System widget set, with an X-inspired API. A Motif-like window manager and a code-generating, visual application builder are also available.</span></p><p><span>"Photon is extremely light and fast. It runs in only 256K, yet provides enormous GUI functionality," Oakley said.</span></p><p><span>Like the QNX OS itself, Photon is network transparent—an HPC running Photon and QNX, equipped with a wireless LAN interface, becomes a transparent extension of the LAN, able to use all the LAN's resources as if they were integrated directly into the HPC. The power this brings to the HPC user is difficult to appreciate—imagine having the power of 100 Pentiums in the palm of your hand!</span></p><p><span>According to Dan Dodge, Vice President R&amp;D, "Photon applications are very network distributed. From the application's perspective, all the resources of all the nodes on the LAN look like a single, logical machine. The environment is so transparent that a user can drag applications from one physical screen to another."</span></p><p><span>For example, a user in a factory control environment could walk up to a computer and drag an application from the control screen onto an HPC, and then walk out onto the factory floor with it and interact with the live application.</span></p><p><span>Although Photon is aimed at compact environments, its dynamic range is extensive. "Photon's API and rich widget library can support high-performance GUI applications with enough functionality to enter the domain of X, while consuming only a fraction of the resources," said Dodge.</span></p><p><span>The QNX operating system is a POSIX-certified realtime OS for Intel and AMD processors. Scalable and modular, QNX fits a wide range of environments, from compact embedded controllers to resource-rich X-based development systems, to distributed realtime systems running hundreds of CPUs.</span></p></em></p></blockquote><p>Versions 4.2, 4.22, and 4.24 all released in 1995. The final version 4 release was 4.25 in 1997. At least one QNX 4 installation ran for over 20 years without a reboot at the ESA. This was possible because peripherals could be hotswapped, drivers could be changed, and network nodes could be added or removed without bringing the system down.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

And with a new name and a new version of their operating system, the company won some major installs. From POS systems at FasFax that allowed for real-time sales figures from geographically disparate locations, to video conferencing systems at Georgia State University, to factories, power plants, hospitals, set-top boxes, phone systems, trains, jets, the Space Shuttle, ISPs, and even traffic lights. The price for a single license dropped to around $285 at this time, and by 1995, QNX was the leading real-time OS for x86 systems. The majority of the company’s revenue was from large enterprises.</p><p>Of course, change was coming in the 1990s, and QSSL knew it. The company took the QNX kernel from version 4.24 and forked it. They had multiple goals with this fork. The system needed to be SMP capable, support POSIX, and be more portable to new hardware. The kernel handled only IPC, message passing, interrupts, and timing. Threading became the minimal unit of scheduling. The new Process Manager then used a loader thread that copied a process’s image into memory freeing the Manager to service other requests while a program continued to load. Naturally, being a real-time system, priority levels were used when scheduling any time-critical process, and new processes inherited the priority of their parent by default. The Process Manager weighed in at 32K (same size as the kernel itself) but added memory allocation, process contexts, resource-manager namespaces, and so on. In this new QNX version, the Process Manager ran inside the microkernel’s address space, but was the only element of the OS to do so. Much of the network stack for this version came from NetBSD, and with that came the ability to use NetBSD network drivers. There was another major change that came from the wider UNIX world, GCC. This naturally meant that language support was quite broadened to include not just C, C++ but all of the other languages supported by the GNU Compiler Collection. This became QNX Neutrino 1.0 released in 1996.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png" width="1456" height="2039" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:2039,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3953875,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4Cxo!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795cb09f-9511-4ada-9954-52f3cf24648d_1632x2286.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>On the 19th of October in 1998, QSSL announced QNX Neutrino 2.0 which featured UPM (Universal Process Model). In the words of CTO Dan Dodge:</p><blockquote><p><em>The premise of UPM is simple. Go beyond the limited MMU protection provided by the other major embedded OSs - where only applications are prevented from corrupting memory - and extend that protection down to services at the kernel level. The result? For the first time, MIPS and PowerPC-based embedded systems can intelligently recover from software faults in drivers, protocol stacks, and custom OS extensions - typically without rebooting.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>QNX was branching into non x86 platforms, and this included PowerPC processors: 401, 403GC, 603e, 821, 823, 860; </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-silicon-graphics" rel="">MIPS</a><span> processors R4000 and R5000; and naturally all x86 CPUs from the 80386 onward.

The announcement was made at Computer '98 in Cologne.</span></em></p><p><em>"The Amiga shook the industry in the 80s with world-leading multimedia architecture," said Jeff Schindler, general manager of Amiga Inc. "QNX's RTOS resembles many of Amiga's unique qualities. It provides the foundation in reaching our vision for the rebirth of Amiga in the new millenium."</em></p><p><em>"We see this partnership as a powerful combination of superior OS technologies, common corporate cultures, and shared business vision," said Dan Dodge, Chief Technology Officer and Cofounder of QNX Software Systems Ltd.</em></p><p><em><strong>About Amiga</strong></em></p><p><em>Amiga Inc. is a technology company targeting the next generation of Amiga architecture with a continued focus on multimedia and the Internet. Since the introduction of the Amiga A1000 in 1985, Amiga has represented the embodiment of the efficient use of memory and hard drive capacity, while pioneering industry developments in multimedia, 32-bit multitasking, and autoconfiguration. Amiga led the industry in combining computer graphics, animation, and film sequences with stereo sound known today as multimedia.

The company has established a strong customer base in a variety of industries, including aerospace, telecommunications, medical instrumentation, process control, point-of-sale, consumer electronics, finance, and telephony. With products distributed in over 100 countries, the company is headquartered in Ottawa, Canada.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>The Amiga port should have been somewhat straightforward considering that Amiga accelerators had been using PowerPC chips, and those chips were now supported by QNX. Gateway’s Amiga team was working closely with QSSL to build a new Amiga (Amiga NG) around the PowerPC G3 and G4 chips running QNX, and these were apparently prototyped as single, dual, and quad processor machines. During alpha testing, Gateway PowerPC boards apparently had some issues, and the two parties blamed one another. By the middle of 1999, Gateway, QSSL, and to some extent Motorola, had poured a hefty sum into the project, and Gateway began insisting on a solid date for the availability of a QNX Neutrino port. Evidently they weren’t satisfied, and I do not believe communication between the two teams, which had one been quite good, was solid by this point. At noon on the 8th of July in 1999, Dan Dodge announced the </span><em>QNX Developers Network for Amigans</em><span>. This was followed by another announcement at 15:15 the following day:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Eight months ago we were chosen by Amiga as their foundation OS partner. Our development group was thrilled to be part of the rebirth of such an innovative product. To meet the challenge we knew it would take a tremendous effort on our part. We had a team of people in place working on our part of the Amiga NG soon after the alliance was announced. Over the next few months we involved more and more of our engineering resouces towards making QNX an advanced multi-media platform. Our investment so far has been significant. These are costs we have borne ourselves.</em></p><p><em>It is clear today from Jim's letter that we were not chosen for the next generation Amiga. Naturally we're disappointed. So, where do we stand now? It is not our intent to confuse the Amiga community. We are proud of what we have accomplished and want to include Amigans in what we've achieved. I did make a promise to deliver an operating system and I intend on keeping that promise. I don't want to split the community, nor do I wish to engage in a war of words. I don't ask you to "trust" me or to take me at my word. Both QNX and Amiga have promised to deliver technology into your hands in the very near future. I ask only that your assessment of QNX be based on what we do and what we deliver.</em></p><p><em>Thanks for the overwhelming support we have received so far.</em></p></blockquote><p>That letter by Jim Collas read, in part:</p><blockquote><p><em>Dear Amigans,</em></p><p><em>After months of research and in-depth discussions with all of our technology partners we have decided to use Linux as the primary OS kernel for the new Amiga Operating Environment (OE). I know this decision is a shock to many of you given the previous announcements and activities relative to QNX. This was a very complicated and difficult decision to make and I assure you that I didn't make this decision without a significant amount of research and deliberation. We have been researching Linux since February but didn't finalized our decision until several weeks ago. We were planning to communicate it to the Amiga community in the technology brief that will be released in the next few days.</em></p><p><em>I am pressed to communicate the Linux decision before the technology brief because of information released by QNX in the last few days. This information had not been reviewed or approved for release by Amiga. In light of our Linux decision, this information is confusing and misleading so I would like to take the time to clarify the situation. I can't disclose any details of the Amiga/QNX discussions because of legally binding confidentiality agreements but I can talk to you about our decision to use the Linux kernel. I think that you will agree that this is the right decision once you understand the reasons for this decision.</em></p><p><em>Before I continue, I should mention that our technology decision does not reflect negatively on QNX. I believe that QNX is a good company with great technology. I just believe that Linux gives us a better chance of executing our plans successfully. The decision to use QNX as our OS partner on our next generation multimedia convergence computer (MCC) was made late last year. When I took over as president of Amiga in February of this year, I initiated an in-depth review of existing Amiga plans and decisions. As president of Amiga I had to make sure that we were defining a strategy and an execution plan that would allow Amiga and the Amiga community to be successful. We reviewed our strategy, architecture decisions, technology partners, and execution plans. During this review period we also added a number of very talented and experienced people to help us finalize our technology and product decisions. I am confident that we now have a solid and exciting plan that people can have confidence in.</em></p><p><em>Linux has been picking up substantial momentum over the past year as a viable, open OS alternative in the marketplace. This momentum, the growing commitment to Linux applications from a wide variety of software vendors, and the growing availability of Linux device drivers from hardware vendors, makes it a compelling candidate. Additionally, with all of the significant component suppliers putting resources on writing drivers for Linux it was difficult to get them to port to yet another operating system. Using the Linux OS as a foundation for our Amiga OE allows us to leverage a significant amount of available software drivers and utilities. This allows us to quickly support multiple graphics cards and other peripherals.</em></p><p><em>Given the above-mentioned advantages, we decided to do an in-depth technical analysis of Linux to determine if it was a suitable OS kernel for our new Amiga operating environment (OE). As we ported parts of our higher level operating environment and AmigaObject architecture to Linux, we discovered some significant performance advantages in the Linux kernel in areas such as distributed object messaging across a network (up to 10X the performance of Windows NT).</em></p><p><em>Does this mean that the next generation Amiga will not be unique? Absolutely not! Remember that the OS kernel is only one component of the new Amiga OE and the hardware is unique. The revolutionary nature of the Amiga OE is in the way it extends the traditional operating system to provide a host environment for a new class of portable applications - applications that exist in a pervasive networked computing environment. We will be integrating multiple technologies including an efficient windowing environment and a unique user interface. In summary, we decided to use Linux because of the incredible momentum and the fact that it is solid technology and a good foundation for our new Amiga OE. </em></p><p><em><span>Additionally, the Linux community is an impressive force that we should be aligned with. We share many common values and objectives with the Linux community. Using Linux as our OS kernel allows us to build a unique and revolutionary operating environment while leveraging the enormous momentum of Linux. The soon to be released technology brief will further explain our architecture and plans for integrating all of the selected technology. Once you read it, I am confident that you will understand the revolutionary nature of the next generation Amiga. I assure you that Amiga and the Amiga community will be a driving force behind the next computer </span><br><span>revolution.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>As a person using </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-path-to-linux" rel="">Linux</a><span> at the time, I believe this to have been the wrong decision. Despite the momentum that Linux had, it wasn’t (still isn’t) as stable, as reliable, or as efficient as QNX. If network performance were a serious consideration, one of the BSDs would have been the better choice. Linux’s hardware support also wasn’t that great in reality. While it could run on quite a bit of kit, it didn’t always support that hardware well, and it didn’t always support all features. Plus, QNX was doing the work to build drivers for the new Amiga. Of course, none of this really mattered. Gateway chose to divest itself of Amiga entirely. The new Amiga Inc. then turned to AmigaOne Partners for Amiga OS 4. </span></p><p><span>QNX Neutrino 2.1 was released in 1999 with support for Java, the Glide API, a wide array of microcontrollers, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/mips-for-the-masses" rel="">ARM</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/work-at-the-mill" rel="">StrongARM</a><span>, and Hitachi SH-4. Interestingly, this release had beta packages including RealPlayer and X in Photon, and it had experimental packages that included Quake 3 Arena and Doom.</span></p><p><span>On the 14th of September in 1999, QNX made an announcement that would shape the future of QNX. The company was partnering with </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-motorola" rel="">Motorola</a><span> to develop automobile driver information systems that included in-vehicle navigation, internet access, natural language processing, car audio, multimedia, and vehicle information dashboards. While the Motorola unit responsible for mobileGT wouldn’t last and the unit at IBM working on Java wouldn’t last, QNX would survive and thrive in that segment.</span></p><div><figure><a

The new version was focused on multimedia with streaming video and audio as well as hardware accelerated MPEG encode/decode. The new system included a web based package manager greatly easing the installation of available software. Thankfully, all supported architectures could now be used for developing QNX native software too. Version 6.1 was mostly a patch release and followed later the same year. QSSL was a founding member of the Eclipse Foundation, and QNX software development got quite a bit better with the release of the Momentics Tool Suite on the 4th of June in 2002 (along with QNX 6.2). This was largely the Eclipse IDE combined with a series of plugins that were QNX and Photon oriented.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

on the 3rd of June in 2004. This version was visually slightly different, and Voyager was replaced by the Mozilla Suite. The development environment was improved and now offered a clustering framework for the development of networked applications utilizing distributed processing. Among the highlights for this release were SCTP support, IP filter and NAT support, IPv6 support, 2D and 3D graphics layering/compositing, full UTF8 support in Photon, USB2 host support, and support for up to 64GB of RAM on x86 and PPC, up to 1TB on MIPS.</p><p>On the 27th of October in 2004, QNX Software Systems Limited was purchased by Harman International Industries. Harman specifically wanted to focus on QNX Neutrino in the embedded market, and within that market, specifically on automotive applications where Harman had found a market in audio. Under Harman’s ownership, QNX operated as a separate division led by Dan Dodge as CEO. While QNX did continue to serve networking, medical, and industrial markets, the direction was clear. What had begun with the Motorola partnership in automotive would become the primary market.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Version 6.3.2 was released on the 16th of August in 2006, 6.4 on the 30th of October in 2008, and 6.4.1 in May of 2009. Throughout that time period, QNX had introduced support for Adobe Flash and developed the QNX CAR platform winning a trophy from Adobe for their efforts. This platform was built of modular components allowing manufacturers to mix and match based upon the market segment. QNX was chosen by companies like BMW, Mercedes, Dodge, Toyota, Volkswagen, and Audi. When QNX demoed their automotive systems in the 2007-2009 timeframe, they had concept dashboards. These all ran QNX Neutrino on ARM CPUs (often Freescale i.MX6 or TI Sitara [Cortex A8]) with the EtherCAT motion library, and many demo units had UIs created in Qt5 and QML while a few had hardware accelerated OpenGL interfaces. From 2008 to 2010, QNX had been licensed for use in more than 17 million in-vehicle systems representing an increase of around 130% over those two years. By March of 2010, more than 200 vehicles were already shipping with QNX, and the QNX CAR platform had more than 60 participants. Those participants included 17 auto makers and 26 automotive suppliers.</p><p>On the 9th of April in 2010, Research in Motion announced their acquisition of QSS from Harman for $200 million:</p><blockquote><p><em>“RIM is excited about the planned acquisition of QNX Software Systems and we look forward to ongoing collaboration between Harman, QNX and RIM to further integrate and enhance the user experience between smartphones and in-vehicle audio and infotainment systems," said Mike Lazaridis, President and Co-CEO at RIM. "In addition to our interests in expanding the opportunities for QNX in the automotive sector and other markets, we believe the planned acquisition of QNX will also bring other value to RIM in terms of supporting certain unannounced product plans for intelligent peripherals, adding valuable intellectual property to RIM's portfolio and providing long-term synergies for the companies based on the significant and complementary OS expertise that exists within the RIM and QNX teams today."</em></p><p><em>"We welcome the opportunities that a strengthened relationship with RIM will create, as two innovation leaders collaborate to bring new connectivity solutions to the industry," said Dinesh C. Paliwal, Harman's Chairman, President and CEO. "We expect to maintain our close association with QNX and the cutting-edge software solutions it provides to Harman and our customers. We believe our leading customers will fully endorse this move and see it as a major step in advancing seamless connectivity and integration among intelligent devices."</em></p><p><em>"Like Harman, RIM shares our passion for innovation and reliability, so we are absolutely thrilled with this opportunity," said Dan Dodge, CEO, QNX Software Systems. "Moreover, RIM will give us the best of all possible mandates: to continue on our innovation path and to increase investment in our core products, professional services, and go-to-market channels. This is a great time to be a QNX customer, as we focus on collaborating with RIM to create an even more exciting platform for the next generation of connected and embedded devices."</em></p></blockquote><p>Also in 2010, QNX gained the QNX Safety kernel variant. This was a version of Neutrino that was security hardened specifically for mission critical applications. This variant continues to this day with the most recent version (8.0) having been independently certified by TÜV Rheinland to meet several standards including ISO 26262 ASIL D, IEC 61508 SIL3, IEC 62304 Class C, and ISO/SAE 21434. Aside from security hardening, the QNX Safety variant is still fully compatible with Neutrino’s native APIs and POSIX.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Self-hosted QNX Neutrino RTOS&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Self-hosted QNX Neutrino RTOS" title="Self-hosted QNX Neutrino RTOS" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!9Gk7!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_lossy/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9644bbf8-719f-426d-8b2d-8dc3102dfaaa_1024x768.gif 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>QNX Neutrino 6.5</figcaption></figure></div><p>In July of 2010, QNX Neutrino 6.5 was released. This version brought performance improvements to the kernel when systems were seeing high memory utilization, the kernel gained zombie reaping, and it gained address space randomization. SMP support was increased, and CPU support was extended to ARMv7 Cortex A-9. The Photon microGUI saw some refinements. As one would expect, version updates were present for everything imported from BSD, Linux, and GNU. This version could make use of the NetBSD’s Pkgsrc tool.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

While many loved the webkit browser, user interface, HDMI output, and multitasking, many loathed the requirement of a BlackBerry to get certain apps working. Additionally, there was a dearth of third party applications. This latter complaint did get ameliorated. While at launch there weren’t too many applications, this grew to over 24,000 by the same time the following year. Around 2,465,000 PlayBooks had been sold by June of 2013.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1464825,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.abortretry.fail/i/170693462?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uowa!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcdfca0c6-2164-49b7-b8ce-52551dfdef19_1024x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>BlackBerry Z10, images from CNET, by Josh Miller</figcaption></figure></div><p>The BlackBerry Z10 was released on the 31st of January in 2013 running BBX (officially BlackBerry 10 due to a trademark dispute, and at the launch event for BBX, Research in Motion announced that they were changing their name to BlackBerry Limited). The Z10 was built around a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus SoC (dual core 1.5GHz Krait CPU, Adreno 225 GPU) for LTE units, or around the TI OMAP 4470 for non-LTE units. The shell was plastic wrapped around a stainless steel inner frame, and the on/off, voice command, and volume buttons on the right side were of metal. While it didn’t have quite the premium feel of an iPhone, it did feel good in the hand. In its dimensions it was 5.1 inches by 2.6 inches, and just over an 1/3 of an inch thick (or just slightly larger than an iPhone 5). It was a slick piece of kit with a high price for the time at $599. The display, however, was excellent. It was a 4.2 inch LCD with a resolution of 1280 by 768 at 355ppi (the iPhone 5 was 326ppi). The device had a 2MP font camera, and an 8MP rear camera capable of HDR, panorama, and 1080p video at 30fps. Wi-Fi was dual band 802.11n, and the device featured Bluetooth, GPS, and NFC. Of course, connectivity didn’t stop there. This device had physical ports: micro USB2, micro HDMI, and 3.5mm audio.</p><p>BBX made heavy use of gestures with a swipe up from the bottom taking the user to the Home Screen, a swipe to right to hit the App Library, and a swipe to the left going to the BlackBerry Hub. The Hub was a combination of SMS/MMS, email, social media, chat, notifications, and calls in a single unified location. BBX was QNX Neutrino, but it did differ. Multitasking was limited to 8 applications at any one time which I believe to have been done due to the application frameworks. A developer could choose to use C/C++ and the Cascades UI framework, or WebWorks which utilized HTML5 with Zepto.js (JQuery API, but 8.4k compressed), or WebKit, or Adobe AIR (Flash), or Android runtime. With so many different application types, decisions would have had to have been made around resource management, and a best guess at when performance would become unacceptable.</p><p>BlackBerry had been unable to compete against the iPhone and Android, and BBX was their last, best hope. By 2014, BBX was in the number four spot behind Windows Phone. By 2017, it was clear that they weren’t going to survive in the mobile market. Due to the extreme devotion of their fans, they kept BBX on life support until 2022. Being an amazing OS running on good hardware, why did BBX fail? Likely, the most pressing problem was application support. While BBX could run some Android applications, support was limited. The platform likewise failed to grab many developers as the existing install bases for iOS and Android were enormous. What applications were made for BBX were often of quite low effort. Finally, moving to a touch screen angered BlackBerry’s existing fanbase. For those individuals hanging on to the BlackBerry ecosystem, the keyboard was one of the main reasons why. Removing the physical keyboard made many of those fans feel betrayed. When BlackBerry Limited did release another phone with a physical keyboard, it was a bit too late.</p><p>On the 20th of September in 2013, BlackBerry Limited announced a 4500 person staff reduction and $1 billion (CAD) loss. On the 23rd, they announced an acquisition by Fairfax Financial Holdings for $9/share. This deal was canceled in November. Instead, John Chen became CEO and initiated a turn around that focused on QNX’s former markets of healthcare, finance, law, and mission critical systems. This focus allowed the company to pick up Ford Motor Company as a QNX customer on the 11th of December in 2014 (Ford had previously used Microsoft Auto).</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg" width="800" height="1514" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1514,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Msd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2cb34622-552e-4350-b07d-521cb12ca472_800x1514.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>On the 28th of February in 2014, BlackBerry released QNX 6.6. The supported platforms were now the expected x86 and ARM CPUs with no mention of any others. This was a major change despite being a point release. Photon support was removed in favor of the Screen Graphics Subsystem. Screen operates as a lower-level service, and this has the benefit of supporting off-screen rendering and compositing of various image sources, and as QNX software had been increasingly using Qt, HTML5, or OpenGL rather than the toolkits supplied with Photon, this made logical sense.</p><p>QNX version 7 was released on the 4th of January in 2017 for ARM v7, ARM v8, x86, and AMD64. This release featured a rewritten PCI server with APIs moved out of libc and into libpci, rewritten virtual memory manager, fewer synchronization objects with increased limits, and filesystem encryption was moved into the Encrypted Filesystem package available from QNX Software Centry.</p><p>By June of 2023, QNX was in over 255 million vehicles around the world, and this would explain why the BlackBerry blog featured a rather large section on automobiles:</p><blockquote><p><em>The automotive evolution to SDVs and “connected cars” requires an OS capable of speed, safety, and security — while unlocking the power to innovate.</em></p><p><em>"With more than 300 million vehicles capable of over-the-air software updates expected to be on the road globally by 2032, automakers are clamoring for better tools to help them develop compelling technology features in the software-defined vehicle," says Alex Oyler, director of North America at SBD Automotive, a leading global automotive technology research and consulting firm.</em></p><p><em>“Both automakers and suppliers rely on validated software and well-integrated development tools to help them more efficiently build and maintain differentiating software for their fleets,” Oyler adds. "A secured-by-design operating system such as the next generation QNX OS — that seamlessly integrates with other software components on a high-performance system-on-chip — represents the foundation of a safe, secure, and seamless experience for drivers.”</em></p><p><em>In addition, early reviews of the new QNX SDP 8.0 give automotive industry leaders a glimpse into what’s possible.</em></p><p><em>“The combination of our DRIVE Thor centralized computer and the new QNX OS will serve as a powerful foundation on which OEMs can build next-generation automotive systems that offer the highest levels of safety and security,” says Ali Kani, vice president and general manager of automotive at NVIDIA. “This represents another major milestone in a nearly 20-year collaboration with BlackBerry QNX that has helped both companies move to the forefront of the automotive industry.” </em></p></blockquote><p>QNX 8.0 was officially announced in December of 2023, and the release was made in January of 2024. Version 8.0 was quickly discontinued with 8.0.1 taking its place. Version 8.0.3 was made available on the 21st of March in 2024. This latest release is available for a variety of Aarch64 platforms including the Raspberry Pi, and is also available for AMD64. QNX 8 supports SoCs with up to 64 cores and has near linear performance scaling. The network stack is now based upon FreeBSD 13.2, Wi-Fi 6 support is present with WPA3 and TLS 1.3, Screen can operate fully headless and now supports Vulkan 1.3 and OpenCL 3, and Screen now supports Wayland 1.21. Developers are now encouraged to use LLVM and libc++ 16 though GCC is still available with libstdc++ 12.2. Python 3.11, valgrind, libasan (address sanitizer), libubsan (undefined behavior detection), and libunwind are all available. For the UNIX user land, Toybox has replaced many common GNU utilities.</p><p><span>If the Raspberry Pi port caught your attention, this is available free for non-commercial use via </span><a href="https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/products/qnx-everywhere" rel="">QNX Everywhere</a><span>. The </span><a href="https://gitlab.com/qnx/quick-start-images/raspberry-pi-qnx-8.0-quick-start-image/-/wikis/Getting-Started" rel="">image</a><span> requires a Raspberry Pi 4 with at least 2GB of RAM and an 8GB or greater MicroSD card.</span></p><p>On the 2nd of January in 2025, it was announced that BlackBerry IoT would now be known as QNX. This decision was made largely by BlackBerry responding to their customers who recognized and desired the QNX brand. QNX CEO John Giamatteo stated:</p><blockquote><p><em>Relaunching the QNX brand is an important step in BlackBerry’s broader strategy to increase our visibility and fortify our leadership within the automotive and embedded industries, with a view to better positioning us for sustained growth and success. The values that QNX stands for have always been a cornerstone for our customers and this brand relaunch honors that strong history while setting the stage for the division to fire on all cylinders and drive smarter, safer, and faster innovation through precision-engineered performance.</em></p></blockquote><p>QNX is a fascinating operating system. It was extremely well designed from the start, and while it has been rewritten, the core ideas that allowed it survive for 45 years persist to this day. While I am sad that Photon was deprecated, the reasoning is sound. Most vendors using QNX either do not require a GUI, or they implement their own. For example, while Boston Dynamics uses QNX in their robots, they don’t really need Photon, and neither do SpaceX’s Falcon rockets. While cars certainly have displays, most vehicle makers desire their screen interfaces to have a unique look and feel. Of course, just stating these use cases of robots, rockets, and cars speaks to the incredible reliability and versatility of QNX. Better operating systems are possible, and QNX proves it.</p><p><em>My dear readers, many of you worked at, ran, or even founded the companies I cover here on ARF, and some of you were present at those companies for the time periods I cover.

        <p><strong>TL;DR: I will retire <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> in December 2025.</strong></p>

        <p>I have provided <a href="http://test-ipv6.com/">test-ipv6.com</a> to the public since 2010. I've sunk significant resources - engineering, support, equipment, and hosting fees - into what is a revenue-free product.</p>

        <p>Without going into details: I feel now is the time for me to refocus my resources within the family.<br>
        I hope people will understand, and respect this decision.</p>

        <p>I am shutting the site down, with a target of "during winter break"  (December) 2025.</p>

        <p>Mirror operators: Should you wish to keep your mirrors up, they will stop getting updates in December.</p>

        <p>Service providers: If you have runbooks for your support team based on this site, or based on RIPE-631, you'll need to update those.</p>

        <p>FAQ:</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the source?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> These portions are already public.</p>

        <p>These are already public.<br>

        <p>The remaining parts, such as geolocation and service provider lookups,  I am contractually unable to release.  Please do not ask.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Will I (jfesler) transfer the domain?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I’d consider a reputable RIR or NIC organization serving the public interest taking things over.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: Should mirrors be retired?</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> I would suggest it.  Once the primary site is retired, I will stop monitoring the functionality of your mirror, and stop providing geolocation and service provider lookups.</p>

        <p><strong>Q: I have more questions or comments!</strong></p>

        <p><strong>A:</strong> If we ever meet for coffee or beer, ask me then.</p>

With the same weight, a person can do a squat in two seconds or 10 seconds. The latter is harder, but it also builds more muscle. More time is more tension; more pain is more gain.</p><p>Thinking benefits from a similar principle of “time under tension.” It is the ability to sit patiently with a group of barely connected or disconnected ideas that allows a thinker to braid them together into something that is combinatorially new. It’s very difficult to defend this idea by describing other people’s thought processes, so I’ll describe my own.</p><p><span>A few weeks ago, </span><em>The Argument</em><span> Editor-in-Chief Jerusalem Demsas asked me to write an essay about the claim that AI systems would take all of our jobs within 18 months. My initial reaction was … no?</span></p><p><span>The prediction is so stupendously aggressive and almost certainly wrong, so my instinct was there was really nothing more to say on the subject. Certainly not 1,799 words more. But as I sat with the prompt, several pieces of a puzzle began to slide together: a </span><em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc" rel="">Financial Times</a></em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc" rel=""> essay</a><span> I’d read, an </span><em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/" rel="">Atlantic</a></em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/" rel=""> article</a><span> I liked, </span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g12/" rel="">a National Assessment of Educational Progress study</a><span> I’d saved in a tab, an interview with Cal Newport I’d recorded, a </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164515.Orality_and_Literacy" rel="">Walter Ong book</a><span> I was encouraged to read, a stray thought I’d had in the gym recently while trying out</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvhQXzJ4vhM" rel=""> eccentric pullups</a><span> for the first time about how time multiplies both pain and gain in fitness settings. The contours of a framework came into view.</span></p><p><span>The problem of the next 18 months isn’t AI disemploying all workers, or students losing competition after competition to nonhuman agents. The problem is whether we will degrade </span><em>our own capabilities</em><span> in the presence of new machines. We are so fixated on how technology will outskill us that we miss the many ways that we can deskill ourselves.</span></p><p>You have 18 months.</p><p><span>That’s the message from several leading AI executives and thinkers about how long people will retain their advantage over artificial intelligence in the workforce. By the summer of 2027, the story goes, AI’s</span><a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/scott-daniel" rel=""> explosion in capabilities</a><span> will leave carbon-based life forms in the dust. Up to</span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/ai-jobs-white-collar-unemployment-anthropic" rel=""> “half of all entry-level white-collar jobs</a><span>” will be wiped out, and even Nobel Prize-worthy minds will cower in fear that AI’s architects will have built a</span><a href="https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/machines-of-loving-grace" rel=""> “country of geniuses in a datacenter.”</a></p><p><span>This doomsday clock seems true enough to many people, because the question I’ve fielded more than any other from parents in the last few months is some version of: “If AI is about to be better than us at everything, what should my children do?”</span><em> </em><span>If generative AI is better at coding, diagnosing, and problem-solving than any software programmer, radiologist, or mathematician, then even the traditionally “safe” majors like computer science, medicine, and math could be anything but safe.</span></p><p>I understand the anxiety behind the question, but rather than try to forecast the future as it might turn out, I’d prefer to describe reality as it already exists. While we have no idea how AI might make working people obsolete at some imaginary date, we can already see how technology is affecting our capacity to think deeply right now. And I am much more concerned about the decline of thinking people than I am about the rise of thinking machines.</p><p><span>In March, </span><em>New York</em><span> </span><em>Magazine</em><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" rel=""> published</a><span> the sort of cover story that goes instantly viral, not because of its shock value, but, quite the opposite, because it loudly proclaimed what most people were already thinking: Everybody is using AI to cheat in school.</span></p><p><span>By allowing high-school and college students to summon into existence any essay on any topic, large language models have created an existential crisis for teachers trying to evaluate their students’ ability to actually write. “College is just how well I can use ChatGPT at this point,” one student told </span><em>New York Magazine</em><span>. “Massive numbers of students are going to emerge from university with degrees, and into the workforce, who are essentially illiterate,” a professor echoed.</span></p><p><span>The demise of writing matters because writing is not a second thing that happens after thinking. The act of writing </span><em>is</em><span> an act of thinking. This is as true for professionals as it is for students. In “Writing is thinking,” an editorial in </span><em>Nature</em><span>, the authors </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44222-025-00323-4" rel="">argued</a><span> that “outsourcing the entire writing process to LLMs” deprives scientists of the important work of understanding what they’ve discovered and why it matters.</span></p><p>Students, scientists, and anyone else who lets AI do the writing for them will find their screens full of words and their minds emptied of thought.</p><p><span>As writing skills have declined, reading has declined even more. “Most of our students are functionally illiterate,” a pseudonymous college professor using the name Hilarius Bookbinder</span><a href="https://hilariusbookbinder.substack.com/p/the-average-college-student-today" rel=""> wrote</a><span> in a March Substack essay on the state of college campuses. “This is not a joke.” Nor is it hyperbole.</span></p><p><span>Achievement scores in literacy and numeracy </span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/highlights/ltt/2022/" rel="">are declining</a><span> across the West for the first time in decades, leading the </span><em>Financial Times</em><span> reporter John Burn-Murdoch to</span><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8016c64-63b7-458b-a371-e0e1c54a13fc" rel=""> wonder</a><span> if humans have “passed peak brain power” at the very moment that we are building machines to think for us. In the U.S., the so-called</span><a href="https://www.nationsreportcard.gov/reports/reading/2024/g12/" rel=""> Nation’s Report Card</a><span>, published by the NAEP, recently found that average reading scores hit a 32-year low in 2024 — which is troubling, since the data series only goes back 32 years.</span></p><p><span>Of course, Americans are reading words all the time: email, texts, social media newsfeeds, subtitles on Netflix shows. But these words live in writing fragments that hardly require any kind of sustained focus necessary to make sense of a larger text. Indeed, Americans in the digital age don’t seem interested in or capable of sitting with anything longer than a tweet. The share of Americans overall who say they read books for leisure</span><a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/publish/post/173751882" rel=""> has declined</a><span> by nearly 40% since the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>Even America’s highest-performing students have essentially stopped reading anything longer than a paragraph. Last year, </span><em>The Atlantic</em><span>’s Rose Horowitch </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2024/11/the-elite-college-students-who-cant-read-books/679945/" rel="">reported</a><span> that students are matriculating into America’s most-elite colleges without having ever read a full book for school. “Daniel Shore, the chair of Georgetown’s English department, told me that his students have trouble staying focused on even a sonnet,” Horowitch wrote.</span></p><p>Nat Malkus, an education researcher at the American Enterprise Institute, suggested to me that high schools have chunkified books to prepare students for the reading-comprehension sections of standardized exams. By optimizing the assessment of reading skills, the U.S. education system appears to have accidentally killed book reading.</p><p><span>The decline of writing and reading matters because writing and reading are the twin pillars of deep thinking, according to Cal Newport, a computer science professor and the author of several bestselling books, including </span><em>Deep Work</em><span>. The modern economy prizes the sort of symbolic logic and systems thinking for which deep reading and writing are the best practice.</span></p><p>AI is “the latest in multiple heavyweight entrances into the prize fight against our ability to actually think,” Newport said. The rise of TV corresponded with the decline in per capita newspaper subscriptions and a slow demise of reading for pleasure. Then along came the internet, followed by social media, the smartphone, and streaming TV.</p><p>“The one-two punch of reading and writing is like the serum we have to take in a superhero comic book to gain the superpower of deep symbolic thinking,” Newport said. “And so I have been ringing this alarm bell that we have to keep taking the serum.”</p><p>Newport’s warning echoes an observation made by the scholar Walter Ong in his book “Orality and Literacy.” According to Ong, literacy is no passing skill. It was a means of restructuring human thought and knowledge to create space for complex ideas.</p><p>Stories can be memorized by people who cannot read or write. But nothing as advanced as, say, Newton’s “Principia” could be passed down from generation to generation without the ability to write down calculus formulas. Oral dialects commonly have only a few thousand words, while “the grapholect known as standard English has … at least a million and a half words,” Ong wrote. If reading and writing “rewired” the logic engine of the human brain, the decline of reading and writing are unwiring our cognitive superpower at the very moment that a greater machine appears to be on the horizon.</p><p>So what should our children study in an age of thinking machines? While I don’t know what field any particular student should major in, I do feel strongly about what skill they should value: It’s the very same skill that I see in decline. It’s the patience to read long and complex texts; to hold conflicting ideas in our heads and enjoy their dissonance; to engage in hand-to-hand combat at the sentence level within a piece of writing — and to value these things at a time when valuing them is a choice, because video entertainment is replacing reading and ChatGPT essays are replacing writing. As AI becomes abundant, there is a clear and present threat that deep human thinking will become scarce.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body" dir="ltr"><blockquote><p><strong>Meta-response to HN (2025-10-04):</strong> My high school teacher in 2004 accused me of plagiarizing from Wikipedia because my research paper looked "too polished" for something typed on a keyboard instead of handwritten. Twenty years later, HN commenters see clean prose and assume LLM slop. Same discomfort, different decade, identical pattern: people resist leverage they haven't internalized yet.</p><p>I use AI tools the way I used spell-check, grammar tools, and search engines before them—as cognitive leverage, not cognitive replacement. The ideas are mine. The arguments are mine. The cultural references, personal stories, and synthesis across domains—all mine. If the output reads coherently, maybe that says more about expectations than about authenticity.</p><p>You can call it slop. Or you can engage with the ideas. One takes effort. The other takes a glance at a header image and a decision that polish equals automation. Your choice reveals more about your relationship to technology than mine.</p></blockquote><hr><p>A 22-year-old designer I was considering for a project spent three hours editing a TikTok on her phone. Transitions, effects, music sync—all precision work. When I suggested she'd finish faster on a laptop, she looked at me like I'd proposed using a typewriter.</p><p>"Why would I need a laptop?"</p><p>Because laptops are command interfaces. Phones are consumption portals. The distinction matters more than anyone admits.</p><p>Not because phones can't create—they obviously can—but because the asymmetry between device types maps directly onto power structures we've stopped questioning. When you operate from a creation position, you gain command-and-control capabilities over people locked in consumption mode. The question isn't which device is "better." The question is: do you notice which mode you're operating from?</p><p>Think about the last time you wrote actual code on a phone. Not "fixed a typo in production at 2am while cursing existence"—I mean real development work. Multiple files open, testing, debugging, deploying.</p><p>You didn't. Because phones aren't optimized for creation at that scale. They're optimized for rapid-fire consumption: scroll, tap, swipe, consume. Even the "creator" apps—video editors, photo tools, drawing programs—operate within carefully bounded creation sandboxes. You're creating <em>content</em>, but you're not creating <em>systems</em>.</p><p>Laptops and desktops flip this. The default mode is generative work. Even consumption requires deliberate setup—install browser, navigate to site, manage tabs. The friction isn't a bug; it's the point. Creation requires friction. Friction creates intentionality. Intentionality creates agency.</p><p>Photography on phones: capture moments, apply filters, share. Photography on computers: RAW processing, color grading, compositing, print preparation.</p><p>Note-taking on phones: quick captures, voice memos, scattered thoughts. Note-taking on computers: interconnected knowledge systems, research databases, publication workflows.</p><p>Same activities. Completely different power relationships to the output.</p><!--$!--><template data-dgst="BAILOUT_TO_CLIENT_SIDE_RENDERING"></template><!--/$--><h2 id="command-positions-and-consumption-positions">Command Positions and Consumption Positions</h2><p>Military organizations understand this instinctively. Command centers use large displays, multiple screens, keyboards, mice—interfaces optimized for generating orders and processing complex information. Field units use tablets and phones—interfaces optimized for receiving commands and reporting status.</p><p>The same pattern appears everywhere:</p><p><strong>Trading floors</strong>: Banks spend millions on multi-monitor setups for traders. The creation position—analyzing markets, executing strategies, generating alpha—demands computational leverage. Their customers? Mobile apps with colorful buttons and simplified charts. Consumption interfaces for consumption participants.</p><p><strong>Software development</strong>: Engineers command multi-screen workstations with mechanical keyboards and precision mice. End users consume via touch interfaces designed to hide complexity. The power gradient isn't accidental—it's architected.</p><p><strong>Content platforms</strong>: YouTube creators edit on desktops with timeline editors and effect panels. Viewers watch on phones, swiping to the next dopamine hit. TikTok creators spend hours on composition and timing. Consumers scroll infinitely, training the algorithm with each micro-engagement.</p><p>The asymmetry creates and maintains hierarchies. Not through explicit control, but through interface design that nudges users into either command or compliance modes.</p><h2 id="watch-your-mind-shift-when-you-switch-devices">Watch Your Mind Shift When You Switch Devices</h2><p>Something curious happens when you switch from laptop to phone for the same task. Notice the mental shift.</p><p>Laptop mode: agency. Control. Possibility space expanding. I can modify this system. I can build new tools. I can automate this frustration away. The interface assumes competence and offers power.</p><p>Phone mode: flow. Ease. Possibility space contracting. This is how it works. These are my options. I adapt to the system. The interface assumes simplicity and offers convenience.</p><p>Neither is inherently wrong. But when 80% of your computing time happens in consumption mode, something shifts in how you relate to digital systems. You stop seeing them as malleable, hackable, controllable. You start seeing them as environmental conditions—like weather patterns you adapt to rather than infrastructures you can reshape.</p><p>This connects to what I explored in <a href="https://zakelfassi.com/blog/2025-08-16-the-great-cognitive-handoff">The Great Cognitive Handoff</a>—we're witnessing a phase transition in how humans relate to computational systems. But device choice determines <em>which side</em> of that transition you land on. Creation devices put you in the driver's seat of AI-assisted workflows. Consumption devices make you a passenger in someone else's architecture.</p><h2 id="generational-divergence-and-interface-fluency">Generational Divergence and Interface Fluency</h2><p>That designer isn't wrong to prefer her phone. She's adapted to the dominant computational interface of her generation. TikTok editing on mobile has reached near-parity with desktop video editing for certain output types. The creation sandbox got sophisticated enough for specific use cases.</p><p>But—and this matters—the sandbox remains someone else's. The app defines the possibility space. The platform determines what's possible. Users create <em>within</em> the system, never <em>of</em> the system.</p><p>Contrast with coding on a laptop. When you write software, you're not just using a tool—you're modifying the tool itself, extending its capabilities, potentially creating new tools entirely. The recursive loop of creation compounds. Each creation makes new creations possible.</p><p>As I outlined in <a href="https://zakelfassi.com/blog/2025-09-24-zaks-law-skill-half-life">Zak's Law of Skill Half-Life</a>, skills at lower abstraction levels have longer durability. Device choice determines which abstraction layers you access. Phones keep you at high abstraction—consumer of finished applications. Computers let you descend toward infrastructure, protocols, systems thinking.</p><p>The generational split isn't about capability. It's about default stance. Generation Z sees phones as primary computers because phones <em>are</em> functionally complete for consumption-primary workflows. But consumption-primary means command-secondary. And command-secondary means power-secondary.</p><h2 id="when-consumption-becomes-creation-sort-of">When Consumption Becomes Creation (Sort Of)</h2><p>The counterargument: "But I create on my phone constantly! Videos, photos, tweets, stories..."</p><p>Yes. And that's precisely the trap.</p><p>You're generating <em>content</em>—raw material for platform algorithms to process, distribute, monetize. The platform commands the distribution layer. You feed the system. The creation serves consumption at scale.</p><p>Real creation—the kind that shifts power dynamics—involves building new systems, not just feeding existing ones. Writing code that others will use. Designing tools that change workflows. Publishing research that alters understanding. Creating infrastructure, not just content.</p><p>Content creation on phones generates value primarily for platforms. Building systems on computers generates value for creators.</p><p>That's not gatekeeping—it's power topology. The difference between building the casino and playing the slots. Both involve skill, both generate outputs, but only one controls the house edge.</p><h2 id="intentional-device-selection-as-political-act">Intentional Device Selection as Political Act</h2><p>Recognizing the pattern enables intentional navigation. Device choice becomes strategic rather than habitual.</p><p><strong>Default to creation devices for:</strong></p><ul><li>System-level thinking and building</li><li>Long-form writing and deep research</li><li>Multi-step workflows requiring maintained context</li><li>Learning new technical skills</li><li>Any work where you want to control distribution</li></ul><p><strong>Default to consumption devices for:</strong></p><ul><li>Rapid information gathering</li><li>Social connection and lightweight engagement</li><li>Capturing moments and quick documentation</li><li>Consuming media you don't need to process deeply</li><li>Times when convenience outweighs agency</li></ul><p>The key word: <em>default</em>. Intentionality transforms the dynamic. You're not passively sorted into consumption mode by interface design. You're deliberately choosing based on what power position serves your goals.</p><p>When I write these posts, I use a laptop exclusively—though sometimes the initial spark gets captured on my phone when I'm on the go, or I'll send myself a voice note to preserve context. But the actual writing, structuring, editing? That's laptop work. The friction—managing files, handling git, processing images, structuring arguments across multiple editing sessions—that friction is generative. It forces deeper thinking. It enables system-level creation.</p><p>When I share the posts, I use my phone. Social platforms optimize for mobile consumption. Meeting audiences where they are means adapting to their interface context.</p><p>Creation on creation devices. Distribution via consumption devices. The split acknowledges the power topology rather than pretending it doesn't exist.</p><h2 id="nobody-mentions-the-surveillance-layer">Nobody Mentions the Surveillance Layer</h2><p>Consumption devices track better than creation devices. The business model demands it.</p><p>Phones know your location, contacts, communication patterns, consumption habits, attention spans, emotional states (inferred from usage), social networks, and behavioral predictions. Every interaction feeds models that predict and shape your next interaction. The consumption interface doubles as a surveillance interface.</p><p>Laptops can track too, obviously. But the friction matters. Installing tracking software on a laptop requires user cooperation or sophisticated attacks. Phones ship with pervasive tracking as default configuration, baked into the OS and every platform app.</p><p>Command positions benefit from information asymmetry. Consumption positions suffer from it. Your phone knows vastly more about you than you know about its decision systems. Your laptop—especially if you control the OS and software—inverts that dynamic.</p><p>The surveillance layer reinforces the power gradient. Consumption devices make you legible to algorithms. Creation devices let you examine and modify the algorithms themselves.</p><h2 id="field-notes-from-hybrid-workflows">Field Notes from Hybrid Workflows</h2><p>Complete abstinence isn't the answer. Phones aren't evil. Laptops aren't sacred. But <em>unconscious</em> device selection hands control to whoever designed the nudges.</p><p>I run hybrid workflows now, deliberately:</p><p><strong>Morning pages</strong>: Laptop. Long-form thinking requires maintained context and zero platform friction.</p><p><strong>Social media</strong>: Phone. Quick engagement, responding to mentions, staying connected. Consumption mode serves connection goals.</p><p><strong>Code</strong>: Laptop exclusively. No exceptions. Systems-level work demands systems-level interfaces.</p><p><strong>Photos</strong>: Phone for capture, laptop for selection and editing. The split separates the consumption moment (gathering reality) from the creation moment (shaping narrative).</p><p><strong>Learning</strong>: Depends. Consuming lectures and articles? Phone is fine. Actually building understanding through practice and experimentation? Laptop becomes essential.</p><p>The pattern: consumption activities work on either device. Creation activities—especially those requiring sustained attention and system-level manipulation—demand creation interfaces.</p><p>Hybrid workflows acknowledge both the convenience of consumption devices and the power of creation devices. The key is matching interface to intention rather than defaulting to whatever's nearest.</p><h2 id="why-this-isnt-actually-about-devices">Why This Isn't Actually About Devices</h2><p>The deeper pattern: every domain has creation/consumption splits, and the split determines power flow.</p><p><strong>Media</strong>: Creating video vs. watching video. Creating music vs. listening to music. Writing vs. reading.</p><p><strong>Economics</strong>: Building businesses vs. working in businesses. Designing financial instruments vs. using financial products.</p><p><strong>Governance</strong>: Writing policy vs. following policy. Shaping discourse vs. consuming discourse.</p><p><strong>Education</strong>: Researching and synthesizing vs. memorizing and regurgitating.</p><p>In every case, creation positions enable command-and-control over consumption positions. Not through force—through architecture. The systems are designed such that creators set parameters within which consumers operate.</p><p>Device choice is just the most visible manifestation. Phones optimize you for consumption across all domains. Laptops enable creation across all domains. The interface shapes the possibility space, which shapes agency, which shapes power.</p><p>The pattern appears in <a href="https://zakelfassi.com/blog/2025-08-11-empire-of-one">Empire of One</a> too—algorithmic systems assign roles based on engagement patterns. Consumption-mode users get served consumption-optimized roles. Creation-mode users retain more agency over their relationship to the system.</p><h2 id="what-comes-next-interface-convergence-or-divergence">What Comes Next: Interface Convergence or Divergence?</h2><p>Two futures branch from here:</p><p><strong>Convergence scenario</strong>: Devices become functionally equivalent. Phones gain full creation capabilities, laptops maintain consumption convenience. The split dissolves. Power dynamics flatten as interface asymmetry disappears.</p><p><strong>Divergence scenario</strong>: Creation and consumption interfaces deliberately separate further. Platforms optimize for behavioral sorting—consumption users get friction-free engagement loops, creation users get ever-more-powerful system-manipulation tools. The power gradient steepens.</p><p>Current trends suggest divergence. Platform incentives reward consumption (easier to monetize attention than agency). Creation tools grow more sophisticated but remain specialized. The middle ground—devices good at both—struggles commercially because optimization for one mode degrades the other.</p><p>Apple knows this. iPad occupies the uncomfortable middle: too constrained for serious creation, too expensive for pure consumption. The product fights its own identity. Meanwhile, MacBooks lean harder into creation (M-series chips optimized for professional workflows) and iPhones lean harder into consumption (algorithmic feeds perfected to near-addiction levels).</p><p>The market is choosing divergence. Which means power gradients will steepen unless we deliberately resist the sort.</p><h2 id="intentional-computing-as-resistance">Intentional Computing as Resistance</h2><p>The resistance isn't rejecting phones or fetishizing laptops. The resistance is <em>noticing</em> which mode you're operating in and <em>choosing</em> based on desired outcomes rather than interface nudges.</p><p>Questions for daily practice:</p><ul><li>Which device am I reaching for, and why?</li><li>Does this task serve my goals, or someone else's metrics?</li><li>Am I creating systems or feeding systems?</li><li>Would switching devices change my relationship to this work?</li><li>What power position am I accepting by using this interface?</li></ul><p>The questions create space between stimulus (notification, urge, habit) and response (grab phone, open app, scroll). That space is where agency lives.</p><p>Some days I deliberately leave my laptop at home. Force myself into consumption mode, see what happens. Other days I leave my phone on airplane mode. Force creation mode, notice the friction.</p><p>Both experiments reveal the same truth: the interface shapes the possible more than we want to admit. Recognizing the shaping creates opportunities to shape back.</p><h2 id="beyond-devices-your-default-stance-toward-reality">Beyond Devices: Your Default Stance Toward Reality</h2><p>Device choice reflects something more fundamental than technology preferences. It reflects your default stance toward information and power.</p><p>Do you see yourself primarily as a consumer of culture or creator of culture? Do you want to understand systems or use systems? Do you optimize for convenience or control?</p><p>Neither answer is "correct"—but the answer determines your position in power topologies that span everything from social platforms to economic systems to governance structures.</p><p>Creation devices signal and enable a particular relationship to reality: malleable, hackable, subject to intervention. Consumption devices signal and enable the opposite: fixed, given, requiring adaptation.</p><p>Both stances serve different purposes. The trap is unconscious default to one stance across all contexts. Because the stance becomes self-reinforcing. Consumption mode atrophies creation muscles. Creation mode can miss the forest for the trees of constant optimization.</p><p>The wisdom is flexibility—consciously choosing creation or consumption mode based on context, rather than being chosen by interface design decisions made by platform architects optimizing for their goals, not yours.</p><h2 id="field-manual-for-the-interface-wars">Field Manual for the Interface Wars</h2><p>One last thing before I close this laptop and switch to my phone for the rest of the evening:</p><p>The power dynamic isn't deterministic. You're not locked into consumption mode because you prefer phones. But you <em>are</em> accepting certain architectural choices about agency, control, and possibility space. Knowing that, you can:</p><p><strong>Choose creation devices when:</strong></p><ul><li>Learning new technical skills</li><li>Building systems or tools</li><li>Writing anything requiring sustained thought</li><li>Researching complex topics</li><li>Any work where you want leverage on your time</li></ul><p><strong>Choose consumption devices when:</strong></p><ul><li>Connecting with people</li><li>Gathering information quickly</li><li>Capturing moments</li><li>Relaxing without creating</li><li>Operating within established systems</li></ul><p><strong>Question your defaults when:</strong></p><ul><li>You reach for a device without thinking</li><li>Platform engagement feels compulsive</li><li>You feel controlled rather than in control</li><li>Your consumption/creation ratio tilts too far either direction</li><li>Interface friction annoys you (friction might be protective)</li></ul><p>The device in your hand isn't just a tool. It's a power topology made physical. Command or comply. Create or consume. Shape or adapt.</p><p>Both modes have value. But only one mode gets to decide what the other mode encounters.</p><p>So pay attention to your interface. Because your interface is paying attention to you.</p><hr><p><em>What's your consumption/creation ratio? Are you conscious of which mode you're operating from?

<p>I set up my own VPS, documented every step, and ended up with a repeatable
deployment pipeline. This is both a checklist for my future self and a guide for
anyone curious about self-hosting. Along the way I'll explain why I picked
Hetzner and Coolify, and how they compare with other options like DigitalOcean,
AWS, Render, or Fly.io.</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>This checklist provides a complete approach to VPS setup and management. This
isn’t just about saving money. It’s about control and understanding. By
self-hosting with Hetzner + Coolify, I built muscle memory for devops that paid
off in confidence and freedom.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to try VPS hosting, consider this a nudge.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>About 5 months ago I made the decision to <a href="https://jamesoclaire.com/2025/05/27/how-to-self-host-your-own-s3-in-2025/">start self hosting my own S3</a>. I was working on <a href="https://appgobin.info/companies">AppGoblin’s SDK tracking of the top 100k Android and iOS apps</a> so was wanting a lot of space, but for cheap. </p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="576" height="1024" src="https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-576x1024.jpg" alt="laptop running garage s3" srcset="https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-169x300.jpg 169w, https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-864x1536.jpg 864w, https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-300x533.jpg 300w, https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352-850x1511.jpg 850w, https://jamesoclaire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251003_0736352.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px"></figure>



<p><br>I got really lucky with getting a second hand Framework laptop. The laptop was missing it’s screen, and was one of the older ones, so it was perfect for a home server. In addition I bought a “just a bunch of disks” JBOD. The framework laptop is running ZFS + <a href="https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/">garage S3</a>. </p>



<h2>I’m happy to report I haven’t thought about this laptop for months</h2>



<p>I’ve been away, I’ve been working, I’ve been busy, and I’ve definitely been using my S3. But I hadn’t thought about the laptop in 4 months. When I finally logged in, I saw I’ve used 10TB of space and it was patiently waiting for a restart for some upgrades.  I nervously restarted, and was so relieved to see everything come right back up.</p>



<h2>I updated garage s3 with no issues as well</h2>



<p>I also saw a pending upgrade for garage v1 to v2. This went along without a hitch too. Feels like it’s been a good weekend.</p>



<h2>I’ve been warned…</h2>



<p>Just so you know, I understand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zfs/comments/1l1dwp1/i_hard_rebooted_my_server_a_couple_times_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">my use case for ZFS is possibly a bit non standard as I’m using a USB to connect the laptop and JBOD</a>. This initially caused me issues with ZFS when garage was heavily reading and writing (the initial setup had the SQLite metadata also stored on the JBOD/ZFS). </p>



<p>I moved my metadata to the laptop, which has so far resolved any ZFS issues again.</p>



<h2>All in all, it’s been a good weekend</h2>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Back in 2009 Tim Berners-Lee drafted a web-specification for "Socially Aware Cloud Storage":</p><blockquote>There is an architecture in which a few existing or Web protocols are gathered together with some glue to make a world wide system in which applications (desktop or web application) can work on top of a layer of commodity read-write storage.<p>Crucial design issues are that principals (users) and groups are identifies by URIs, and so are global in scope, and that elements of storage are access controlled using those global identifiers. The result is that storage becomes a commodity, independent of the application running on it.</p></blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/CloudStorage.html"><div><p>Socially aware cloud storage - Design Issues</p><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/favicon.ico" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/diagrams/social/simondseconoart-small.png" alt=""></p></a></figure><p>Several of these ideas were going around in the late 2000s, shortly after the explosive growth of "web2" monoliths like Facebook.</p><p>Another spiritually similar idea being championed at the time came from the Opera browser folks who wanted to put <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">"a web server in your browser"</a>.</p><p>While 'Opera Unite' never fully materialized, Tim's spec got significant traction some years down the road as one privacy crisis after another made the case for stronger web agency self-evident.</p><p>In 2015 Tim &amp; co. <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/web-inventor-tim-berners-lees-next-project-platform-gives-users-control-their-data" rel="noreferrer">secured some funding for the Solid Protocol</a>.</p><blockquote>Right now we have the worst of both worlds, in which people not only cannot control their data, but also can’t really use it, due to it being spread across a number of different silo-ed websites. Our goal is to develop a web architecture that gives users ownership over their data, including the freedom to switch to new applications in search of better features, pricing, and policies.”</blockquote><figure><a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/04/tim-berners-lee-inventor-web-plots-radical-overhaul-creation/"><div><p>Tim Berners-Lee, Inventor of the Web, Plots a Radical Overhaul of His Creation</p><p>The creator of the web just received the equivalent of the Nobel Prize for computing.

For example, social networks would still run in the cloud. But you could store your data locally. Alternately, you could choose a different cloud server run by a company or community you trust. <p>You might have different servers for different types of information—for health and fitness data, say—that is completely separate from the one you use for financial records.</p></blockquote><p>To this day, Tim continues to eloquently champion <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/28/why-i-gave-the-world-wide-web-away-for-free">the virtues of the Solid vision</a>.</p><blockquote>We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual. Solid is an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.<p>Sharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/06/opera-hoping-to-reinvent-the-web-by-making-browser-a-server/">You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered&nbsp;by it.</a></p></blockquote><p>The <a href="https://solidproject.org/">Solid Protocol</a> remains an excellent idea and has even culminated in an official <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/09/linked-web-storage-wg-charter.html">web specification</a>, but Solid has not yet amounted to any mainstream adoption on the web. Its primary financial sponsor <a href="https://www.inrupt.com/" rel="noreferrer">Inrupt</a> (of which Tim is co-founder &amp; CTO) has focused on the enterprise market as a path to sustainability; it remains to be seen what resources will be directed towards web-scale adoption of Solid.</p><p>Thankfully those of us who want data ownership and agency in our web applications <em>now</em> don't have to wait. <a href="https://atproto.com/" rel="noreferrer">AT Protocol</a> was ushered in by the folks at <a href="https://bsky.social/" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, now with a network of over 30M people strong and increasingly spread across multiple federated platforms/communities like <a href="https://blackskyweb.xyz/" rel="noreferrer">Blacksky</a> or <a href="https://tangled.org/">Tangled</a>.</p><p>While the respective architectures of the <em>Solid </em>and <em>AT </em>protocols are quite different, they're pointing to the same Open Social Web, re-built on the principles of user-sovereign data storage.</p><p>What web-user sovereignty looks like in practice, from the vantage point of atproto, has been expertly illustrated by <a href="https://danabra.mov/">danabra.mov</a></p><figure><a href="https://overreacted.io/open-social/"><div><p>Open Social — overreacted</p><p>The protocol is the API.</p><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/icon.png?e0852c1e2c7f0e65" alt=""></p></div><p><img src="https://overreacted.io/open-social/opengraph-image?5b0b970dfd19bb8c" alt=""></p></a></figure><blockquote>Notice that Alice’s handle is now <code>@alice.com</code>. It is not allocated by a social media company [like facebook.com/alice]. Rather, her handle is <em>the</em> universal “internet handle”, i.e. a domain. Alice <em>owns</em> the <code>alice.com</code> domain, so she can <em>use it as a handle</em> on any open social app. (On most open social apps, she goes by <code>@alice.com</code>, but for others she wants a distinct disconnected identity, so she owns another handle she’d rather not share.)<p>Bob owns a domain too, even though he isn’t technical. He might not even know what a “domain” is. Bob just thinks of <code>@bob.com</code> as his “internet handle”. Some open social apps will offer you a free subdomain on registration, just like Gmail gives you a free Gmail address, or may offer an extra flow for buying a domain. You’re not locked into your first choice, and can swap to a different domain later.</p><p>(...) With open social, Alice’s data—her posts, likes, follows, etc—<em>is</em> hosted on the web itself. Alongside her personal site, Alice now has a <em>personal repository</em> of her data.</p></blockquote><p>This new paradigm is made technically possible by what the AT protocol refers to as a <a href="https://atproto.wiki/en/wiki/reference/core-architecture/pds" rel="noreferrer">Personal Data Server</a> or PDS for short (what Solid calls a <a href="https://solidproject.org/faq#pod">Pod</a>).</p><p>The notion of a 'PDS' quickly comes off as something very technical and nerdy which is why it's not mentioned once in Dan's explainer, even though it's still targeted at an audience of <em>web nerds</em>. But really the only obscure word here is the <em>Server</em>, which in this context is interchangeable with <em>Storage</em>, as in Personal Data Storage.</p><p>Even regular internet users have some mental model of what personalized data storage entails, especially with the complementary framing of <em>collectively owned and operated</em> data storage.</p><h2 id="data-banking-coops">Data-banking Coops</h2><p>If you're a regular internet user the PDS paradigm won't move your data from the cloud to your personal computer. Most people will still rely on an institutional cloud service, but instead of data-banking with a shareholder-controlled corporation most people’s data can be entrusted to the equivalent of member-owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_union">credit unions</a> for data storage.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg" alt="As the economy was transformed by industrialization and then by consumer banking, powerful new players such as Standard Oil, J.P. Morgan, and a handful of others threatened the freedom of citizens. In order to provide a counterweight to these new powers, citizens joined together to form trade unions and cooperative banking institutions, which were federally chartered to represent their members’ interests. These citizen organizations helped balance the economic and social power between large and small players and between employers and worker. The same collective organization is required to move from an individualized asset-based understanding of data control to a collective system based on rights and accountability, with legal standards upheld by a new class of representatives who act as fiduciaries for their members. In the U.S. almost 100 million people are members of credit unions, not-for-profit institutions owned by their members, and already chartered to securely manage their members’ digital data and to represent them in a wide variety of financial transactions, including insurance, investments, and benefits. The question then is, could we apply the same push for citizen power to the area of data rights in the ever-growing digital economy?" loading="lazy" width="1418" height="643" srcset="https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 600w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/size/w1000/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.muni.town/content/images/2025/09/IMG_2977.jpeg 1418w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Source: </span><a href="https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf" rel="noreferrer"><span>https://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Data-Cooperatives-final.pdf</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>One in every three US adults banks with a Credit Union. Achieving similar or better numbers for data storage is far from inconceivable considering how much our collective experience with Big Banking mirrors that of Big Tech/Social.</p><p>The concept of <a href="https://www.cip.org/blog/data-cooperatives" rel="noreferrer">data cooperatives</a> has already gained a lot of traction in the fediverse with several providers like <a href="https://social.coop/">social.coop</a>, <a href="https://data.coop/">data.coop</a> and <a href="https://cosocial.ca/">cosocial.ca</a> being operational for many years and still going strong. Soon the AT network will have a similarly co-owned institution in <a href="https://northskysocial.com/" rel="noreferrer">Northsky</a>.</p><p>Whether these providers are strictly cooperatives in the formal sense isn't what's most important here though; any suffuciently transparent, democratic and community-oriented data bank (like the aforementioned Blacksky, or the forthcoming Eurosky) is a valid steward and co-creator of an Open Social.</p><p>Data Ownership as a conversation changes when data resides primarily with people-governed institutions rather than corporations. Rather than arguing for what kinds of data we <em>ought to be</em> able to download from the corporate silos, the platforms should be asking us what kinds of data they may copy from <em>our servers</em>, and only with strictly temporary allowances.</p><p>And while the separation of user data and social platform is most fully realized today in the AT network, there are exciting signs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub">cross-pollination happening</a> in the ongoing development of atproto’s predecessor <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub</a>.

            <pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2025 08:12:24 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li">https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/?li</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479820">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <!-- Left content -->
  <p>My colleagues and friends know that I prefer to communicate
with them via email rather than chat messaging.
There are many benefits in such a choice.
You may want to consider them and adopt the same stance.</p>
<h2 id="unified-inbox">Unified inbox</h2>
<p>My messages arrive in a single program, where I can process and tag them.
With messaging programs I’d have to iterate through Teams, Signal, WhatsApp,
Slack, Viber, FaceTime, LinkedIn, Messenger, Google Meet, Discord,
Mattermost, Instagram, WebEx, and possibly others,
to collect and process the messages sent on each platform.</p>
<h2 id="unified-archive">Unified archive</h2>
<p>Similarly, if I want to find a past message I have exactly one place
to search: my email archive.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-availability">Long term availability</h2>
<p>Companies get out of business or become acquired
and services can easily be discontinued;
for a reminder have a look at the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services">64 services Google has discontinued</a>.
If you ever exchanged messages on ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger, Skype,
Yahoo! Messenger, Google Hangouts, GChat, BlackBerry Messenger, or Campfire
your messages are now gone.
With email and local message storage
you control the lifetime of your messages
(provided you perform regular backups).
My email archive contains the messages I have
sent and received from 1986 onward.</p>
<h2 id="rich-functionality">Rich functionality</h2>
<p>Email clients offer rich functionality.
In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Thunderbird">Thunderbird</a>
email client, I use the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folders for categorizing important messages.</li>
<li>Filters to file messages into folders and to avoid some spam.</li>
<li>Send-later functionality to manage message flows.</li>
<li>Tagging messages that require special handling (e.g.&nbsp;pending action,
handle at home, or handle at work).</li>
<li>Address book, with auto-filled salutations in two languages as a custom field.</li>
<li>Macros to automate the signing and sending of attachments.</li>
<li>Sorting of messages through various fields (sender, date, topic).</li>
<li>Sophisticated message search based on arbitrary field contents
and their combinations.</li>
<li>Off-line message processing and composition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some messaging systems offer some of these features, but all
features are certainly not universally available.</p>
<h2 id="single-interface">Single interface</h2>
<p>Having a single messaging interface allows me to invest in becoming
maximally productive in the email client application I’m using.
I can learn its features in-depth,
I can tailor it with plug-ins,
and I can extend it to fit my needs.
When using it (many hours a day)
my mind and muscles memorize how to perform common actions.
With messaging platforms I’d only be able to dabble in each.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-communication">Asynchronous communication</h2>
<p>Rather than having
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a>
and concentration interrupted by incoming message notifications,
with email I can easily decide when to fetch and process messages.</p>
<h2 id="freedom-from-ads-and-addictive-content">Freedom from ads and addictive content</h2>
<p>Some “free” messaging services serve together with the messages
ads or addictive content, such as short-form videos.
Email clients will only display email messages.</p>
<h2 id="confidentiality">Confidentiality</h2>
<p>Depending on the email provider I choose, I can obtain strong
guarantees on who reads my email messages.
Some, like <a href="https://proton.me/mail">Proton Mail</a> are explicitly
targeting people who want to protect their privacy.
In contrast, many messaging platform will scan my messages
to send me targeted ads or train their AI systems on them.</p>
<h2 id="open-protocols">Open protocols</h2>
<p>Email is transported with open protocols (SMTP, IMAP),
which means I can use any email client and operating system
I want and obtain any functionality I need,
without depending on the business model or whims of the company
controlling a proprietary messaging platform.
I can even develop my own clients, something I have often done
to automate the sending of multi-part email messages to students
or conference committee members.</p>
<h2 id="open-storage-format">Open storage format</h2>
<p>My messages are stored as plain text files in the super-simple
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">Mbox</a> file format,
which means I can easily process them with other tools,
reliably create backup copies, and
move them from one email client to another.</p>
<p>For example, I have a small script that removes all attachments
from old email messages, allowing me to keep my email archive
in a manageable size.
In other cases I’ve run on my message files scripts to analyze the messages I
send and receive, and I’ve opened them in my editor to fix
hardware-induced corruption.</p>

<p>In short, email can be an amazingly open and reliable environment
that fosters exceptional productivity.
We shouldn’t settle for anything less.</p>

					<h2>Social Cooling is a name for the <em>long-term negative side effects</em> of living in a reputation economy:</h2>
					
					<div>
							<h3>1. A culture of conformity</h3>
							<p>Have you ever hesitated to click&nbsp;on a link because you thought your visit might be logged, and it could look bad?</p>
							<p>More and more people feel this pressure, and they are starting to apply self-censorship.
						</p></div>

							<h3>2. A culture of risk-aversion</h3>
							<div><p>When doctors in New York were given scores this had unexpected results.</p><p>
							
							Doctors that tried to help advanced cancer patients had a higher mortality rate, which translated into a lower score.</p></div>
							<p>Doctors that didn't try to help were rewarded with high scores, even though their patients died prematurely.</p>
							<p><em>Rating systems can create unwanted incentives, and increase pressure to conform to a bureaucratic average.</em></p>
						</div>
			<div>
							<h3>3. Increased social rigidity</h3>
							<p>Digital reputation systems are limiting our ability and our will to protest injustice.</p>
							<p>In China each adult citizen is getting a government mandated "<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-34592186">social credit score</a>". This represents how well behaved they are, and is based on crime records,&nbsp;what they say on social media, what they buy,&nbsp;and even the scores of their friends.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>I</span>t’s not just you. The internet is getting worse, fast. The services we rely on, that we once loved? They’re all turning into piles of shit, all at once. Ask any Facebook user who has to scroll past 10 screens of engagement-bait, AI slop and surveillance ads just to get to one post by the people they are on the service to communicate with. This is infuriating. Frustrating. And, depending on how important those services are to you, <em>terrifying</em>.</p><p>In 2022, I coined a term to describe the sudden-onset platform collapse going on all around us: <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/nov/26/enshittification-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-explained" data-link-name="in body link">enshittification</a></em>. To my bittersweet satisfaction, that word is doing big&nbsp;numbers. In fact, it has achieved escape velocity. It&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;just a way to say something got worse. It’s an analysis that explains the way an online service gets worse, how that worsening unfolds, and the contagion that’s causing everything to get worse, all at once.</p><p>This moment we’re living through, this Great Enshittening, is a material phenomenon, much like a disease, with symptoms, a mechanism and an epidemiology. When doctors observe patients who are sick with a novel pathogen, their first order of business is creating a natural history of the disease. This natural history is an ordered catalogue of the disease’s progress: what symptoms do patients exhibit, and in which order?</p><p>Here’s the natural history of enshittification:<br><strong>1</strong> First, platforms are good to their users.<br><strong>2</strong> Then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers.<br><strong>3</strong> Next, they abuse those customers to claw back all the value for themselves – and become a giant pile of shit.</p><p>This pattern is everywhere. Once you learn about it, you’ll start seeing it, too. Take <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon</a>, a company that started out by making it possible to have any book shipped to your door and then became the only game in town for everything else, even as it dodged taxes and filled up with self-immolating crapgadgets and other junk.</p><p>In Jeff Bezos’s original business plan for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Amazon</a>, the company was called Relentless. Critics say that this is a reference to Bezos’s cutthroat competitive instincts, but Bezos always insisted that it was a reference to his company’s relentless commitment to customer service.</p><p>How did Amazon go from a logistics company that got packages to you quickly and efficiently to a behemoth of digital content defined by the Prime experience (which has much less to do with free shipping now and more with everything else)?</p><hr><h2 id="stage-1-good-to-users"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>1: good to </strong><strong>users</strong></h2><p>Amazon started with a large surplus of cash that it was able to allocate to its customers, and allocate it did. The company raised a fortune from early investors, then a larger fortune by listing on the stock market. Then it used that fortune to subsidise many goods, selling them below cost. It also subsidised shipping and offered a no-questions-asked, postage-paid returns policy.</p><p>This offer tempted millions of users to pile on to the platform. Once they were there, Prime membership went a long way to locking them in. Paying for shipping a year in advance is a powerful incentive to do your shopping on Amazon. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of Prime subscribers begin their e-commerce searches on Amazon and, if they find what they’re looking for, don’t shop around for a better deal.</p><p>You can think of Prime as a form of soft lock-in, Amazon binding you to its platform with a silken ribbon. But Amazon’s also got some iron chains in its toolbox. All the audiobooks and movies, and most of the ebooks and emagazines, you buy from Amazon are permanently locked to its platform.</p><p>They are sold with digital rights management (DRM), a form of encryption designed to force you to view or listen using apps that Amazon controls. Break up with Amazon and delete your apps, and you will lose all the media you’ve ever bought from the platform. For a certain kind of reader, listener or movie buff, this is a very high switching cost indeed.</p><p>Amazon has one more trick up its sleeve: after years of selling goods below cost, it has completed the work that big box stores started, eliminating swaths of small, independent, brick-and-mortar businesses. Its online predatory pricing tactics have done the same for much of the e-commerce world.</p><p>That means shopping anywhere other than Amazon has become substantially more inconvenient. These tactics – Prime, DRM and predatory pricing – make it very hard <em>not</em> to shop at Amazon. With users locked in, to proceed with the enshittification playbook,&nbsp;Amazon needed to get its business customers locked in, too.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-2-abusing-users-good-to-businesses"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>2: abusing users, good to business</strong><strong>es</strong></h2><p>Amazon was initially very good to those business customers. It paid full price for their goods, then sold them below cost to its customers. It subsidised returns and customer service, too. It ran a clean search engine, which put the best matches for shoppers’ queries at the top of the page, creating a path to glory merchants could walk merely by selling quality goods at fair prices.</p><p>Then, once those merchants were locked in, Amazon put the screws on them. Amazon brags about this technique, which it calls “the flywheel”. It brings in users with low prices and a large selection. This attracts merchants who are eager to sell to those users. The merchants’ dependence on those customers allows Amazon to extract higher discounts from those merchants, and that brings in more users, which makes the platform even more indispensable for merchants, allowing the company to require even deeper discounts – and around and around the flywheel spins.</p><p>Let’s take a step back. This flywheel is the direct product of a radical legal theory that has had the world in its grip since the late 1970s. From the 1890s until the Jimmy Carter administration, US corporations’ power was blunted by antitrust law, which treated large companies as threats <em>simply because they were large</em>. Once a company is too big to fail, it becomes too big to jail, and then too big to care. Antitrust law was designed to fight that apathy and force companies to care.</p><p>A rival – and frankly terrible – theory of antitrust law says that the only time a government should intervene against a monopolist is when it is sure that the monopolist is using its scale to raise prices or lower quality. This is the consumer welfare standard theory and its premise is that when we find monopolies in the wild, they are almost certainly large and powerful thanks to the quality of their offerings. Any time you find that people all buy the same goods from the same store, you should assume that this is the very best store, selling the very best goods. It would be perverse (goes the theory) for the government to harass companies for being so excellent that everyone loves them.</p><p>It was under this theory that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jimmy-carter" data-link-name="in body link">Jimmy Carter</a> started to remove a few of the Jenga blocks from the antitrust system. Then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ronald-reagan" data-link-name="in body link">Ronald Reagan</a> came along and tore them out by the fistful. (Most of the rightwing policies for which we remember Reagan <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2023/04/27/much-of-ronald-reagans-presidency-was-foreshadowed-by-jimmy-carters-policies/" data-link-name="in body link">started under Carter</a>, who was hoping to woo conservative voters. He failed.) Every president since – Republican or Democrat – has followed Reagan’s example, up to (but not including) <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden" data-link-name="in body link">Joe Biden</a>.</p><p>The Amazon flywheel is designed to fit neatly into the consumer welfare framework. It proclaims itself to be an enemy to merchants on behalf of consumers. The flywheel is all about lowering prices, and the consumer welfare standard theory prizes low prices above all else.</p><hr><h2 id="stage-3-a-giant-pile-of-shit"><strong>Stage </strong><strong>3: a giant pile of shit</strong></h2><p>Amazon has a myriad of tactics at its disposal for shifting value from business customers to itself, some of which also involve shifting value away from end users, no matter what the cute flywheel pitch says.</p><p>It uses its overview of merchants’ sales, as well as its ability to observe the return addresses on direct shipments from merchants’ contracting factories, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/jun/07/independent-uk-retailers-claim-1bn-damages-against-amazon" data-link-name="in body link">cream off its merchants’ bestselling items and clone them</a>, relegating the original seller to page umpty-million of its search results.</p><p>Amazon also crushes its merchants under a mountain of junk fees pitched as optional but effectively mandatory. Take Prime: a merchant has to give up a huge share of each sale to be included in Prime, and merchants that don’t use Prime are pushed so far down in the search results, they might as well cease to exist.</p><p>Same with <a href="https://sell.amazon.co.uk/fulfilment-by-amazon?ld=SEUKFBAAdGog-Top-Kwds_14921146748_129850349469_kwd-23792740295_e_565464207487_c_sig-Cj0KCQjw_rPGBhCbARIsABjq9cerrKp9B1eCyx3wzgQTJzVZozgQC7258a5neee6dQ9lMOd6qf4PaK4aAgfiEALw_wcB_asret_&amp;amp;id=go_cmp-14921146748_adg-129850349469_ad-565464207487_kwd-23792740295_devc_ext-_prd-" data-link-name="in body link">Fulfilment by Amazon</a>, a “service” in which a merchant sends its items to an Amazon warehouse to be packed and delivered with Amazon’s own inventory. This is far more expensive than comparable (or superior) shipping services from rival logistics companies, and a merchant that ships through one of those rivals is, again, relegated even farther down the search rankings.</p><p>All told, Amazon makes so much money charging merchants to deliver the wares they sell through the platform that its own shipping is fully subsidised. In other words, Amazon gouges its merchants so much that it pays nothing to ship its own goods, which compete directly with those merchants’ goods.</p><p>Here’s where Amazon’s attacks on its merchants’ bottom lines turn into higher prices for its customers. A merchant that pays Amazon through the nose needs to make up the money somewhere. Hypothetically, merchants could eat Amazon’s fees themselves – in other words, if Amazon wants a 10% fee on an item with a 20% profit margin, the seller could split the difference, and settle for a 10% profit.</p><p>But Amazon’s fee isn’t 10%. Add all the junk fees together and an Amazon seller is being screwed out of 45-51 cents on every dollar it earns there. Even if it wanted to absorb the “Amazon tax” on your behalf, it couldn’t. Merchants just don’t make 51% margins.</p><p>So merchants must jack up prices, which they do. A lot. Now, you may have noticed that Amazon’s prices aren’t any higher than the prices that you pay elsewhere. There’s a good reason for that: when merchants raise their prices on Amazon, they are required to raise their prices everywhere else, even on their own direct-sales stores. This arrangement is called most-favoured-nation status, and it’s key to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/26/amazon-antitrust-lawsuit-analysis-big-tech" data-link-name="in body link">US Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust lawsuit against Amazon</a>.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-34">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-34" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Let the implications of most-favoured nation settle in. If Amazon is taxing merchants 45-51 cents on every dollar they make, and if merchants are hiking their prices everywhere their goods are sold, then it follows you’re paying the Amazon tax no matter where you shop – even the corner mom-and-pop hardware store.</p><p>It gets worse. On average, the first result in an Amazon search is 29% more expensive than the best match for your search. Click any of the top four links on the top of your screen and you’ll pay an average of 25% more than you would for your best match – which, on average, is located 17 places down in an Amazon search result.</p><p>Why does this happen? Because Amazon makes more than <em>$</em><em>50b</em><em>n every year</em> charging merchants for search placement. When you search for a product on Amazon, the top results aren’t the best matches: they’re the matches that pay the highest fees to Amazon to be top of the list.</p><p>Researchers Rory Van Loo and Nikita Aggarwal call this “<a href="https://scholarship.law.bu.edu/faculty_scholarship/3645/" data-link-name="in body link">Amazon’s pricing paradox</a>”. Amazon gets to insist that it has the lowest prices in the business, but no one can find those prices. Instead, we all pay a massive Amazon tax every time we shop there, <em>and</em> the merchants we buy from are paying an Amazon tax, too.</p><p>That means that, on average, the stuff at the top of an Amazon search results page is <em>bad</em>. It’s low-quality, high-priced junk. Even when you’re buying a known quantity, such as a specific brand of AA batteries, the top item will usually be more expensive than the items lower down on the page – the ones without the splashy banners advertising “Best Seller” or “Amazon’s Choice”. The Amazon smile logo gets a lot more sinister when it appears next to a top search result that costs 29% more than the best match for your query, thanks to Amazon’s $50bn-a-year paid search placement.</p><p>Not that you can find lower prices through anything as simple as sorting your search results by price. The merchants that dominate the search listings will play games with quantity to have the result with the lowest price, even if the price per unit is much higher. For example, a four-pack of AAs priced at $3.99 is more expensive per battery than a 16-pack priced at $10 (ie $1 versus $0.63), but sort-by-lowest-price will bury the better deal on the third or fourth page of results.</p><p>This is only the beginning. Amazon has clawed back value from buyers and sellers in many more ways. It underinvests in anti-fraud, so the top-scoring items with the highest user ratings are often terrible but are garlanded with (paid) rave reviews. Merchants with high-quality offerings are faced with two bad options: either they sink to the bottom of the rankings, or they cheat, too. If they <em>do</em> cheat, they’ll have to raise the prices of their merchandise in order to pay for the specialised fraud-as-a-service scum who gin up all those fake reviews. Then, if they get caught, they’ll be banished from Amazon and either go bust or have to start all over again under a new business name.</p><p>But for Amazon, all of this is fine. It’s how its system works, its flywheel. Amazon makes money when you are satisfied, and when you’re furious. The costs are borne by sellers, and by you. Why <em>would</em> the company invest in fighting fraud under those circumstances?</p><p>That’s also why Amazon puts so little effort into policing rotten sellers – and why so many of the “brands” there are consonant-heavy nonsense strings, seemingly generated at random by fly-by-nights that pop up and disappear, then pop up again under a new name.</p><p>This is end-stage enshittification. Amazon locked in its customers, then squeeeeezed, counting on a few good, desperate sellers to keep the system going. Then it clawed value away from its good sellers, leaving behind bad sellers that are a further source of misery for us.</p><p>Now Amazon is in the terminal stage. We’re all still stuck to the platform, but we get less and less value out of it. And because we’re all still there, buying Prime and starting (and ending) our purchase planning with Amazon’s enshittified search results, the merchants who rely on selling to us are stuck there, too, earning less and less from every sale.</p><p>The platform has turned into a pile of shit, and we’re at the bottom of it.</p><hr><p><span>A</span> confession: I am no true believer in markets as the best arbiter of how our society should work, who should be in charge of it and how its productive capacity should be organised. Like other leftists, I am deeply suspicious of capitalism. I understand the temptation to look at all this verbiage about enshittification, throw your hands up and say, “What do you expect? Capitalism always produces crises of production. Enshittification is just a sweary euphemism for capitalism.”</p><p>But this is wrong. There are meaningful differences between the internet as it stands today – the enshitternet – and the old, good internet we once had. The enshitternet is a source of pain, precarity and immiseration for the people we love. The indignities of harassment, scams, disinformation, surveillance, wage theft, extraction and rent-seeking have always been with us, but they were a minor sideshow on the old, good internet and they are the everything and all of the enshitternet.</p><p>This has real, material consequences for our comrades in the struggle for a better world. The internet that spawned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/occupy" data-link-name="in body link">Occupy</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement" data-link-name="in body link">Black Lives Matter </a>has become hostile to the maintenance of radical political movements and is inimical to the founding of new ones. That really matters. Not because the internet is the most important issue facing us today. Far from it. Compared with the climate emergency, genocide, inequality, corruption, democratic backsliding, authoritarianism and sustained racist, homophobic, misogynist and transphobic attacks, the internet is just a sideshow. But the internet is the terrain upon which these fights will be waged. It is the communications medium we will use to organise to save our species and planet from their imminent eradication. We can’t win these fights without a free, fair and open internet.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/18/my-hero-audre-lorde-jackie-kay" data-link-name="in body link">Audre Lorde</a> was far smarter than I am about nearly everything, but when she wrote, “<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/audre-lorde-the-master-s-tools-will-never-dismantle-the-master-s-house" data-link-name="in body link">The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s house</a>”, she was manifestly wrong. The master’s tools were used to build that house in the first place – that makes them the ideal tools to take it to bits and rebuild it to shelter us.</p><p>We can halt the creeping enshittification of every digital device. We can build a better, enshittification-resistant digital nervous system, one fit to coordinate the mass movements we will need to fight fascism, end genocide and save our planet and our species.</p><figure id="d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:54,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘My house filled with stuff while my bank account drained’: how I stopped impulse buying&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;d30261f5-99f3-45df-9c5e-0edbb4e70d5f&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/thefilter/2025/feb/27/how-to-stop-impulse-buying&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>You won’t be able to do it alone. Your personal consumption choices might make a difference to the merchants you patronise, but they have no effect on the policies that created our enshittogenic environment. Just as you can’t save the planet by diligently sorting your recycling, you can’t stop enshittification by “voting with your wallet” (those votes are always won by those with the thickest wallets, and that’s the billionaires who made money by enshittifying everything).</p><p>Take Amazon: to fix Amazon, we need policy solutions. We need to ban predatory pricing – selling goods below cost to keep competitors out of the market (and then jacking them up again). We need to impose structural separation on the company so it can either be a platform, or compete with the sellers that rely on it as a platform. We need to curb its junk fees, which suck 45-51 cents on every dollar merchants take in. We need to end its most favoured nation deal, which forces merchants who raise their prices on Amazon to pay these fees to raise their prices everywhere else, too. We need to unionise its drivers and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/amazon-diaries" data-link-name="in body link">warehouse workers</a>. We need to treat its rigged search results as the fraud they are.</p><p>The path to a better Amazon doesn’t lie through consumer activism, or appeals to the its conscience. Corporations, being artificial, immortal colony-organisms that use humans as their inconvenient gut flora, do not have consciences to appeal to. The path leads through coalitions: of consumers and merchants who are tired of being robbed; of workers who are tired of being immiserated and maimed; of competitors who are tired of being strong-armed by a monopolist bully; of tax-justice activists who are tired of trillion-dollar multinationals ducking their obligations. Systemic problems have systemic solutions, not individual ones. You can’t shop your way out of a monopoly.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/martin-luther-king" data-link-name="in body link">Martin Luther King Jr </a>once said, “It may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, but it can stop him from lynching me, and I think that’s pretty important, also.”</p><p>It may be true that regulation can’t force corporate sociopaths to conceive of you as a human being entitled to dignity and fair treatment, and not just an ambulatory wallet, a supply of gut bacteria for the immortal colony organism that is a limited liability corporation. But it can make that exec fear you enough to treat you fairly and afford you dignity, even if he doesn’t think you deserve it. And I think that’s pretty important.</p><p><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> This is an edited extract from Enshittification: Why Everything Suddenly Got Worse and What to Do About It by Cory Doctorow, published by Verso at £22 on 14 October.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Today, we’re introducing new capabilities for managing your agents’ context on the Claude Developer Platform: context editing and the memory tool.</p><p>With our latest model, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Claude Sonnet 4.5</a>, these capabilities enable developers to build AI agents capable of handling long-running tasks at higher performance and without hitting context limits or losing critical information.</p><h2 id="context-windows-have-limits-but-real-work-doesnt">Context windows have limits, but real work doesn’t</h2><p>As production agents handle more complex tasks and generate more tool results, they often exhaust their effective context windows—leaving developers stuck choosing between cutting agent transcripts or degrading performance. Context management solves this in two ways, helping developers ensure only relevant data stays in context and valuable insights get preserved across sessions.</p><p><strong>Context editing</strong> automatically clears stale tool calls and results from within the context window when approaching token limits. As your agent executes tasks and accumulates tool results, context editing removes stale content while preserving the conversation flow, effectively extending how long agents can run without manual intervention. This also increases the effective model performance as Claude focuses only on relevant context.</p><div><figure><img alt="Visualization comparing available context before context editing and after context editing." loading="lazy" width="1920" height="800" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1x, https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://www.anthropic.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww-cdn.anthropic.com%2Fimages%2F4zrzovbb%2Fwebsite%2F8ad2952bc0513750088cdfd309ee83ba0fd15438-1920x800.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></figure></div><p><strong>The memory tool</strong> enables Claude to store and consult information outside the context window through a file-based system. Claude can create, read, update, and delete files in a dedicated memory directory stored in your infrastructure that persists across conversations. This allows agents to build up knowledge bases over time, maintain project state across sessions, and reference previous learnings without having to keep everything in context.</p><p>The memory tool operates entirely client-side through tool calls. Developers manage the storage backend, giving them complete control over where the data is stored and how it’s persisted.</p><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 enhances both capabilities with built-in context awareness—tracking available tokens throughout conversations to manage context more effectively.</p><p>Together, these updates create a system that improves agent performance:</p><ul><li>Enable longer conversations by automatically removing stale tool results from context</li><li>Boost accuracy by saving critical information to memory—and bring that learning across successive agentic sessions</li></ul><h2 id="building-long-running-agents">Building long-running agents</h2><p>Claude Sonnet 4.5 is the best model in the world for building agents. These features unlock new possibilities for long-running agents—processing entire codebases, analyzing hundreds of documents, or maintaining extensive tool interaction histories. Context management builds on this foundation, ensuring agents can leverage this expanded capacity efficiently while still handling workflows that extend beyond any fixed limit. Use cases include:</p><ul><li><strong>Coding:</strong> Context editing clears old file reads and test results while memory preserves debugging insights and architectural decisions, enabling agents to work on large codebases without losing progress.</li><li><strong>Research: </strong>Memory stores key findings while context editing removes old search results, building knowledge bases that improve performance over time.</li><li><strong>Data processing: </strong>Agents store intermediate results in memory while context editing clears raw data, handling workflows that would otherwise exceed token limits.</li></ul><h2 id="performance-improvements-with-context-management">Performance improvements with context management</h2><p>On an internal evaluation set for agentic search, we tested how context management improves agent performance on complex, multi-step tasks. The results demonstrate significant gains: combining the memory tool with context editing improved performance by 39% over baseline. Context editing alone delivered a 29% improvement.</p><p>In a 100-turn web search evaluation, context editing enabled agents to complete workflows that would otherwise fail due to context exhaustion—while reducing token consumption by 84%.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2><p>These capabilities are available today in public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, natively and in Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud’s Vertex AI.

<p>Public awareness of legal sports betting has grown in recent years – and so has the perception that it is a bad thing for society and sports, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.</p>

<p>Today, 43% of U.S. adults say the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the country is a <strong>bad thing for society. </strong>That’s up from <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/14/as-more-states-legalize-the-practice-19-of-u-s-adults-say-they-have-bet-money-on-sports-in-the-past-year/">34% in 2022</a>. And 40% of adults now say it’s a <strong>bad thing for sports,</strong> up from 33%.</p>



<p>Despite these increasingly critical views of legal sports betting, many Americans continue to say it has neither a bad nor good impact on society and on sports. Fewer than one-in-five see positive impacts.</p>



<details><summary>About this research</summary>
<p>This Pew Research Center analysis examines recent changes in Americans’ awareness of, attitudes about and personal experiences with sports betting. It comes as more states <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">legalize the practice</a>.</p>



<h4 id="2c86970a0dfb1a0fb6143626d475626a">Why did we do this?</h4>



<p>The Center conducts high-quality research to inform the public, journalists and decision-makers. Studying the public’s views of and experiences with sports betting is part of our long-standing research on social trends, technology and related topics.</p>

<h4 id="61af5ad1ffc78809f7ec505aec15ab69">How did we do this?</h4>



<p>This analysis is based on findings from a survey of 9,916 U.S. adults who are part of the Center’s American Trends Panel. The survey was conducted from July 8 to Aug. 3, 2025. The survey’s overall margin of error is plus or minus 1.3 percentage points.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the share of Americans who have bet money on sports in the past year has not changed much since 2022.</p>



<p>Today, 22% of adults say they’ve<strong> personally bet money on sports in the past year.</strong> That’s a slight uptick from 19% three years ago. This figure includes betting in any of three ways:</p>



<ul>
<li>With friends or family, such as in a private betting pool, fantasy league or casual bet</li>



<li>Online with a betting app, sportsbook or casino</li>



<li>In person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk</li>
</ul>

<p>All of this increase has come through <strong>online sports betting:</strong> 10% of adults now say they’ve placed a bet this way in the past year, up from 6% in 2022. There has been no change in the shares of adults who have bet on sports with family or friends or in person at a casino, racetrack or betting kiosk.</p>



<p>Commercial sports betting has spread rapidly across the United States since a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">Supreme Court ruling in 2018</a> gave states the green light to legalize it. At least 38 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico now allow commercial sports betting in some form, <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/events/details/sports-betting-on-the-rise-as-states-let-gamblers-wager-online">according to the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>.</p>



<p>In our new survey, 63% of adults say they’ve heard or read a lot or a little about the fact that sports betting is now legal in much of the U.S. That’s up from 56% in 2022. The increase in public awareness comes as betting-related advertisements <a href="https://www.espn.com/espn/betting/story/_/id/44716101/sports-betting-ads-tv-versus-alcohol-study-fantasy-spending-volume">have become common during sports broadcasts</a>.</p>



<p>The rest of this analysis takes a closer look at Americans’ views of and experiences with sports betting. It’s based on the survey of 9,916 U.S. adults, conducted in July and August.</p>

<p>Since 2022, Americans in many demographic groups have become more likely to view the widespread legalization of sports betting as a bad thing for society, as well as for sports.</p>



<p>This is true for men and women; college graduates and non-college graduates; and upper-, middle- and lower-income Americans alike. It is also the case among Democrats and Republicans, as well as among those who have personally placed a sports bet in the past year and those who have not.</p>



<p>Some of the biggest shifts in attitudes about sports betting’s societal impact have come among young Americans – especially young men. <strong>Today, 47% of men under 30 say legal sports betting is a bad thing for society, up from 22% who said this in 2022.</strong> Women under 30 have also become more likely to express this view: 35% see legal sports betting as bad for society, up from 25% three years ago.</p>



<p>The legalization of sports betting has <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/state/sports-betting-tax-revenue/">generated revenue for state governments and gambling operators</a>, but it has also raised concerns about <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Sports-gambling_NCPGLitRvwExecSummary.pdf">gambling addiction</a> and other societal harms. Critics have also cautioned that it may <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2025/08/bad-bets-the-new-culture-of-sports-gambling/">compromise the integrity of sports</a>. In recent years, several professional and college athletes and team personnel have been punished for violating betting rules.</p>



<details><summary>Recent betting violations in professional sports</summary>
<p>The largest professional sports leagues in North America – including the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Hockey League (NHL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) – ban players, and often coaches and other personnel, from betting on their own sports. In some cases, there are also rules about betting on <em>other</em> sports. Punishments for violating the rules range from fines or suspensions to lifetime bans.</p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/us/politics/supreme-court-sports-betting-new-jersey.html">U.S. Supreme Court’s 2018 decision to allow sports betting</a>, at least 20 professional athletes in these five leagues – as well as one NFL coach and one MLB umpire – have faced disciplinary action for violating their leagues’ gambling policies. All but four of these disciplinary actions took place in 2023 and 2024, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of league announcements and media reports.</p>



<p>More than half of the athletes who have faced disciplinary action (11 of 20) were from the NFL. The rest involved players from MLB (five), MLS (two), the NBA (one) and the NHL (one).</p>



<p>In most cases, players received suspensions, ranging from several games to indefinite. However, in 2024, an <a href="https://abc7news.com/post/tucupita-marcano-gets-lifetime-mlb-ban-betting-baseball/14909938/">MLB player</a> and an <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jontay-porter-banned-from-nba">NBA player</a> each received permanent bans for betting on their own teams’ games.</p>

<p>As was the case in 2022, some groups of Americans are more likely than others to say they’ve personally bet money on sports in the past year in any of the ways we asked about.</p>



<p><strong>Young adults are more likely than older Americans to say they’ve placed a sports bet in the past year.</strong> Some 31% of adults under 30 say this, including 36% of men and 29% of women in this age group. Sports betting is less common in all older age groups.</p>



<p><strong>Black and Hispanic adults are also especially likely to have bet money on sports in the past year:</strong> 30% and 27%, respectively, say they have done so. Roughly two-in-ten Asian (22%) and White (19%) adults say the same.</p>



<p>There are no differences between college graduates and non-college graduates on this question. In each group, 22% say they have bet on sports in the past year. Nor are there major partisan differences: 24% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they have done so, as have 22% of Republicans and Republican leaners.</p>



<h4 id="who-has-placed-an-online-sports-bet-in-the-past-year">Who has placed an online sports bet in the past year?</h4>



<p>When it comes to <em>online </em>sports betting, young adults and Black Americans again stand out.</p>



<p>Overall, 17% of adults under 30 – including 21% of men and 16% of women in this age group – say they’ve placed an online sports wager in the past year. Three years ago, 7% of those under 30 had done so – including 9% of men and 6% of women.</p>



<p>Among Black adults, 19% say they’ve placed an online sports bet in the past year, up from 10% in 2022. Smaller shares of Hispanic (12%), Asian (11%) and White (8%) adults say they’ve done this in the past year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="readme">
			
				<h2 id="user-content-testing-1password" dir="auto">Testing 1Password</h2>
<p dir="auto">In October of 2023, I reported a vulnerability to 1Password regarding their <code>op</code> (a.k.a. <code>1password-cli</code>) program. In my report I detailed that their approach to prompting users only once, and then leaving the vault open to the CLI was easily exploited in supply-chain scenarios, especially when a threat actor targets developer toolchains. There are two attack paths I highlighted, and I supplied them with a proof for one of them.</p>

<p dir="auto">This demo was tested across the three most recent versions of macOS, using <code>zsh</code> and <code>bash</code> shells using the latest 1Password desktop client.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-two-attack-paths" dir="auto">Two Attack Paths</h2>
<p dir="auto">Both attacks would be a supply-chain attack, but there are two distinct paths:</p>
<h3 id="user-content-ide-path" dir="auto">IDE Path</h3>
<p dir="auto">The IDE path is pretty straight-forward, and I think carries the greatest risk:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>I install the 1Password extension because I responsibly wish to keep my tokens in a safe place (e.g. not my <code>$ENV</code>)</li>
<li>I also use the MySQL extension in my IDE, it's nice to be able to stay in the same tool</li>
<li>I use the 1Password extension to resolve secret references, which requires me to unlock my vault</li>
<li>I installed a new red theme, red is my favorite color</li>
<li>That red theme is an extension, and contained malicious code which uses the <code>op</code> NPM module to enumerate and exfiltrate <em>every</em> vault that I have access to</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-package-manager-path" dir="auto">Package manager path</h3>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>I install the 1Password CLI, and I use <code>op</code> to protect secrets in my environment</li>
<li>I use GitHub Packages for NPM packages which are private to my organization</li>
<li>I hear of a really nifty plugin which will allow me to add syntax highlighting to shell output on this CLI project I'm working on, so I <code>npm i syntax-highlighting-stuff</code></li>
<li>Oh no! <code>syntax-highlighting-stuff</code> had a <code>post-install</code> script on it, and it enumerated and exfiltrated the secrets from <em>every</em> vault I have access to</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-observed-patterns" dir="auto">Observed patterns</h3>
<p dir="auto">It seems like the vulnerability is that once you unlock your vault, anything spawned from the parent process of whatever opened the vault retains an active session to that open vault.</p>
<pre><code>$ op run -- ls <span># This prompts me to unlock my vault</span>
$ op run -- ls <span># The second call does not prompt me, the vault is already open</span>
$ op <span>read</span> <span>'op://Foo/Bar/baz'</span> <span># Still doesn't prompt me again because the vault is still open</span>
</code></pre><p dir="auto">This also works with subprocesses:</p>
<pre><code>$ <span>export</span> <span>GITHUB_TOKEN</span><span>=</span><span>'op://Foo/Bar/baz'</span>
$ op run -- env <span>|</span> grep GITHUB_TOKEN <span># This will prompt me</span>
$ bash <span># Start a new shell subprocess</span>
$ op run -- env <span>|</span> grep GITHUB_TOKEN <span># This will not prompt me</span>
$ bash <span># Now we're two shells deep in subprocesses</span>
$ op run -- env <span>|</span> grep GITHUB_TOKEN <span># This will still not prompt me</span>
</code></pre><h2 id="user-content-the-proof" dir="auto">The Proof</h2>
<p dir="auto">This repository contains the code from the proof that I submitted to 1Password on 2nd October, 2023. Here are the instructions for running the proof:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The <code>index.cjs</code> has a module which runs the <code>naughty</code> module.</li>
<li>Either using netcat or <a href="https://codeberg.org/manchicken/simple-exfil-service.git" rel="nofollow"><code>simple-exfil-service</code></a>, listen on port <code>4242</code></li>
<li>To run this test, simply run <code>op run npm install</code> like you needed a GitHub token</li>
<li>Afterward, check your output from port 4242, but also check to see if there is a <code>/tmp/naughty</code> file</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's what the person running <code>npm i</code> would see:</p>
<pre><code>❯ op run -- npm i

&gt; 1password-cli-risks@1.0.0 postinstall
&gt; node ./index.cjs

</code></pre><p dir="auto">Notice that the <code>value</code> for the <code>password</code> is in plaintext in both cases.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-the-risk" dir="auto">The Risk</h2>
<p dir="auto">The 1Password CLI is marketed as a tool which makes technical practitioners safer by protecting credentials that are traditionally stored in plaintext in a user's environment variables on their local machine. This vulnerability demonstrates that while this does get the secrets out of your environment, it also <em>drastically</em> expands the potential blast radius for a successful malware or supply-chain attack.</p>
<p dir="auto">To put it simply: the risk here is not that your GitHub secret will be leaked via an environment variable, the risk is that <em>every vault you have access to</em> could be dumped by a threat actor.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, as agentic AI tools become more commonplace, that may add additional risk factors which have yet to be considered in the research I'm presenting here.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>op</code> tool doesn't just possess the ability to get individual items, it also has the ability to enumerate your vaults (<code>op vault list</code>) and to enumerate items in a given vault (<code>op item list --vault abc123</code>). <a href="https://github.com/1Password/op-js?tab=readme-ov-file#available-commands-and-functions" rel="nofollow">The JavaScript module supports all of the same commands</a> that the <code>op</code> CLI tool does, too.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-attempts-to-mitigate" dir="auto">Attempts to Mitigate</h2>
<p dir="auto">I have explored a number of paths to mitigate this.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Following the suggestion of a colleague, I experimented with using a separate vault for CLI secrets
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This doesn't work because you cannot limit the default vault from being read by the CLI</li>
<li>Not only that, but you can't set limits for things like shared vaults</li>
<li>As weird as it sounds, when you unlock one vault, you unlock all vaults which are accessible to the CLI tool</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1Password recommended using service accounts to mitigate this, and I did try it, but I found some challenges as I started thinking of how to roll it out to teams
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This kinda sucks because that means each developer gets a separate service account user on their workstation</li>
<li>This also means that the developer has to manage a service account</li>
<li>In addition to being unweildy, this also means that each engineer must be diligent to <em>not</em> enable the shiny "Integrate with 1Password CLI" button in the Developer tab on the GUI settings</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-recommendations" dir="auto">Recommendations</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I recommend that folks avoid using <code>op</code> on developer workstations until 1Password has released a fix for these scenarios
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The best way to do this appears to be to make sure CLI integration checkbox is <em>unchecked</em> in the Developer settings screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I recommend that when you <em>must</em> use <code>op</code>, that it be limited to service accounts, per 1Password's recommendation, and that you carefully verify that the "Integrate with 1Password CLI" box is unchecked in the GUI settings</li>
<li>I recomment that, where possible, you get in the habit of always passing <code>--ignore-scripts</code> to <code>npm</code> commands, and find a similar pattern for any other package manager that you use in conjunction with <code>op</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I strongly recommend that 1Password modify their product to resolve this problem. Just spitballing, I think any of the following would be sufficient (this is an OR, not an AND):</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Allow users to limit access to vaults using CLI integrations</li>
<li>Allow users to designate individual items in their Vaults for use with the CLI</li>
<li>Prompt for specific vaults or items individually</li>
<li>Prompt for each process individually, closing the gap for subprocesses</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-conclusion" dir="auto">Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="auto">This investigation took a while, and I waited a while before publishing this disclosure (life circumstances and giving 1Password time to fix the issue). While 1Password is within their right not to issue a CVE or a fix for this vulnerability, I do think 1Password users (I am proud to be one) would be much safer if this issue were eliminated.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks, please contact me with any corrections or feedback.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Most of the heavy lifting features are provided by / built into sqlc, I do not aim to take credit for them.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">☑️ Supports SQlite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.<br>
☑️ Multiple queries per file.<br>
☑️ Database client agnostic.<br>
☑️ Utility wrappers for popular gleam database libraries (<a href="https://github.com/lpil/sqlight">lpil/sqlight</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lpil/pog">lpil/pog</a>).<br>
☑️ Automatically pulls the schema of your database.<br>
☑️ Automatically downloads <a href="https://sqlc.dev/" rel="nofollow">sqlc</a> binary.<br>
☑️ Named parameters.<sup>*1</sup> <br></p>
<p dir="auto"><sup>*1</sup>: Meaning that it infers the names of the parameters from your sql queries in the gleam function you call. for example for a query called <code>FindUser</code>, defined as <code>SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = $1</code>, parrot will produce a function where the arguments match those column names: <code>pub fn find_user(username: String) { ... }</code>. If you have multiple parameters of the same data types this can avoid confusion and bugs.</p>

<p dir="auto">As with everything in software, there are some quirks with this library, due to
the nature of your database of choice and sqlc.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multidimensional Arrays</h3><a id="user-content-multidimensional-arrays" aria-label="Permalink: Multidimensional Arrays" href="#multidimensional-arrays"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you have an <code>INTEGER[][]</code> column in Postgres, <code>pg_dump</code> does not correctly identify
the column as a two-dimensional array and therefore only gives you a <code>List(Int)</code> instead
of a <code>List(List(Int))</code>. If this is a problem for you, you can raise an issue and
we might come up with a solution or workaround.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dynamic Data Types</h3><a id="user-content-dynamic-data-types" aria-label="Permalink: Dynamic Data Types" href="#dynamic-data-types"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple of complex data types that are explictly made <code>dynamic</code>
since they are too complex to handle with the current implementation.
There is a plan for a better and more flexible implementation. Until then,
it will be wrapped in a dynamic type.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Targetting JavaScript</h3><a id="user-content-targetting-javascript" aria-label="Permalink: Targetting JavaScript" href="#targetting-javascript"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">So here is the catch: you can only execute parrot in an erlang gleam application.
However the generated code will also run in a javascript environment.
So if you need parrot for a javascript project, you can create a separate package and
copy over the generated module and that will work.</p>

<h2>2025.10.04: NSA and IETF: <span>Can an attacker simply purchase standardization of weakened cryptography? #pqcrypto #hybrids #nsa #ietf #antitrust</span></h2>
<p>It's normal for post-quantum cryptography
to be rolled out as an <em>extra</em> layer of security on top of traditional pre-quantum cryptography,
rather than as a <em>replacement</em>.</p>
<p>For example,
Google's <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">CECPQ1</a> experiment
was double encryption with
traditional pre-quantum ECC
(specifically
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#safecurves">X25519</a>)
and post-quantum NewHope1024.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2</a>,
a joint experiment between Google and Cloudflare,
was ECC+NTRUHRSS701.
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">CECPQ2b</a>
was ECC+SIKEp434.
<a href="https://ssh-comparison.quendi.de/comparison/kex.html">Ten SSH implementations</a>
support ECC+sntrup761.
Today's usage of post-quantum cryptography by browsers is
<a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#post-quantum-encryption-adoption">approaching half</a>
of the connections seen by Cloudflare,
where
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95% of that</a>
is ECC+MLKEM768
and 5% is ECC+Kyber768.</p>
<p>If post-quantum cryptography is designed to be super-strong,
so strong that it even survives future quantum computers,
then why are we keeping the ECC layer?
Same reason that you wear your seatbelt:
in the real world, cars sometimes crash, and seatbelts reduce the damage.</p>
<p>Google already explained this back in
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">2016</a>:
"The post-quantum algorithm might turn out to be breakable even with today's computers,
in which case the elliptic-curve algorithm will still provide the best security that today's technology can offer."
We've seen
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many breaks of post-quantum proposals</a>
since then,
including the sudden
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/975">public</a>
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1026">collapse</a>
of SIKE
three years after CECPQ2b applied SIKE to
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment/">tens of millions</a> of user connections.
The <em>only</em> reason that this user data wasn't immediately exposed to attackers
is that CECPQ2b encrypted data with SIKE <em>and</em> with ECC,
rather than switching from ECC to just SIKE.
As another example,
the reference Kyber/ML-KEM software went through two rounds of security patches for
<a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a> at the end of 2023,
and then had
<a href="https://pqshield.com/pqshield-plugs-timing-leaks-in-kyber-ml-kem-to-improve-pqc-implementation-maturity/">another security patch</a>
in mid-2024.</p>
<p>Deploying ECC+PQ rather than just PQ is an easy common-sense win.
ECC software is practically everywhere anyway,
and nobody has identified an application that can afford PQ without being able to afford ECC+PQ.</p>
<p>Typically people talk about deploying ECC+PQ as deploying "hybrids" rather than "non-hybrids",
although you have to be careful with this terminology
since the word "hybrid" also has other meanings in cryptography.
It's more descriptive to talk about
"double encryption" and "double signatures"
rather than
"single encryption" and "single signatures".</p>
<p><strong><a name="problem">The problem in a nutshell.</a></strong>
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html#nsa">Surveillance agency</a>
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUSKBN25T3CK/">NSA</a>
and its
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/aug/01/nsa-paid-gchq-spying-edward-snowden">partner</a>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/may/25/gchqs-mass-data-sharing-violated-right-to-privacy-court-rules">GCHQ</a>
are trying to have standards-development organizations
endorse weakening ECC+PQ down to just PQ.</p>
<p>Part of this is that
NSA and GCHQ have been endlessly repeating arguments that this weakening is a <em>good</em> thing
(in much the same way that NSA advertised
<a href="https://projectbullrun.org/dual-ec/index.html">Dual EC</a>
as providing
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250902084755/https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/events/random-number-generation-workshop-2004/documents/numbertheoreticdrbg.pdf">"increased assurance"</a>).
I have a previous blog post showing that
those arguments <a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20240102-hybrid.html">collapse upon examination</a>.
But that's not today's topic.
In today's blog post I'm instead looking at
how easy it is for NSA to simply spend money to corrupt the standardization process.</p>
<p><strong><a name="tls">Two TLS encryption drafts.</a></strong>
For concreteness,
I'll focus on what's happening in a particular standards-development organization
called the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
Within that,
I'll focus on current proposals within an IETF "working group" (WG)
that sets standards for Transport Layer Security (TLS),
the security layer inside HTTPS and inside various other protocols.
I'll look specifically at how the TLS WG handled
two drafts specifying post-quantum encryption mechanisms for TLS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hybrid (double encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250710085814/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-kwiatkowski-tls-ecdhe-mlkem-03.html">"Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies ECC+PQ in TLS,
  specifically usage in TLS of "X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768, and SecP384r1MLKEM1024".
  The first of those is also what I mentioned above as
  <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/pqc-forum/c/vtMTuE_3u-0/m/k6JisLwXAQAJ">95%</a>
  of current post-quantum connections to Cloudflare.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-hybrid (single encryption):
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250718131345/https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-connolly-tls-mlkem-key-agreement-05.html">"ML-KEM Post-Quantum Key Agreement for TLS 1.3"</a>.
  This draft specifies usage in TLS of "ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024" without seatbelts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The non-hybrid draft was first posted in March 2024.
Of course someone asked "what the motivation is for being 'fully post-quantum' rather than hybrid".
The draft author
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/qFRxBSnEPJcdlt7MO0cIL2kW5qc/">responded</a>:
"FIPS / CNSA 2.0 compliance guidelines ...
currently are a big 'maybe' at best for 'hybrid solutions', and the
timetables for compliant browsers, servers, and services are to exclusively
use FIPS 203 at level V (ML-KEM-1024) by 2033. I figure there will be
demand for pure ML-KEM key agreement, not hybrid (with no questions that
come along with it of whether it's actually allowed or not)."</p>
<p>As context,
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_budget_of_the_United_States">massive U.S. military budget</a>
now publicly requires cryptographic "components" to have
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221022163808/https://www.jcs.mil/Portals/36/Documents/Library/Instructions/CJCSI%206510.02F.pdf?ver=qUEnOsWpGPcGGMFTb4yYVA%3D%3D">NSA approval</a>.
"CNSA 2.0" refers to a public NSA document
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240927153634/https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071834/-1/-1/0/CSA_CNSA_2.0_ALGORITHMS_.PDF">"Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite 2.0"</a>.
The document says up front that its requirements apply to
"all NSS use of public cryptographic algorithms (as opposed to algorithms NSA developed),
including those on all unclassified and classified NSS".
The <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/us/title-40/subtitle-iii/chapter-111/sec-11103/">legal definition</a>
of "national security system" (NSS)
covers practically all military information systems,
except for "routine administrative and business applications" such as "payroll".</p>
<p>In June 2024,
NSA's William Layton
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/ESCdYNwVeF4VkvoORFJLJk_87VU/">wrote</a>
that "we do not anticipate supporting hybrid in NSS".</p>
<p>In December 2024, a Cisco employee
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/S9Mwv28VEHrG189ZtoubUani7J8/">wrote</a>
the following:
"There are people whose
cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt who say that pure ML-KEM is the
right trade-off for them, and more importantly for my employer, that's
what they're willing to buy.  Hence, Cisco will implement it; I am
essentially just asking for code points."
Certainly "willing to buy" is a statement about funding,
evidently from a source large enough to dictate Cisco actions,
evidently from a source asking for non-hybrids,
evidently from "people whose cryptographic expertise I cannot doubt";
if that source isn't NSA, who is it?</p>
<p>(Side note: If you think the word "pure" in "pure ML-KEM" sounds good,
remember that replacing CECPQ2's ECC+SIKE with "pure SIKE" would have been a disaster.)</p>
<p>In June 2025,
NSA's Mike Jenkins
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/spasm/xUKIoHQwm1BjNZWS2x3xb-BhsLI/">posted</a>
the following:
"As the CNSA 2.0 profiles should make clear, we are looking for products that support /standalone/ ML-DSA-87 and /standalone/ ML-KEM-1024. If there is one vendor
that produces one product that complies, then that is the product that goes on the compliance list and is approved for use. Our interactions with vendors suggests
that this won't be a problem in most cases."
Evidently there are many companies happy to jump when NSA says jump.</p>
<p><strong><a name="dogfood">Pretending to eat your own dog food.</a></strong>
For software engineers,
"dogfooding"
(a term
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120406142929/http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/317315/vmworld_2009_virtualization_controversy_eating_your_own_dog_food/?fp=39&amp;fpid=25874&amp;rid=1">perhaps</a>
coined by Paul Maritz in the 1980s)
refers to making regular use of the software that you're writing.
This builds your confidence that the software works,
and helps iron out problems.</p>
<p>But there's also a marketing version of the same concept,
where you publicly <em>say</em> that you're using your own software
as a way to build <em>other people's</em> confidence in the software.
As in other types of marketing,
what you're saying doesn't have to be true.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, NSA
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">weakened</a>
the Data Encryption Standard to just 56 bits.
In public,
NSA <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220805195031/https://cryptome.org/nsa-inman-1979.pdf">claimed</a>
that it hadn't tampered with the standard,
and that the
"implausibility of public allegations is further demonstrated by the fact that
NSA has endorsed the use of DES for the encryption of national security-related information,
including selected classified information".</p>
<p>This is powerful marketing.
Many people hearing this last quote will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is using DES, so DES is strong".
Koblitz and Menezes
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151122060827/https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1018.pdf">claimed</a>
that it's "far-fetched"
that NSA would have intentionally selected something weak
"for U.S. government usage (for both unclassified and classified communications [41])".
Many people today will think
"Oh, okay, NSA is buying single encryption, so double encryption is unimportant".</p>
<p>But DES <a href="https://ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/publications/27.pdf">wasn't</a> strong.
NSA had engineered DES to be
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"weak enough"</a>
for NSA to break.
NSA wanted DES to
<a href="https://archive.org/details/cold_war_iii-nsa/cold_war_iii-ISCAP/page/n239/mode/2up">"drive out competitors"</a>,
to "reduce the field that NSA had to be concerned about".</p>
<p>It's perfectly plausible that NSA was using DES,
but surely NSA was then using DES multiple times (Triple-DES or beyond),
which makes it much harder to break
(as long as you <a href="https://sweet32.info/">switch keys frequently</a>).
Obviously NSA wouldn't have said "use multiple layers" publicly:
NSA wanted to fool people into thinking that DES was secure.</p>
<p>Today we have better ciphers than DES.
However, for data that it cares about,
NSA still uses two independent encryption layers
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524232250/https://www.nsa.gov/Portals/75/documents/resources/everyone/csfc/threat-prevention.pdf">"to mitigate the ability of an adversary to exploit a single cryptographic implementation"</a>.
Gee, maybe multiple encryption is important after all!</p>
<p>Try to put yourself in
<a href="https://blog.cr.yp.to/20250930-stealth.html">the mindset of NSA as an attacker</a>.
You have a
<a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2014/04/09/20130905-guard-sigint_enabling.pdf">massive budget</a>
to "covertly influence and/or overtly leverage" systems
to "make the systems in question exploitable";
"to the consumer and other adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact".
One of your action items is to "influence policies, standards and specification
for commercial public key technologies".
Another is to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace
to make it more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed by NSA/CSS".</p>
<p>You spend this money pursuing many different attack paths,
taking whatever surveillance wins you can get.
It's not that <em>everybody</em> was using Dual EC,
for example,
but you managed to manipulate <em>some</em> people into using it,
and for you that's a win.</p>
<p>Weakening ECC+PQ to just PQ,
normalizing the practice of driving without seatbelts,
is another win for you as the attacker.
It's adding further vulnerabilities to the cryptographic ecosystem.
The point is that,
beyond SIKE and <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#qrcsp">many other</a> publicly broken cryptosystems,
there will be some further cases where
your "advanced cryptanalytic capabilities" break the PQ part
while the "consumer and other adversaries" think the PQ part is secure.</p>
<p>What do you do with your control over the U.S. military budget?
That's another opportunity to "shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace".
You can tell people that you won't authorize purchasing double encryption.
You can even follow through on having the military publicly purchase single encryption.
Meanwhile you quietly spend a negligible amount of money on an independent encryption layer
to protect the data that you care about,
so you're actually using double encryption.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callgood">Adoption of double encryption in TLS.</a></strong>
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7221">"Adoption"</a>
in IETF is a preliminary step before standardization:
when a WG is
"ready to develop a particular document, the most common mechanism is
for it to 'adopt' an existing document as a starting point".</p>
<p>In March 2025,
after the close of a two-week "WG adoption call",
the TLS WG chairs declared
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250419105450/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iGLZeIYzsIZPYO1ezA2Eulv5x98/">"consensus to adopt"</a>
the "Post-quantum hybrid ECDHE-MLKEM Key Agreement for TLSv1.3" draft.</p>
<p>There were no objections to the declaration of consensus on adopting this draft.
I had pointed out that the patents on Kyber/ML-KEM create two issues related to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250405080704/https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8179/">IETF's patent policy</a>,
but I said that the first issue can be fixed after adoption (before standardization),
and I now think that this is also true for the second issue.
The risks from patents are orthogonal to the risks from non-hybrids,
and I won't say more about patents in this blog post.</p>
<p><strong><a name="options">Why worry about a weaker standard if there's a stronger standard?</a></strong>
At this point you might be wondering:
if people are driving with seatbelts and this is on its way to being standardized,
what's the problem with <em>also</em> having a driving-without-seatbelts standard
for reckless fools who want to use that?</p>
<p>Think about Dual EC.
Dual EC wasn't the only randomness-generation standard.
But companies paid for FIPS certification of at least
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130224022123/http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/drbg/drbgval.html">62 different implementations</a>
of Dual EC.
NSA
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220">bribed</a>
the RSA company to change its popular cryptographic library
to use Dual EC by default.</p>
<p>These companies saw that Dual EC was a standard from a reputable standards organization
(in fact, from three such organizations, namely ANSI, ISO, and NIST).
Even for companies realizing that Dual EC was a controversial standard pushed by NSA,
how many companies would risk losing money by refusing to implement Dual EC?
It's <em>easy</em> for purchasing managers to use standards to set purchasing requirements.</p>
<p>What's particularly pernicious about a driving-without-seatbelts standard
is that a purchasing manager who looks at it has an incentive to pick it
instead of the driving-with-seatbelts standard.
Wow, I can save $50 for every seatbelt that I skip!
Wow, I can save <a href="https://cr.yp.to/papers.html#pppqefs">50 picodollars</a> for every ECC operation that I skip!
The purchasing manager doesn't care whether this cost reduction matters in context:
every penny saved sounds good, right?
The purchasing manager also doesn't realize the standard is <em>dangerous</em>:
on the contrary, why would it be a standard if it were unsafe?</p>
<p>Soon we're faced with widespread non-usage of seatbelts.
And then, years too late,
we realize that, oops, something people used and thought was secure actually wasn't,
just as in the case of SIKE.</p>
<p><strong><a name="callbad">Adoption of single encryption in TLS.</a></strong>

the non-hybrid draft mentioned above.</p>
<p>Here are some quotes (some from me, some from other people)
illustrating objections raised on the TLS mailing list during the call period:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft creates security risks</strong>.
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">Sample quote</a>:
  "SIKE was applied to large volumes of user data as part of the CECPQ2
  experiment in 2019. SIKE was publicly broken in 2022.
  [paragraph break]
  The <em>only</em> reason that this didn't immediately give away the user data
  to attackers is that CECPQ2 was ECC+SIKE, rather than just SIKE.
  [paragraph break]
  Should we keep rolling out post-quantum cryptosystems to <em>try</em> to stop
  future quantum attacks? Yes, of course. But, just in case this goes
  horribly wrong <em>again</em>, let's make sure to keep ECC in place. Any draft
  violating this should be rejected as a security risk not just by WGs but
  also by the ISE."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates BCP 188.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "To the extent that this is an allusion to
  NSA purchasing, it violates BCP 188 ('IETF Will Work to Mitigate
  Pervasive Monitoring')."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft violates the WG charter.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/xJqwB30b5wf3GVlAiIP3O4tuBIE/">Sample quote</a>:
  "the draft's regression from ECC+PQ to just PQ
  is certainly a technology issue; and this is fatal, as a contravention
  of the 'improve security' goal in the WG charter".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There are no principles supporting the adoption decision.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Sample quote</a>:
  "I don't see what criteria we might use in adopting this that
  wouldn't leave the WG open to accusations of favouritism if
  we don't adopt other pure PQ national standards that will
  certainly arise".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft's motivation section is circular.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YNSu6ZO5e0JMJ1cRlnxh6oIjyZg/">Sample quote</a>:
  there is
  "a preliminary step that
  has been skipped here, namely identifying why the proposal is claimed to
  be adding something important. The draft's motivation sentence consists
  of rearranging buzzwords without answering the question:
  'Having a fully post-quantum (not hybrid) key agreement option for TLS
  1.3 is necessary for migrating beyond hybrids and for users that need
  to be fully post-quantum.'&nbsp;"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The draft increases software complexity.</strong>
  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Sample quote</a>:
  "The main stated benefit of using a standalone ML-KEM is complexity
  reduction, but with the current progress in the deployment of the ML-KEM +
  ECC hybrid method, a standalone ML-KEM method actually increases overall
  complexity in software stacks."
  (This was responding to a claim during the adoption-call period
  that the draft provided a "compute / dependency base that is minimalist".)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a high-level survey of the objections.
These quotes aren't intended to convey the full text of objections.
They also aren't intended to convey the number of people objecting;
I'll get back to that below.</p>
<p><strong><a name="standards">Standardization procedures.</a></strong>
How does a standards-development organization handle objections?
The law on this topic in the United States has been settled for decades.</p>
<p>The starting point is that
agreements in restraint of interstate commerce are
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap1-sec1.htm">illegal</a>.
Courts interpret this to cover various types of agreements
that are illegal <em>per se</em>,
such as price fixing and group boycotts,
along with further agreements that unreasonably interfere with competition.</p>
<p>Here's an
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/456/556/">example</a>
from the 1980s.
Agents of a company that was leading its market, McDonnell and Miller,
took control of a subcommittee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers,
a standards-development organization.
They generated a letter, under ASME's apparent authority,
declaring that a new competitor's product wasn't compliant.
They distributed that letter to buyers, of course damaging the new competitor's business.</p>
<p>The competitor, HydroLevel, sued the conspirators—including ASME,
which didn't even <em>know</em> the abuse was happening.
HydroLevel won. ASME was ultimately forced to pay millions of dollars.
The Supreme Court didn't mince words in describing the anti-competitive
power of standards-development organizations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ASME wields great power in the Nation's economy. Its codes and
standards influence the policies of numerous States and cities, and,
as has been said about "so-called voluntary standards" generally,
its interpretations of its guidelines "may result in economic
prosperity or economic failure, for a number of businesses of all
sizes throughout the country," as well as entire segments of an
industry. ... ASME can be said to be "in reality, an
extragovernmental agency which prescribes rules for the regulation
and restraint of interstate commerce." ... When it cloaks its
subcommittee officials with the authority of its reputation, ASME
permits those agents to affect the destinies of businesses, and thus
gives them the power to frustrate competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>... Many of ASME's officials are associated with members of the
industries regulated by ASME's codes. Although undoubtedly most
serve ASME without concern for the interests of their corporate
employers, some may well view their positions with ASME, at least in
part, as an opportunity to benefit their employers. When the great
influence of ASME's reputation is placed at their disposal, the less
altruistic of ASME's agents have an opportunity to harm their
employers' competitors through manipulation of ASME's codes.</p>
<p>... Only ASME can take systematic steps to make improper conduct on
the part of all its agents unlikely, and the possibility of civil
liability will inevitably be a powerful incentive for ASME to take
those steps. Thus, a rule that imposes liability on the
standard-setting organization -- which is best situated to prevent
antitrust violations through the abuse of its reputation -- is most
faithful to the congressional intent that the private right of
action deter antitrust violations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another
<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/486/492/">Supreme Court case</a>
rejected an argument of
antitrust immunity for another standards-development organization.
The organization made various decisions by majority vote,
and had allowed
steel manufacturers to pack a standards-development group,
filling the group with pro-steel agents to take over a vote.
The Supreme Court
again recognized the importance of procedural safeguards preventing abuse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The antitrust validity of these efforts is not established, without
more, by petitioner's literal compliance with the rules of the
Association, for the hope of procompetitive benefits depends upon
the existence of safeguards sufficient to prevent the
standard-setting process from being biased by members with economic
interests in restraining competition. An association cannot validate
the anticompetitive activities of its members simply by adopting
rules that fail to provide such safeguards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court declined at that point to draw a dividing line saying
which safeguards were required.
In 2004, Congress passed a
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4302.htm">law</a>
pinning this down:
the new law said that "standards development activity" by a "standards development organization"
isn't illegal <em>per se</em>,
and gave
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2024-title15/html/USCODE-2024-title15-chap69-sec4301.htm">definitions</a>
of the quoted phrases.</p>
<p>In particular, a "standards development organization" is required by law to
"incorporate the attributes of openness, balance of interests, due process, an appeals process, and consensus in a manner consistent
with the Office of Management and Budget Circular Number A-119, as revised February 10, 1998".</p>
<p>That
<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1998-02-19/html/98-4177.htm">OMB rule</a>,
in turn,
defines "consensus" as follows:
"general
agreement, but not necessarily unanimity, and includes a process for
attempting to resolve objections by interested parties, as long as all
comments have been fairly considered, each objector is advised of the
disposition of his or her objection(s) and the reasons why, and the
consensus body members are given an opportunity to change their votes
after reviewing the comments".</p>
<p>The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
inserted itself into a private court case in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207015058/https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/1178246/dl">2019</a>
to say that "the United States has a significant
interest in the correct interpretation of the exemption from <em>per se</em>
treatment for standards development organizations engaging in standard setting activities".</p>
<p>Deputy Assistant Attorney General Alexander Okuliar in the same division
presented a longer statement to ANSI in
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617062615/https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/speech/file/1281926/dl">2020</a>
regarding antitrust and standards.
The statement mentioned ANSI's compliance with the same requirements and said
"From an antitrust perspective, these requirements are central".</p>
<p>Here's a random
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250915073928/https://www.electropedia.org/iev/iev.nsf/2907043f18b6c837c1256f2b00710424/0b9474d4e73bb310c12585fa0058b1ce/$FILE/C00067%20evaluation%20observations-final.pdf">example</a>
of what an objection-response document looks like in ISO, IEC, etc.
Not the best user interface, but it gets the job done.</p>
<p><strong><a name="agreement">There was not general agreement to adopt the non-hybrid draft.</a></strong>
Now that we have the concept of consensus in mind,
let's go back to what happened in the IETF TLS WG
regarding the non-hybrid draft.</p>
<p>During the adoption-call period,
there were statements from 20 people unequivocally supporting adoption:
David Adrian from Google,
Joseph Birr-Pixton,
Uri Blumenthal from Department of Defense subsidiary Lincoln Labs,
"Flo D" from GCHQ,
Quynh Dang from NIST,
Viktor Dukhovni,
Scott Fluhrer from Cisco,
Rebecca Guthrie from NSA,
Russ Housley,
Alicja Kario from IBM subsidiary Red Hat,
Kris Kwiatkowski,
Andrei Popov from Microsoft,
Tirumal Reddy from Cisco,
Yaroslav Rosomakho,
Jan Schaumann,
Sophie Schmieg from Google,
Martin Thomson from Mozilla,
Filippo Valsorda formerly from Google,
Loganaden Velvindron,
and
Thom Wiggers.</p>
<p>There were also statements from 2 people <em>conditionally</em> supporting adoption:
John Mattsson from Ericsson
("I support adoption as long as reuse of ephemeral keys is normatively forbidden, i.e.  MUST NOT reuse")
and
Yaakov Stein
("I support adoption of pure PQC KEMs drafts with Intended status: Informational
(meaning that the IETF is not recommending using)").</p>
<p>However, there were statements from 7 people unequivocally opposing adoption:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/YyemGJF-4-hRVwOcJ47Rw4Nu8Js/">Thomas Bellebaum</a>
  ("I agree with Stephen on this one and would not support adoption of non-hybrids"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uOmcMEqlyekrvcOgdsf7GtIlf3w/">Andrey Jivsov</a>
  ("I am opposed to the adoption of ML-KEM at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/toxVUv_d1pdDspbfo8OxcJeC_QU/">Stephen Farrell</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption, at this time"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/0f6XBGPElMLNoiS1Eh3u7EhzoGc/">Rich Salz</a>
  ("I was all set to say that I am in favor of adoption, but Stephen's post
  changed my mind. [paragraph break] The conservative and safe thing is to stick to hybrids and that is what the IETF should do for now"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/uhWI53zIjWJT5ZiS_UthyBe2k9Y/">Rob Sayre</a>
  ("I oppose adoption"),
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/EzKcwjagajQqcRpH4TDTn70W9hc/">Sun Shuzhou</a>
  ("I'm opposed to adoption"),
and me.</p>
<p>Even assuming that the 2 statements of conditional support are treated as positive votes,
the overall situation here, 22 positive votes and 7 negative votes,
does not qualify as general agreement.
"General"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/general">means</a>
"shared by or affecting most people, or most of the people in a group";
"most"
<a href="https://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/most">means</a>
"nearly all of the people or things in a group, or nearly all of something";
the phrase "general agreement" means that nearly everyone agrees.
Merely having three quarters agree is not good enough.</p>
<p>What happens if a standards-development organization issues a rule
declaring that "general agreement" exists
even when a quarter of the votes are in opposition?
I haven't found any court cases on point,
but I would expect courts to reject this
as being inconsistent with the plain meaning of "general agreement".</p>
<p>Anyway, IETF hasn't attempted to issue such a rule.
On the contrary, IETF
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250603130154/https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">claims</a>
that WG decisions are <em>not</em> taken by voting:
"Decisions within WGs, as with the broader IETF, are taken by 'rough consensus' and not by voting."
This begs the question of what IETF thinks "rough consensus" means.
Letting chairs make arbitrary decisions is a violation of due process.</p>
<p>More to the point, IETF can't override the definition of "consensus" in the law.
That definition requires general agreement.
Adoption of this draft was controversial, and didn't reach general agreement.</p>
<p><strong><a name="resolution">Objections were not handled properly.</a></strong>
Within the statements in favor of adoption,
most of the statements were very short:
e.g., just the words "I support adoption" with no further comments.</p>
<p>Some statements in favor of adoption did say more,
such as stating circular arguments for the draft
(e.g.: "as time progresses, non-hybrid key exchanges will
become more and more commonplace, so why not have it already defined?"),
or expressing concerns about key reuse
(e.g.: "I also share John's concerns about key reuse,
but would prefer to litigate that in the working group, rather than during adoption"),
without responding to the content of the objections.</p>
<p>There was a response to one word in the lack-of-principles objection.
(The response was as follows:
"The NIST competition was international, and Kyber was developed by an
international team. I struggle to understand how adopting this document
would somehow be 'favoritism'.")
A brief note by one supporter tangentially related to one objection
falls far short of fair consideration of each objection by the group as a whole.</p>
<p>I tried to engage that supporter in discussion.
I started by quoting the following earlier statement in the commentator's message:
"I find it to be cognitive dissonance to simultaneously argue that the
quantum threat requires immediate work, and yet we are also somehow
uncertain of if the algorithms are totally broken. Both cannot be true
at the same time."
I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/2Dfu4x678DEKCzF-fkdvJHJkS-8/">responded</a>
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rolling out PQ is trying to reduce the damage from an attacker having a
quantum computer within the security lifetime of the user data. Doing
that as ECC+PQ instead of just PQ is trying to reduce the damage in case
the PQ part is broken. These actions are compatible, so how exactly do
you believe they're contradictory?</p>
<p>Here's an analogous example of basic risk mitigation: there's endless
work that goes into having planes not crash, not hit turbulence, etc.,
but we still ask airplane passengers to keep their seatbelts on whenever
they're in their seats.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was still no reply to this
by the time the adoption call closed two weeks later.</p>
<p>The broader pattern was that
objectors were engaging in discussion while supporters were not.
The majority process wasn't "attempting to resolve each objection";
it was simply collecting positive votes,
trying to <em>override</em> objections from the minority
without even <em>answering</em> those objections,
let alone trying to <em>resolve</em> them.</p>
<p>That's in an organization saying that decisions aren't taken by voting.
The same organization also
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250528213926/https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-llc-statement-competition-law-issues/">says</a>,
as part of explaining why it's supposedly complying with antitrust law:
"IETF activities are conducted with extreme transparency, in public forums. Decision-making requires achieving broad consensus via these public processes."</p>
<p>When there's an objection,
the legal concept of consensus
requires not just fairly considering the objection,
and not just attempting to resolve the objection,
but—if resolution fails—having the group agree on
the contents of a <em>response</em> to the objection.
That's an official statement of <em>why</em> the objection was overridden.
It's something that can be appealed if it's wrong.
Consider, for example,
ISO's
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250626064256/https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/consolidated/index.html#a_2_5_3">simple rule</a>
saying "Committees are required to respond to all comments received".
In IETF, there weren't even <em>informal</em> responses to the objections listed above,
let alone official responses.</p>
<p><strong><a name="chairs">The chairs declared consensus anyway.</a></strong>
Shortly before the end of the specified adoption-call period,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250613195524/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/_AWy51BSgX1ipv0hfnAzLrDrTYI/">declared</a>
"consensus to adopt this draft as a working group item".
There were some notes on followup procedures,
but there was no explanation of the rationale for this claim of consensus.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250424144801/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/iCPW1FHzdwoYuUztIVfZvDtJYII/">challenged</a>
the claim of consensus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Um, what? There were several people (including me) raising objections on
list to basic flaws in this draft, such as (1) the failure to provide an
ECC backup to limit the damage from further security problems in the PQ
layer, (2) the failure to provide an engineering justification for this
option, and (3) the lack of any principles that would justify saying no
to options selected by other governments if this option is allowed.</p>
<p>Your message doesn't explain how you came to the conclusion that there's
consensus. Surely you aren't relying on some tally of positive votes to
ram this document through while ignoring objections; voting isn't how
IETF is supposed to work. So how <em>did</em> you come to this conclusion?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few days later,
the chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250522155251/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/k7_PEqKZulXMtm-D_9pEvfqcxAU/">responded</a>
that they had declared consensus
"because there is clearly sufficient interest to work on this draft".</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513013809/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/501mDxIkopb4xubDc8YQYyiZQDU/">said</a>
that this was ambiguous (sufficient for what?);
said that in any case this criterion was improper since it "would allow a draft to be adopted
over amply justified objections of almost all WG participants,
simply because the chairs and a few participants say they have enough interest in working on the draft";
and asked for an explicit statement
of whether this was the complete explanation
of why the chairs had declared consensus.</p>
<p>The chairs
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617140508/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/25uD_umU7uOL9LQ1sirFxyA9xmA/">responded</a>
that "sufficient" means "that there were enough people willing to review the draft".
They added that "WGs groups have adopted drafts with much less support than this one received."
Gee, that's confidence-inspiring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile
an IETF "security area director"
had jumped into the discussion,
in particular
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">writing</a>
"There is clearly consensus
based on the 67 responses to the adoption call. ...
The vast majority was in favour of adoption ...
There were a few dissenting opinions".</p>
<p>Remember that the actual tallies were 20 supporters, 2 conditional supporters, and 7 opponents,
even if some people (for example, me) had sent multiple messages.
Nobody had posted the actual tallies at this point:
there was just this "security area director" claiming that the "vast majority" of the "67 responses" were in favor
while there were only "a few dissenting opinions".
Also remember that this is an organization that claims
that it doesn't make decisions by voting.</p>
<p>The "security area director"
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250517194102/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/RK1HQB7Y-WFBxQaAveeT7pHZbbc/">continued</a>
that "you cherry-picking when to call
consensus evaluation 'voting' depending on whether misnaming this
is in your advantage ... is dishonestly manipulative";
that I was violating the "code of conduct";
and that if I did not "voluntarily stop this kind of behaviour"
there would be "measures under the terms of RFC3934 which is part of BCP25".</p>
<p>In a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250513185456/https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/nqouPVfPtU7hm-RF0lSDHCfze54/">followup message</a>,
the "security area director" wrote
"you calling into question this consensus
call of the WG chair is abusive and follows a repetitive pattern.
Nevertheless, for now this is your right ...
you are attempting to bait the chairs to
say they took inventory of the public emails ...
there comes a point where you will be prevented from further playing these games".</p>
<p>Wait a minute: "<em>for now</em> this is your right" (emphasis added)
and "you will be prevented from further playing these games"?
Sounds ominous.
What did the "security area director" mean by this?
No more objections in IETF?
No more appeals?
NSA's minions can just ram their non-consensual drafts through IETF
without opponents even being allowed to <em>speak up</em>?</p>
<p>Actually, yes, there's a stealth activity going on right now
that will have this effect unless enough people take action by Tuesday the 7th.
I hope to have another blog post up in a day or two saying what's going on here.</p>
<p>Anyway,
I've filed a formal
<a href="https://cr.yp.to/2025/20250812-non-hybrid.pdf">complaint</a>
regarding the claim of consensus to adopt.
So far the complaint hasn't been handled properly,
but hope springs eternal.
I don't have an answer yet to the subtitle question of this blog post.</p><hr><span size="1"><b>Version:</b>
