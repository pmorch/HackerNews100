<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><h4 id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro"></a></h4><p>This will be a short and sweet post. As I’m not big on goodbyes.</p><p>Disqus started showing ads for their “free” tier comments system a few years back. At the time, the communication they sent out via email, seemed quite laid-back and had the tone of “don’t worry about it, it’s not a big thing”. Which in part lead me to almost forget it happened.</p><p>At the time, the disqus comments system looked quite smart and sleek. I remember thinking that the ads system will possibly look smart and sleek too. Which alleviated any worries I had at the time.</p><p>WELL…….I’ve just seen the ads, and they look horrific!!!</p><h4 id="apologies">Apologies<a href="#apologies"></a></h4><p>I have a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">Pihole</a> set up, so ads are blocked on my home network. When I’m out of the house, my phone is connected to a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank">Wireguard VPN</a> which routes my data through my home internet, therefore - getting all the ad-blocking, Pihole goodness.</p><p>After years with Pi-hole, which now blocks over a million domains, I’ve become incredibly accustomed to a mostly ad-free web. Without realizing it, I’d forgotten what the typical internet experience feels like.</p><p>I used to get a couple of emails from Disqus, letting me know that there’s a new comment on this blog. I haven’t had many of these emails recently, so I decided to disable my adblocker for a few minutes and check out the comments.</p><p>There were none, instead I was greeted by some horribly formatted and obviously scammy ads:</p><figure><a><img data-src="./disqus_ads.webp" data-action="zoom" alt="Horrible Disqus Ads" src="https://ryansouthgate.com/goodbye-disqus/disqus_ads.webp"></a></figure><p>For the people who read this blog, I’m sorry.</p><p>I became “blind” to what the web is really like for most users. I’ve tried to keep this blog minimalist - a clean place to find answers. Those ads not only ruin that experience; they trample privacy too:</p><figure><a><img data-src="./disqus_traffic.webp" data-action="zoom" alt="Screenshot of Firefox Dev Tools. Showing a worrying amount of tracking requests" src="https://ryansouthgate.com/goodbye-disqus/disqus_traffic.webp"></a></figure><p>With this post, I’ve removed Disqus. It was making my blog worse, and frankly, they were profiting off my work and my visitor’s data.
I want this blog to be a resource for devs and technologists, free not just in money, but in freedom from unwanted tracking and invasive ads.</p><h4 id="any-alternatives">Any Alternatives?<a href="#any-alternatives"></a></h4><p>I’m not entirely sure comments are needed here. There are other ways to reach me, for example; <a href="https://github.com/ryansouthgate" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_southgate" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a>. But having a place for discussion under each post can be valuable.
If you have any recommendations for alternative commenting systems (especially those that respect privacy or are self-hosted), I’d love to hear them! Please reach out if you’ve found something that works well.</p><p>Thanks as always for reading - your trust matters to me.</p><p><em>Sorry again for the mess!</em></p><hr><hr></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-link="/posts/111/companies-are-lying-about-ai-layoffs">

<p>Companies are saying that the economy and AI are causing the large amount of tech layoffs, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-Ecodxn5m4">Vanessa Wingårdh looked at the H-1B visa data</a> and noticed that the companies are lying.</p>
<p>She argues that the American employees are being replaced by cheaper H-1B visa workers.
<a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/h1b-visa-grassley-durbin-letter-tech-firms-8fe931e9">WSJ also reported on this due to some senators speaking up.</a>
As proof she uses the H-1B <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub">data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</a>.
When filtering by fiscal years 2023, 2024 and 2025, the number of Beneficiaries Approved for some of the big corporations as of 30 June 2025 are shown in the second column below.
I also searched a bit for news articles about layoffs and put those numbers in the third column.</p>

<p>A commenter on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45423088#45424038">Hacker News</a> writes: "You can go on Blind, Fishbowl, any work related subreddit, etc. and hear the same story over and over and over - 'My company replaced half my department with H1Bs or simply moved it to an offshore center in India, and then on the next earnings call announced that they had replaced all those jobs with AI'. There's a reason why 'AI = Actually Indians' is a meme everywhere on the internet, and it isn't racism, it's just people observing the reality around them."</p>
<p>I searched a bit to verify these claims and it seems plausible since I could without much effort find a report from Boeing in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boeing/comments/1f1qqud/engineers_replaced_by_h1b/">2000s</a>, and that indeed the replacing of US workers by H-1Bs seems commonly agreed upon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1nmw5c8/has_anyone_inadvertently_trained_their_h1b/">here</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/1hnodib/h1b_visa_exploited_for_decades/">here</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskALiberal/comments/1m9h4x6/what_do_you_think_of_microsoft_laying_off_workers/">here</a>.</p>

    </p><h2>What is the EUPL?</h2>
    <p>EUPL is an acronym for "European Union Public Licence".</p>
    <p>The first EUPL draft (v.0.1) went public in June 2005. A public debate was then organised by the European Commission (IDABC). The consultation of the developers and users community was very productive and has lead to many improvements of the draft licence; 10 out of 15 articles were modified. Based on the results of these modifications (a detailed report and the draft EUPL v.0.2), the European Commission  elaborated a final version (v.1.0) that was officially approved on 9 January 2007, in three linguistic versions.</p>
    <p>By a second Decision of 9 January 2008, the European Commission validated the EUPL in all the official languages of the European Union.</p>
    <p>By a third Decision of 9 January 2009, the European Commission clarified specific points of the EUPL, publishing the version 1.1 in all the official languages of the European Union.</p>
    <p>The Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/863 of 18 May 2017 updating the open source software licence EUPL to further facilitate the sharing and reuse of software developed by public administrations (OJ 19/05/2017 L128 p. 59–64 ) published the version 1.2, with extended compatibility.</p>
    <h2>Why the EUPL?</h2>
    <p>The purpose of the European Commission is first of all to distribute its own software under the licence. Some applications developed in the framework of the IDABC programme, such as Circabc, or Eusurvey have already been licensed under the EUPL in 2007. Other European Institutions are also interested in using the new licence.</p>
    <p>But why creating a new legal instrument from scratch when more than 100 other F/OSS licences exist, such as the GPL, the BSD or the OSL? The reason is that in a detailed legal study no existing licence was found to correspond to the requirements of the European Commission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Licence should have equal legal value in all EU languages;</li>
      <li>The terminology regarding intellectual property rights had to be conformant with European law requirements;</li>
      <li>To be valid in all Member States, limitations of liability or warranty had to be precise, and not formulated "to the extend allowed by the law" as in most licences designed with the legal environment of the United States in mind.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>The main objective of the European Commission is to distribute widely and promote the use of software owned by itself and other European Institutions under an Free/Open Source Licence conform to European law requirements.</p>
    <p>The EUPL is however written in neutral terms so that a broader use might be envisaged.</p>
    <p>In addition, distribution of software should avoid the exclusive appropriation of the software even after improvement by a third party (therefore, the EUPL is a "copyleft" licence).</p>
    <h2>Who may use the EUPL?</h2>
    <p>Although the potential users of European Institutions' software are mostly other public sector administrations, there is nothing in the EUPL preventing its broader use. The EUPL could be used by anyone who holds the copyright to a piece of software. It could become – in various languages - an adequate legal interoperability instrument across Europe.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, the EUPL purpose is not to compete with other licences. It might be used primarily by public administrations, either European or national, that would need a common licensing instrument to mutualise or share software and knowledge.</p>
    <h2>Is the EUPL compatible with the GPL and other F/OSS licences?</h2>
    <p>Yes, it is. The EUPL contains a unique compatibility clause and provides for a list of compatible copyleft licences. The GPL is one of them.</p>
    <p>For example, how would the interaction between the EUPL and the GPL play out in the case of CIRCA, an application a already distributed under the EUPL?</p>
    <p>A developer may merge the Circabc software with a GPL component, and then could license the new derivative work (another project, with a new name) under the GPL. It is not permitted to "re-license" CIRCA under the GPL. A developer will be also able to integrate CIRCA in existing GPL work called e.g. "MY-GPL-PROGRAM" and continue to license this improved work under the GPL licence that he had chosen originally.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's September 2025. We have Claude Opus 4.1. GPT-5. Nano banana. There has never been a better time in the history of computing to build software. Here are a few ideas I wish existed.</p><ol><li>A camera app that uses nano banana to make my mediocre iPhone photos look like they were taken on a Leica.</li><li>A single-purpose AI agent that can take any frontend project and automatically add support for light mode, dark mode, and custom theming. It should be able to use vision to see the UI changes, and then iteratively make changes based on the rendered UI.</li><li>Another single-purpose AI agent that can decompile and debug minified code into an interpretable codebase. This also requires a strong code-then-debug loop.</li><li>A hybrid of Strong (the lifting app) and ChatGPT where the model has access to my workouts, can suggest improvements, and coach me. I mainly just want to be able to chat with the model knowing it has detailed context for each of my workouts (down to the time in between each set).</li><li>A recommendation engine that looks at my browsing history, sees what blog posts or articles I spent the most time on, then searches the web every night for things I should be reading that I’m not. In the morning I should get a digest of links. I also want to be able to give feedback on which were good suggestions and which weren’t to improve the next day’s digest.</li><li>A calorie tracking app that’s a chat app grounded by nutrition databases. Just minimize the cognitive effort it takes me to log a meal.</li><li>A minimalist writing app that lets me write long-form content. A model can also highlight passages and leave me comments in the marginalia. I should be able to set different “personas” to review what I wrote.</li><li>An AI agent that can build one-off specialized AI agents. I want to describe a task like “build me an agent that can decompile code” and this agent will go off and build a hyper-specialized code decompilation agent for me.</li><li>A minimalist ebook reader that lets me read ebooks, but I can highlight passages and have the model explain things in more depth off to the side. It should also take on the persona of the author. It should feel like an <em>extension</em> of the book and not a separate chat instance.</li><li>A Deep Research agent that can reason for multiple days. I want to give it <em>very</em> complex queries and let it know it can spawn hundreds of sub-agents and reason for 3 days before it needs to return a response.</li><li>A <em>paint-by-number</em> filmmaking app. I want to be able to brainstorm an idea for a short film in the app, have the model create a detailed storyboard, and then I just need to use my phone to film each of the storyboarded shots. Kind of like training wheels for making movies.</li><li>A local screen recording app but it uses local models to create detailed semantic summaries of what I’m doing each day on my computer. This should then be provided as context for a chat app. I want to ask things like “Who did I forget to respond to yesterday?” I've been using Rewind for a year now, and it's nowhere near as useful as it should be.</li><li>Semantic filters for Twitter/X/YouTube. I want to be able to write open-ended filters like “hide any tweet that will likely make me angry” and never have my feed show me rage-bait again. By shaping our feeds we shape ourselves.</li><li>An agent that can create a detailed curriculum for very niche topics. I should be able to say something like “I want to learn everything we know about the science of progress” and it would search the web for people, blog posts, YouTube videos, essays, and textbooks. Then it should read through all the content, and give me a guided curriculum that will take me from beginner to expert.</li><li>An <em>actually good</em> book recommendation engine that first quizzes you about things you’ve read in the past, what your goals are, and the sort of things you enjoy reading. Then once it knows a lot about you, another agent simulates what you might think of the books the main agent suggests. It only surfaces books that you’re very likely to enjoy.</li><li>A semantic search engine for TikTok and Instagram Reels. There’s so much useful information locked away in short-form videos. I want to be able to query it.</li><li>A sleep fitness app that pulls in data from my Apple Watch (HR, VO₂), Eight Sleep, Oura Ring, workout apps, and combines them to give me practical recommendations for how to improve my sleep and recovery. I want it to proactively message me. Something like <em>“I noticed your HRV has gone down this week, maybe you’re overtraining?”</em></li><li>A massive component library designed to be rendered within the context of a chat interface. Most existing component libraries have primitives that are too low-level. Less customization, more high level widgets.</li><li>A minimal voice assistant for my Apple Watch. I have lots of questions that are too complicated for Siri but not for ChatGPT. The responses should just be a few words long.</li><li>A writing app that searches the web for the topic you’re writing about, then composes a “suggested reading” list based on what it thinks might be helpful for you to read. (Writing apps should never write <em>for</em> you.)</li><li>A running app that creates a personalized plan, tracks your running pace and heart rate, and then iteratively adjusts the training program based on real world data.</li><li>A nano banana photo-editing app where I don’t have to write a prompt. Just give me hundreds of templates from trying out different haircuts to seeing what you and your partner’s kid would look like to making me look like The Rock. A photo editing super-app.</li><li>Same.energy but for finding YouTube videos with similar vibes. Let me put in a URL and have it find similar videos. YouTube's algorithm today is not this. &nbsp;It just tries to maximize the median user’s engagement.</li><li>A Sony Walkman-style device that you can give to children so they can ask questions to an LLM. It should be voice-first, and focused on explaining things. There shouldn’t be a single screen on the device. Offline-first would be a plus.</li><li>A search engine for biographies of people where the query is a questionnaire about the current problem you’re facing, your stage in life, your field, etc. The engine’s results should be chapters from biographies or autobiographies from great people throughout history who have gone through and written about similar circumstances.</li><li>A screen-recording agent that observes how I’m using my computer and phone. Each day it audits the content I’ve been consuming. Screen Time is not specific enough. I want to know the exact nutritional value of the tokens I’m consuming.</li><li>A marketplace for AI agents. I don’t think today’s general agents will be better than an agent designed for a specific use case. I want a hyper-specific agent catalog for niche tasks like finding an apartment to rent in San Francisco. There should be tens of thousands of these agents that I can use via the web or call via API.</li><li>A writing app that lets you “request a critique” from a bunch of famous writers. What would Hemingway say about this blog post? What did he find confusing? What did he like?</li></ol><p>If you're building anything on this list, please let me know. I'd really like to use it.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>In the last 3 months, I've interviewed 134 engineers - students, mid-level, seniors and even CTOs.&nbsp;</p><p>My main takeaway: there is a huge pool of exceptional junior engineers<strong> </strong>that most companies won’t even consider.&nbsp;</p><p>While everyone else is fighting over seniors, smart companies can get a significant advantage by going the other direction. If you won’t, your competitors will.</p><p>I’m not alone here. In the beginning of 2025 Shopify recently hired 25 interns (and <!--$--><a href="https://www.firstround.com/ai/shopify?ref=review.firstround.com" rel="noopener">their head of engineering said he</a><!--/$--> aims for 1000(!) more by the end of the year, saying that: “...interns bring energy, drive and intensity that pushes the whole team forward.”)</p><h2>Why do companies avoid juniors?</h2><p>Every company has a different excuse:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>In small startups - “we are a very small team and we don’t have time to mentor juniors, we need engineers who will be very productive from day 1"</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>In medium-sized companies - “we are going to grow very fast, we need engineers who can handle scale and have faced such challenges before"</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>In big companies - “our infrastructure is super complex, it’ll take juniors too long to ramp up".</p></li></ul><p>It's safer to hire someone with 4+ years of experience who can contribute from day one, even if their ceiling isn't as high as a motivated junior engineer.</p><p>So colleges continue churning out graduates who can't get a job, while companies complain about how hard it is to find senior engineers (and pay premium rates for them).</p><p>The thing is that many of these "experienced" hires aren't actually that much more productive than a well-mentored junior engineer.</p><p>Software development is not rocket science. There are diminishing returns, you will get better with time, but the pace will become slower. You can tell the difference between a developer with 1 year of experience and one with 5, but between those with 10 vs 15? Probably not.</p><p>The most critical parts (motivation, ambition, character, and brains)<strong> </strong>have little to do with experience.</p><h2>What companies are missing</h2><p>The main mistakes companies make:</p><ol><li data-preset-tag="p"><div><p><strong>Old assumptions about onboarding time.</strong> Companies assume junior engineers need 6-12 months to become productive, but AI-savvy juniors can get up to speed much faster. They can use it to understand codebases (without interrupting team members), generate boilerplate code, and learn new technologies at an accelerated pace.</p></div></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><div><p><strong>Outdated interviews</strong> - most technical interviews still focus on algorithm memorization and whiteboard coding. These skills are less relevant when AI can handle all those known problems. </p></div></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>They don't know where to find amazing juniors - </strong>companies recruit from the same places and miss the hidden gems. A perfect example: engineers who applied to Y Combinator but didn't get in. They are very often impressive people with strong motivation and drive.</p></li></ol><p>Before I share my take on junior interviews, let’s talk about what’s so great about them:</p><h2>Why I love working with juniors</h2><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Juniors are<strong> not restricted by what they know</strong>.&nbsp; They haven't been trained to think "that's just how we do things." They’ll not try to reuse the same technologies from previous companies, or recreate those ‘amazing’ design patterns that were useful only in a specific context. It’s not just being AI-native, it’s about having less resistance to change.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Great juniors<strong> learn fast and search for feedback</strong>. It’s easier to manage them. They <strong>want</strong> to improve and know what you think about their work.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Loyalty.</strong> engineers who you train from the beginning tend to stay longer. They understand your systems deeply and can mentor the next generation of junior engineers.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Higher ceiling.</strong> A motivated junior engineer often has more upside. You're getting someone at the beginning of their growth curve rather than the middle or end.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Juniors bring<strong> fresh energy </strong>to the team - they want to learn, and they have a drive to prove themselves and succeed. Their motivation can be contagious!<br>The existing seniors in your team <strong>will enjoy</strong> working with smart and motivated developers.</p></li></ul><p>Before we continue, a side note:</p><p>The argument here is not to stop hiring seniors. To be effective, juniors need people to mentor them, do high quality code reviews, and so on. And in addition, for some critical challenges, you would still want people who’ve done those before at other places.</p><p>Ok, so you’ve decided it’s worth giving some juniors a chance. Now comes the hard part. As there are so many juniors looking for a job, it can be difficult to find the right ones. Here’s the process that worked for us:</p><h2>How to hire the right junior engineers</h2><p>Most companies are still hiring like it's 2019. AI has fundamentally changed how we write software. If your hiring process hasn't changed, you're probably hiring the wrong people.&nbsp;</p><p>For some reason, companies still ban AI during technical interviews. They're optimizing for skills that matter less while ignoring the skills that actually determine success on the job.</p><p>Here’s our hiring process in 5 steps:</p><h4>1. Filter for the right mindset</h4><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Ask about <strong>projects they've built, then drill deeper.</strong> Ask "Why did you build this?" and "How does that work?" <br>Keep drilling down until you hit the bottom of their understanding and whether they can think through complex problems.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Look for passion and curiosity.</strong> You want the ones who light up when talking about their projects. They should show real excitement about the problems they've solved. These conversations should be energizing for both of you!</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Watch out for red flags.</strong> The ones who get defensive when you ask follow-up questions or can't explain their work past the surface level are probably just chasing a tech salary.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h4>2. “Use whatever tools you like" home assignment&nbsp;</h4><p>A small and realistic coding challenge with explicit permission to use any tools they want.&nbsp;</p><p>The key is what happens next - we schedule a 30-minute follow-up where they walk through their solution. We ask them to explain their approach, then drill deeper on their reasoning - asking "Why did you make that choice?" or "how does this part work?". We keep going until you reach the limits of their understanding.</p><p>Do they understand the code they submitted? Can they explain design decisions and trade-offs? How deep is their knowledge of the technologies they chose?</p><h4>3. Problem solving without AI</h4><p>A ~40-minute interview to test their ability to think through complex problems and design solutions. We focus on system design, architectural decisions, and reasoning through trade-offs.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, they will use AI in their job even in those tasks, but we also want to see if they can think for themselves, and what is their fundamental engineering thinking.</p><h4>4. Live implementation with AI</h4><p>We give them 20 minutes for a small live coding task and see how they work with AI tools. Their prompting strategies, how they iterate on AI output, and whether they can effectively guide the AI toward solutions that make sense.</p><h4>5. Evaluate their AI strategy</h4><p>Then, we ask candidates to walk us through their typical development workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>We ask them to explain when they choose AI assistance versus manual coding, ideally with specific examples from projects they've built.</p><p>The engineers who can’t think without AI hit walls when they encounter new problems.</p><p>The ones who resist AI are outpaced by peers who go all-in with the new tools.&nbsp;</p><p>We look for engineers who excel in both phases - the ones who understand the huge benefit AI provides, but also know where it hurts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Making it work after the hire</h2><p>Congrats! You’ve hired a new junior engineer. What’s next?</p><p>Here’s my take:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Invest in mentoring infrastructure.</strong><br>Don’t just assume they can use AI to learn everything. Make sure your experienced engineers have the time to pair with them, create clear learning paths, and be available for their needs.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Be patient with short-term productivity.</strong> Don’t expect them to produce magic because they are ‘AI-native’. Yes, they should be fast, but give them the proper time to learn the basics of your company.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Measure the right metrics.</strong> Track how quickly junior engineers become productive, their retention rates, and their main blockers. We (very objectively) suggest using Weave to benchmark them to your current engineers and industry standards :)</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Talk to them!</strong> Ask them about their experience, and what they think you could improve for the next juniors. Use the fresh perspective they bring, and come with an open mind to their suggestions. Also - make sure to appreciate their work and tell them when you do. Even if they are superstars - they might not know it, and could use some encouragement.&nbsp;</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Start small.</strong> Don't hire 10 juniors and let them run amok on your codebases. Start with 1-2 and learn what works (from the previous steps) before scaling up.</p></li></ul><h2>Why this matters more than ever</h2><p>I believe most companies are making a huge mistake by avoiding juniors entirely. They're missing out on AI-native engineers who can learn quickly, adapt to new tools, and grow into really exceptional senior engineers quite fast.</p><p>This market inefficiency won't last forever. As we’ve seen with the Shopify example,&nbsp; smart companies will figure out how to hire and develop junior engineers effectively. They will build incredible teams while their competitors fight over the same pool of expensive senior talent.</p><p>Investing your time in passionate junior developers will pay off in the long run. The question is whether you'll start now or wait until everyone else figures it out.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/29/faa_decides_it_trusts_boeing/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/29/faa_decides_it_trusts_boeing/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45420327">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>After years of relying on the FAA to certify its jets as airworthy, Boeing is finally going to be allowed to do so itself – sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The US Federal Aviation Administration <a href="https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/faa-statement-boeing-airworthiness-certificates" rel="nofollow">said</a> on Friday that it was granting Boeing "limited delegation" to issue its own airworthiness certificates for the 737 Max and 787 aircraft, which it hasn't been able to do since 2019 and 2022, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boeing lost its ability to certify the airworthiness of the 737 Max after a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/boeing_might_be_criminally_prosecuted/">pair of crashes</a> in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people. The agency took 787 certification out of Boeing's hands due to what the FAA said was "production quality issues."&nbsp;</p>

    

<p>As we've previously reported, the 787's problems include things like a need to be <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/boeing_might_be_criminally_prosecuted/">power cycled every 51 days</a> due to faulty software, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/08/08/boeing_787_software_bug_hack/">easy hackability</a> of plane systems, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2014/01/16/us_safety_authorities_on_boeings_case_787_batteries_fail/">melting batteries</a>, and other issues pointed out before the FAA took control of its airworthiness. Not that things have become much better for the 787 since the FAA assumed responsibility for its airworthiness, mind you: Since then Boeing has <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/07/boeing_787_production_defect/">delayed 787 deliveries</a> due to faulty horizontal stabilizers, and a whistleblower has argued that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/17/boeing_whistleblower_fuselage_gaps/">chronic fuselage gaps</a> have left the entire 787 fleet in a position to fly apart at the seams.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>The 737 Max has continued to have problems since the FAA took over inspection of that Boeing model, too. It was a 737 Max 9 which <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/08/boeing_737_max_9_airplanes/">lost a door plug in flight</a> last year. The FAA grounded 737 Max aircraft following the door plug incident, after which United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, the only carriers with Max 9s in their fleets, discovered a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/09/united_alaska_737_loose_bolts/">chronic problem of loose bolts</a> on the questionably-airworthy aircraft. A Congressional look at internal Boeing documents found emails from engineers <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/01/11/boeing_737_max_emails/">saying</a> in 2020 that they wouldn't put their own families on the 737 Max over safety concerns.</p>
<p>The FAA gave Boeing <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/28/faa_gives_boeing_90_days/">90 days</a> to fix a number of safety shortcomings it flagged in a February 2024 report it published following the door plug blowout. It's well past that 90-day deadline, but the FAA now says that they're at least partially content with improvements the company has made since it started scrutinizing the firm, again, last year.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
<p>
  <strong>Airworthiness certification custody sharing</strong>
</p>
<p>"The FAA will only allow this step forward because we are confident it can be done safely," the agency said in its Friday press release – but being done safely still means Boeing will be subject to FAA scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>Per the Administration, Boeing will only get to issue airworthiness certificates every other week, with the FAA handling things the other half of the time. Far from being simply an acknowledgement that Boeing is doing better, the FAA is going to use its every-other-week model to spend more time keeping a watchful eye on the assembly process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"By alternating weeks, we are creating more opportunities to directly observe how Boeing is carrying out this responsibility in practice," an FAA spokesperson told <em>The Register.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/01/15/boeing_airbus_commercial_deliveries_2024/">Boeing going backwards as production's slowing and woes keep flowing</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/23/boeing_thoma_bravo_software_sale/">Boeing offloads some software businesses to private equiteer Thoma Bravo</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/28/boeing_starliner_fixes/">Boeing's Starliner may fly again, pending fixes to literally everything</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/31/faa_whistleblower_complaints/">Report claims FAA ignores most whistleblower complaints</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"The FAA's role is to provide oversight of Boeing's performance, ensuring that it issues certificates only when airplanes meet all applicable safety requirements," the spokesperson continued. "Alternating weeks strengthens our ability to identify trends, intervene early if concerns arise, and maintain confidence in the overall safety of Boeing's system."</p>
<p>The FAA didn't tell us whether the agreement was temporary, or how long it might take Boeing to earn its complete trust and confidence in its ability to issue reliable airworthiness certificates. Boeing didn't respond to questions for this story. ®&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto"><em><g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji> Hey! This is an old, abandoned project, with both technical and design issues <a href="https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/issues/269" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/issues/269/hovercard">listed here</a>. Please have fun with this tutorial but do look for more modern and authoritative sources if you want to learn about OS design. <g-emoji alias="warning">⚠️</g-emoji></em></p>
<p dir="auto">How to create an OS from scratch!</p>
<p dir="auto">I have always wanted to learn how to make an OS from scratch. In college I was taught
how to implement advanced features (pagination, semaphores, memory management, etc)
but:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>I never got to start from my own boot sector</li>
<li>College is hard so I don't remember most of it.</li>
<li>I'm fed up with people who think that reading an already existing kernel, even if small, is
a good idea to learn operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Inspired by <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf" rel="nofollow">this document</a>
and the <a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/" rel="nofollow">OSDev wiki</a>, I'll try to make short step-by-step READMEs and
code samples for anybody to follow. Honestly, this tutorial is basically the first document but
split into smaller pieces and without the theory.</p>
<p dir="auto">Updated: more sources: <a href="https://littleosbook.github.io/" rel="nofollow">the little book about OS development</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160412174753/http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html" rel="nofollow">JamesM's kernel development tutorials</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This course is a code tutorial aimed at people who are comfortable with low level computing. For example,
programmers who have curiosity on how an OS works but don't have the time or willpower to start reading the Linux kernel
top to bottom.</li>
<li>There is little theory. Yes, this is a feature. Google is your theory lecturer. Once you pass college,
excessive theory is worse than no theory because it makes things seem more difficult than they really are.</li>
<li>The lessons are tiny and may take 5-15 minutes to complete. Trust me and trust yourself. You can do it!</li>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Start with the first folder and go down in order. They build on previous code, so if
you jump right to folder 05 and don't know why there is a <code>mov ah, 0x0e</code>, it's because you missed lecture 02.
Really, just go in order. You can always skip stuff you already know.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Open the README and read the first line, which details the concepts you should be familiar with
before reading the code. Google concepts you are not familiar with. The second line states the goals for each lesson.
Read them, because they explain why we do what we do. The "why" is as important as the "how".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Read the rest of the README. It is <strong>very concise</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">(Optional) Try to write the code files by yourself after reading the README.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Look at the code examples. They are extremely well commented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">(Optional) Experiment with them and try to break things. The only way to make sure you understood something is
trying to break it or replicate it with different commands.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">TL;DR: First read the README on each folder, then the code files. If you're brave, try to code them yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Strategy</h2><a id="user-content-strategy" aria-label="Permalink: Strategy" href="#strategy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We will want to do many things with our OS:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Boot from scratch, without GRUB - DONE!</li>
<li>Enter 32-bit mode - DONE</li>
<li>Jump from Assembly to C - DONE!</li>
<li>Interrupt handling - DONE!</li>
<li>Screen output and keyboard input - DONE!</li>
<li>A tiny, basic <code>libc</code> which grows to suit our needs - DONE!</li>
<li>Memory management</li>
<li>Write a filesystem to store files</li>
<li>Create a very simple shell</li>
<li>User mode</li>
<li>Maybe we will write a simple text editor</li>
<li>Multiple processes and scheduling</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Probably we will go through them in that order, however it's soon to tell.</p>
<p dir="auto">If we feel brave enough:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A BASIC interpreter, like in the 70s!</li>
<li>A GUI</li>
<li>Networking</li>

<p dir="auto">This is a personal learning project, and even though it hasn't been updated for a long time, I still have hopes to get into it at some point.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm thankful to all those who have pointed out bugs and submitted pull requests. I will need some time to review everything and I cannot guarantee that at this moment.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>C# is a versatile language. You can write mobile apps, desktop apps, games, websites, services and APIs with it. You can write it like Java with all the abstractions and <code>AbstractionFactoryClassProvider</code>s. But differently from Java, you can write low-level and unsafe code too. When I say low-level, I mean without the GC, with raw pointers. </p><p>Low-level code is usually required for performance or interoperability with C libraries or the operating system. The reason low-level code helps with performance is that it can be used to eliminate runtime checks on memory accesses.</p><p><strong>Array element accesses are bounds-checked in C# for safety</strong>. But, that means that there's performance impact unless the compiler can eliminate a bounds-checking operation. The bounds-checking elimination logic needs to ensure that the array index was already bounds-checked before, or can be assured to be inside bounds during the compile-time. For example, take this simple function:</p><pre><code>int sum(int[] array)
{
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; array.Length; i++)
  {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}</code></pre><p>That's an ideal situation for bounds-checking elimination because the index variable <code>i</code> is created with known boundaries, and it depends on the array's length. The index variable's lifetime is shorter than the array's lifetime and it's guaranteed to be contained valid values throughout the function. The native code produced for <code>sum</code> has no bounds-checking:</p><pre><code>L0000	xor	    eax, eax
L0002	xor	    edx, edx
L0004	mov     r8d, [rcx+8]          ; read length
L0008	test    r8d, r8d              ; is empty?
L000b	jle	    short L001c           ; skip the loop
L000d	mov	    r10d, edx
L0010	add	    eax, [rcx+r10*4+0x10] ; sum += array[i];
L0015	inc	    edx                   ; i++
L0017	cmp	    r8d, edx              ; compare length with i
L001a	jg	    short L000d           ; loop if still greater
L001c	ret	</code></pre><p>But, what if the function signature was slightly different?</p><pre><code>int sum(int[] array, int startIndex, int endIndex)
{
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = startIndex; i &lt;= endIndex; i++)
  {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}</code></pre><p>Now, the C# compiler doesn't have a way to know if the passed <code>startIndex</code> and <code>endIndex</code> values are inside the boundaries of <code>array</code> because their lifetimes are distinct. So the native assembly produced becomes way more involved with bounds-checking operations:</p><pre><code>L0000	sub		rsp, 0x28				
L0004	xor		eax, eax			; sum = 0
L0006	cmp		edx, r8d			; startIndex &gt; endIndex?
L0009	jg		short L0045			; then skip the entire function
L000b	test	rcx, rcx			; array is null?
L000e	je		short L0031			; then cause NullReferenceException
L0010	mov		r10d, edx
L0013	or		r10d, r8d
L0016	jl		short L0031
L0018	cmp		[rcx+8], r8d		; array.Length &lt;= endIndex ?
L001c	jle		short L0031			; then do bounds-checking
L001e	xchg	ax, ax				; alignment NOP
L0020	mov		r10d, edx
L0023	add		eax, [rcx+r10*4+0x10]   ; sum += array[i]
L0028	inc		edx					; consider i + 1
L002a	cmp		edx, r8d			; i &gt; endIndex?
L002d	jle		short L0020			; no, go on
L002f	jmp		short L0045			; return
L0031	cmp		edx, [rcx+8]		; i &gt; array.Length?
L0034	jae		short L004a			; bounds-checking failed. go to ----+
L0036	mov		r10d, edx												|
L0039	add		eax, [rcx+r10*4+0x10]	; sum += array[i]				|
L003e	inc		edx					; i++								|
L0040	cmp		edx, r8d			; i &lt;= endIndex ?					|
L0043	jle		short L0031			; continue for loop					|
L0045	add		rsp, 0x28												|
L0049	ret							; return sum						|
L004a	call	0x00007ff857ec6200	; throw IndexOutOfRangeException &lt;--+
</code></pre><p>We could use low-level unsafe functions and pointers in C# (yes, C# supports raw pointers!) to avoid bounds-checking altogether, like this:</p><pre><code>unsafe int sum(int* ptr, int length)
{
  int* end = ptr + length;
  int sum = 0;
  for (; ptr &lt; end; ptr++)
  {
    sum += *ptr;
  }
  return sum;
}</code></pre><p>That also creates a <em>very </em>optimized code that supports passing along a sub-portion of an array:</p><pre><code>L0000	movsxd	rax, edx        
L0003	lea	rax, [rcx+rax*4]    ; end = ptr + length
L0007	xor	edx, edx            ; sum = 0
L0009	cmp	rcx, rax            ; ptr &gt;= end ?
L000c	jae	short L0019         ; then return
L000e	add	edx, [rcx]          ; sum += *ptr
L0010	add	rcx, 4              ; ptr += sizeof(int)
L0014	cmp	rcx, rax            ; ptr &lt; end?
L0017	jb	short L000e         ; then keep looping
L0019	mov	eax, edx
L001b	ret	                    ; return sum</code></pre><p>Unsafe code and pointer-arithmetic can be very performant as you can see. The problem is that it's too dangerous. With incorrect values of length, you don't simply get an <code>IndexOutOfRangeException</code> but instead your app either crashes, or returns incorrect results. If your code happened to modify the memory region instead of just reading it, then you could have a nice entry point for a buffer overflow security vulnerability in your app too. Not to mention that all the callers of that function will have to have unsafe blocks too.</p><p>But it's possible to handle this safe and fast in C# without resorting to esoteric rituals like that. First, how do you solve this problem of indexes to describe a portion of an array and actual boundaries of the array being disconnected from each other? You create a new immutable type that holds these values together. And that type is called a <em>span</em> in C#. Other programming languages may call it a <em>slice</em>. Declaration of <code>Span</code> type resembles something like this. Well, it's not exactly this, but I want you to understand the concept first:</p><pre><code>readonly struct Span&lt;T&gt;
{
  readonly T* _ptr;
  readonly int _len;
}</code></pre><p>It's basically an immutable pointer with length. The great thing about a type like this is that the compiler can assure that once an immutable Span is initialized with correct bounds, it will always be safe to access without any bounds-checking. That means, you can pass around sub-views of arrays or even other spans safely and quickly without the performance overhead.</p><p>But, how can it be safe? What if the GC decides to throw away the structure that <code>ptr</code> points to? Well, that's where "ref types" come into play in C#.</p><p>A ref type is a type that can't leave the stack and escape to the heap, so it's always guaranteed that a <code>T</code> type will outlive a <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> instance. That's why the actual <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> declaration looks like this:</p><pre><code>readonly ref struct Span&lt;T&gt;  // notice "ref" 
{
  readonly ref T _ptr;        // notice "ref"
  readonly int _len;
}</code></pre><p>Since a ref type can only live in stack, it can't be a member of a class, nor can it be assigned to a non-ref variable, like, it can't be boxed either. A ref type can only be contained inside another ref type. It's ref types all the way.</p><p>Span-based version of our <code>sum</code> function can eliminate bounds-checking despite that it can now have several super powers. The first one is that it can receive a sub-view of an array too with specific indices:</p><pre><code>int sum(Span&lt;int&gt; span)
{
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; span.Length; i++)
  {
    sum += span[i];
  }
  return sum;
}</code></pre><p>For instance you can call this function with <code>sum(array)</code> or you can call it with a sub-view of an array like <code>sum(array[startIndex..endIndex])</code>. That wouldn't incur new bounds-checking operations other than when you're trying to slice the array using the range operator. See how the generated assembly code for <code>sum</code> becomes optimized again:</p><pre><code>L0000	mov	rax, [rcx]
L0003	mov	ecx, [rcx+8]
L0006	xor	edx, edx            ; sum = 0
L0008	xor	r8d, r8d            ; i = 0
L000b	test	ecx, ecx		; span.Length == 0?
L000d	jle	short L001e
L000f	mov	r10d, r8d
L0012	add	edx, [rax+r10*4]    ; sum += span[i]
L0016	inc	r8d                 ; i++
L0019	cmp	r8d, ecx            ; i &lt; Length?
L001c	jl	short L000f         ; then keep looping
L001e	mov	eax, edx            
L0020	ret						; return sum</code></pre><p>Another superpower you get is that the ability to declare the data structure you receive immutable in your function signature, so your function is guaranteed not to touch it, and you can find bugs instantly. All you need to do is to replace <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code> with <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt;</code>. Then your attempts to modify the span contents will immediately cause a compiler error. Something impossible with regular arrays, even if you declare them <code>readonly</code>. The <code>readonly</code> directive only protects the reference from modification not the contents of the data structure.</p><p>Passing along a smaller portion of a larger data structure to relevant APIs used to involve either copying or passing the relevant part's offset and length values along with that data structure. It required the API to support calls with larger structures with offsets. It was impossible to guarantee the safety of such APIs as the relationship between parameters couldn't be established by the compiler or the runtime.</p><p>It's now both easy and expressive to implement zero-copy operations safely using spans. Consider a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort?ref=ssg.dev" rel="noreferrer">Quicksort</a> implementation for instance; it usually has a function like this that works with portions of a given array:</p><pre><code>int partition(int[] array, int low, int high)
{
  int midpoint = (high + low) / 2; // I know, we'll get there!
  int mid = array[midpoint];

  // tuple swaps in C#! ("..^1" means "Length - 1")
  (array[midpoint], array[^1]) = (array[^1], array[midpoint]);
  int pivotIndex = 0;
  for (int i = low; i &lt; high - 1; i++)
  {
     if (array[i] &lt; mid)
     {
       swap(array, i, pivotIndex);
       pivotIndex += 1;
     }
  }
  (array[midpoint], array[endpoint]) = (array[endpoint], array[midpoint]);
  return pivotIndex;
}</code></pre><p>This function receives an array and offsets that designate a part of it, and rearranges the items based on a picked value in it. Values smaller than it move to the left, larger than it move to the right.</p><p>The <code>mid = array[midpoint]</code> has to be bounds-checked because the compiler can't know if the index is inside the bounds of this array. The <code>for</code> loop also performs bounds-check for array accesses in the loop, which some of them can be eliminated, but not fully guaranteed. </p><p>There is also an overflow error because we pass array ranges using <code>high</code> and <code>low</code> values: <code>(high+low)</code> can overflow for very large arrays, and the results would be catastrophic, can even cause buffer overflow exceptions.</p><p>The <code>partition</code> function gets recursively called many times by <code>Quicksort</code> function below, so that means bounds-checking can be a performance issue. </p><pre><code>void Quicksort(int[] array, int low, int high)
{
  if (array.Length &lt;= 1)
  {
    return;
  }

  int pivot = partition(array, low, high);
  Quicksort(span, low, pivot - 1);
  Quicksort(span, pivot + 1, high);
}</code></pre><p>With spans, the same Quicksort function looks like this:</p><pre><code>void Quicksort(Span&lt;int&gt; span)
{
  if (span.Length &lt;= 1)
  {
    return;
  }

  int pivot = partition(span);
  Quicksort(span[..pivot]);
  Quicksort(span[(pivot + 1)..]);
}</code></pre><p>See how expressive using spans are especially with the range syntax? It lets you get a new span out of an existing span or an array using double dots (<code>..</code>)? And the partition function even looks much better too:</p><pre><code>int partition(Span&lt;int&gt; span)
{
  int midpoint = span.Length / 2; // look ma, no buffer overflows!
  int mid = span[midpoint];
  (span[midpoint], span[^1]) = (span[^1], span[midpoint]);
  int pivotIndex = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; span.Length - 1; i++)
  {
     if (span[i] &lt; mid)
     {
       swap(array, i, pivotIndex);
       pivotIndex += 1;
     }
  }
  (span[midpoint], span[^1]) = (span[^1], span[midpoint]);
  return pivotIndex;
}</code></pre><p>Because C# spans are also zero-based, it's harder to have buffer overflow problems caused by formulae like <code>(low + high) / 2</code>. Now, the implementation is as fast as an unsafe implementation with raw pointers, but still extremely safe.</p><h2 id="new-zero-copy-operations-in-net-runtime">New zero-copy operations in .NET runtime</h2><p>I used a recursive example here to show how sub-portions of a larger data structure can be passed to another function, but spans can be used almost everywhere, and now .NET runtime supports zero-copy alternatives of popular functions too.</p><p>Take <code>String.Split</code> for example. You can now split a string without creating new copies of every split portion of the string. You can split a CSV line into its parts like this:</p><pre><code>string csvLine = // .. read CSV line
string[] parts = csvLine.Split(',');

foreach (string part in parts)
{
  Console.WriteLine(part);
}</code></pre><p>The problem with that is, now you're dealing with newly created 5 buffers with varying lengths. .NET allocates new memory for them, GC keeps track of them. It's slow, it hogs memory. It's problematic especially in loops, and can create GC pressure, slowing your app even more.</p><p>You can instead cast your CSV line into a <code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;char&gt;</code> and iterate over its components to write it to the output:</p><figure><pre><code>string csvLine = // .. read CSV line

var span = csvLine.AsSpan();
var parts = span.Split(',');
foreach (var range in parts)
{
  Console.Out.WriteLine(span[range]);
}</code></pre><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>Note that we use a small detour to use </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>Console.Out.WriteLine</span></code><span> instead of </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>Console.WriteLine</span></code><span> because </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>Console</span></code><span> class lacks an overload to output a </span><code spellcheck="false"><span>ReadOnlySpan&lt;char&gt;</span></code><span> like a string.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The great ROI of that experiment is making zero memory allocations after reading CSV line into memory. A similar logic that improves performance and memory efficiency can be applied everywhere that can receive a <code>Span&lt;T&gt;</code>/<code>ReadOnlySpan&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of an array.</p><h2 id="embrace-the-future">Embrace the future</h2><p>Spans and slice-like structures in are the future of safe memory operations in modern programming languages. Embrace them. The quick takeaways are: </p><ul><li>Use spans over arrays in your function declarations unless you explicitly require a standalone array in your function for some reason. Such a change opens your API into zero-copy optimization scenarios, and calling code will be more expressive.</li><li>Don't bother with unsafe/pointers if you can code the same logic with spans. You can still perform low-level memory operations without wandering into the dangerous parts of the forest. Your code will still be fast, and yet safer.</li></ul><p>Use spans, wherever possible, mostly readonly.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Video</span> Google has confirmed it will merge its ChromeOS and Android operating systems, and that the mobile OS will emerge triumphant.</p>
<p>The ads and search giant has <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/16/android_replacing_chromeos/">hinted</a> that the two operating systems would merge. On Wednesday at Qualcomm’s Summit event, Google’s president for the Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, made it official. Android will be the winner and users will see the results in 2026.</p>
<p>"I think the opportunity for us that we see is how do we accelerate all the AI advancement that we're doing on Android and bring that to the laptop form factor as rapidly as possible, and also have the laptop and the rest of the Android ecosystem work seamlessly together?" he said on Wednesday.</p>

</p>

        


        

<p>"Basically, we're taking the Chrome OS experience, and we're re-baselining the technology underneath it on Android, so that combination is something we're super excited about for next year."</p>

</ul>
<p>Chromebooks have helped Google to carve a niche in the laptop market, mostly with low-cost devices <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/05/canalys_reports_revitalization_of_chromebook/">sold to schools</a> for use by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/08/4_in_5_chromebooks_sold_to_us_students/">students</a>. The search behemoth also created <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2013/02/21/google_chromebook_pixel/">expensive and powerful</a> Chromebooks.</p>
<p>But with Google – along with everyone else in tech sphere – <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/20/google_high_on_ai_flogs/">adding AI</a> to everything, it's Android's time to shine, he said.</p>
<p>Moving to the Android code base will mean Google can deploy its Gemini AI services on more devices, Samat said.</p>

        

<p>To buttress his argument that Android can work on laptops, Samat pointed to the OS being "super successful" on tablet computers.</p>
<p>Qualcomm’s role in Google’s new strategy appears to be adapting its smartphone SoCs for laptops, or ensuring the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/qualcomm_details_x2_elite/">laptop chips</a> it makes to run Windows can also handle Android.</p>
<p>Samat said that Android also offered opportunities for adding XR (virtual, augmented and other extended-reality systems) to be built into a wide variety of platforms. Android would enable this, he argued.</p>

        

<p>But Samat said merging Google’s two OSes is mostly about AI. Like everything else this year. ®</p>

Meanwhile, the FDA allows levels 100x higher than what Europe considers safe.</p><p>This seemed like a solvable problem.</p><p>Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent testing of specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports meets Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid's snacks, whatever you're curious about.</p><p>Here's how it works: Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, get detailed lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn't reach its funding goal within 365 days, automatic refund. All results are published openly. Laboratory.love uses the same methodology as PlasticList.org, which found plastic chemicals in everything from prenatal vitamins to ice cream. But instead of researchers choosing what to test, you do.</p><p>The bigger picture: Companies respond to market pressure. Transparency creates that pressure. When consumers have data, supply chains get cleaner.</p><p>Technical details: Laboratory.love works with ISO 17025-accredited labs, test three samples from different production lots, detect chemicals down to parts per billion. The testing protocol is public.</p><p>So far a couple dozen products have received some funding, six products have been fully funded (five product results published, the sixth is at the lab as I write this!)</p><p>You can browse products, add your own, or just follow specific items you're curious about: <a href="https://laboratory.love/" rel="nofollow">https://laboratory.love</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45420519"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45420519" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45420519&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm working on a system that helps surgeons make precise bone cuts during knee replacement surgery.  Believe it or not, manual cuts are still the standard in that type of procedure.  Robotic systems exist but they are very costly, big, and actually add time to the surgery (bad news when you are under anesthesia and your leg is in a tourniquet).</p><p>It uses 4k stereoscopic capture and bunch of ML models to match bone position with sub-millimeter precision.  The surgeon screws a metal base piece into the bone, and we detect where that is in space.  Then, a Stewart Platform adjusts another part that is placed onto the base.  The robotic adjustment allows the base to be placed in a ballpark area, with the robotically-adjusted piece oriented in the exact spot where the surgeon needs to cut.</p><p>The net result is a robotic system that is many times cheaper than the least expensive incumbent, decreases surgery time significantly, reduces error, and basically "just works" as opposed to requiring a ton of training.  We are debuting at a tradeshow in October.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45420956"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45420956" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45420956&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics/circuits: <a href="https://circuitscript.net/" rel="nofollow">https://circuitscript.net/</a></p><p>Recently, I have released a simple IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript online: <a href="https://bench.circuitscript.net/" rel="nofollow">https://bench.circuitscript.net/</a></p><p>The next steps are to create more schematics with Circuitscript as examples to test the limitations of the language and to generate PCB designs with KiCAD. The Circuitscript tool (currently only the desktop cli tool) is able to generate KiCAD netlists and this can be imported into PCBnew.</p><p>The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.</p><p>The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse.</p><p>Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45419703"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45419703" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45419703&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Building an iOS app for metronome sequencing to get faster at playing guitar and reaching "shred" speeds at different subdivisions/time signatures in a single sequence. Planning on adding accuracy indicators and scoring so rushing or dragging can be easily identified when finishing a saved routine. I.e., some post-routine metrics.</p><p>I've been playing guitar for a little under 6 years and ran into the common problem among many intermediate guitarists fall into, which is stagnating into a plateau at a certain BPM.</p><p>The most effective solution I've found is to take the top speed hit playing a chunk of a lick and simply increase it 20-50 BPM past that limit, attempting one's best to stay in tempo. Regardless of how sloppy it sounds. Then roughly halve that increased addition of BPM, it will become relatively easier to play. For example, if you are stuck at 120 BPM, upping it to 150 BPM with sloppy attempts, then dropping it back down to 130-140 BPM.</p><p>I've gone cleanly from alternate picked 140 BPM triplets to 220 BPM triplets in two months after being stuck at 140 BPM for over a year with this method. Sometimes even hitting 280 BPM triplets when I have the focus and time for it.</p><p>Even then, I want a more consistent, and variable way of customizing a practice session using a metronome from a hobbyist perspective without using a DAW. With a simpler interface for doing so. As well as encourage with said method above for other guitarists in the pursuit of speed.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45419807"><td></td></tr><tr id="45419852"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45419852" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45419852&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>

But slowly I realize most of our data will be going through LLM's so Yggdrasil is evolving into a platform which consumes all your LLM queries, while keeping it easy to query and reference.</p><p>And now I have begun to realize how detrimental LLM assisted coding can be to someone who starts depending on it too much, so Yggdrasil is a bet in the other direction as compared to mainstream. Instead of agents/AI doing everything I believe human + ai assistance will win in the end.</p><p>Yggdrasil has a simple agent called Valkyrie, so they have their place, but that I believe should be the last step, after the developer has discussed and planned thoroughly through our tree interface, Heimdall.</p><p>And if someone replaces the dev, they can browse their conversations with the LLM, observe their mind map, what questions they asked, what extra things they considered (branches), the whole thought process easily navigable and visible.</p><p>Personally after using Yggdrasil, I feel quite confident in using the LLM, as I can ask all the silly questions I want, without worrying about context pollution. It aligns really well with the natural exploratory tangential thoughts we have when trying to find solutions or learn something.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45419314"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45419314" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45419314&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm pursuing my vision of "music-i18n": Open source music software that works for microtonal music and worldwide musical cultures.</p><p>It's not a from-scratch effort, quite the contrary: I'm trying to tie in existing music standards (MIDI, MusicXML, SMuFL, MEI, etc.) and ensure that FOSS systems (MuseScore, Verovio, smaller components) implement enough of those standards to support music-i18n.</p><p>Sometimes, this also includes extending the standards themselves when they are not fully capable of representing some non-mainstream musical aspect. For example, MusicXML lacks the ability of representing multiple accidentals per note (whereas MEI does), which is a must for microtonality.</p><p>I started down this path around 2018, as a music player who got interested in arranging Arabic songs in a "Real Book" style.

<div><p>Often, when I use generative AI to produce videos, the results are close to what I envision but rarely capture my imagination exactly. Prompting the AI to fix specific details can be a cumbersome and time-consuming process. To address this, I'm developing solutions that make the creative workflow more intuitive. So far, I’ve built an app that allows users to provide visual clues as guides, along with a 3D environment where the camera can be freely manipulated within the generated scene.</p><p>The community is moving fast though.

<div><p>I'm working on a partition-oriented declarative data build system. The inspiration comes from working with systems like Airflow and AWS step functions, where data orchestration is described explicitly, and the dependency relationships between input and produced data partitions is complex. Put simply, writing orchestration code for this case sucks - the goal of the project is to enable whole data platforms to be made up of jobs that declare their input and output partition deps, so that they can be automatically fulfilled, enabling kubernetes-like continuous reconciliation of desired partitions.</p><p>This means, instead of the answer to "how do we produce this output data" being "trigger and pray everything upstream is still working", we can answer with "the system was asked to produce this output data partition and its dependencies were automatically built for it". My hope is that this allows the interface with the system to instead be continuously telling it what partitions we want to exist, and letting it figure out the rest, instead of the byzantine DAGs that get built in airflow/etc.</p><p>This comes out of a big feeling that even more recent orchestrators like Prefect, Dagster, etc are still solving the wrong problem, and not internalizing the right complexity.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45420086"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45420086" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45420086&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>A kanji learning app using free dictionary data and the FSRS spaced repetition system for maximum context per card and optimal memory retention.</p><p><a href="https://shodoku.app/" rel="nofollow">https://shodoku.app/</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/runarberg/shodoku" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/runarberg/shodoku</a></p><p>My theory of learning is that you learn the characters better if you learn how to read and write them at the same time. And flash cards are better by giving you as much information as possible about the character.</p><p>This is fundamentally different from e.g. WaniKani which only teaches you how to read the character and relies on pre-made mnemonics (plus SRS) for easier retention, and from Anki which (normally) has very minimal flash cards, showing only small bits of information per card. When you have the whole dictionary on each card it gives you the opportunity to create the easiest connection with what you already know. This may be some made up story about the components (radicals) in the kanji (like WaniKani does) a word you already know, other kanji sharing the components, etc. The more connections you make the easier it is to learn them.</p><p>One of the features I personally use extensively is the ability to bookmark words containing the kanji, which will then pop up at the top of the words section in a later review. If I remember the meaning and the reading of the words I have bookmarked for this character during a reading review, I consider mark card as <i>good</i>. If I remember none of them I mark it “again”.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45420150"><td></td></tr><tr id="45419390"><td></td></tr><tr id="45419032"><td></td></tr><tr id="45419607"><td></td></tr><tr id="45419458"><td></td></tr><tr id="45419452"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45419452" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45419452&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45418675"></a></center></td><td><br>

				<p><strong>What you need to know:</strong> Governor Newsom today signed legislation further establishing California as a world leader in safe, secure, and trustworthy artificial intelligence, creating a new law that helps the state both boost innovation and protect public safety.</p>
			</div><div>
				
				
				
				
				<p><strong>SACRAMENTO — </strong>Governor Newsom today signed into law Senate Bill 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA), authored by Senator Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) – legislation carefully designed to enhance online safety by installing commonsense guardrails on the development of frontier artificial intelligence models, helping build public trust while also continuing to spur innovation in these new technologies. The new law builds on recommendations from <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/03/18/california-strengthens-its-position-as-the-global-ai-leader-with-new-working-report-issued-by-experts-and-academics/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/03/18/california-strengthens-its-position-as-the-global-ai-leader-with-new-working-report-issued-by-experts-and-academics/">California’s first-in-the-nation report</a>, called for by Governor Newsom and published earlier this year — and helps advance California’s position as a <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/18/californication-of-ai-golden-state-is-1-in-ai-and-the-birthplace-of-modern-tech-so-yeah-be-quiet-ted-cruz/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/18/californication-of-ai-golden-state-is-1-in-ai-and-the-birthplace-of-modern-tech-so-yeah-be-quiet-ted-cruz/">national leader in responsible and ethical AI</a>, the world’s fourth-largest economy, the birthplace of new technology, and the top pipeline for tech talent.</p>
			</div><div><h4>“California has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance. AI is the new frontier in innovation, and California is not only here for it – but stands strong as a national leader by enacting the first-in-the-nation frontier AI safety legislation that builds public trust as this emerging technology rapidly evolves.”</h4>
<p><strong>Governor Gavin Newsom</strong></p></div><div>
				
				
				
				
				<p>California works closely to foster tech leadership and create an environment where industry and talent thrive. The state is balancing its work to advance AI with commonsense laws to protect the public, embracing the technology to make our lives easier and make government more efficient, effective, and transparent. California’s leadership in the AI industry is helping to guide the world in the responsible implementation and use of this emerging technology.&nbsp;</p>
			</div><div><h4>“With a technology as transformative as AI, we have a responsibility to support that innovation while putting in place commonsense guardrails to understand and reduce risk. With this law, California is stepping up, once again, as a global leader on both technology innovation and safety. I’m grateful to the Governor for his leadership in convening the Joint California AI Policy Working Group, working with us to refine the legislation, and now signing it into law. His Administration’s partnership helped this groundbreaking legislation promote innovation and establish guardrails for trust, fairness, and accountability in the most remarkable new technology in many years.”</h4>
<p><strong>Senator Scott Wiener</strong></p></div><div>
				
				
				
				
				<p>Earlier this year, a group of world-leading AI academics and experts — <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-advance-safe-and-responsible-ai-protect-californians/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2024/09/29/governor-newsom-announces-new-initiatives-to-advance-safe-and-responsible-ai-protect-californians/">convened at the request of Governor Newsom</a> — released a <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/03/18/california-strengthens-its-position-as-the-global-ai-leader-with-new-working-report-issued-by-experts-and-academics/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/03/18/california-strengthens-its-position-as-the-global-ai-leader-with-new-working-report-issued-by-experts-and-academics/">first-in-the-nation report </a>on sensible AI guardrails, based on an empirical, science-based analysis of the capabilities and attendant risks of frontier models. The report included recommendations on ensuring evidence-based policymaking, balancing the need for transparency with considerations such as security risks, and determining the appropriate level of regulation in this fast-evolving field. SB 53 is responsive to the recommendations in the report — and will help ensure California’s position as an AI leader. This legislation is particularly important given the failure of the federal government to enact comprehensive, sensible AI policy. SB 53 fills this gap and presents a model for the nation to follow.</p>
			</div><div><h4>“Last year Governor Newsom called upon us to study how California should properly approach frontier artificial intelligence development. The Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA) moves us towards the transparency and ‘trust but verify’ policy principles outlined in our report.&nbsp; As artificial intelligence continues its long journey of development, more frontier breakthroughs will occur. AI policy should continue emphasizing thoughtful scientific review and keeping America at the forefront of technology.”</h4>

<p><strong>Jennifer Tour Chayes</strong><br>Dean of the College of Computing, Data Science, and Society at UC Berkeley</p></div><div><h2><strong>California’s AI dominance&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>California continues to dominate the AI sector. In addition to being the birthplace of AI, the state is home to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/ai50/">32 of the 50 top AI companies</a> worldwide. California leads U.S. demand for AI talent. In 2024, 15.7% of all U.S. AI job postings were in California — #1 by state, well ahead of Texas (8.8% and New York (5.8%), per the 2025 Stanford AI Index. In 2024, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/as-sf-bay-area-eats-up-52-of-all-ai-and-ml-vc-dollars-foreign-vcs-warn-of-waste" data-cke-saved-href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/as-sf-bay-area-eats-up-52-of-all-ai-and-ml-vc-dollars-foreign-vcs-warn-of-waste">more than half</a> of global VC funding for AI and machine learning startups went to companies in the Bay Area. California is also home to three of the four companies that have passed the $3 trillion valuation mark. Each of these California-based companies — Google, Apple, and Nvidia — are tech companies involved in AI and have created hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p>
<h2>What the law does:</h2>
<p>SB 53 establishes new requirements for frontier AI developers creating stronger:</p>
<p><strong>✅ Transparency: </strong>Requires large frontier developers to publicly publish a framework on its website describing how the company has incorporated national standards, international standards, and industry-consensus best practices into its frontier AI framework.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Innovation: </strong>Establishes a new consortium within the Government Operations Agency to develop a framework for creating a public computing cluster. The consortium, called CalCompute, will advance the development and deployment of artificial intelligence that is safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable by fostering research and innovation.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Safety: </strong>Creates a new mechanism for frontier AI companies and the public to report potential critical safety incidents to California’s Office of Emergency Services.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Accountability: </strong>Protects whistleblowers who disclose significant health and safety risks posed by frontier models, and creates a civil penalty for noncompliance, enforceable by the Attorney General’s office.</p>
<p><strong>✅ Responsiveness:</strong> Directs the California Department of Technology to annually recommend appropriate updates to the law based on multistakeholder input, technological developments, and international standards.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content-blocks"><p><span><span>At forty-seven, Kurt Vonnegut published&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></span></span><span><span>. He had been a struggling writer, a car salesman, a PR man at General Electric, and a failed playwright. He had seen war firsthand, lived through firebombs, raised six children (four of them adopted after his sister's death), and produced a shelf of novels that garnered little attention. Then suddenly, almost accidentally, he became one of the most important American voices of the twentieth century. When people recall Vonnegut now, they picture the wry, cigarette-smoking humanist, the man who wrote about time travel and Dresden and the strange species of Tralfamadorians. But in 1969, when&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;came out, he was not young, not new, and certainly not destined to succeed. He was forty-seven.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Why does this matter? Because we live in a culture obsessed with precocity. We valorize the twenty-two-year-old founder, the thirty-year-old Nobel laureate, the poet who dies before publishing her second book. To be forty-seven in America often feels like you are past your prime, coasting toward irrelevance. And yet Vonnegut’s story punctures this narrative. It raises the uncomfortable, thrilling question: how much can be done late, when everyone thinks the window has closed?</span></span></p><p><span><span>American culture has always been suspicious of age. Fitzgerald made it clear in&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>This Side of Paradise</em></span></span><span><span> - the whole point was to capture the fleeting brilliance of youth before it calcified into routine. The Beats chased a similar myth, a reckless vitality that had to burn out quickly. Silicon Valley today has its own catechism: Zuckerberg’s infamous line, “Young people are just smarter.” It’s the same fetish, rebranded.</span></span></p><p><span><span>But history doesn’t quite bear this out. Galileo was in his forties when he published his most radical works. Thomas Paine was forty when&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Common Sense</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;reshaped political thought. Susan B. Anthony was fifty-two when she cast her first illegal vote. The assumption that genius peaks young has always been a convenient myth. It flatters the ambitious and terrifies the hesitant. It also blinds us to the fact that many of history’s breakthroughs came from people who had been around long enough to see patterns others missed.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Vonnegut is a particularly vivid example because he had already failed. He had written science fiction for pulp magazines, novels like&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Player Piano</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>The Sirens of Titan</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;that earned him modest attention but little money. He was not a wunderkind. He was a midlist author, typing away between family obligations and day jobs. By the logic of our culture, he should have given up. Instead, he wrote the book that only someone with his scars, his age, and his accumulated oddities could have produced.</span></span></p><p><span><span>There is dignity in failure, especially prolonged failure. Consider Melville: forgotten after&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Moby-Dick</em></span></span><span><span>, reduced to writing insurance reports, rediscovered decades later. Or Emily Dickinson, who failed in the most invisible way: unread in her lifetime, her poems quietly fermenting in a drawer. Vonnegut’s failures were of a different sort - his books did get published, but with disappointing results. He was a writer who could fill a shelf in a used bookstore, gathering dust beside more fashionable authors. But that experience mattered.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;is not a young man’s book. Its humor is laced with bitterness, its form is fractured by time, and its philosophy is resigned rather than triumphant. Only someone who had seen things fall apart (repeatedly) could have written it.</span></span></p><p><span><span>And maybe this is why age can produce greatness. Youth thrives on conviction; age is forced into complexity. Vonnegut could not tell a clean story about Dresden. He knew memory was fractured, that trauma distorted time, that irony was the only language left. His narrative jumps back and forth through decades, between planets and battlefields; because that was the only way to be honest.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Middle age is rarely glamorous. Dante placed himself “midway in our life’s journey” in the dark wood, lost and confused. The Greeks had their crises too - Solon supposedly argued that you could not call a man happy until he died, because only the full arc could reveal whether fortune had spared him. At forty-seven, Vonnegut was in that territory. He had no assurance his career would matter. His books were not chart-toppers. He was supporting a sprawling family on uneven income. He had lived enough to know the absurdities of both war and corporate America. Out of that stew came&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>This matters; because middle age is often treated as decline, the moment when one’s creativity has been used up. Neuroscience papers are circulated to show how fluid intelligence peaks in your twenties, how mathematicians do their best work before thirty-five. But there is another kind of intelligence: crystallized, layered, associative. The ability to see connections across disciplines, to synthesize long experience into something new. Vonnegut’s novel is precisely that kind of synthesis: war memoir, science fiction, satire, elegy.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Vonnegut’s war had always haunted him. As a young soldier, he was captured in the Battle of the Bulge, held in Dresden, and survived the firebombing by hiding in a slaughterhouse basement. It took him decades to turn this into art.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Some traumas resist immediate rendering.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Primo Levi needed years before&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>If This Is a Man</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;could be written. Pat Barker’s&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Regeneration</em></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;trilogy required the hindsight of the 1990s to reimagine the First World War. Vonnegut’s forty-seven-year-old self could finally write what his twenty-five-year-old self could only (and barely) endure.</span></span></p><p><span><span><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></span></span><span><span> is not cathartic. It does not end with redemption. The famous refrain - “So it goes” - is less about acceptance or closure, than about repetition, about the endless cycle of death. The book offers no comfort, but it does offer recognition.</span></span></p><p><span><span>That recognition is the work of age.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Life, all this living, all this striving is a long apprenticeship that cannot be compressed. Some writers learn style and voice quickly; others take decades. Henry James distinguished between the “young genius” and the “late bloomer,” but suggested both paths were legitimate.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Vonnegut’s early books were uneven, witty but scattered. He had not yet found the tone that made him distinctive. By the time he reached&nbsp;</span></span><span><em><span>Slaughterhouse-Five</span></em></span><span><span>, he had rehearsed irony, satire, science fiction tropes, and autobiographical fragments enough times to finally bring them together. Forty-seven was not late; it was right on time.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Chartres was not built in a decade. The Parthenon was rebuilt multiple times. Sometimes greatness takes patience, not precocity.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Why does our culture cling to the idea that if you haven’t made it by thirty, you won’t? Part of it is economic: industries want to exploit youthful energy at low wages. Part of it is romantic: the myth of the prodigy is more cinematic than the tale of the slow grinder. But part of it may also be anxiety about mortality. To celebrate the late bloomer is to admit that our lives can change radically past middle age, which is destabilizing. If anything can happen at forty-seven, then perhaps we cannot measure ourselves against arbitrary deadlines.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Vonnegut mocked all deadlines. He wrote about time as non-linear, about events existing simultaneously. In&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em></span></span><span><span>, Billy Pilgrim comes “unstuck in time.” That phrase could apply to Vonnegut himself: his career looked like a sequence of failures until it suddenly wasn’t.</span></span></p><p><span><span>We are all unstuck in time.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Our successes and failures do not unfold in neat order.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sometimes they arrive decades late.</span></span></p><p><span><span><strong>Remember: </strong></span></span><span><span>Kurt Vonnegut was forty-seven when he wrote his masterpiece. And this fact should unsettle us! It should challenge the myth that our best years are always early. It should remind us that the middle of life can be fertile, that failure can ripen into art, that age can distill experience into something no youth could mimic. To be forty-seven is not to be finished. It may, for some, be the very beginning.</span></span></p></div><p><span><span>Where </span></span><span><span><strong>Builders</strong></span></span><span><span> Come to </span></span><span><span><strong>Think</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Every so often, we find ourselves in the middle of a massive technological wave that starts to upend our presumptions and our ideas about the past, present, and future. These waves come with excess—optimism, excitement, hype, and speculation. Since non-believers don’t invent the future and speculators are always on a hustle, I often turn to practitioners to get a fix on the coordinates of reality. It has always helped me maintain a sense of pragmatic optimism when the rest of the world around me seems either overtly hyperbolic or depressingly pessimistic.</p>



<p>We are in the middle of another massive technological wave, thanks to generative artificial intelligence and its offshoot, robotics. A tanker load of money is being poured into these two areas, and it has come with increasingly breathless promotional activity. It warrants a reality check. For that, I turned to Rodney Brooks, who has spent decades in both arenas. The Australian-born Brooks was a Professor of Robotics at MIT and former director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He has founded three companies: iRobot (maker of the Roomba), Rethink Robotics, and now&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://robust.ai/">Robust.AI</a>, which now builds warehouse automation robots. He is an academic who entered the startup arena and hasn’t left it since.</p>



<p>We recently connected for a conversation about robotics, artificial intelligence, and the future. Contrary to many, he believes humans will do just fine in a world filled with robots and AI. He poured cold water on the humanoid robot hype. He also said that if you look at the computer and internet revolutions, the AI revolution is going to take a lot longer than most think. “There’s a tendency to go for the flashy demo. But the flashy demo doesn’t deal with the real environment. It’s going to have to operate in—the messy reality. That’s why it takes so long for these technologies,” he said. He painted a more pragmatic yet optimistic vision ahead. He warned that humanoid hype is creating a lot of false expectations. Excerpts from our conversation.</p>

<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;You have a rare quality as a science person to write about tech in an understandable fashion. I think it’s always helpful to think beyond the tech directly and consider what the consequences are. When I hear people talk about AGI taking over, I point out that we have already become machine-idiots. We just follow the machine blindly.</p>



<p>You wrote something about Waymo recently, where you said there is not really full self-driving because there is human intervention. I would argue it’s not even the best human intervention. Waymo dropped me off at a completely different location, even though on the map it showed the right location.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;At MIT, I taught big classes with lots of students, so maybe that helped. I came here in an Uber this morning and asked the guy what street we were on. He had no clue. He said, “I just follow it.” (‘It’ being the GPS—Ed.) And that’s the issue—there’s human intervention, but people can’t figure out how to help when things go wrong.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;We are now&nbsp;<em>Machine Idiots</em>. So what are you working on now?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;My new company is putting smart carts in fulfillment warehouses. It doesn’t sound like much, but in fulfillment, many people work picking orders and shipping them out. There are enormous warehouses everywhere full of human workers because human hands are just so much better than anything else. They’re picking, putting orders in totes in these carts, and pushing the carts around.</p>



<p>We’ve got this cart called Carta that has cameras. It knows where it is, goes to the right place, and helps people figure out where the item they want is. It doesn’t do the grasping—people do the picking.</p>



<p>The big thing we do is reduce the amount of walking people have to do. In these warehouses, a typical number of steps per day for a person is 30,000. Now we all know what 10,000 steps feels like (it’s about 5 miles), so imagine doing 30,000 steps a day. It’s really hard on people’s bodies.</p>



<p>When they finish a pick-tour, instead of walking back and pushing a heavy cart 400 feet, they just say ‘done,’ and the robot goes off and takes the items to the correct location. We have&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance">affordances</a>&nbsp;on the cart that lower the cognitive load. (Affordance is an action humans can easily perceive—Ed.)</p>



<p>In comparison, the state of the art is that people have scan guns, and on their wrists are tiny screens with character-based software—it’s ’80s or ’90s technology emulated on an Android device. They have to read that to know what bin number, what thing to do.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;How does this company relate to all the companies you’ve started?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;My companies have always been about letting the person still have control. The previous one, Rethink Robotics, involved people showing the robot what to do. The Roomba had a handle; if it got stuck, you could pick it up and move it. If a human grabs the Carta cart, they’re now in charge. If you grab its magic handlebar, you are like Superman—you move your hand a little, and it amplifies what you’re doing. We make the floor worker take control and put it in the right place without much physical effort.</p>



<p>The cart knows a ladder and knows not to go near ladders because a person is up there—if it hit one, it would be disastrous. If it’s going down an aisle and there’s a person there, it’s polite, waits for the person to move, tries to go around them. But if a pallet is blocking the aisle, it recognizes that it’s not going to move by itself. There’s no point waiting. It turns around and tells the central system that this aisle is blocked. It’s simple intelligence, which is what we can do today and make reliable. It’s not sexy. It’s technology in the service of making things easier for workers and more efficient.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;You’re building a product which is simpler, unsexy, but when I think about the Roomba and all the companies you’ve done in the past, they have always made things very futuristic—like some robot is cleaning my house. Whereas now we’re in the phase of automation where we almost take robots for granted as humans, even though you’re solving problems like those robots inside Amazon’s warehouse.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Amazon has automated and manual warehouses. We’re trying to put technology in the manual warehouses, whether it’s DHL—our biggest customer—or Amazon. It’s about putting robots in places where there are no robots. And it’s not saying it’s a humanoid that’s going to do everything.</p>



<p>You’re right, it’s not sexy. And you know what that means for me? It’s hard to raise money. “Why aren’t you doing something sexy?” the VCs ask. But this is a $4 trillion market that will be there for decades.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;It’s much easier to fund the promise than a real business, because real businesses have limitations on how fast they can grow. Whereas if you don’t know, you can live (and fund) the dream. There’s nothing wrong with living the dream—that’s how you get to fund crazy things in this industry. But people doing more rational things do pay the price.</p>



<p>You’ve been in robotics for a long time. There are misconceptions about robots and robotics. The biggest fallacy is that we think of them in human form. Ten years later, that idea of a humanoid has become so pervasive. We don’t think about things that do robotic tasks, like ad systems that serve ads constantly—they are also robots.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;The robots—they’re not embodied. I always say about a physical robot, the physical appearance makes a promise about what it can do. The Roomba was this little disc on the floor. It didn’t promise much—you saw it and thought, that’s not going to clean the windows. But you can imagine it cleaning the floor. But the human form sort of promises it can do anything a human can. And that’s why it’s so attractive to people—it’s selling a promise that is amazing.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;What do you think about the current state of robotics in the US versus how people are funding robots and thinking about them?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;There’s good news and bad news. The amount of processing power we have now is amazing—amounts of computation and small sensors largely driven by the phone market.</p>



<p>With my company, the motors we use are hub motors from electric scooters because they are made in the millions. They’re cheap and much better than the motors you could buy 10 years ago at a much lower price. So instead of building custom motors, we ride that curve.</p>



<p>Likewise with GPUs—I think Nvidia is the luckiest company in the world. They were building graphics processing units and they turned out to be able to do the computation of neural networks. The GPUs are great for the vision computations you need to localize, to know where you are—SLAM, simultaneous localization and mapping.</p>



<p>You can do so much more computation, sensing, some actuation, but people underestimate the long tail of the natural environment. That’s what we see with autonomous vehicles. I first attended a talk on autonomous vehicles in 1979 in Tokyo. By 1990, Ernst Dickmanns in Germany had his truck driving on the Autobahn at 100 kilometers an hour. He took it to Paris, and an autonomous vehicle drove around Paris in 1990. Then in 2007, 2008, people saw the DARPA autonomous vehicle and said, “Oh, it’s going to be everywhere instantly.” But it’s taken almost 20 years, and it’s still only in little tiny geographical areas because of the long tail of all the things that can happen.</p>



<p>There’s a tendency to go for the flashy demo, but the flashy demo doesn’t deal with the real environment. It’s going to have to operate in the messy reality. That’s why it takes so long for these technologies.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;Like Waymo—they still require human intervention.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;That’s why I’m skeptical of the Tesla taxi system. At the last earnings call, Elon said they’re going to have safety drivers in the Teslas and they’re hiring remote drivers. It’s sort of a charade.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;There is a habit in our modern society to forget how long it takes for something to actually find its true form, like PCs. I remember using MS-DOS, then eventually where we are today where we don’t even think about what the PC looks like. The same with smartphones—I used the earliest examples from Nokia and Palm and then eventually seeing where we are today. There is a way to minimize the effort needed for technology to find its perfect form, but that’s going to be a challenge for self-driving as well.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;It’ll take a long time for adoption.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;You did early work on mapping and (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) SLAM about 40 years ago. When you were thinking about that future, how were you thinking about it?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;The SLAM paper was released in 1985. I was working on mobile robots, and Waymos are mobile robots. It never occurred to me that there would be, in my lifetime, the level of Waymos we have, even though it’s not where people think it is. I was just wanting to get mobile robots that could move around and do things in the world, and they had to know where they were and how to get somewhere. That was the problem I was solving—just the next few steps.</p>



<p>Around the same time, I wrote some whimsical things about home cleaning robots, mixing nanotechnology with robotics. I talked about lots of little robots living on your floor, picking up stuff and putting it in a pile for the big robot to come and suck up the dirt—societies of robots around us, which was a science fiction thing that has not happened.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;What was the genesis of your fascination with robots?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I grew up in a working-class environment. My parents didn’t come close to finishing high school. Somehow I just won the genetic lottery. I was born in the ’50s, a white male in an English-speaking country, which turned out to be really important. But on top of that, I had mathematical ability that was so obvious that by the time I was four, my parents referred to me as “the professor.”</p>



<p>My parents found these How and Why Wonder books—one on electricity and one on computers and giant brains. The publication date is 1961. I probably got them when I was seven. I read these books, learned how to make circuits out of stuff I had—wires, nails, batteries, flashlight bulbs. The computers had pictures of imagined robots and explained binary systems, so I learned how to build circuits and then saw how to build little bits of computation. I was always trying to build computers for the rest of my childhood because there were no computers available. I tried building robotic devices but wasn’t really good at mechanisms, so I really wanted to build robots.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;Where did you grow up?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Adelaide, South Australia.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;Still a fan of cricket?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Here’s my superpower. When I was eight years old, Ian and Greg Chappell coached me when I was a child. It did me zero good—I was so bad. But as far as all my countrymen are concerned, they think I am the luckiest guy on the planet. (The Chappell brothers – Ian and Greg are legends of the game of cricket, much like the baseball legends, the DiMaggio brothers.)</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;When you look at that SLAM paper you wrote, what has been the big lesson of turning something on paper into reality?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;All these things require so much more engineering than some initial idea. My initial idea was loop closing, which is critical to SLAM. But my version of merging observations probabilistically was actually quite terrible. In 1985, someone else who read the paper published a paper a year later to improve on that part. Then other people started to see little pieces—”Oh, I can improve here, I can improve there.” During the ’90s, there were hundreds of papers every year coming out on SLAM. It was a hot topic, and people realized it was going to be important for getting moving robots into environments.</p>



<p>Even now, it’s only in the last five years that we’ve been able to do it with computer vision because we didn’t have enough computational power. Up until recently, it was all LIDAR-based. So technologies wait for other technologies to come along. The computer vision wasn’t driven by that, but then it got good enough to do it. Some things might be a good idea, and you can see how it could work, but it may require so many side technologies that you haven’t worked through all the details to make it practical. That could be a long time.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;Knowing what you know, do you think we need to be rethinking how we approach innovation, education, and our perspective on the world? Forty years may have worked in the pre-network era, but now we live in a post-network world with new intensity and rhythm.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney</strong>: There’s a new rhythm, and what I fear is that everyone jumps into new orthodoxies. For a few years now, people have been saying if you’re not working on neural net-based AI, you’re in the past, you’re a dinosaur. I guarantee there will be things that people have been working on for years that will become important and they’re not neural-based.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;You have very strong opinions about generative AI. When I talk to young people, I wonder if we have an entire society trained on an answer-based value metric—we read a book, get an answer, take an exam, give an answer. Whereas generative AI means we’re more question-oriented going forward. The ability to ask the right questions is going to separate us from being really good versus just average. You have to be someone special to be able to ask questions in philosophy and art and robotics and AI. Not everybody can connect the dots. So maybe there’s a whole new class of educational approaches that need to emerge.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I think we need multiple education approaches and not put everything in the same bucket. I see this in Australia—”What’s your bachelor’s degree?” “I’m doing a bachelor’s degree in tourism management.” That’s not an intellectual pursuit, that’s job training, and we should make that distinction. The German system has had this for a long time—job training being a very big part of their education, but it’s not the same as their elite universities.</p>



<p>[ Brooks is right in pointing out that we are busy propping up an education system that creates work for an industrial and industrial-version of digital economies. Germans (and many other parts of the world) have this idea of diplomas in specialized trade skills, which is exactly how we are going to be thinking about in the future, because the idea of work, augmented by digitized automation, both robotic and software, will need to evolve. As such, we need to really rethink the entire map of employment and fine-tune “collegial output” in terms of jobs needed to be done in tandem with the emergence of rapid computerized automation. The United States is still trying to use the same template of education that it has for decades. –OM ]</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;In India too, we had diplomas which were very targeted—if you wanted to work in a power station, you got a diploma.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Australia too, diplomas for teaching primary school, which is honorable. But it’s not necessarily—although I wish, looking back at the history teaching I got, it didn’t teach me about the world because it was just regurgitating “this happened, that happened,” instead of why it happened, what were the intellectual ideas driving it.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;I struggled in college because I was always the one asking, “Why are we doing this experiment? What is the outcome? Why are we looking for this outcome?” We already know the answer—some scientist discovered it—but no one explains why we’re repeating it and what we gain from it as students.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I remember undergraduates working in my lab at MIT. One guy who ended up being a professor would be doing stuff and then say, “That’s why they taught me that thing in that class, now I see what”—because the classes, even at MIT, didn’t necessarily connect why this question is interesting, why it’s important. Then through the practice of trying to build real things, “Oh, that’s what I needed to know.”</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;I think of being a journalist as the best education I ever got, especially writing about tech, because I learned about microcontrollers, embedded operating systems, networks, switches, and compute. I also learned about the impact of all these technologies on real people and the real world. There’s no way any college could have taught me that. In this world, I was happier than in school because in school, I wasn’t able to connect the dots. In the real world, the dots were connecting in my brain.</p>



<p>I look at why I’m okay with all the generative AI stuff that has come to market—I know the right questions to ask. I know how to talk to ChatGPT. I’ve grown up interviewing people, so I know when the response is nonsense.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Generative AI challenges us intellectually. John Searle at Berkeley talked about the Chinese Room argument. (<em>It says that no matter how smart a computer seems, it can’t have human consciousness.–Ed</em>) Well, the Chinese Room showed up. I recently gave an example. I used Google to give me a Chinese output for: “Who is Ai Weiwei?”</p>



<p>I cut and pasted those Chinese characters into ChatGPT, and it gave a biography of him. So there’s the Chinese room—I feed in symbols in Chinese and it feeds me back symbols in Chinese. Searle was saying the Chinese room is absurd because they could never understand Chinese just by symbol matching. And here it did it. So there’s a challenge to what it means to understand language.</p>



<p>There are these rules of language, and the only reason we can understand language is because of biological structures in our brain attuned to language. Here’s generative AI—did it have the universal grammar machine in it, yet it’s so adept at language. So that’s another challenge.</p>



<p>Generative AI challenges long-held notions of how things work. In the worst case, it says we’re not as smart as we think we are because this dumb thing can do what we do. We always have a view of ourselves as people being special. I remember when the human genome was decoded and we had fewer genes than a potato—people were outraged.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;More is more, right? More must be better.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Through the history of mankind—the world is the center of the universe, the sun goes around it, God is up there looking at us. Then we discover other planets, other solar systems, other galaxies, and we’re one of billions of billions of planets. But we’re special! It gets people upset. I was at the World Economic Forum on stage talking about AI and being provocative. Yehudi Menuhin was in the audience and stood up and yelled at me for devaluing humans by talking about machine intelligence.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;If you stop thinking about generative AI as this road to AGI and think of it as simply a way to interact with information—</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;That’s what I do take it as. If you’d explained it to me 15 years ago, I would have said, “There’s no way that can work.” So it’s a surprise that it works, but it is an encoding of information.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;What are you thinking about the future right now? How should we contextualize artificial intelligence and robotics? Do you want my really crazy stuff?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;If I look at history and history of ideas, we often get sucked in by the wrong idea. One of my examples is Sir Isaac Newton. Really smart dude—he invented calculus, figured out gravity and movement of bodies in 3D, did optics, split light into multiple colors. But he spent over half his life working on alchemy, trying to convert lead to gold. Really smart guy. Why did he do that? He thought, as everyone did, that it was chemical. They had primitive chemistry. He didn’t know about nuclear—the nucleus is what you have to deal with to convert lead to gold. Everyone thought it was the same kind of thing they were used to, burning stuff and mixing stuff. He had the wrong underlying model.</p>



<p>When Elon Musk decided he wanted to put stuff into orbit, he didn’t say, “I’ll write a Python script, and that will get stuff into orbit.” He had to figure out how to burn fuel efficiently, worry about mass, liquid flows, high temperatures, because you can write as big a program as you want, it’s not going to get stuff into orbit. Computation is not the stuff you need to physically move things.</p>



<p>Somehow, we’ve decided that computation is what happens in our brain. Is it really computation? And why is that?</p>



<p>Between 1945 and 1965, there were four disciplines that were of focus. You have this two-by-two chart of science, and engineering. And you have life and intelligence.</p>



<p>Over here we have neuroscience. Here we have AI. Here we have artificial life. And here we have abiogenesis—turning abiotic into biotic. These four modern computational disciplines all came into being 1945 to 1965. If you look at any two of them, I can show you someone who worked in those two fields. For any three of them, mostly I can find someone who worked in all three fields—von Neumann, McCulloch, a whole bunch of people.</p>



<p>Any of the four have taken computation as their primary metaphor. Abiogenesis is still chemical, not computational. But why are any of these computational? Is that the right stuff?</p>



<p>Or are we trying to build a rocket by writing a program, which is doomed to failure? In the same way, Newton was doomed to failure with alchemy because it’s not chemical—it’s nuclear, and no one knew about the nucleus. So that’s my bigger picture. AGI could be 300 years away because we’re dealing in the wrong kind of stuff.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;I am trying to figure out what AGI is.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Building a machine which could do all the things we do with our brain. It may be something that we haven’t even thought about.</p>



<p>There’s this assumption of the infinite power of the human mind. I like to think about orcas. Orcas are really smart, really brutal, as we are. There’s great footage where they’re going after seals up on rocks, but they’ve got to sneak up on them in shallow water, so they roll over at 90 degrees so their dorsal fin doesn’t show above water. So they’re solving problems. They have some self-model.</p>



<p>But we never think they’re going to build a foundry and start smelting metal. We don’t think they’re smart enough, but we think we’re infinitely smart and we’ll solve all these problems with technology. Just like the orcas, we may have limits and we don’t like that.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;But humans do solve problems. And look how far we’ve come.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;We’ve come so far compared to orcas, but orcas can only come so far. Maybe there’s a natural limit for us.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;But what I was trying to say is that we have entered a new reality. The world existed pre-internet and post-internet. It was not creating digital data at the speed we generate now, so we need new tools to deal with this reality.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with you, but I think that’s the pedestrian part of our existence.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;I find it more exciting because it’s going to be more disruptive than this idea of AGI. We have all this money going into robots, humanoid robots, and other AI, but we don’t have manufacturing in this country. We don’t make anything. When I look at what China is doing with their EVs or their self-driving cars, they’re building new cities with roads that have sensors—essentially built for this new reality. I feel we are not thinking about the opportunities correctly because the Chinese have the end market for manufacturing. They are very good at manufacturing—that’s what they’ve been doing for the last 25 years.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I started manufacturing in China in the late ’90s. Just last week, my company put out a press release that Foxconn is going to build our robots at scale. They’re based in Taiwan, but it’s undeniable—if you want to do something at scale, that’s how you have to do it.</p>



<p>But let’s look ahead to this century. Fifty years from now, all the innovation is going to be happening in Nigeria. They’re going to be such a big part of the world population, and they’re going to have so many problems they have to deal with, and they will deal with them. Nigeria is going to be the center of the technological universe by the end of this century. (Just as China and its large population, and its need to solve its problems made it into an economic powerhouse, Brooks believes the sheer size of Nigeria is going to make it an economic and technological epicenter.–Ed)</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;How are we going to have all these companies build robots in the U.S.? What will be our manufacturing? What will be our place in this world? What do we think about the American future in manufacturing? Do we think about a post-capitalist future where scale is not what we think about? How does the world change?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Will manufacturing be driven by 3D printing? It’s not yet. We’re starting to use 3D printing for components of machines. Electron (a New Zealand company) that launches satellites from New Zealand—they 3D print their rocket motors. But they can afford to do that because it’s such a high-value thing. As 3D printing becomes more general, in the same way information technology and payment systems got adopted in the third world more quickly than in the US, 3D printing will become the engine of manufacturing.</p>



<p>Right now, the supply chain is the reason China is so effective. Chinese manufacturing companies realized they had to diversify and started building supply chains in places like Malaysia, Vietnam. But if 3D printing really gets to be effective, the supply chain becomes all about raw materials that get poured into the front of those 3D printers. It’ll be about certain chemicals, about raw materials, because then every item would ultimately be 3D printed. That completely breaks the dynamic of what made Chinese manufacturing so strong—the supply chain of components.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;But then that flies in the face of manufacturing jobs being the savior of any economy.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I was at a Brown University commencement giving a talk. And we were bemoaning the loss of US manufacturing. I asked the parents of the about to be Brown graduates—do who wants your kids to work in a factory? Oh no, not us! The poor people need the jobs, not my child. Who aspires that their kid is going to work at the sewage company? This bemoaning of manufacturing being lost is a little duplicitous—it’s not for us, it’s for the poor people.</p>



<p><strong>OM</strong>: Manufacturing jobs are like a political hot potato. Politicians love to talk about manufacturing jobs as it wins votes. If you believe in the robotic revolution and 3D printing, things are going to be very different 25 years from now. I recently saw a video of BYD’s new factory in China. It is supposed to be as big as the city of San Francisco and it will have only 40,000 people making cars. The rest are all BYD-made robots. That’s the future of manufacturing at scale. This is very counter to the idea of “manufacturing jobs” as politicians like to talk about it.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;That’s why I brought up 3D printing. There’ll be other technologies that come in, not just robotics. One of the most interesting things is applying AI to creating materials—you can make predictions about what material properties will be and you don’t have to laboriously make each material and test it. As materials change, there’s 3D printing, changes in materials, a whole bunch of things that can come together. My answer is I don’t know, but I know it’s going to be different.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;Before you go, how should we correctly think about robotics and AI. Right now there is a hype way of thinking about it, there is a negative way of thinking about it. What is the right way?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;The right way of thinking about it is that appearance alone is not everything. There are things that are incredibly hard for us to do with technology at the moment, which we just don’t know how to do. So many of the promises of the hype of robotics and AI gloss over things we don’t know how to do well. We do not know how to manipulate things with robot hands. Everyone is excited about a robot hand, and Chinese companies are making the same mistake, thinking that it’s dexterous.</p>



<p>But the way that we do stuff with our hands, we have no way of reproducing, nor should we think that hands should be five-fingered. When this first structure appeared in animals, it was the first creatures that crawled out of the ocean onto the land. They had five bones to make pads that could be pushed around. This is an accident of evolution. Maybe in the future, the dexterous things will look more like sea anemones, lots of tentacles filled with cilia and they just pour stuff in and it gets manipulated.</p>



<p>I think the correct thing is not to think about it as being a duplication of humans. It’s never a duplication of humans that is the optimal solution or the most cost-effective solution. So it will be different from humans.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;You’ve said something about quantum computing having an impact and materials and physics.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;The effective quantum computers for the next 10 years are going to be using quantum computers to simulate physical systems, not doing classical computation way better. That’s still a long way off. I used to make the joke, people would ask me, “When are we going to get quantum computers?” And I would say, “I don’t know, but I’m pretty sure they’re going to be fusion powered.” Now we’re starting to see a diversity of approaches to fusion. Never say never, but for the next few years quantum computers are going to be much more about simulating physical systems.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;If you were to describe yourself right now, would you describe yourself as an optimist about AI or maybe not so much?</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;I model myself as a realist. I’ve lived through so many hype cycles in AI. They weren’t as big in public as this one, but they were brutal amongst AI practitioners. The arguments were strong and deeply held—screaming matches would happen. I’ve seen that happen again and again. Neural is ascendant at the moment, but neural was ascendant four or five times before and then got crushed. Something else took over, came back.</p>



<p>You can see that in agentic AI. Now suddenly everyone’s got agent-based AI. They didn’t have it six months ago. I suspect it’s a little more marketing than reality. But when was the first paper on agentic AI published? It was in 1959 by Oliver Selfridge. There’s been agent-based systems—SOAR, there’s been lots. They come and go, all these ideas, and they get improved every time they come back. I’m not saying it’s stupid, I’m just saying as someone who’s been involved, it is not just the shiny new thing. This thing that looks shiny now may not be so shiny in a few years.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;But when I think about it, I feel that the amount of money being poured into this sector is going to have an impact. It’s going to push things along much faster.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;It’s going to have an impact and a lot of it will be wasted too.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;The networks were overbuilt and then that allowed a company like Google to come in and build out its own network and offer search so cheaply.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;There is an upside. Let me tell you my upside version—thinking of how to use all these data centers once the crash comes in training generative AI models. There will be so much competition in these data centers, just sitting there waiting to be used. I’m not going to use it to mine bitcoin, but smart people would be thinking beyond the crash of how to use—as you said, the networks were there, they were overbuilt, they were ready. So I think these data centers are getting overbuilt. They’ll be ready to be used for something new. If you can figure out how to do that, if some kid can figure out how to do that, they’re going to be working right now on it in obscurity and poverty and then boom.</p>



<p><strong>Om:</strong>&nbsp;It would have been fun to keep talking, but I know we’ve gone over our time.</p>



<p><strong>Rodney:</strong>&nbsp;Thank you for the conversation. It’s been stimulating to think through these ideas with someone who understands both the technical and broader implications.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<p center="">Don't Become a Scientist! 
</p><p center="">Jonathan I. Katz 
</p><p center="">Professor of Physics 
</p><p center="">Washington University, St. Louis, Mo. 
</p><p center="">[my last name]@wuphys.wustl.edu 
</p><p>Are you thinking of becoming a scientist? Do you want to uncover the 
mysteries of nature, perform experiments or carry out calculations to learn how 
the world works? Forget it! 
</p><p>Science is fun and exciting. The thrill of discovery is unique. If you are 
smart, ambitious and hard working you should major in science as an 
undergraduate. But that is as far as you should take it. After graduation, you 
will have to deal with the real world. That means that you should not even 
consider going to graduate school in science. Do something else instead: medical 
school, law school, computers or engineering, or something else which appeals to 
you. 
</p><p>Why am I (a tenured professor of physics) trying to discourage you from 
following a career path which was successful for me? Because times have changed 
(I received my Ph.D. in 1973, and tenure in 1976). American science no longer 
offers a reasonable career path. If you go to graduate school in science it is 
in the expectation of spending your working life doing scientific research, 
using your ingenuity and curiosity to solve important and interesting problems. 
You will almost certainly be disappointed, probably when it is too late to 
choose another career. 
</p><p>American universities train roughly twice as many Ph.D.s as there are jobs 
for them. When something, or someone, is a glut on the market, the price drops. 
In the case of Ph.D. scientists, the reduction in price takes the form of many 
years spent in ``holding pattern'' postdoctoral jobs. Permanent jobs don't pay 
much less than they used to, but instead of obtaining a real job two years after 
the Ph.D. (as was typical 25 years ago) most young scientists spend five, ten, 
or more years as postdocs. They have no prospect of permanent employment and 
often must obtain a new postdoctoral position and move every two years. For many 
more details consult the <a href="http://garp.univ-bpclermont.fr/guilde/emploi/ysn.html">Young Scientists' 
Network</a> or read the account in the May, 2001 issue of the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">Washington Monthly.</a> 
</p><p>As examples, consider two of the leading candidates for a recent Assistant 
Professorship in my department. One was 37, ten years out of graduate school (he 
didn't get the job). The leading candidate, whom everyone thinks is brilliant, 
was 35, seven years out of graduate school. Only then was he offered his first 
permanent job (that's not tenure, just the possibility of it six years later, 
and a step off the treadmill of looking for a new job every two years). The 
latest example is a 39 year old candidate for another Assistant Professorship; 
he has published 35 papers. In contrast, a doctor typically enters private 
practice at 29, a lawyer at 25 and makes partner at 31, and a computer scientist 
with a Ph.D. has a very good job at 27 (computer science and engineering are the 
few fields in which industrial demand makes it sensible to get a Ph.D.). Anyone 
with the intelligence, ambition and willingness to work hard to succeed in 
science can also succeed in any of these other professions. 
</p><p>Typical postdoctoral salaries begin at $27,000 annually in the biological 
sciences and about $35,000 in the physical sciences (graduate student stipends 
are less than half these figures). Can you support a family on that income? It 
suffices for a young couple in a small apartment, though I know of one physicist 
whose wife left him because she was tired of repeatedly moving with little 
prospect of settling down. When you are in your thirties you will need more: a 
house in a good school district and all the other necessities of ordinary middle 
class life. Science is a profession, not a religious vocation, and does not 
justify an oath of poverty or celibacy. 
</p><p>Of course, you don't go into science to get rich. So you choose not to go to 
medical or law school, even though a doctor or lawyer typically earns two to 
three times as much as a scientist (one lucky enough to have a good senior-level 
job). I made that choice too. I became a scientist in order to have the freedom 
to work on problems which interest me. But you probably won't get that freedom. 
As a postdoc you will work on someone else's ideas, and may be treated as a 
technician rather than as an independent collaborator. Eventually, you will 
probably be squeezed out of science entirely. You can get a fine job as a 
computer programmer, but why not do this at 22, rather than putting up with a 
decade of misery in the scientific job market first? The longer you spend in 
science the harder you will find it to leave, and the less attractive you will 
be to prospective employers in other fields. 
</p><p>Perhaps you are so talented that you can beat the postdoc trap; some 
university (there are hardly any industrial jobs in the physical sciences) will 
be so impressed with you that you will be hired into a tenure track position two 
years out of graduate school. Maybe. But the general cheapening of scientific 
labor means that even the most talented stay on the postdoctoral treadmill for a 
very long time; consider the job candidates described above. And many who appear 
to be very talented, with grades and recommendations to match, later find that 
the competition of research is more difficult, or at least different, and that 
they must struggle with the rest. 
</p><p>Suppose you do eventually obtain a permanent job, perhaps a tenured 
professorship. The struggle for a job is now replaced by a struggle for grant 
support, and again there is a glut of scientists. Now you spend your time 
writing proposals rather than doing research. Worse, because your proposals are 
judged by your competitors you cannot follow your curiosity, but must spend your 
effort and talents on anticipating and deflecting criticism rather than on 
solving the important scientific problems. They're not the same thing: you 
cannot put your past successes in a proposal, because they are finished work, 
and your new ideas, however original and clever, are still unproven. It is 
proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death for a proposal; because 
they have not yet been proved to work (after all, that is what you are proposing 
to do) they can be, and will be, rated poorly. Having achieved the promised 
land, you find that it is not what you wanted after all. 
</p><p>What can be done? The first thing for any young person (which means anyone 
who does not have a permanent job in science) to do is to pursue another career. 
This will spare you the misery of disappointed expectations. Young Americans 
have generally woken up to the bad prospects and absence of a reasonable middle 
class career path in science and are deserting it. If you haven't yet, then join 
them. Leave graduate school to people from India and China, for whom the 
prospects at home are even worse. I have known more people whose lives have been 
ruined by getting a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs. 
</p><p>If you are in a position of leadership in science then you should try to 
persuade the funding agencies to train fewer Ph.D.s. The glut of scientists is 
entirely the consequence of funding policies (almost all graduate education is 
paid for by federal grants). The funding agencies are bemoaning the scarcity of 
young people interested in science when they themselves caused this scarcity by 
destroying science as a career. They could reverse this situation by matching 
the number trained to the demand, but they refuse to do so, or even to discuss 
the problem seriously (for many years the NSF propagated a dishonest prediction 
of a coming shortage of scientists, and most funding agencies still act as if 
this were true). The result is that the best young people, who should go into 
science, sensibly refuse to do so, and the graduate schools are filled with weak 
American students and with foreigners lured by the American student visa. </p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        <p>Wait. Does k-means count as machine learning? Yes. Yes, it does.</p>

<p><a href="https://cs229.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">CS229</a> is the graduate-level machine learning course I took at Stanford as part of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/graduate-certificate-ai-achievement-unlocked-mark-cramer/" target="_blank">Graduate Certificate in AI</a> which I received back in 2021. While k-means is my choice as the easiest to understand algorithm in machine learning, it was taught as the introductory clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning. As a TA for <a href="https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs229-machine-learning" target="_blank">XCS229</a>, which I have been doing since 2022 and most recently did this Spring, I know that it is still being taught as part of this seminal course in AI.</p>

<h2 id="we-have-liftoff">We have liftoff!</h2>

<p>Unlike <a href="https://mdcramer.github.io/apple-2-blog/synthesizing-data/">previously</a> where I saved the result for the end, let’s start by taking a look at the algorithm in action!</p>

<p><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/Cy0wMMLObVA?autoplay=1" title="Video of Apple ]\[+ running k-means" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/Cy0wMMLObVA/0.jpg" alt="Video of Apple 2+ running k-means"></a></p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of the final decision boundary after convergence.</p>

<p><img src="https://mdcramer.github.io/assets/images/apple2/k-means-convergence.jpg" alt="K-means decision boundary after convergence" title="K-means decision boundary after convergence"></p>

<p>The final accuracy is 90% because 1 of the 10 observations is on the incorrect side of the decision boundary.</p>

<p>For debugging purposes, to speed up execution, I reduced the number of samples in each class to 5. (You might note that, on the graph, there are only 4 points in class 1, which are the □s. That’s because one of the points is at <code>(291, 90)</code>, which is off the edge of the screen. Gaussian distributions can generate extreme outliers, so I decided to preserve those points rather than clip them to the edge of the screen.) That’s obviously pretty small but you can see the algorithm iterating.</p>

<p>At the end of each loop I draw a line between the latest estimates of cluster centroids. The perpendicular bisector of these segments are the decision boundaries between the classes, so I draw them, too. Some of the code was written to handle more than two classes but here there are only two which makes this relatively easy.</p>

<h2 id="k-means-explained">K-means explained</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank">K-means clustering</a> is a recursive algorithm that aims to partition \(n\) observations into \(k\) clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, called the cluster centroid.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Step</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Initialize</td>
      <td>Produce and initial set of k cluster centroids. This can be done by randomly choosing k observations from the dataset.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Step 1 - Assignment</td>
      <td>Using Euclidean distance to the centroids, assign each observation to a cluster.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Step 2 - Update</td>
      <td>For each cluster, recompute the centroid using the newly assigned observations. If the centroids change (outside of a certain tolerance), go back to step 1 and repeat.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Ezpz.</p>

<p>The math is also simple. In step 1, the distance between two points, \(x\) and \(y\), is simply \(\sqrt{(x_0 - y_0)^2 + (x_1 - y_1)^2 + \cdots + (x_{d-1} - y_{d-1})^2}\), where \(d\) is the dimensionality of the observations. In our case \(d=2\) which is why we only have \(x_0\) and \(x_1\). Also, since we’re only using the distances for comparative purposes, it’s not even necessary to take the square root. In step 2, the centroid is simply the sum of all the points divided by the number of points.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>First, a little housekeeping before getting to the implementation of the algorithm.</p>

<p>At the very top of the program I decided to organize everything into subroutines. The idea here is to enable expansion into other ML algorithms.</p>

<p>The “wait for key” subroutine is the APPLESOFT BASIC method for simply waiting for any keystroke before continuing. (<code>PEEK</code> and <code>POKE</code> are commands for directly accessing addresses in memory. I had those numbers memorized in high school but, naturally, I had to look them up.) I thought it’d be nice to add this pause after generating the data but I might take it out later.</p>

<p>Lastly, at the end of the “hyperparameters” section I declare a convenience array, <code>P%(2,1)</code> to keep track of 3 random points as well as a few arrays I’m going to use in the k-means algorithm. The reason I do this here is because in APPLESOFT BASIC you get an error if you declare an array that already exists. Should at some point I want to call the k-means algorithm multiple times, this won’t be a problem.</p>

<h3 id="initialize">Initialize</h3>

<p>Getting started, the first thing to do is initialize the algorithm by generating \(k\) cluster centroids. (\(k\) is a hyperparameter that specifies the number of clusters to be “found.” I set it previously with <code>KN = 2</code>.)</p>

<p>I start by clearing out the prediction column, \(y\), of the dataset table, <code>DS%(NS - 1,3)</code> because I’m going to use this to make sure I don’t randomly pick the same point twice. Then for each class I randomly pick a point from the dataset. If it’s already been used I randomly pick another. <code>KM(KN - 1, 2)</code> is where I store the means for each cluster along with a count of the number of points in each cluster.</p>

<p>Finally, I draw a line between the cluster centroids. This loop does not take into account all combinations of centroids (it works fine if \(k=2\)) and generates an error if a centroid is off the screen, which is possible, so I might just get rid of this later, since it’s not really necessary, rather than try to fix it.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---assignment">Step 1 - Assignment</h3>

<p>The assignment step is also quite easy. I loop through all the data points, computing the Euclidean distance to each cluster centroid. (Since <code>SQRT()</code> is expensive, and unnecessary here since we’re just comparing, I actually just compute the square of the Euclidean distance.) If the distance is less than the previous minimum distance, <code>DI(I,DS%(I,3))</code>, I update the assignment, <code>DS%(I,3) = J</code>.</p>

<p>At the end, I compute the accuracy of the computed assignments by simply counting the number of assignments, <code>DS%(I,3)</code>, that match the actual labels, <code>DS%(I,2)</code>. Here, however, there’s an interesting wrinkle: with two classes, half the time the label I choose for the assignment is the opposite of the label from the original dataset. K-means doesn’t require the distinction, so at times I was seeing a perfect classification reporting 0% accuracy. The line <code>IF A &lt; 0.5 THEN A = 1 - A</code> addresses this, however, it only works for 2 classes. I’ll need something more robust should I want this to work for \(k &gt; 2\).</p>

<h3 id="step-2---update">Step 2 - Update</h3>

<p>The second step is to recompute the cluster centroids based on the assigned data points. Convergence occurred if the centroids don’t change (within a tolerance) from the previous iteration.</p>

<p>I start by saving the cluster centroids to <code>KO(KN - 1,1)</code>. This is used later to determine convergence. I then iterate through ever data point, adding it’s values to the cluster to which it belongs while keeping track of the number of data points in each cluster. Next I iterate through each cluster and compute the mean of each dimension by dividing by the number of data point in that cluster.</p>

<p>Lastly, I determine if there’s convergence by measuring how far all the centroid have moved. (Again, I don’t bother with the <code>SQRT()</code>.) If the answer is more than the specified tolerance, \(0.01\), I go back to Step #1. Otherwise, I clear the graphics, redraw the axis and data points and finish by drawing the decision boundary.</p>

<h3 id="drawing-the-decision-boundary">Drawing the decision boundary</h3>

<p>This code is a slog and it’s not really critical to understanding ML but I thought it’d be cool to drawn a decision boundary while k-means is iterating and then again at the end. Given a point (the midpoint on the segment between two cluster centroids) and a slope (which is perpendicular to that segment), the challenge is to drawn a line inside the ‘box’ of the screen, assuming the line intersects that box.</p>

<p>Without delving too far into the details, this routine relies heavily on the convenience array, <code>P%(2,1)</code>, that I declared during the “hyperparameters” routine. I start by computing the slope of the perpendicular segment connecting two centroids. I then find the midpoint of that segment. (By the way, this routine also does not account for all combinations of centroids, but it works when \(k=2\).) I accommodate for when the slope is vertical and use <code>P%(0,0)</code> and <code>P%(0,1)</code> to store the midpoint between the two centroids and <code>M</code> for the slope.</p>

<p>I then iterate through the 4 sides of the ‘box’ on the screen, using the corners <code>(10,10)</code> and <code>(269,149)</code> so that the decision boundary isn’t drawn all the way to the edges of the screen. I thought that would look prettier this way. I next determine if the decision boundary intersects, respectively, the left, right, top and bottom edges of the box. I use <code>NX</code> to keep track of the number of sides of the box intersected by the decision boundary and <code>P%(NX,0)</code> and <code>P%(NX,1)</code> to keep track of those intersections. If <code>NX = 3</code>, which means there are two intersections, I draw the line because it’s inside the box.</p>

<h2 id="can-we-do-better">Can we do better?</h2>

<p>Yes! Yes, we can.</p>

<p>While k-means is simple, it does not take advantage of our knowledge of the Gaussian nature of the data. If we know that the distributions are Gaussian, which is very frequently the case in machine learning, we can employ a more powerful algorithm: Expectation Maximization (EM). This post is already long enough, so we’ll deal with that another day. Eventually, perhaps, we’ll also get to deep learning, although developing back propagation for an arbitrary size neural net using APPLESOFT BASIC on an <span>Apple ][+</span> is not going to be easy.</p>

<div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Former Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer is closing the doors on her consumer software startup Sunshine, and is selling the company’s assets to her new AI startup, Dazzle. The news was <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wired.com/story/marissa-mayer-sunshine-startup-shut-down/">first reported by Wired</a>, which cited an email sent to Sunshine’s shareholders.</p>

<p>Dazzle is setting out to build an AI personal assistant, the report cited anonymous sources as saying, and added that all of Sunshine’s employees will move to the new company.</p>







<p>Almost all of Sunshine’s investors, who include Norwest Venture Partners, Felicis Partners, and SV Angel, have signed off on the deal, Wired cited the sources as saying. </p>

<p>Originally founded in 2018, Sunshine first launched with a subscription app for contact management, dubbed “Sunshine Contacts.” That product saw little adoption due to privacy concerns about privacy, and pretty much languished. In 2024, the service added <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/27/marissa-mayers-startup-just-rolled-out-apps-for-group-photo-sharing-and-event-planning-and-the-internet-isnt-sure-what-to-think/">event management and photo sharing</a> — with a touch of AI, of course — but with little success. Both apps have been downloaded just over 1,000 times on the Google Play Store.</p>

<p>The company had raised about $20 million in 2020, and according to Meyer, was largely self-funded. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently tried using the <a href="https://amzn.to/46Y65Wo">Minisforum DEG1 GPU Dock</a> with a Raspberry Pi 500+, using an M.2 to OCuLink adapter, and <a href="https://amzn.to/48CZlyl">this chenyang SFF-8611 Cable</a>.</p>

<p>After figuring out there's a power button on the DEG1 (which needs to be turned on), and after fiddling around with the switches on the PCB (hidden under the large metal plate on the bottom; TGX to OFF was the most important setting), I was able to get the Raspberry Pi's PCIe bus to at least tell the graphics card installed in the eGPU dock to spin up its fans and initialize.</p>

<p>But I wasn't able to get any output from the card (using <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/discussions/756">this Linux kernel patch</a>), and <code>lspci</code> did not show it. (Nor were there any logs showing errors in <code>dmesg</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-500-plus-egpu-jmt-dock.jpeg" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-3844c36f-6031-4ca4-a3b1-c52098338202" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;3844c36f-6031-4ca4-a3b1-c52098338202&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Pi 500+ JMT eGPU Dock Setup"></p>

<p>I switched back to my <a href="https://amzn.to/3IBI3XY">JMT eGPU OCuLink dock</a> for the rest of my testing, and uploaded a <a href="https://youtu.be/Dv3RRAx7G6E?t=321">video detailing some of my struggles</a>, and a <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/full-egpu-acceleration-on-pi-500-15-line-patch">blog post detailing the Pi 500+ eGPU testing</a>.</p>

<p>A few commenters mentioned they <em>too</em> had issues with the Minisforum DEG1. But a few of them looked closely at the <em>OCuLink cable</em> Minisforum included, and noted there were a couple extra colored wires going through the cable sleeve that <em>didn't</em> seem to be present on other cables—like the chenyang I was using! They suggested I try swapping cables.</p>

<p>So I did... and testing it with an RX 6500 XT worked!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/minisforum-dock-working-with-pi-500-plus.jpeg" width="700" height="467" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-eab0557c-ed9e-4acd-86f4-ce6f71c8ada7" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;eab0557c-ed9e-4acd-86f4-ce6f71c8ada7&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="Minisforum dock working with AMD RX 6500 XT eGPU on Raspberry Pi 500+"></p>

<p>Looking closely at the cables side by side, I can confirm what some of the commenters said: the cable that came with the DEG1 looks like it has additional colored wires going between the connectors.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/oculink-cable-difference-minisforum-colored-wires.jpeg" width="700" height="467" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-c94ceb12-bcc5-4d7e-a735-56c7458e3735" data-insert-attach="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;c94ceb12-bcc5-4d7e-a735-56c7458e3735&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:{&quot;alt&quot;:[&quot;alt&quot;,&quot;description&quot;],&quot;title&quot;:[&quot;title&quot;]}}" alt="OCuLink cable that came with Minisforum DEG1"></p>

<p>Moral of the <em>this</em> portion of the story: not all OCuLink cables are created equal.</p>

<h2>Going Deeper</h2>

<p>But then I swapped back to my RX 7900 XT, the one that was previously unrecognized in the Miniforum dock... and it still wouldn't work.</p>

<p>I tried all three switches in different settings, I tried swapping OCuLink cables back and forth again... nothing. The RX 6500 XT was happy as can be, but the 7900? Nope.</p>

<p>I even popped in an Intel B580 card, and <em>it</em> worked too...</p>

<p>So now I'm left scratching my head: <em>what's different about the RX 7900 XT?</em> And <em>why does my cheaper $50 eGPU dock seem to work with everything, but the $99 Minisforum DEG1 doesn't?</em></p>

<p>Searching through forum posts, I even found <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=387794">someone running a 7900 XT in the DEG1 on a Pi</a>, so maybe it's just a strange fluke with my setup?</p>

<p>Inconsistencies like these really bother me. And they usually eat up an entire afternoon, because I'm always <em>certain</em> it's a PEBKAC, and I usually exhaust every route debugging before I'd waste a vendor or a maintainer's time with a bug report!</p>

<p>I haven't yet torn down one of these cables to try to figure out which pins are perhaps missing on the chenyang cable (see <a href="https://jpc-pt.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/AMPH-OCUL4X-A-RA-XXX-Sent-Out_01.jpg">OCuLink Pinouts here</a>. The bigger issue there is, I can't find a source for the cable Minisforum includes separate from the DEG1 dock, and most online listings don't clearly show which kind of cable you'll get—with or without the extra wires!</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>If you’re mounting solar panels, everybody knows the drill, right? Point them south, angled according to latitude. It’s easy. In a video which demonstrates that [Everyday Dave] is truly out standing in his field, we hear a different story. [Dave] has a year’s worth of data in his <a href="https://youtu.be/I-Fz5T5c0OQ" target="_blank">Solar Panel Showdown</a> that suggests there are good reasons to mount your panels vertically.</p>
<p>Specifically, [Dave] is using bifacial solar panels– panels that have cells on both sides. In his preferred orientation, one side faces South, while the other faces North. [Dave] is in the Northern Hemisphere, so those of you Down Under would have to do the opposite, pointing one face North and the other South.</p>
<p>Since [Dave] is far from the equator, the N/S vertical orientation beats the pants off of East-West facing panels, especially in winter. What’s interesting is how much better the bifacial panels do compared to the “standard” tilted orientation. While peak power in the summer is much better with the tilted bifacial panels (indeed, even the tilted single-sided panels), in winter the vertical N/S panels blow them out of the water. (Especially when snow gets involved. Vertical panels don’t need sweeping!)</p>
<p><span id="more-833943"></span>Even in the summer, though, there are advantages: the N/S panels may produce less power overall, but they give a trickle earlier and later in the day than the tilted orientation. Still, that extra peak power really shows, and over a six-month period from solstice-to-solstice, the vertical panels only produced 77% what the tilted bifacial panels did (while tilted single-sided panels produced 90%).</p>
<p>Is it worth it? That depends on your use case. If most of the power is going to A/C, you’ll need the extra in the warmer months. In that case, you want to tilt the panels. If you have a steady, predictable load, though, having even production winter/summer might be more to your liking– in that case you can join [Dave] in sticking solar panels straight up and down.</p>
<p>These results probably apply at latitudes similar to [Dave] who is in cloudy and snowy Ohio, which is perhaps not the ideal place for solar experimentation. If you’re not an Ohio-like distance from the equator, you might find an <a href="https://hackaday.com/2025/05/07/tracking-the-sun-nah/">East-West array is the best bang for the buck</a>. Of course if you really want to max out power from each individual cell, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/08/15/the-sunchronizer-keeps-your-solar-panel-aligned/">you can’t beat sun tracking</a> regardless of where you are.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mdx-content="true"><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="627" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://jameelur.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffriction-growth.dcafe3c3.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1x, https://jameelur.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffriction-growth.dcafe3c3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://jameelur.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Ffriction-growth.dcafe3c3.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"></p><p>The title of this article says it all. Overcoming friction leads to growth. Comfort leads to stagnation.</p>
<p>ChatGPT and by extension “AI” is likely the biggest “revolution” of my generation. It is likely also going to be the biggest killer of creativity in my generation. I always thought the creativity killer was going to be access to infinite entertainment. I think I was wrong.</p>
<p>I’ve come to believe that with the rise of convenience and comfort, it becomes harder for us to reach our potential. Technology and Capitalism is taking us towards an extreme.</p>
<p>A certain level of convenience can lead to efficiency gains. Automation is important for a reason. Too much convenience though, that's a killer. When friction was inherent in the system, applying ourselves led to growth as we overcame that friction. We simply didn’t have an alternative that was viable. And this principle applies to everything.</p>
<p>When I was a child in Sri Lanka, I ended up memorizing the landline numbers of all my close relatives. To this day I remember them. The moment I got a phone where my contacts could be saved, I stopped remembering numbers. It may seem like a small thing but it illustrates the principle. The ease of access to information has geared us towards efficiently looking up information instead of remembering it. I won't argue the utility of having hundreds of numbers saved on your phone, I simply want to make a point. Overcoming friction leads to growth.</p>
<p>Let's take another activity where creativity is important, writing. When it's easier to prompt ChatGPT to write your college essay, you'll never apply yourself. Afterall, when everyone is doing it, why not you? As everyone uses ChatGPT, the expectation of high quality writing will increase, making it harder for people to be vulnerable. You can’t become a master without making mistakes and learning from it.</p>
<p>Humans are creatures of comfort. Just like so many things in this world, we follow the path of least resistance. With access to technology being ubiquitous, and ChatGPT being so widely available, to choose not to use it is very hard. You need to deliberately prioritize your growth and choose to go against the current. You need to deliberately introduce friction to the process.</p>
<p>That said, total abstinence is not the solution. ChatGPT is here to stay. Just like most advancements in technology are. As a child of the 21st Century, you’ll need to learn to utilize this new tool in a manner that aids you, not hinders you. More importantly, not hinder the <strong>future</strong> you.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content" id="article-content"><p>A year ago, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/oracle/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/oracle/">Oracle</a> cofounder and Chairman Larry Ellison described a future where everyone, including law enforcement, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/oracle-larry-ellison-surveillance-state-police-ai/">will face regular surveillance</a> as daily life is documented seemingly nonstop.</p><div>



<p>At Oracle’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.oracle.com/events/financial-analyst-meeting-2024/">financial analyst meeting</a>&nbsp;last September, he predicted artificial intelligence will help process the vast amounts of footage recorded by cameras placed on everything from car dashboards and front doors to security systems and cops.



</p><p>“We’re going to have supervision,” Ellison said. “Every police officer is going to be supervised at all times, and if there’s a problem, AI will report that problem and report it to the appropriate person. Citizens will be on their best behavior because we are constantly recording and reporting everything that’s going on.”



</p><p>Those comments have gained fresh relevance now that his company has emerged as a major player in the AI industry and is poised to play a critical role in the deal for TikTok’s U.S. operations. TikTok’s video-sharing platform is among the most popular social media properties in the country.



</p><p>Oracle didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>The company has been an AI infrastructure provider and stunned Wall Street earlier this month by reaching a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?st=vUBGuq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?st=vUBGuq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/business/openai-oracle-sign-300-billion-computing-deal-among-biggest-in-history-ff27c8fe?st=vUBGuq&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">$300 billion deal with OpenAI</a>, which will purchase computing power over about five years in one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. 



</p><p>And earlier this week, OpenAI signed deals with SoftBank and Oracle&nbsp;for new data centers as part of the massive Stargate Project.



</p><p>In its most recent quarterly earnings call with analysts, management also offered&nbsp;revenue projections that cited $455 billion in contracts, up 359% from a year earlier.&nbsp;CEO Safra Catz&nbsp;revealed that Oracle landed deals with three different customers during the quarter.



</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://fortune.com/how-we-test-supplements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/how-we-test-supplements/" data-type="page" data-id="4319596">Oracle is expected to be among the companies</a> that will buy TikTok’s U.S. business from Chinese parent company ByteDance. In addition, Oracle&nbsp;will spearhead U.S. oversight of the algorithm and security.



</p><p>President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon signed an executive order clearing the way for a deal to put TikTok in U.S. hands. The <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/trumps-billionaire-backers-tiktok-deal-murdochs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/trumps-billionaire-backers-tiktok-deal-murdochs/" data-type="link" data-id="https://fortune.com/2025/09/25/trumps-billionaire-backers-tiktok-deal-murdochs/">U.S. ownership structure is still being finalized</a>, but Trump said&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;and Ellison would play a “big” role in managing the app, while conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch and computer billionaire Michael Dell would sit on the board. Trump hinted that three more “blue-chip” backers are also part of the ownership group.</p><p>Vice President JD Vance said that the algorithm will be “under the control of American investors,” adding that more details would be forthcoming.&nbsp;



</p><p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-secured-oracle-trump-100000512.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-algorithm-secured-oracle-trump-100000512.html">Reports earlier this week</a>&nbsp;said&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;will re-create TikTok’s algorithm and provide a new U.S. version while also ensuring security for users’ data.



</p><p>“This deal will allow for the U.S. to control the app’s algorithm,” Vance said. “It’s actually going to be American-operated all the way.”
