<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><br><span><span>O</span></span>n a frigid evening in January 2018, Brian Wharton was sitting at home in Hawkins, a small town in the backcountry of east <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Texas</a>, when there was a knock on the door. A woman introduced herself as a lawyer working to spare the life of Robert Roberson, a death row inmate who had come within four days of execution.</p><p>Wharton immediately understood the significance of this visit. He was a retired detective from the police department in Palestine, another small town about 80 miles away, and in 2002 he had been involved in a case that stuck in his memory.</p><p>On 31 January that year, Wharton was called to Palestine hospital after receiving reports of a mortally ill child. Her father, Roberson, had brought his two-year-old daughter Nikki into the ER in a comatose state, the little girl lying limp in his arms and turning blue. She died the following day.</p><p>Wharton led the investigation. He arrested Roberson hours after the girl died, even before an autopsy had been performed, having been advised by doctors that this was a case of “shaken baby syndrome” – the theory that the child had died from violent shaking that caused fatal brain injuries.</p><p>Wharton went on to testify at Roberson’s capital trial. The jury convicted Roberson in February 2003 and sent him – now branded <a href="https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_info/robersonrobert.html" data-link-name="in body link">Prisoner 999442</a> – to death row.</p><figure id="5b7b9c5f-41b9-4bf1-bd4f-ea96d3768293" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-1"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="An old photograph of Robert Roberson and his daughter Nikki next to a car." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e2b1947b00ab6443727183bc6413fdf8fea90de/0_0_1696_1148/master/1696.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="301.21462264150944" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A photograph of Robert Roberson and his daughter Nikki.

Why had the doctors and nurses seized on shaken baby syndrome as the cause of Nikki’s injuries almost immediately, and why with such certainty? Why had a nurse told him she had found indicators of sexual assault on Nikki’s body when he could see no such evidence?</p><p>Why, when he escorted Roberson back to his house on the day of Nikki’s collapse, could he find no signs of a violent altercation? Why were there no marks or indentations on the walls, no holes in the sheetrock, nothing – and no blood anywhere except a few drops on a washcloth Roberson gave him?</p><p>Above all, why had Roberson himself acted so strangely? As a police officer, Wharton had dealt with both perpetrators and victims of violent crimes, but Roberson’s behavior fitted the pattern of neither criminal nor victim. He came across as flat, emotionless, matter-of-fact, as though nothing was registering with him.</p><p>All these things bugged the former detective to the point that he felt haunted by them. So when the doorbell rang, and Roberson’s lawyer stood before him, Wharton knew exactly what to do.</p><p>“Come in,” he said. “I’ve been waiting for you.”</p><hr><p><span><span>O</span></span>n Tuesday, the US supreme court will convene in Washington for what is known as a “long conference”, preceding the start of its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/" data-link-name="in body link">2023-24 term</a>. The justices will meet in private to sift through the backlog of cases that have amassed over the summer, tossing out those they are disinclined to consider.</p><p>The lawyer Gretchen Sween will be waiting on tenterhooks for news of which petitions the court has discarded. Among the huge pile of requests awaiting the justices’ attention is <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979625-roberson-cert-petition-to-scotus-may-23" data-link-name="in body link">one she prepared for her client: Roberson</a>.</p><p>“We’ll be watching anxiously to see if we make it through that gauntlet,” Sween told the Guardian.</p><p>Roberson’s supreme court appeal could be his last shot at judicial review. Should the justices reject his approaches, the state of Texas would be free to set a new execution date.</p><p>Roberson has asked the court to review the decision of the Texas state courts to <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/01/11/robert-roberson-texas-death-penalty-shaken-baby/" data-link-name="in body link">deny</a> a retrial despite new evidence that has emerged casting doubt on his conviction. Since Sween took over as his attorney in 2016 she has discovered that:</p><ul>
 <li><p>Nikki, who shortly before she died had been placed in Roberson’s custody, was chronically sick almost from birth. She suffered bouts of breathing apnea which caused her suddenly to stop breathing and collapse. Shortly before her father rushed her to hospital, she had had diarrhea for five days and had a fever of 104.5F (40.3C).</p></li>
 <li><p>Nikki also had severe undiagnosed pneumonia.</p></li>
 <li><p>She had been prescribed medications, including an opioid, that are no longer considered safe for children as they can cause fatal breathing problems and oxygen deprivation.</p></li>
 <li><p>The sexual assault allegation was unsupported by any evidence, and the nurse who raised it was unqualified to identify it.</p></li>
</ul><p>Then there is the overarching question of shaken baby syndrome. The petition asks the supreme court to weigh whether a death sentence based largely on a scientific hunch presented to the jury as fact should be allowed to stand when, in the intervening years, that theory has been largely discredited.</p><p>In other words: should Texas be allowed to execute a man on the basis of junk science?</p><p>“This is a shocking, social failure,” Sween said. “This is not simply a matter of having the wrong guy, it’s a matter of there having been no crime committed in the first place.”</p><hr><p>Texas houses its <a href="https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_offenders_on_dr.html" data-link-name="in body link">179 male death row inmates</a> in the Allen B Polunsky Unit, a complex of windowless grey boxes resembling a Walmart supercenter shrouded in barbed wire.</p><p>Roberson, 56, was waiting in the secure metal cubicle assigned for media visits. He was wiping smudges off the bulletproof glass, an attention to detail that seemed incongruous given the circumstances.</p><p>He was dressed in the all-white onesie that is death row uniform in Texas. From the first exchange, his highly unusual way of speaking was evident.</p><p>“Thank you for for for for for, ah ah, this interview, sir sir,” he said, blinking fast behind his glasses, in time with his stutter.</p><p>That was a clue as to why medical staff were so quick to suspect Roberson when they encountered him, and why Wharton found his behaviour so singular. Long after his capital trial – too late for the jury to factor it in – Roberson was diagnosed with autism.</p><figure id="f458b7ad-163d-42b3-a25b-776aeb29ab3f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="portrait of a man wearing a priest's dog collar and crucifix" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84ca83ad84b973a73ba77106fbfe8828e05a5ffb/0_0_5504_8256/master/5504.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="667.5" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Brian Wharton, the former lead detective in the death penalty case against Robert Roberson, has changed his opinion about the guilt of Roberson.</span> Photograph: Callaghan O’Hare/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>Roberson described his life of poverty at the time he began looking after Nikki. Separated from the girl’s mother, and living with a new partner,<strong> </strong>he worked three newspaper delivery routes to try to support them.</p><p>“After gas and stuff, you don’t make too much from a paper route,” he said.</p><p>Asked what he hoped for Nikki when he took custody of her, he said: “I was hoping to raise her, you know, to be a father to her, to raise her to have a good life and stuff, and for us all to be happy. To provide for her best I can, to nurse her, to love her, to pray for her.”</p><p>Roberson said Nikki was sick from the day she joined him, recalling that they had to visit the doctor’s surgery because she was so ill. On the morning of 31 January 2002, he said he found she had fallen out of bed and was lying face down on the floor.</p><p>“She had a little bit of blood on her lip, I wiped it off on a towel,” he said.</p><p>He lifted her back on the bed and they went back to sleep. Then he described what happened after he awoke a second time.</p><p>“When I got back up she wasn’t breathing and I listen to her heart, weren’t breathing.

During the trial, the prosecution said he came across as cold and uncaring because he didn’t cry, but he said that was because he had trained himself not to cry during his difficult childhood.</p><p>“It’s hard for me to cry because I got my behind whooped by my father who would say, ‘Shut up or dry it up or we’ll give you some more.’ My dad was kind of abusive, you know.”</p><p>Roberson was taken into custody within hours of Nikki’s death. He remains there more than 21 years later.</p><figure id="2ccff594-1bf7-4188-b03a-a46df8477ec6" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="The Allan B Polunsky Unit, in Livingston, Texas." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9595f08eb16af5ff83b7268181cca0682ba9cd5/0_0_6893_4595/master/6893.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.64514725083416" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The Allan B Polunsky Unit, in Livingston, Texas.</span> Photograph: Callaghan O’Hare/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>I asked him how he felt about being convicted of shaking his daughter to death.</p><p>“I would never think about shaking her,” he replied. “And that’s God’s honest truth. I don’t know what happened to her, Mr Pilkington. I wouldn’t want that to be on nobody: to lose a child, especially if you tried to do right and you loved her and tried to get to know her, then to be accused.”</p><p>Roberson said he knew nothing about the medical hypothesis that fueled his prosecution until long after he was arrested. He read about it in a brochure someone gave his mother.</p><p>“I’d never heard about shaken baby in my life,” he said.</p><hr><p><span><span>S</span></span>haken baby syndrome (SBS) began life in the early 1970s as a medical hypothesis for why some children become severely ill, some fatally, showing signs of internal head trauma but little or no signs of external trauma. One of the first to float the idea was a British pediatric neurosurgeon, Norman Guthkelch, who in 1971 suggested the cause might be violent shaking.</p><p>By the 1980s, SBS had developed into a detailed theory focusing on three symptoms, known as the triad, that it was believed could indicate abusive shaking: bleeding between the tissue layers covering the brain, swelling on the brain, and bleeding at the back of the eyes. When that triad was seen, even without any outward sign of force, child abuse might be behind it.</p><p>By the 1990s, a form of groupthink had crept in, medical practitioners firming up what had begun as a mere hunch into a formal diagnosis. The collective thinking now was that where those three symptoms were seen in young children, not only could abusive shaking be presumed, it had to be taken as the cause.</p><p>In 2001, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the world’s leading pediatric medical organization, issued official guidance. It said that where a young child had internal head injuries there was “the need for a presumption of child abuse” – a categoric finding that rapidly became medical, and then forensic dogma.</p><p>So it was that a year later, when Roberson brought Nikki to ER, he was met by a cordon of medical staff trained in this thinking, with detectives and prosecutors following their lead.</p><p>“When we got to Palestine hospital, the conversation was about shaken baby,” Wharton recalled, “so for me and my detectives that’s the direction we were going.”</p><p>The problem was that the presumption that the triad must be caused by violent shaking had no scientific foundations. As a new book of essays, <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/shaken-baby-syndrome/67016F1A1F6ED92141A179E9A5D145FB" data-link-name="in body link">Shaken Baby Syndrome</a>, published by Cambridge University Press and edited by prominent scientists and law professors in the US, UK, Europe and Japan, points out, shaking is essentially a biomechanical issue pediatric doctors know little about.</p><p>One of the first biomechanical studies to be carried out into SBS was conducted in 1987, almost 20 years after the hypothesis emerged. It found that violent shaking produces a force inside the head well below that involved in impact injuries such as car crashes, and much weaker than child abuse experts had assumed.</p><p>The new book’s conclusion is that 50 years after Guthkelch’s hunch, “this hypothesis still lacks a scientific evidence base”.</p><p>In 1997, shaken baby syndrome became a global sensation with the televised trial of a British nanny, Louise Woodward, in Massachusetts. She was prosecuted following the death of the eight-month-old in her care, Matthew Eappen.</p><p>Woodward was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced to life, later reduced to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979627-34-declaration-of-norman-guthkelch-expresses-some-horror-dated-feb-3-2012" data-link-name="in body link">involuntary manslaughter</a> and time served. Her trial was so high-profile that it brought to public attention serious doubts about the credibility of SBS raised by the nanny’s defense attorney, the co-founder of the Innocence Project, Barry Scheck.</p><p>Since Roberson was sentenced to death in 2002, those doubts have steadily grown. Dr Patrick Barnes, a key prosecution witness in the Woodward trial, retracted his testimony and became a vocal critic of the syndrome.</p><figure id="e16d1f00-fa90-4551-b3bc-0f55f86b09ed" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="old photo of a woman and a child" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/718db076fe57df0a24482eeb6f1f80e3815c7473/0_0_2048_1532/master/2048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="332.880859375" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>The trial of Louise Woodward, a British nanny in the US, brought to public attention serious doubts about the credibility of SBS.</span> Photograph: Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Even Guthkelch, its creator, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23979627-34-declaration-of-norman-guthkelch-expresses-some-horror-dated-feb-3-2012" data-link-name="in body link">came out in 2012</a> and said his work had been distorted.

In 2013, the state introduced a first-in-the-nation <a href="https://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=articles&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=47776" data-link-name="in body link">“junk science writ”</a> that allowed prisoners – especially those on death row – to challenge sentences on grounds of misused forensic science. It was under this law that in 2016 Sween saved Roberson from imminent death by securing a stay of execution four days before his scheduled lethal injection.</p><p>But the hope generated by the new junk science law in Texas has proven a chimera. There have been about 70 attempts by death row inmates to utilize the law and of those the number that have obtained relief is zero.</p><p>Kosoul Chanthakoummane was one of those who appealed through the junk science law. He had been put on death row on the back of three different types of junk science: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/04/false-witness-us-using-hypnosis-convict-criminals" data-link-name="in body link">hypnosis of a witness</a> to obtain identification, bitemark analysis and a discredited form of DNA testimony.</p><p>In August 2022, Texas <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/08/17/texas-execution-kosoul-chanthakoummane-lethal-injection/10354060002/" data-link-name="in body link">executed him</a> anyway.</p><p>There is a real possibility that that fate now awaits Roberson. Having secured a stay of execution, he was granted an evidentiary hearing at his trial court. Sween presented a mass of new evidence. Expert witnesses were called to speak about the growing consensus that SBS is junk science.</p><p>The court heard that Nikki’s symptoms could all be explained by natural rather than violent causes, including her pneumonia and chronic illness and the life-threatening medication. It was also told about Roberson’s autism, and the unfounded nature of the sexual assault allegation.</p><p>Despite the voluminous testimony, a state judge <a href="https://www.cbs19.tv/article/news/local/judge-denies-recommending-east-texas-death-row-inmates-appeal-exoneration-new-trial/501-39bfdd8e-b687-4065-9b34-25b60c320e6c?fbclid=IwAR0prM39z6qk3QAM9lMHodMm71V2SG_zOvR1_oPXgmpnDu_rqggbD0Edg8c" data-link-name="in body link">denied the appeal</a>.

Its argument cites testimony from Teddie, Roberson’s estranged girlfriend, who said he had a bad temper and would yell at Nikki and hit her.</p><p>Roberson’s legal team counter that Teddie was not a credible witness. Her own sister testified for Roberson, insisting she had never seen him mistreat Nikki and telling the jury Teddie had a problem with telling the truth.</p><p>Brian Wharton, who after retiring from law enforcement retrained as a cleric and is now pastor of a United Methodist church situated 10 miles away from death row,<strong> </strong>testified at the junk science hearing. He told the court that, drawing on his 14 years’ experience as a police officer, he had come to the view that shaken baby syndrome was a fallacy and that without it there was no evidence supporting Roberson’s death sentence.</p><p>“What case would we have been able to make?” Wharton told the Guardian. “There was no crime scene, no forensic evidence. It was just three words: shaken baby syndrome. Without them, he would be a free man today.”</p><p>Roberson said the worst part of his fight to stay alive was not knowing.

<p>Whenever I explain my research at Google into mobile text editing, I’m usually met with blank stares or a slightly hostile “Everyone can edit text on their phones, right? What’s the problem?”</p>



<p>Text editing on mobile isn’t ok. It’s actually much worse than you think, an invisible problem no one appreciates. I wrote this post so you can understand why it’s so important. But as it’s a rather nuanced issue, I may lose you. To help, I’ve sprinkled lots of headers throughout so if you get bored, just skip ahead.</p>



<h2>TL;DR</h2>



<p>Android and iOS share a common problem: they copied desktop text editing conventions, but without a menu bar or mouse. This forced them to overload the tap gesture with a wide range of actions: placing the cursor, moving it, selecting text, and invoking a pop-up menu. This results in an overly complicated and ambiguous mess-o-taps, leading to a variety of user errors.</p>



<p>It’s less of a problem if you only do short bursts of text in social media or messaging apps. But doing anything more complicated like an email gets tedious. However, in my user study on text editing, I was surprised to find that everyone had significant problems and rather severe workaround for editing text.  </p>



<p>With the extremely talented <a href="https://www.32al.io/">Olivier Bau</a>, together we created a prototype called Eloquent, which offers a much simpler solution. We presented this work at <a href="https://programs.sigchi.org/uist/2021/program/content/61484">UIST 2021</a>.</p>



<h2>Yes, text editing really is a problem</h2>



<p>In 2017, while working on Android, I had some questions about text editing and started asking around for existing user studies. I assumed that for something so core to the user experience, we would have at least a few studies. Looking back over seven years of research, I couldn’t find a single one on text editing. I was a bit stunned.</p>



<p>Text editing on mobile was considered “good enough.” Since people weren’t complaining, there was little motivation to improve it. However, I decided to conduct my own study, and the results were surprising. I gave 10 participants a simple set of text editing tasks, such as deleting an “x” from a string of characters or moving a word to the end of a sentence. Every single person had problems with targeting, using the clipboard and lots and lots of errors.</p>



<p>I asked the participants about their overall experience editing text on mobile devices. They all expressed frustration, but not so much with messaging or social media apps, where they typically only needed to write short bursts of text. However, when it came to composing more complex text, such as multiple-sentence emails, they often said things like, “I’ll start it on my phone, but if it gets too complex, I’ll just finish it on my laptop.” Even more surprising, over half of the participants said that instead of editing text, it was easier to just select all, delete, and retype, bypassing editing entirely. This is not a sign that things are working well.</p>



<p>Just to be clear, the problem here isn’t <strong>entering</strong> text, but with <strong>editing</strong> it. With better keyboards, voice transcription, and physical keyboards on many tablets, getting text into a device is not the problem it used to be. However, you will always want to edit your words afterwards.</p>



<p>While my research focused on fixing text editing problems on Android, I want to be clear that iOS, which has some significant differences to Android text editing, still has many of the same problems.</p>



<h2>Text editing is a hack</h2>



<p>Mobile devices were originally designed for consumption. The revolution of flick-scrolling made it easy to move through content. The superpower of mobiles was their on-the-go consumption of videos, photos, social media, and messaging. These are valuable tasks but require little text editing. People forget the original iPhone didn’t even have clipboard support!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet over the last 10 years we’ve heard over and over that it’s only a matter of time before everyone will be using tablets for everything. Apple ran an add a few years ago “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S5BLs51yDQ">What’s a computer?</a>” and in 2013, Google tried a “Tablet Tuesdays” campaign to get it’s workers to use their tablets all day while at work. Tablets continue to sell fairly well but as a desktop replacement, it’s been, let’s just say, less than a resounding success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tablets+not+replacing+computers&amp;sca_esv=566788144&amp;sxsrf=AM9HkKlmFItGPFjEaiRnbM2TkMs7l7k9yw%3A1695172364343&amp;ei=DEcKZcnBFLGkptQP-OyVoAk&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjJ9--UgbiBAxUxkokEHXh2BZQQ4dUDCBA&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=tablets+not+replacing+computers&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiH3RhYmxldHMgbm90IHJlcGxhY2luZyBjb21wdXRlcnMyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIIECEYFhgeGB1IpElQvQ9Y5kdwAXgAkAEAmAGBAaABoBWqAQQ2LjIwuAEDyAEA-AEBwgIKECMYsAIYsAMYJ8ICCxAAGIoFGIYDGLADwgIFEAAYogTCAgwQABgFGB4YDRgPGArCAggQABiKBRiGA8ICCBAhGKABGMMEwgIKECEYoAEYwwQYCsICBRAhGKsCwgIHECEYoAEYCuIDBBgBIEGIBgGQBgI&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">written about</a> quite extensively, I’m not really saying anything new here. However, people don’t seem to agree why. It’s not that some people can’t be productive on tablets. There clearly are people that can make this work. But most can’t.&nbsp;Why is that? </p>



<p>There are likely many reasons, but I would argue that there are a few deep foundational UX problems with tablets that hinders productively. Text editing is one. Another is file handling, <a href="https://jenson.org/files2">something I’ve previous written about</a> if you’re interested. However, before anyone accuses me of being a nostalgic fool, I want to be clear that I am not anti-mobile. <strong>My goal is not to return back to the desktop, but to move mobile forward.</strong> How can we actually use our fix our phones and tablets to be as productive and fast as we are on desktop systems?</p>



<h2>Start with desktop text editing…</h2>



<p>Text editing on desktop has a long and interesting history, but let’s focus post 2000, where it started to stabilize. Every desktop OS has a mouse cursor that can be moved accurately with a mouse or trackpad, making it easy to click on the exact character you want.</p>



<p>Selecting text is also quite simple: after clicking down on the mouse, an additional drag of the cursor selects more. Then an EDIT menu with the classic Cut/Copy/Paste commands let you act on your selection. For must faster actions, the command keys X, C, and V made it significantly faster.</p>



<p>The combination of these three features—an accurate pointer, simple selection, and a menu with command keys—made text editing easy, relatively error-free, and unambiguous. To be fair, one can imagine improvements to this system, and I don’t wish to imply that it is perfect. It is simply the baseline against which I am comparing mobile text editing.</p>



<h2>…and then poorly copy it</h2>



<p>Given how prevalent desktop UI was when mobile was launched, it’s not surprising that it tried to copy desktop editing. The problem is that there was no mouse pointer and a menu bar with command keys. This meant it had to make significant compromises.</p>



<p>For example, instead of clicking with a mouse pointer, mobile devices use a finger to tap. This means that placing the text cursor is less accurate. This is well known in UX research as the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error">fat finger</a>‘ problem. This is why user interface guidelines suggest buttons to be fairly tall and wide as bigger targets are easier to hit. However, text characters can’t be made big enough. This usually results in placing the text cursor a bit to the left or right of where you intended.</p>



<p>The targeting problem has led to a cascade of new interaction mechanisms that technically solve the problem but have unfortunate side effects.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The 4 changes mobile made to text editing</h2>



<h3><strong>1. Text Handles</strong></h3>



<p>Mobile adds a teardrop handle to the bottom of the text cursor. This allows the text cursor to be seen more easily and gives a handle to drag the cursor to the correct position if you miss. This all seems pretty reasonable right?</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png" alt="" width="156" height="101" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image.png 583w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-120x78.png 120w" sizes="(max-width: 156px) 100vw, 156px"></figure></div>


<p>Actually, no! This creates our first ambiguity. The text handle is itself a tap target. Unfortunately, so is the text surrounding it. We now have two potential tap targets. When they are far apart, it’s fine. The problem only occurs when I want to tap just to the left or right of the text cursor. In this case, it’s unclear what the user wants: to move the cursor or to tap/drag the handle.</p>



<p>We saw this in our user testing when users tried to place the text cursor accurately: they would miss by a few characters and tap again to the side but the text handle would take priority and ‘eat the tap’ incorrectly assuming that the user wanted to drag it. On the desktop, if you clicked in the wrong location, you’d just click again to move the cursor, there was no ambiguity.&nbsp; While this isn’t disastrous, it adds friction. Worse, it’s the start of a trend. As we get to the other changes below, this input ambiguity will grow worse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>iOS doesn’t have a teardrop handle but it’s text cursor still has the same ‘eat the tap’ problem.</p>



<h3><strong>2. Magnifier</strong></h3>



<p>Because the text on mobile devices is so small and the finger is so relatively big, mobile devices added a magnifying glass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two issues with the magnifier. First, it doesn’t help you very much before you tap to place the cursor, it’s more there to help you correct your mistake. It does this by making it easier to see where you are dragging. Second, It’s visually confusing. By floating above your finger, it creates two visible cursors: the real one under your finger and a duplicate in the magnifier. It’s actually not that bad with very short text fields, but with longer emails, it’s easy to get lost and not be sure where you are in the&nbsp; text.</p>

<p>Apple’s magnifier is even more chaotic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22524824/apple-ios-15-iphone-text-selection-magnifying-glass-reversal" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxapcquSZxs">vanishing in iOS13</a> and returning in iOS15. </p>



<h3><strong>3. Selecting text</strong></h3>



<p>On desktop, selecting text was a natural extension of mouse clicking by keeping the button down and dragging. With mobile this isn’t possible so there is a completely new gesture, double tap. Wait, there is actually a third gesture long press, which also works. Both do the same thing. Don’t look at me, I didn’t design this….</p>



<p>However this new gesture causes more friction as decoding a ‘double tap’ must wait a bit to see if another tap is coming, so this usually delays the effect of a single tap. This means the text handle has another way to ‘eat a tap’.</p>



<p>However selection is still not done as you often want to select more than a single word. To solve this problem, the text cursor handle is at both ends of the selection. This allows you to extend your selection by dragging it at either end. This means selecting a few words is actually a two step process: select a word and then drag the selection handles. This compound set of gestures to edit text, like placing the cursor described above isn’t horrible, but it isn’t nearly as elegant as desktop and definitely adds yet more friction.</p>

<h3><strong>4. Popup menu</strong></h3>



<p>As there is no menu bar with mobile, there needs to be some way to invoke the clipboard commands. This is done in two ways. The first is the most obvious: as soon as there is a text selection, show a menu above the selection. This is visually a bit busy but it doesn’t create any tapping ambiguity. This works fairly well for cut/copy but is more problematic for pasting, which usually doesn’t start with a selection. The solution is a bit hidden: you can bring up this same menu by tapping the text handle. This means users have to learn TWO different gestures to bring up the menu. iOS is nearly the same.</p>

<p>This problem is made even worse on Android as the text handle actually disappears after 4 seconds of inactivity. The reason for this is that the handle slightly obscures text beneath it. This makes the menu completely unavailable. If you want to bring up the menu, you have to tap again to make the handle appear and then tap the handle a second time. It’s no wonder people are confused.</p>



<p>This menu-on-handle-tap adds yet another targeting ambiguity. A common problem with trying to place the cursor is that the user accidentally taps the handle which brings up the menu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For highly proficient users, this gets even worse as their is no command key equivalents for cut, copy, or paste. Whether you are a beginner or expert, you must use the menu in the exact same way. Imagine if on the desktop, everyone had to use the Edit menu to cut and paste text. This is just lazy design. While we should always take care of novice users first, we shouldn’t ignore proficient users. Part of the unspoken reason desktop clipboard use is so high is the speed in which it can be used. Mobile has none of this.</p>



<h2>How a tap can be misinterpreted</h2>



<p>These extra mobile hacks that shoehorn desktop text editing into the mobile experience are functional, they get the job done, but each one adds another way a tap can be misinterpreted. Each time the user taps one of these actions can occur:</p>



<ul>
<li>place the cursor</li>



<li>bring up the menu (if there already is a cursor)</li>



<li>start a drag</li>



<li>start a double tap</li>



<li>start a long press</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are very deliberate, these separate actions can be managed. This isn’t a complete train wreck. My point however is that it is fragile. There are just so many ways the user can end up surprised. Here are some of the errors I saw in my user testing:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Problem 1:</strong> When a user taps, due to the fat finger problem, they miss the location they wanted. </li>



<li><strong>Problem 2:</strong> If they tap slightly to the side to place the cursor correctly, they tap the text handle and the menu comes up, confusing them. They are forced to tap away to dismiss the menu and try again.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 3:</strong> Instead of getting the menu, their second tap is interpreted as a trivial drag and nothing happens.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 4:</strong> If the user attempts a double tap, but taps a bit to the side, or hits the text handle, the OS misunderstands and nothing happens.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 5:</strong> The user wants to paste into an empty field and is confused as there is no text cursor and no menu. They must first tap into the empty field to get the cursor and THEN tap the cursor a second time to get the menu.</li>



<li><strong>Problem 6:</strong> The user traps to place the cursor but looks up to talk for a second, During this brief pause, the text handle times out and disappears. Looking down they want to tap the handle but don’t see it and are confused. They have to tap again.</li>
</ul>



<p>All of this friction starts to add up. Each of these changes, on their own, seem reasonable. However, taken together they add a significant amount of errors and friction to the process. In my study of 10 users, it took 5 attempts on average to place the cursor accurately. We had one user tap 19 times! It’s no longer a surprise why so many of our test users just gave up on text editing, retyping everything instead of actually editing the text. </p>



<p>Obviously, text editing on mobile is possible as millions do it every day. My point isn’t that “it’s impossible” but a much more subtle “it’s much harder than we think”. Many of you will just say “get a grip grandpa, it’s not that bad” and dismiss my concerns. But keep in mind that most text created on mobile is short and low effort, usually messages and social media comments. Editing is rarely needed so this friction doesn’t matter so much. I’ve also had many people tell me of students writing entire papers on their phone. That’s right, it’s possible! Lots of people run marathons too, that doesn’t mean everyone is able to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t believe me, please try doing some significant text editing on either Android or iOS. Just use voice input to dictate a quick paragraph and then try to clean it up. Pay attention to how many errors happen and then honestly tell me that it was a simple and easy experience.</p>



<p>If we want mobile to replace desktop (or at least compete with it), it has to grow beyond these backward looking tap-hacks to something designed specifically for mobile. Instead of poorly copying the desktop, we should lean into the touch experience to create something fluid, clear, and much simpler.</p>



<h2>Eloquent: one path forward</h2>



<p>Before I go into the details of Eloquent, I want to emphasize that my primary goal in this post is to fully describe the problem. Make this invisible problem visible to you. Many people don’t realize how bad it is. Given this, I hope we can agree that something needs to be done. You may not agree with Eloquent, and that’s fine. I hope that other, even better solutions will be suggested.</p>



<p>Since this post is already quite long, I will list the key things we tried below, but I will rely on the introductory video I made for UIST to give you a more complete demonstration of our efforts. Because the problem involves the collision between tapping, selecting, the magnifier, and menu usage, it is difficult to fix the problem without addressing all four simultaneously.</p>



<h3><strong>Simplified cursor placement</strong></h3>



<p>Our core goal was to create a tap action that is completely unambiguous, similar to the simplicity of a mouse click on desktop. We wanted a tap to always place the cursor. As mentioned above, one problem with today’s text handles is that they “eat” the cursor, thinking it is the start of a drag or menu. We unified this logic so that any time the finger touches the screen, it is considered the start of a drag. A tap is simply a very short drag. This means that if you tap to the side of the handle and lift quickly, the cursor will jump to the new location; if however you drag slowly, the cursor drags to the same location. Problem solved.</p>



<p>Visually, we always keep the text handle visible. We didn’t want it to come and go. This encourage users to drag, which is more accurate than tapping. We made it semi-transparent so that it didn’t obscure the text. This made the cursor visually stable and eliminated the 4-second timeouts.</p>



<h3><strong>Unified magnifier</strong></h3>



<p>By having the magnifier integrated over the text cursor, it simplifies the visual presentation so the user is always looking at the cursor in context. As Eloquent is so drag focused, this improves the overall experience and encourages dragging. We use a fisheye technique to economize on space and keep the user oriented to their text.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-700x283.png" alt="" width="554" height="224" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-700x283.png 700w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-120x48.png 120w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-768x310.png 768w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-1536x621.png 1536w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-2048x828.png 2048w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-720x291.png 720w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image3-1440x582.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"></figure></div>


<p>However, this approach led us to an unexpected place: it’s actually better to ALWAYS drag the cursor as the magnifier allows much more accurate placement of the text cursor. As we started using this system more, we just starting dragging immediately and narrowed in on our target. This is a new behavior but one we found was very very quick to adopt.</p>



<h3><strong>Drag Press for text selection</strong></h3>



<p>The main reason there is so much ambiguity today is that there is only a single tap gesture. This forces the ambiguities we’ve seen. So we created a new gesture while the user was dragging: pressing harder while dragging. This gesture starts a text selection. We used the barometric pressure sensor in the phone to detect when the user pressed. We did this as it was the only hardware sensor available to us at the time. We maintained two running averages, a long one as a base measure and a short one to trigger the event. When the short average went above the long average, we fired a drag-press event. This was remarkably robust, working well even though the sensor varies quite a bit. A more advanced mechanism, such as Apple’s unfortunately discontinued<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Touch#3D_Touch"> 3D Touch hardware</a> could be a better solution.</p>



<h3><strong>Improved menus</strong></h3>



<p>Finally, we try to enable a more fluid gesture so that proficient users can actually get some much needed speed into using copy/paste. As nearly every text menu today (both Android and iOS) are hierarchical, we wanted to take this opportunity to flatten the menu as well. This wasn’t a critical goal but was such a horrible UX crime that we wanted to solve it as well. We wanted to at least try to come up with something that is more discoverable. Every single user tester found this easily and enjoyed using it. </p>



<p>In addition, after the drag-press starts the selction, a second drag-press brings up the menu. This allows targeting, selecting, and bringing up the menu in a single fluid gesture. As a power user feature, it’s also possible to quickly flick to invoke the menu item. This allows mobile a rough equivalent of command keys. This isn’t a backward looking hack but a mobile inspired approach where the entire process of targeting, selecting, and clipboard action can now be done with a single fluid gesture. (see the video below for a demonstration)</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-700x169.png" alt="" width="808" height="195" srcset="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-700x169.png 700w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-120x29.png 120w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-768x185.png 768w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-1536x371.png 1536w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-2048x494.png 2048w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-720x174.png 720w, https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image5-1440x347.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px"><figcaption>The Eloquent T-Menu uses swipe gestures for cut and paste. It also has no hierarchy and just slides off screen</figcaption></figure>



<h3><strong>Game-like animations</strong></h3>



<p>We added several small visual animations to help users learn and understand what is going on:</p>



<ol>
<li>The text cursor ‘scoots’ between locations and the handle ‘wobbles’ when it arrives. We did this to reinforce the idea that the cursor was always there. It also implied you could always drag it.</li>



<li>The cursor also ‘dimples’ when you tap, invoking the magnifier briefly. The goal here is to encourage users to do more than just tap. We were trying to encourage dragging.</li>



<li>When a force-press occurs over a word, we ‘inflate’ the highlight, reinforcing the gesture.</li>



<li>Swipe menu gestures animate the selection in the direction of the swipe. Swipe up for cut removes the selection upwards. Swipe down for paste, drops the new selection down.</li>
</ol>

<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://jenson.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/eloquent-drag.gif" alt="" width="540" height="160"><figcaption>Scoot, wobble, dimple, and magnifier drag animations</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3><strong>Backward compatibility</strong></h3>



<p>We made a concerted effort to make today’s existing actions possible in this new model, as we wanted to provide a bridge for existing users. For example, by making tap and drag ALWAYS drag the cursor wouldn’t work for large vertically scrolling text fields. So we did a simple check on drag-start and if it the first few pixels were vertical, we’d do a standard vertical scroll of the text field. All other drags just placed and dragged the cursor. It actually worked quite well.</p>



<p>Enough text, here is a quick demo that shows it off much better:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Eloquent: Improving Text Editing on Mobile" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_9YPm0EghvU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2>Shipping this</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, shipping something like Eloquent would be challenging. First, as too many people mistakenly see text editing as “done”, there is little appetite to fix it. Second, users have been trained to cope with this error-prone approach for well over a decade. Asking people to change at this point would be hard.</p>



<p>But most importantly, fixing text editing isn’t seen as important enough in the war between Android and iOS. It’s not the flashy feature that shifts your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_promoter_score">Net Promoter Scores</a>. What I find ironic is that a fundamental change, like fixing text editing, could make people feel much more at ease using their phones  and could be an enormous reason to switch. But it would be a slow burn and take years of steady effort. Android just can’t think this way. Apple just might.</p>



<p>It’s too bad, because I’d like mobile to grow and be even more productive than desktops are today. But the way we’re going, we’ll be editing text this way for the next 20 years at least. Do we really want this? Too bad text editing is an invisible problem no one appreciates.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-supported-configurations" dir="auto"><a href="#supported-configurations"></a><a name="user-content-supported-configs">Supported Configurations</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">This project was built with support of WDM, KMDF, and UMDF drivers in mind, as well as Win32 Services. This includes support for all versions of WDF included in WDK 22H2 and newer. Currently, the crates available on <a href="https://crates.io/" rel="nofollow"><code>crates.io</code></a> only support KMDF v1.33, but bindings can be generated for everything else by cloning <code>windows-drivers-rs</code> and modifying the config specified in <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/windows-drivers-rs/blob/main/crates/wdk-sys/build.rs"><code>build.rs</code> of <code>wdk-sys</code></a>. Crates.io support for other WDK configurations is planned in the near future.</p>

The fine comes after a long-running antitrust court battle <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/intel-gets-fined-145-billion-dollars-by-the-eu/">dating back to 2009</a> when the Commission initially fined Intel a record $1.13 billion for abuse of dominance.</p>

<p>While some of Intel's actions, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/intel-wins-major-battle-as-court-overturns-12-billion-fine-for-anticompetitive-practices/">like hidden rebates</a>, were dropped on appeal due to lack of evidence of harm, the Commission upheld that Intel paid PC manufacturers to delay or limit products using AMD processors.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Commission cited examples where Intel paid HP not to sell AMD-powered business PCs to small and medium businesses through direct channels from 2002-2005. It also paid Acer to delay the launch of an AMD-based notebook from late 2003 to early 2004. Intel also paid Lenovo to push back the launch of AMD notebooks by six months.</p>

                            <!-- PLACE THIS SECTION INSIDE OF YOUR BODY WHERE YOU WANT THE VIDEO PLAYER TO RENDER -->
            <p>According to the General Court, by placing these conditions on payments, Intel was able to limit the competitive threat posed by AMD desktops in key market segments.</p>

<p>The Commission said the new €376 million fine reflects that Intel hindered the development and expansion of its main competitors in the x86 CPU market during nearly 5 years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As a result of those restrictions, computer manufacturers halted, delayed or placed restrictions on the commercialisation of products based on a competitor's chipsets, which they had actively planned and for which there was consumer demand.</p>

<p>Intel's naked restrictions therefore had a detrimental effect on competition in the market, by depriving customers of a choice which they would have otherwise had.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the fight is not over as the Commission has appealed the dismissal of the rebates part of the case. And Intel could still face more fines if the appeal court rules the rebates also violated competition laws. The €376 million fine is now set in stone as Intel did not appeal that ruling.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce the Cambridge Law Corpus (CLC), a corpus for legal AI research. It consists of over 250 000 court cases from the UK. Most cases are from the 21st century, but the corpus includes cases as old as the 16th century. This paper presents the first release of the corpus, containing the raw text and meta-data. Together with the corpus, we provide annotations on case outcomes for 638 cases, done by legal experts. Using our annotated data, we have trained and evaluated case outcome extraction with GPT-3, GPT-4 and RoBERTa models to provide benchmarks. We include an extensive legal and ethical discussion to address the potentially sensitive nature of this material. As a consequence, the corpus will only be released for research purposes under certain restrictions.

is all Bottlerocket aims to do.
Many of the packages, tools, interpreters, and dependencies installed by default in general purpose Linux distributions are simply not needed to only host containers.
By excluding these extraneous pieces of software, your <strong>operational and security overhead is reduced</strong>.</p><p>Bottlerocket manages complexity and requirements for different orchestrators, platforms, and architectures into specific builds for every compatible combination called <strong>variants</strong>.
This ensures that your operating system is tailor made for that set of requirements.</p><div><p><svg width="100%" viewBox="0 0 330 150" id="svg3585" inkscape:version="1.2.1 (9c6d41e, 2022-07-14)"

Should something go awry during an update, the Bottlerocket update system lets you revert to the previously working version with your settings intact.</p><p>Bottlerocket updates can be managed manually or with the help of Bottlerocket’s orchestrator-specific tools: <a href="https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-update-operator">Bottlerocket Update Operator (brupop)</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-ecs-updater">ECS updater</a>.</p></div><a id="td-block-4"></a><div><h2 id="security-focused">Security Focused</h2><p>Being both minimal and updatable underlie important aspects of Bottlerocket’s focus on security.
The use of variants delivered by an image means that there is <strong>no requirement for a package registry or manager</strong> that can mutate the system and introduce security issues.</p><p>Bottlerocket’s <strong>unique functionality is written in Rust</strong> and a little bit of Golang.
Both are compiled languages with built-in protection against <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/fearless-security-memory-safety/">memory</a> <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF">safety</a> issues.

<p><em>This blog article is part of the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20s-people/">20sPeople season</a> – a season of exhibitions, activities and events from The National Archives that explores and shares stories that connect the people of the 2020s with the people of the 1920s.</em></p>



<p>With today’s release of the new film adaptation of Agatha Christie’s 1937 novel, <em>Death on the Nile</em>, I’m taking another look at one of the most bizarre events in the famous crime novelist’s life. On the evening of Friday 3 December 1926, Agatha Christie left her home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, got into her car and disappeared into the night. Her disappearance sparked a manhunt involving the police, members of the public and famous figures and was lapped up by the tabloid press. This strange series of events was worthy of her own works of fiction; however, unlike the mysteries solved by Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple, this one was never fully explained. Records held at The National Archives give us a unique insight into the strange events of December 1926.</p>



<p>Agatha Christie’s career was at its height at the end of 1926. Her sixth novel, <em>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</em>, had been published earlier that year and her first collection of short stories featuring the character of Hercule Poirot had been published two years previously. Christie’s personal life was less happy, however. Her husband Archibald Christie (Archie) had been having an affair with a woman called Nancy Neele and in August, he asked Agatha for a divorce. Following an argument between husband and wife on 3 December, Archie left to spend the weekend with friends. Later that night Agatha kissed her daughter Rosalind goodnight as she lay sleeping, left the house and drove away in her Morris Cowley. The next day, the car was discovered abandoned above a chalk quarry at Newlands Corner, and some of her clothes were found inside. The police reported that:</p>



<blockquote><p>‘The car was found in such a position as to indicate that some unusual proceeding had taken place, the Car being found half-way down a grassy slope well off the main road with its bonnet buried in some bushes, as if it had got out of control. In the Car was found a Fur Coat, a Dressing Case containing various articles of ladies wearing apparel, and a driving licence indicating that the owner was Mrs. Agatha Christie of Sunningdale, Berks.’</p><cite>The National Archives, Agatha Christie: search by police and civilian volunteers when her car was found abandoned, 1927. Catalogue ref: HO 45/25904</cite></blockquote>

<p>Many assumed the worst, and a police investigation began to find the missing woman. A man who had seen Agatha Christie that night reported that she was ‘sparsely dressed for such an inclement morning, and that she appeared strange in her manner.’  <a title="The National Archives, Agatha Christie: search by police and civilian volunteers when her car was found abandoned, 1927. Catalogue ref: HO 45/25904." id="return-note-56002-1" href="#note-56002-1"><sup>1</sup></a> </p>



<p>The disappearance was also widely reported in the newspapers, and concerned members of the public joined the search. Journalists put forward a range of theories to explain her disappearance. Some suggested she had drowned herself, others that she had been murdered by her husband. And still others claimed the whole turn of events was nothing more than a publicity stunt to promote her novels. Some prominent figures joined the efforts to find her. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was a keen spiritualist, even consulted a medium to attempt to solve the mystery of her disappearance. <a title="Kent &amp; Sussex Courier, 24 December 1926, The British Newspaper Archive (Accessed 6 February 2022)." id="return-note-56002-2" href="#note-56002-2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Finally, 11 days later on the 14 December, a member of the public recognised her staying at the Swan Hydro hotel in Harrogate. She had checked in under the name of her husband’s mistress. She was suffering with memory loss and could give no account of the preceding 11 days or any reasons for her actions. Her biographer Andrew Norman argues that she was in a ‘fugue’ state caused by trauma or depression <a title="Andrew Norman, Agatha Christie: The Finished Portrait, History Press (2010)." id="return-note-56002-3" href="#note-56002-3"><sup>3</sup></a>; however, others still believed that her actions were deliberate and perhaps designed to cause distress and embarrassment to her husband.</p>



<p>Following Christie’s reappearance, there were concerns in some quarters that the police response had been excessive and that time and money had been wasted on the search for her. This was partly due to inaccurate press reports that aeroplanes, divers and multiple police forces had been involved. On 25 February, Mr Neil Maclean, MP for Glasgow Govan, put a question to the Home Secretary asking for information on ‘the number of the Metropolitan police specially detailed for the search for Mrs Agatha Christie; the time occupied; and the total cost, including the wages of the officers so detailed.’ <a title="H C Deb (25 February 1927). Vol. 202. Available at https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/1927-02-25/debates/3971de95-953e-48d5-96f5-b8e0581579b7/MrsAChristie(Search) (Accessed: 6 February 2022)." id="return-note-56002-4" href="#note-56002-4"><sup>4</sup></a>  </p>



<p>Documents relating to this question can be found in a Home Office file held at The National Archives. The written answer from the Home Secretary was that ‘No members of the Metropolitan Police were specially detailed for the purpose, and no cost was incurred by the Metropolitan Police. A description of the missing person was published in Information in the usual way.’ <a title="The National Archives, Agatha Christie: search by police and civilian volunteers when her car was found abandoned, 1927.

<p>This response was informed by a letter from the Deputy Chief Constable of the Surrey Constabulary, William Kenward, dated 9 February 1927. In it, he detailed the actions taken by the police in response to the disappearance and made clear that press reports had exaggerated the actual police response.</p>



<blockquote><p>‘The number of police said to have been engaged has been greatly exaggerated, and I received invaluable assistance from the public generally. The aeroplanes which are said to have taken part in the search are nothing to do with the police. There is no doubt that a good deal of press matter circulated in connection with the case was without foundation.’</p></blockquote>



<p>He also explained why the actions taken were justified by the potential danger that the missing woman could have faced following her disappearance.</p>



<blockquote><p>‘The lady disappeared under circumstances which opened out all sorts of possibilities – she might have been wandering with loss of memory over that vast open country around Newlands Corner, or she might have fallen down one of the numerous gravel pits that abound there and are covered in most instances with undergrowth and lying helpless in agony, or she might have been as was strongly suggested to the police, the victim of a serious crime. Under no circumstances could the police of this district have justified any inaction in the matter.’</p></blockquote>



<p>Agatha’s husband, Archie Christie, responded to enquiries about his wife’s state of mind by explaining that she was suffering from a nervous disorder and memory loss. The police approached him to request a contribution towards police costs, but he refused saying it was ‘entirely a police matter’. <a title="The National Archives, Agatha Christie: search by police and civilian volunteers when her car was found abandoned, 1927.

<p>It may never be known whether Agatha Christie’s disappearance was due to the psychological effects of the depression she was suffering from, or whether there were other reasons. However, the breakdown of her marriage to Archie Christie was no doubt a traumatic experience. The couple finally divorced in 1928 and Archie went on to marry his mistress, Nancy Neele.</p>

<p>The sudden disappearance of Agatha Christie in December 1926 gave the British public a real-life taste of the kind of mystery she had shared with them in her stories. And this probably explains why the incident caught the imagination of so many at the time.</p>



<p>Despite this dramatic episode in her life, Agatha Christie went on to continued success in crime fiction, going on to publish over 60 more novels and numerous short stories. She is still today the best-selling novelist of all time, having sold over a billion copies of her books in the English language <a title="HarperCollins Publishers, ‘Agatha Christie’ (accessed 6 February 2022)." id="return-note-56002-7" href="#note-56002-7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Her wonderful stories, along with their many television and film adaptions, have brought joy to millions around the world.</p>

<p>The dreaded rat lungworm—a parasite with a penchant for rats and slugs that occasionally finds itself rambling and writhing in human brains—has firmly established itself in the Southeast US and will likely continue its rapid invasion, <a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/10/23-0706_article">a study published this week</a> suggests.</p>
<p>The study involved small-scale surveillance of dead rats in the Atlanta zoo. Between 2019 and 2022, researchers continually turned up evidence of the worm. In all, the study identified seven out of 33 collected rats (21 percent) with evidence of a rat lungworm infection. The infected animals were spread throughout the study's time frame, all in different months, with one in 2019, three in 2021, and three in 2022, indicating sustained transmission.</p>
<p>Although small, the study "suggests that the zoonotic parasite was introduced to and has become established in a new area of the southeastern United States," the study's authors, led by researchers at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine, concluded. The study was published Wednesday in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>The finding is concerning given the calamitous infection the rat lungworm, aka <em>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</em>, can cause in humans. The parasitic nematodes are, as their name suggests, typically found in rats. But they have a complicated life cycle, which can be deadly when disrupted.</p>
<h2>Sickening cycle</h2>
<p>Normally, adult worms live in the arteries around a rat's lungs—hence rat lungworm. There, they mate and lay eggs. The worm's larvae then burst out of the lungs, get coughed up by the rat, and are swallowed and eventually pooped out. From there, the larvae are picked up by slugs or snails. This can happen if the gastropods eat the rat poop or if the ravenous larvae just bore into their soft bodies. The larvae then develop in the slugs and snails, which, ideally, are eventually eaten by rats. Back in a rat, the late-stage larvae penetrate the intestines, enter the bloodstream, and migrate to the rat's central nervous system and brain. There they mature into sub-adults then migrate to the lungs, where they become full adults and mate, thus completing the cycle.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Humans become accidental hosts in various ways. They may eat undercooked snails or inadvertently eat an infected slug or snail hiding in their unwashed salad. Infected snails and slugs can also be eaten by other animals first, like frogs, prawns, shrimp, or freshwater crabs. If humans then eat those animals before fully cooking them, they can become infected.</p>

<p>When a rat lungworm finds itself in a human, it does what it usually does in rats—it heads to the central nervous system and brain. Sometimes the migration of the worms to the central nervous system is asymptomatic or only causes mild transient symptoms. But, sometimes, they cause severe neurological dysfunction. This can start with nonspecific symptoms like headache, light sensitivity, and insomnia and develop into neck stiffness and pain, tingling or burning of the skin, double vision, bowel or bladder difficulties, and seizures. In severe cases, it can cause nerve damage, paralysis, coma, and even death.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-moor-lambdamoo-all-over-again" dir="auto"><a href="#moor-lambdamoo-all-over-again">'moor'; lambdaMOO all over again.</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">"Moor" is a multi-user, programmable server, coded in Rust, designed to be able to run the original LambdaMOO core as a starting point, with various improvements at the server level to provide a more modern foundation for future development.</p>
<p dir="auto">LambdaMOO is a MUD -- aka a shared, multi-user, text-based virtual world -- that first opened to the public in 1990 and is still in operation.  LambdaMOO was and remains unusual in that it is a highly programmable, persistent-world MUD.  In particular, LambdaMOO provides a dynamically programmable environment ("live coding" similar to Smalltalk) that supports programming by many users.</p>
<p dir="auto">Unlike many MUDs, LambdaMOO is not solely focused on role playing games, although its programmability has enabled users to develop RPGs implemented inside LambdaMOO.)</p>
<p dir="auto">Chances are if you landed here you already know all this, but I have a blurb here
<a href="https://github.com/rdaum/moor/blob/main/doc/lambda-background.md">here</a> briefly summarizing more about LambdaMOO and why it's interesting.</p>
<p dir="auto">(note: "moor" name is provisional and awful, alternative suggestions accepted)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-project-goals--status" dir="auto"><a href="#project-goals--status">Project goals / status</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The intent here is to start out at least fully compatible with LambdaMOO 1.8.x series and to be able to read and
execute existing cores, and the 1.0 feature release is targeting this rather ambitious but also rather restricted goal.
(Primarily to maintain focus so I don't get distracted by the shiny things I've wanted to do for the last 30 years.)</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-lambdamoo-is-30-years-old-why-remain-compatible" dir="auto"><a href="#lambdamoo-is-30-years-old-why-remain-compatible">LambdaMOO is 30+ years old, why remain compatible?</a></h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Because it's easy to go into the weeds creating new things, and never finishing. By having a concrete goal, and something
to compare and test against, I may actually get somewhere.</li>
<li>Because the <em>actual</em> useful and hard parts of those old MOO-type systems was the "user-space" type pieces (like
LambdaCore/JHCore etc) and by making a new system run those old cores, there's more win.</li>
<li>Because LambdaMOO itself is actually a very <em>complicated system with a lot of moving parts</em>. There's a compiler,<br>
an object database, a virtual machine, a decompiler, and a network runtime all rolled into one. This, is, in some
way... fun.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-current-status--features" dir="auto"><a href="#current-status--features">Current status / features</a></h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pretty much feature complete / compatible with LambdaMOO 1.8.1 with a few caveats (see below)</li>
<li>Can load and run LambdaMOO 1.8.x cores.</li>
<li>Have tested against JaysHouseCore, and most of the functionality is there. Bugs are becoming increasingly rare.</li>
<li>Hosts websocket, "telnet" (classic line oriented TCP connection), and console connections. MCP clients work, with
remove editing, etc.</li>
<li>Objects are stored in a concurrent transactional object database -- safe, consistent and happy. The architecture
allows for cleanly adding different storage backends for new scenarios.</li>
<li>Monitoring/metrics support via Prometheus-compatible export.</li>
<li>Separate network-host vs daemon process architecture means that upgrades/restarts can happen in-place without
dropping live connections.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here's a screenshot of the <code>JaysHouseCore</code> world running in <code>moor</code>, connected to with the classic <code>rmoo</code> Emacs client,
editing a MOO verb:</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-how-do-i-use-it" dir="auto"><a href="#how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The easiest way to get started is to run the <code>docker compose</code> setup. This will bring up a complete server with <code>telnet</code>
and <code>websocket</code> interfaces. The server will be setup with an initial <code>JaysHouseCore</code> core import, and will be set up with
metrics monitoring via Grafana and VictoriaMetrics.</p>
<p dir="auto">To do this, take a look at the local <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, instructions are there, but it really just amounts to:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then connect (with your favourite MUD/MOO client) to <code>localhost:8888</code> and follow the login instauctions. Classic
clients like <code>TinyFugue</code> will work fine, and there are some newer clients like <a href="https://github.com/Blightmud/Blightmud">BlightMud</a>
that should work fine. (A partial -- and probably outdated list of clients -- can be found here: <a href="https://lisdude.com/moo/#clients" rel="nofollow">https://lisdude.com/moo/#clients</a>)</p>
<p dir="auto">Once you're familiar with how the docker setup works, you can get more creative.</p>
<p dir="auto">An actual production deployment can be fairly easily derived from the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, and the provided <code>Dockerfile</code>.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Because it's new and shiny and fun.</li>
<li>Because its codebase is more modern and easier to add to and maintain.</li>
<li>Because it's getting ongoing development.</li>
<li>Because it has an exciting future.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-missing--next-steps-before-10" dir="auto"><a href="#missing--next-steps-before-10">Missing / Next steps before 1.0</a></h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Bugs, bugs, bugs. Collect em' all.</li>
<li>Generally, open issues / missing features can be seen here: <a href="https://github.com/rdaum/moor/issues">https://github.com/rdaum/moor/issues</a> (but there are also
plenty of TODOs in the code not yet captured as issues.)</li>
<li>Major missing features:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Quota support.</li>
<li>Background tasks resumption after restart (from DB and from textdump load.)</li>
<li>Dump to a backup <code>textdump</code> format.</li>
<li><code>$do_command</code>; LambdaMOO has the ability to attempt execution of a command through
user code on <code>#0:do_command</code>; if that fails, it then dispatches through the regular
built-in command handler. I need to get around to this.</li>
<li><code>read</code>; This is used for prompts, password changes, editor, etc. It's slightly tricky
because of the 'transactional' nature of I/O in Moor where all verb and I/O operations
can be retried on transaction commit failure. Haven't decided what to do about this.</li>
<li>Actual transaction retry on commit-conflict. (Mainly because without actual users and stress testing I haven't
been able to provoke this scenario to test against yet. The hooks are there, just not done.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improvements needed:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Performance improvements. Especially caching at the DB layer is missing and this thing will run dog-slow
without it</li>
<li>Better auth (SSO, OAuth2, etc?). Better crypt/password support.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-unsupported-features-that-might-not-get-supported" dir="auto"><a href="#unsupported-features-that-might-not-get-supported">Unsupported features that might not get supported</a></h3>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>encode_binary</code> &amp; <code>decode_binary</code>:  These two functions allow for escaped binary
sequences along with a network option for sending them, etc.
But:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>moor</code>'s strings are utf8 so arbitrary byte sequences aren't going to cut it and</li>
<li>we're on a websocket, and have better ways of doing binary than encoding it into the
output.</li>
<li>The alternative will be to provide a <code>binary</code> type that can be used for this purpose
and to have special <code>notify</code> calls for emitting them to the client.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Network connections, outbound and inbound (e.g. <code>open_network_connection</code>, <code>listen</code>,<br>
<code>unlisten</code> etc). My intent is for the network service layer to be implemented at the Rust level, in the
server daemon, not in MOO code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-but-then" dir="auto"><a href="#but-then">But then...</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The following are targeted as eventual goals / additions once 1.0 (fall 2023) is out the door:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>A richer front-end experience. Support for websockets as a connection method means that the server can provide
a richer narrative stream to browsers (with in-core support assistance.) A client which provides a full proper
UI experience with interactive UI components, graphical elements, and so on are the end-goal here.</li>
<li>Support for multiple programming language for programming MOO verbs/objects. The backend has been written such that
this is feasible. Authoring verbs in JavaScript/TypeScript will be the first target, and WebAssembly modules are
also a possibility. These verbs would still run within the same shared environment and use the same shared object
environment, but would allow for a more modern programming experience.</li>
<li>A more scalable server architecture; the system right now is divided into separate "host" frontends for network<br>
connections, and a common backend <code>daemon</code> which manages the database, virtual machine, and task scheduler. This
can be further split up to permit a distributed database backend or distributing other components, to meet higher
scalability goals if that is needed.</li>
<li>Enhancements to the MOO data model and language, to support a richer / smoother authoring experience. Some ideas
are:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Datalog-style relations / predicates; for managing logical relationships between entities. This could allow
bidirectional (or more) relationships like already exist with e.g. <code>location</code>/<code>contents</code>, but more generalized,
and to allow for making complex worlds easier to maintain.</li>
<li>Adding a map/dictionary type. MOO predates the existence of dictionary types as a standard type in most languages.<br>
MOO's type system only has lists and uses "associative lists" for maps, which are a bit awkward. Immutable/CoW
maps with an explicit syntax would be a nice addition. Other MOO offshoots (Stunt, etc.) do already provided this.</li>
<li>Adding a <code>binary</code> type. MOO's type system is very string-oriented, and there's not an elegant way to represent
arbitrary binary data. (There's <code>encode_binary</code> and <code>decode_binary</code> builtins, but these are not the way I'd do it
today.)</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>

Children are taught never to speak to unknown grown-ups, especially those regarded by their parents as untrustworthy. The onset of adolescence and young adulthood brings a bursting desire to interact with all sorts of people, particularly the kind who might not elicit family approval. Whether the resulting encounters are sexual or social, they confer a thrilling frisson of escape.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <p><span>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</span></p></div><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/081%20Books%20and%20arts%20-%20Social%20skills-e79a073e6bb3a642db7e9fce5f866128.mp3" title="The vital art of talking to strangers" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p>Social circles generally narrow again as people find life-partners, form households and produce offspring of their own. Time becomes scarce; new friendships are often based on sharing the burden of child care. Some people never recover the youthful zest for unforeseen liaisons. Professional duties swell even as parental ones diminish, and the inclination sags. In old age, even if curiosity and charisma remain undimmed, frailty makes new serendipitous connections harder to establish.</p><p>But that is not the whole story. In mid-life and beyond people can still experience the joy of a random meeting, however short, which somehow touches a nerve. That might involve nothing more than a smile, or a chance remark that hits an emotional spot; or it might be an unexpectedly deep conversation on a plane or train, a surge of mutual understanding that is life-affirming even if the interlocutor is never seen again. This aspect of the promise and peril of strangers has enticed storytellers—from the rapture of “Brief Encounter” and “Before Sunrise” to the ruin of “Strangers on a Train”. The knowledge that the exchange will be a one-off can permit a delicious, uninhibited frankness.</p><p>In the age of covid-19 and Zoom, the chronological pattern has been warped. Instead of their hazy possibilities and risks, strangers have assumed an all-too-literal role as a looming source of infection. During lockdowns they are officially to be avoided. Yet youngsters still long, dangerously, for the ecstasy of communion, not just with edgy individuals but anonymous crowds. People of all ages have come to miss the human stimulation of busy high streets or trains, or the comforting sense of fellowship in a cinema or theatre audience.</p><p>So this is an apt moment for three books about meeting strangers. Will Buckingham has written a moving memoir of finding solace, after the death of his life-partner, in travelling and talking in lands such as Myanmar that are culturally distant from his native England. Joe Keohane, an American journalist, argues that communicating empathetically with strangers is vital and potentially life-changing. Jon Yates, who runs a youth charity based in London, frets that deep fissures in Western societies are making it impossible for people to reach, even casually, between classes, religions, ethnicities and generations.</p><p>All three authors make sweeping generalisations about the evolution of human society, from hunter-gatherers to the age of Homer and beyond. But they are more interesting when they reflect, using personal experience or scientific research, on how people live and communicate now. In different ways, they all make two separate but related points. First, interacting meaningfully with a new person can bring huge rewards—but it is a skill that must be cultivated and can easily be lost. Second, the self-segregation of modern Western societies means that, for many people, conversing with some fellow citizens seems pointless, undesirable or outlandish. The second problem exacerbates the first: if you consider others beyond the pale, why make the effort to get to know them?</p><p>As both Mr Keohane and Mr Yates emphasise, in Britain and America political divisions have ossified into tribal ones. Supporters and opponents of Brexit live in discrete clusters; Republicans and Democrats see each other as bad people, not fellow Americans whose opinions happen to differ. These opposing sides have become strangers to one another. Mr Buckingham focuses on the pleasures and pitfalls of encounters in remote places where the stakes are lower because the acquaintanceships are bound to be temporary—in a holiday flat-share in Helsinki or while travelling through the Balkans. But, like the other two, he notes that wariness of unfamiliar people is neither new nor insuperable.</p><h2>Faces look ugly when you’re alone</h2><p>Mr Keohane and Mr Yates offer tips on befriending strangers. Mr Keohane describes exercises in which groups of Republicans and Democrats were, with great difficulty, coaxed to overcome stereotypes and see one another as rounded individuals. They were trained to ask each other good questions and avoid name-calling. Mr Yates discusses the case for a kind of national social service that would encourage youngsters to mix with other groups and generations. Both have homely micro-solutions that readers can apply in daily relations—assume the best of others, remember that most have stories they are longing to tell, react philosophically when a friendly approach is rebuffed.</p><p>A telling point that none of the books captures is a paradoxical one: some of the most sophisticated forms of interaction between strangers occur in societies that are chronically divided. Think, for example, of rural Northern Ireland, or of parts of the former Ottoman Empire, such as Lebanon, where residents have lived in separate communal silos. In ways impenetrable to outsiders, the denizens of such places develop perfect antennae for the affiliation of a stranger and adjust their remarks accordingly. The ensuing exchanges occur within well-understood parameters—including a sense that social categories are resilient and pleasantries will not change them. But tact allows people from antagonistic camps to have amicable encounters and transactions.</p><p>All three authors are inclined to overstate the ability of brief interactions to stave off conflict. Yet at least this much is true: a capacity to engage with new people in civilised, humane and meaningful ways is a necessary condition for social peace, even if it is not a sufficient one. That points up a half-hidden cost of covid-19. Children educated on screen; teenagers bouncing off the walls; adults working at home; lonely pensioners: more or less everyone’s social skills have been atrophying, with consequences not only for individuals but, perhaps, for the fabric of society.</p><p>As lockdowns lift, people are now stumbling back into a world of accidental collisions, some eagerly, some queasily, most with an odd sensation of novelty after a year of hibernation. The lesson of these books is that the easing of restrictions is not just a coveted opportunity to reconnect with those you love and resemble. It also restores a freedom, long taken for granted even if little used, to come to know the profoundly different. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline "The comfort of strangers"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/culture/">Culture</a> <span>July 10th 2021</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/07/10/the-vital-art-of-talking-to-strangers"><span>The vital art of talking to strangers</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/07/08/the-spectacular-rise-and-fall-of-an-investors-darling"><span>The spectacular rise and fall of an investors’ darling</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2021/07/10/longing-to-travel-a-chronicle-of-sicily-will-make-it-worse"><span>Longing to travel?

Today: Can you put plastic in the microwave?</em></p><p>It all started by accident. Kazi Albab Hussain, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, was studying <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7022296/" target="_blank">silver nanoparticles</a> released by certain types of plastic food packaging when he noticed another confetti-like substance under the microscope: tiny plastic bits.</p><p>As a new father he became preoccupied by the discovery. “I’d been exposed to a whole new world, and I was worried to see that a lot of baby foods were stored in plastic,” he says. So Hussain shifted gears in his research. He wanted to know: Just how many of these particles was his child eating?</p><p>Quite possibly billions, according to his <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.3c01942" target="_blank">findings</a>. To test materials widely used in baby food packaging, Hussain brought a couple of store-bought polypropylene-based reusable plastic containers and a polyethylene-based reusable plastic food pouch back to his lab. Along with his team, he filled the storage vessels with water and 3% acetic acid to mimic the aqueous and acidic foods they might reasonably contain in real life. After storing the filled containers in the fridge or at room temperature for 10 days, the team found millions to billions of microplastics and nanoplastics in the liquids.</p><p><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-to-microwave-food" target="_blank">Microwaving</a> the containers accelerated the process by an alarming magnitude: Within three minutes, some containers released as many as 4.22 million <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/microplastics-food" target="_blank">microplastics</a> (particles smaller than 5 millimeters) and 2.11 billion nanoplastics (particles about 70 times smaller than the width of a human hair) per square centimeter of surface area. Hussain’s research indicates we’re eating a lot more plastic than previously believed. In 2019 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/2266/" target="_blank">one study</a> calculated we might be ingesting about 50,000 microplastic particles per year.</p><p>The health impacts of eating plastic is still unclear, but researchers have long suspected they’re not great. And <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34185251/" target="_blank">growing evidence</a> suggests high exposure to microplastics (and the lengthy list of chemicals they’re made from) could provoke immune and stress responses, along with various reproductive, metabolic, and behavioral issues.</p><p>Given the mounting concern around one of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/human-made-stuff-now-outweighs-all-life-on-earth/#:~:text=About%20half%20of%20the%20world's,19%20percent%20of%20the%20total." target="_blank">earth’s most-produced substances</a>, Hussain’s findings beg a timely question: Can you put plastic in the microwave?</p><h2>What does microwaving do to plastic?</h2><p>Plastics are spaghetti-like chains of carbon molecules, called polymers, which are usually derived from crude oil. To make plastics that are clear, cloudy, rigid, or soft, manufacturers add a cocktail of chemicals. Though there are <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.est.1c00976" target="_blank">more than 10,000 of them</a>, the most well-studied groups are: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/bisphenol" target="_blank">bisphenols</a> (which include <a data-offer-url="https://www.consumerreports.org/bpa/bpa-exposure-may-be-much-greater-than-previously-believed/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/bpa/bpa-exposure-may-be-much-greater-than-previously-believed/&quot;}" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/bpa/bpa-exposure-may-be-much-greater-than-previously-believed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BPA</a> and are often found in rigid products, like food storage containers and water pipes) and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157593/" target="_blank">phthalates</a> (which are typically used to make <a data-offer-url="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/fda-denies-petition-to-ban-all-phthalates-in-food-packaging-a8313932149/#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20found%20in%20products,milk%20cartons%20and%20juice%20boxes." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/fda-denies-petition-to-ban-all-phthalates-in-food-packaging-a8313932149/#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20found%20in%20products,milk%20cartons%20and%20juice%20boxes.&quot;}" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/fda-denies-petition-to-ban-all-phthalates-in-food-packaging-a8313932149/#:~:text=Phthalates%20are%20found%20in%20products,milk%20cartons%20and%20juice%20boxes." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more flexible products</a>, such as food prep gloves or the plastic lining inside a milk carton).</p><p>As Hussain found, microplastics and chemicals can build up in your leftovers over time—even when you’re storing those plastic containers in the fridge. But microwaving wet foods in plastic delivers <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/for-the-love-of-god-stop-microwaving-plastic/#:~:text=Microwaving%20delivers%20a%20double%20whammy,chemical%20components%20of%20the%20plastic." target="_blank">an even bigger one-two punch</a>: Heat speeds up hydrolysis, the process by which water molecules can essentially break chemical bonds apart. This supercharged reaction causes plastic containers to shed microplastics and nanoplastics, as well as leach chemical additives (the bisphenols, phthalates, and more), into your food. And once those microplastics are ingested, it’s possible they can degrade and also <a data-offer-url="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know#:~:text=Once%20in%20the%20body%2C%20these,inflammation%2C%20or%20other%20unknown%20effects." data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know#:~:text=Once%20in%20the%20body%2C%20these,inflammation%2C%20or%20other%20unknown%20effects.&quot;}" href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/news/20221028/microplastics-health-risks-what-do-we-really-know#:~:text=Once%20in%20the%20body%2C%20these,inflammation%2C%20or%20other%20unknown%20effects." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">leach chemicals in the body</a>.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In other words, heating plastic essentially makes it softer and more porous. If you’ve ever microwaved marinara sauce in a plastic bowl, you’ve seen the sunset red, impossible-to-remove stain it leaves behind. “Passages in the plastic can open up, so the sauce gets inside,” says James Rogers, PhD the director of food safety research and testing at <a data-offer-url="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/5-things-our-food-safety-expert-would-never-do-a1091094520/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/5-things-our-food-safety-expert-would-never-do-a1091094520/&quot;}" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/5-things-our-food-safety-expert-would-never-do-a1091094520/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><em>Consumer Reports</em></a>. The opposite exchange happens too: “If something goes in, something can also come out,” he says.</p><h2>Are those chemicals and microplastics unsafe?</h2><p>Just about all Americans have measurable amounts of <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/sperm-count-zero" target="_blank">phthalates</a> and <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/sya-bpa/index.cfm" target="_blank">BPA</a> in their bodies. Mammalian animal studies strongly suggest that, once inside, these chemicals act like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4702494/" target="_blank">sneaky gatecrashers at a masquerade ball</a>. They’re not welcome at the party, but they’re also tough to parse from the legitimate guests.</p><p>That’s because bisphenols and phthalates are <a data-offer-url="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/plastics-edcs-and-health" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/plastics-edcs-and-health&quot;}" href="https://www.endocrine.org/topics/edc/plastics-edcs-and-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">endocrine disruptors</a>. They can mimic, block, or interfere with the body’s hormones—possibly increasing the risk of various conditions, including <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0303720721002598?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">infertility</a>, some cancers, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7437820/" target="_blank">metabolic diseases</a>, neurological conditions, and immune system dysfunction. According to Laura N. Vandenberg, PhD, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, “That’s just the short list.”</p><p>Various human studies have also reinforced the animal ones. Exposure to high phthalate levels in the womb has been linked to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30338578/" target="_blank">asthma</a> in childhood. For boys, that early contact could cause <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC5915182/" target="_blank">behavioral problems</a> as well as potentially lower <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412018303404?via%253Dihub" target="_blank">sperm counts</a> later in life. Pregnant people might experience <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29606598" target="_blank">lower thyroid hormone levels</a> and more <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31220737/" target="_blank">preterm births</a>.</p><p>There’s a lot more that we don’t know. At Duke University, Jason Somarelli, PhD, the director of research at the Duke Comparative Oncology Group, is studying the thousands of other additives in plastics. “We’ve found at least 100 known carcinogens in these other chemicals,” he says. “And then there’s well over 2,000 others where we just don’t have enough data to know.” What he can say with confidence: “There’s bad stuff in plastic.”</p><p>Beyond the chemicals being leached by plastics, the particles themselves—which have been discovered in human <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2023/8/18/microplastics-found-in-human-hearts" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2023/8/18/microplastics-found-in-human-hearts&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/blog/2023/8/18/microplastics-found-in-human-hearts" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hearts</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/detection-of-plastics-in-human-blood" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/detection-of-plastics-in-human-blood&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/detection-of-plastics-in-human-blood" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bloodstreams</a>, <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-found-in-human-lungs" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-found-in-human-lungs&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-found-in-human-lungs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lungs</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33395930/" target="_blank">placentas</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969723013293" target="_blank">semen</a>, and <a data-offer-url="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-in-breastmilk" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-in-breastmilk&quot;}" href="https://www.plasticpollutioncoalition.org/resource-library/microplastics-in-breastmilk" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">breastmilk</a>—pose a threat too.

That can trigger an immune response: Because plastics can’t be degraded, white blood cells die in the battle, causing inflammation. Those particles can also “act as transport vehicles for other pollutants,” says Vandenberg, bringing potentially toxic substances into the body.</p><p>Hussain wanted to see for himself what microplastics and nanoplastics might do inside our bodies. His team bathed human embryonic kidney cells in high concentrations of plastics shed by the containers they were testing. Within 48 hours, 76% of embryonic kidney cells died—about three times more than the percentage of cells that spent the same amount of time in a more diluted (less plastic-y) solution. Hussain’s findings corroborate <a data-offer-url="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/microplastics-harmful-human-cells/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/microplastics-harmful-human-cells/&quot;}" href="https://www.york.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/2021/research/microplastics-harmful-human-cells/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">another study</a> published last year, which determined that direct microplastic exposure can cause cell death, inflammation, and oxidative stress.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>So, why aren’t the cells in our bodies dying en masse? “The big outstanding question is uptake,” says Somarelli. “If these plastics just get in our guts and we flush most of them out—if we’re all just walking around pooping and peeing out plastic all the time—then they will have potentially little effect.” That’s what Hussain hopes is happening too: “I would like to believe that our body is working on getting them out,” he says. But even if these particles and chemicals aren’t making us sick immediately, most experts I spoke to suspect they could still have longer-term effects.</p><h2>But what if my container is “microwave-safe”?</h2><p>Though various plastics are marked as microwave-safe—and plenty of <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/02/18/east-palestine-plastic-industry-lobbying/" target="_blank">plastic lobbyists have defended them</a> as perfectly safe—the term is somewhat misleading. It’s simply referring to plastic types <a data-offer-url="https://scienceline.org/2022/09/is-it-safe-to-microwave-plastic-containers/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://scienceline.org/2022/09/is-it-safe-to-microwave-plastic-containers/&quot;}" href="https://scienceline.org/2022/09/is-it-safe-to-microwave-plastic-containers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">that won’t crack or melt when heated</a>, not their chemical makeup. Supposedly microwave-safe products can still contain bisphenols, phthalates, and plenty of other potentially harmful ingredients.</p><p>All of the experts I spoke with suggest people avoid storing and heating food in plastics altogether. “Without testing the entire landscape of these products, it is hard to really know” if any of them are truly safe, says Rogers. Though some types are known to pose more health risks than others. So, how can you identify them? Most plastics will have a number (one through seven) stamped somewhere on the surface, usually on the underside of the container. <a data-offer-url="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-microwave-plastic#types" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-microwave-plastic#types&quot;}" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/can-you-microwave-plastic#types" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The seven types include</a>:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/polyethylene-terephthalate" target="_blank">Polyethylene terephthalate</a> (PET or PETE): a semi-rigid plastic typically deployed as soda bottles, peanut butter jars, and clothing fibers.</li><li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/polyethylene#:~:text=High%2Ddensity%20polyethylene%20(HDPE),mechanical%20properties%20of%20PE%20material." target="_blank">High density polyethylene</a> (HDPE): the most commonly used plastic type.

These types of plastics usually have a low melting point, “which means that when you’re microwaving them, they’ll release chemicals even faster than harder plastics,” he says. Types three and seven are also the most likely categories to contain phthalates and bisphenols.</p><p>If he “was on a deserted island and [plastic] was all that was available,” Rogers says he’d opt for types two and five. These are both higher density formulas, used to contain liquids and manufacture items like the rigid plastic forks dispensed at your local takeout restaurant. They have a higher melting point, “and they also don’t tend to chip or shatter as much,” says Rogers. (Still, Hussain’s team found these types of containers shed plenty of microplastics when heated.)</p><p>Though the research into plastics is ongoing, the experts I spoke to agree that avoiding it wherever possible is worth the extra effort. “I tend to be pretty strict on this one,” says Rogers. “Personally, I avoid heating food in any plastic with an automatic default to <a data-offer-url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qg0g2UYETTfTRehMRFMSDD-W2DZ0QSWAUa5QJug91M/edit?usp=sharing" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://cna.st/affiliate-link/LfXDK5GmEGKZf93qiv9ySZFDrqYEPnU8JD28mFZJ4gFX327pUF4gUgB6Bo3FifpFrJAzHGjtx3pJHxjw2A6tB3qUQL1drwteQ6zF4gcVGfTU6XCawWeEPZdDqqc72asC7Bhi5iMh6hn2yuGUTHZhZkp7F7JYDkK9eRfMdQwPDjLaASqVuzPUwLkeZNcNw9kG4ukqe25NLrrGZQ4DL9i83FzLY&quot;}" href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/LfXDK5GmEGKZf93qiv9ySZFDrqYEPnU8JD28mFZJ4gFX327pUF4gUgB6Bo3FifpFrJAzHGjtx3pJHxjw2A6tB3qUQL1drwteQ6zF4gcVGfTU6XCawWeEPZdDqqc72asC7Bhi5iMh6hn2yuGUTHZhZkp7F7JYDkK9eRfMdQwPDjLaASqVuzPUwLkeZNcNw9kG4ukqe25NLrrGZQ4DL9i83FzLY" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">glassware</a>.” Beyond never microwaving food in plastic, Vandenberg hopes people simply stop using it.

<!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The “verified fan” concert ticket presale for pop sensation Olivia Rodrigo’s upcoming Guts Tour is today, and, yet again, it’s worth remembering that Ticketmaster stacks the deck heavily in favor of ticket scalpers, regardless of what the company says.</p><p>I’ve written about Ticketmaster and ticket scalping for more than a decade, and have covered various fiascos for fans, including the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7g45a/why-ticket-brokers-can-get-taylor-swift-tickets-ticketmaster-live-nation-monopoly?ref=404media.co">Taylor Swift Eras Tour</a>, the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7gx34/blink-182-tickets-are-so-expensive-because-ticketmaster-is-a-disastrous-monopoly-and-now-everyone-pays-ticket-broker-prices?ref=404media.co">recent Blink-182 tour</a>, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxjqz4/the-cure-tried-to-stop-scalpers-brokers-are-selling-entire-ticketmaster-accounts-instead?ref=404media.co">the Cure tour</a>. I have also reported on anti-scalping strategies implemented by Ticketmaster that, in practice, benefit scalpers. The main reason scalpers continue to get tickets and fans continue to be upset is because ticket scalpers are professional ticket buyers, who in many cases have navigated Ticketmaster’s buying process every day for years. The average music fan, meanwhile, might try to buy tickets a couple times a year at most, and doesn’t spend their days thinking of ways to optimize the ticket buying process. </p><p>Twitter is already <a href="https://twitter.com/ellaaimagine/status/1704214261948461493?ref=404media.co">full</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/scuderiaamy/status/1704665961855328581?ref=404media.co">fans</a> who are <a href="https://twitter.com/Scoby20/status/1704693527496581319?ref=404media.co">confused</a> about the onsale process for Olivia Rodrigo and are wondering why it took Ticketmaster so long to send out codes to buy them. It is also full of people who got waitlisted for tickets: “DEMAND IS HIGH,” Ticketmaster said in a tweet. “Fan response to Olivia Rodrigo’s GUTS world tour has been massive, and despite adding 20 more dates to better meet demand, there are still far more registered fans than tickets available.” </p><div><p>🎟️</p><p><strong>Do you know anything else about ticket scalping or Ticketmaster? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at +1 202 505 1702. Otherwise, send me an email at jason@404media.co.</strong></p></div><p>It is still unclear whether there’s even going to be a public sale for these tickets. With Taylor Swift, Ticketmaster canceled the public sale altogether. This system has the effect of making huge swaths of fans upset, but scalpers have figured out how to circumvent it. Here’s why scalpers are getting Olivia Rodrigo tickets, and you probably aren’t.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%9Cverified-fan%E2%80%9D">“Verified Fan” </h3><p>Olivia Rodrigo is using a system very similar to the one used by Taylor Swift, which Ticketmaster calls “Verified Fan.” This is essentially a weighted lottery in which people have to pre-register for a chance to buy tickets. Ticketmaster then uses an algorithm that is nominally tied to previous buying history, the age of an account, and the account’s geographic location to determine whether that account can have a chance to buy tickets for specific shows. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>The problem with this is that normal people have one Ticketmaster account tied to one email address and can therefore enter this lottery one time for one specific show. Serious ticket scalpers have many accounts (hundreds or thousands) tied to many different email addresses, with credit cards all over the country and can enter the lottery as many times as they want. As Joseph and I showed earlier this year, there is a black market for “aged” Ticketmaster accounts that are years old and might have a better chance of winning the Verified Fan lottery. Scalpers can buy “100 Phone Verified Ticketmaster Accounts” for $500 from a scalper-focused website, or they can buy “1,000 Phone Verified Ticketmaster Accounts.” </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-10.56.37-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1884" height="1476" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-10.56.37-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-10.56.37-AM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-10.56.37-AM.png 1600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-10.56.37-AM.png 1884w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>“All Accounts have been created with unique USA residential proxies. Unique password for each account. Will be creating accounts on your own catchall emails/gmails/hotmails/yahoos. We have not added billing info as you have to add your own credit + billing info,” one advertisement states.</p><p>One scalper I spoke to on the condition of anonymity to talk about industry practices told me that scalpers use these accounts to win Verified Fan lotteries.</p><p>But that scalper said they simply create their own Ticketmaster accounts. Ticketmaster now requires text message phone number verification, but they can bypass this by buying “Mobile Virtual Network Operator” phone numbers in bulk from eBay, which are cheap phone numbers that can be bought for SMS verification from very small cell phone companies and people who resell numbers from those companies . There are also services online and on eBay that sell “SMS verification” for the purposes of creating new accounts. “We provide a SMS verification code forwarding service to enable you to verify your online accounts such as social media / email / delivery / dating sites etc,” one eBay listing reads. This scalper then ages the accounts by letting them sit for a while, or by buying tickets on the accounts over time. </p><p>The sale of Ticketmaster accounts also lets scalpers sell tickets even when there are restrictions on scalping. Rather than selling the “tickets,” scalpers are <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxjqz4/the-cure-tried-to-stop-scalpers-brokers-are-selling-entire-ticketmaster-accounts-instead?ref=404media.co">selling the Ticketmaster accounts</a>, with the tickets inside of those accounts.</p><h3 id="credit-card-presales">Credit Card Presales</h3><p>Before the “Verified Fan” presale, there was a special presale on Wednesday for American Express credit card holders (for Swift, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/24/business/taylor-swift-tour-capital-one.html?ref=404media.co">credit card presale was for Capital One cardholders</a>). Credit card companies pay Ticketmaster and Live Nation so that their cardmembers can have exclusive access to tickets. Capital One also had an ad campaign with Swift. These credit card presales benefit scalpers, because serious ticket brokers have every sort of credit card, while every fan does not. </p><h3 id="specialized-internet-browsers-for-ticket-scalpers">Specialized Internet Browsers for Ticket Scalpers</h3><p>Tickets to popular events generally use a “virtual waiting room,” which is a lottery system on Ticketmaster’s website designed to prevent its servers from overloading. People are asked to open the event page at a certain time (usually 10 am local time) to get “in line” to buy tickets. Scalpers have the advantage here, too. The average fan opens a Chrome tab, goes to the event page, and gets in line one time. Each tab in Chrome is counted as the same “session,” and Ticketmaster’s software will sync those tabs up, meaning that regardless of how many tabs you have open, you can only be in line one time per browser. </p><p>Savvy fans who have been burned before might get in line a few times, by opening the event in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. They might even get in line on their phone, too. Big ticket brokers, meanwhile, pay hundreds or thousands of dollars to use one of three different broker-specific web browsers that are designed to help get through virtual waiting rooms quickly. </p><figure><img src="https://www.404media.co/content/images/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-11.02.27-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1167" srcset="https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-11.02.27-AM.png 600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-11.02.27-AM.png 1000w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-11.02.27-AM.png 1600w, https://www.404media.co/content/images/size/w2400/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-21-at-11.02.27-AM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>These browsers, called <a href="https://insomniacbrowser.com/?ref=404media.co">Insomniac</a>, <a href="https://www.privatetabs.com/?ref=404media.co">Private Tabs</a>, and <a href="https://www.kpx.ai/?ref=404media.co">KPX</a>, are programmed so that each tab is a different session. This means brokers can enter the virtual waiting room hundreds or thousands of times. “Every tab contains its own unique clean IP,” Private Tabs advertises. Insomniac offers a “Century View” where hundreds of tabs can be monitored at a time. Private Tabs costs $500 per month. Insomniac costs $400 per month. KPX, a new browser, costs $40 per month. </p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iclai1LfJr4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="FREE TRIALS, UNLIMITED PHONES, VIRTUAL CREDIT CARDS, AUTOMATED BILLING, SELF CLEANING IPS AND MORE."></iframe></figure><p>These browsers have additional features that automate the ticket buying process or make it easy to handle a variety of situations that anyone buying tickets will face. Private Tabs lets scalpers get SMS codes directly in the browser, lets them set “location-based IP addresses” per tab (Ticketmaster sometimes allows people who are geographically close into the waiting room first), and has various autofill options for scalpers. In a promotional video, the creator of Private Tabs says that “if you have like, eight monitors,” the browser will let scalpers monitor waiting rooms in all eight of them. “Most of our customers gross OVER 1 MILLION IN SALES their first year using our WEB BROWSER tools!,” Private Tabs advertises. “300k+ Waiting Rooms Passed,” KPX advertises.</p><p>Average fans do not pay for browsers like this.</p><h3 id="selling-tickets-before-they-go-on-sale">Selling Tickets Before They Go On Sale</h3><p>Yesterday, my mom forwarded me an email: “Olivia Rodrigo GUTS Tour: Tickets On Sale Now!,” the email, which came from a secondary market ticketing platform called Box Office Ticket Sales, said. My mom asked me: “How can they be selling these if they don’t go on sale until tomorrow?” </p><p>The answer is that scalpers regularly sell tickets they don’t have, or that aren’t even on sale yet. Ticket resale sites regularly let brokers “substitute” tickets that are better than the ones they originally sold, so scalpers will list tickets that they don’t have at astronomical prices, hope they sell them, then try to buy tickets that are similar to the ones they sold for less than the price they sold them for. So, this is gambling, but it can often work as arbitrage. There are broker services that will look for inefficiencies in the market; brokers often will list tickets for a high price, sell them, then use software to automatically buy the tickets from another service for less money, pulling a profit along the way. </p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Of the practices I mentioned here, this one is maybe the least problematic, but it’s normal for fans (or their parents) to Google something like “Olivia Rodrigo tickets,” and have most of the results be ads that link to secondary platforms rather than Ticketmaster. Lots of sales are made to people who don’t realize that they’re buying tickets for more than face value from a random secondary ticketing market rather than the primary seller. Box Office Ticket Sales has a popup on Olivia Rodrigo tickets that says “ALERT: Tickets for this event are in high demand. Get yours today before they’re gone!” Many of the tickets listed are for “Zone Seating.” </p><p>“The tickets you receive may be in the specific section listed here or in an equivalent or better location. This listing describes tickets that the seller does not own or may not know the exact location of the seats, but is offering to obtain for you,” the site says. To its credit, the site also says “As a resale marketplace, prices may be above face value” and also says “we are a resale marketplace, not the ticket seller.”</p><p>As I’ve tried to point out in my reporting over the years, scalpers and Ticketmaster are engaged in a neverending game of cat-and-mouse, but the more difficult Ticketmaster ostensibly makes it to buy tickets, the easier it is for dedicated professionals to buy them while fans are left disappointed.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html-->
