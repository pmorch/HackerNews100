<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     <p>Recently I’ve been thinking about how everything that happens in the terminal
is some combination of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your <strong>operating system</strong>’s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>shell</strong>’s job</li>
<li>Your <strong>terminal emulator</strong>’s job</li>
<li>The job of <strong>whatever program you happen to be running</strong> (like <code>top</code> or <code>vim</code> or <code>cat</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>The first three (your operating system, shell, and terminal emulator) are all kind of
known quantities – if you’re using bash in GNOME Terminal on Linux, you can
more or less reason about how how all of those things interact, and some of
their behaviour is standardized by POSIX.</p>
<p>But the fourth one (“whatever program you happen to be running”) feels like it
could do ANYTHING. How are you supposed to know how a program is going to
behave?</p>
<p>This post is kind of long so here’s a quick table of contents:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</a></li>

<li><a href="#these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these “rules” take a long time to learn</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programs-behave-surprisingly-consistently">programs behave surprisingly consistently</h3>
<p>As far as I know, there are no real standards for how programs in the terminal
should behave – the closest things I know of are:</p>
<ul>
<li>POSIX, which mostly dictates how your terminal emulator / OS / shell should
work together. I think it does specify a few things about how core utilities like
<code>cp</code> should work but AFAIK it doesn’t have anything to say about how for
example <code>htop</code> should behave.</li>
<li>these <a href="https://clig.dev/">command line interface guidelines</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But even though there are no standards, in my experience programs in the
terminal behave in a pretty consistent way. So I wanted to write down a list of
“rules” that in my experience programs mostly follow.</p>
<h3 id="these-are-meant-to-be-descriptive-not-prescriptive">these are meant to be descriptive, not prescriptive</h3>
<p>My goal here isn’t to convince authors of terminal programs that they <em>should</em>
follow any of these rules. There are lots of exceptions to these and often
there’s a good reason for those exceptions.</p>
<p>But it’s very useful for me to know what behaviour to expect from a random new
terminal program that I’m using. Instead of “uh, programs could do literally
anything”, it’s “ok, here are the basic rules I expect, and then I can keep a
short mental list of exceptions”.</p>
<p>So I’m just writing down what I’ve observed about how programs behave in my 20
years of using the terminal, why I think they behave that way, and some
examples of cases where that rule is “broken”.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-always-obvious-which-rules-are-the-program-s-responsibility-to-implement">it’s not always obvious which “rules” are the program’s responsibility to implement</h3>
<p>There are a bunch of common conventions that I think are pretty clearly the
program’s responsibility to implement, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>config files should go in <code>~/.BLAHrc</code> or <code>~/.config/BLAH/FILE</code> or <code>/etc/BLAH/</code> or something</li>
<li><code>--help</code> should print help text</li>
<li>programs should print “regular” output to stdout and errors to stderr</li>
</ul>
<p>But in this post I’m going to focus on things that it’s not 100% obvious are
the program’s responsibility. For example it feels to me like a “law of nature”
that pressing <code>Ctrl-D</code> should quit a REPL, but programs often
need to explicitly implement support for it – even though <code>cat</code> doesn’t need
to implement <code>Ctrl-D</code> support, <code>ipython</code> <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">does</a>. (more about that in “rule 3” below)</p>
<p>Understanding which things are the program’s responsibility makes it much less
surprising when different programs’ implementations are slightly different.</p>
<h3 id="rule-1-noninteractive-programs-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-c">rule 1: noninteractive programs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code></h3>
<p>The main reason for this rule is that noninteractive programs will quit by
default on <code>Ctrl-C</code> if they don’t set up a <code>SIGINT</code> signal handler, so this is
kind of a “you should act like the default” rule.</p>
<p>Something that trips a lot of people up is that this doesn’t apply to
<strong>interactive</strong> programs like <code>python3</code> or <code>bc</code> or <code>less</code>. This is because in
an interactive program, <code>Ctrl-C</code> has a different job – if the program is
running an operation (like for example a search in <code>less</code> or some Python code
in <code>python3</code>), then <code>Ctrl-C</code> will interrupt that operation but not stop the
program.</p>
<p>As an example of how this works in an interactive program: here’s the code <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/vi.py#L2225">in prompt-toolkit</a> (the library that iPython uses for handling input)
that aborts a search when you press <code>Ctrl-C</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2-tuis-should-quit-when-you-press-q">rule 2: TUIs should quit when you press <code>q</code></h3>
<p>TUI programs (like <code>less</code> or <code>htop</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>q</code>.</p>
<p>This rule doesn’t apply to any program where pressing <code>q</code> to quit wouldn’t make
sense, like <code>tmux</code> or text editors.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3-repls-should-quit-when-you-press-ctrl-d-on-an-empty-line">rule 3: REPLs should quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty line</h3>
<p>REPLs (like <code>python3</code> or <code>ed</code>) will usually quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an
empty line. This rule is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule – the reason for this is
that by default if you’re running a program (like <code>cat</code>) in “cooked mode”, then
the operating system will return an <code>EOF</code> when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code> on an empty
line.</p>
<p>Most of the REPLs I use (sqlite3, python3, fish, bash, etc) don’t actually use
cooked mode, but they all implement this keyboard shortcut anyway to mimic the
default behaviour.</p>
<p>For example, here’s <a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/shortcuts/prompt.py#L824-L837">the code in prompt-toolkit</a>
that quits when you press Ctrl-D, and here’s <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/6794b5478f660256a1023712b5fc169196ed0a22/lib/readline/readline.c#L658-L672">the same code in readline</a>.</p>
<p>I actually thought that this one was a “Law of Terminal Physics” until very
recently because I’ve basically never seen it broken, but you can see that it’s
just something that each individual input library has to implement in the links
above.</p>
<p>Someone pointed out that the Erlang REPL does not quit when you press <code>Ctrl-D</code>,
so I guess not every REPL follows this “rule”.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4-don-t-use-more-than-16-colours">rule 4: don’t use more than 16 colours</h3>
<p>Terminal programs rarely use colours other than the base 16 ANSI colours. This
is because if you specify colours with a hex code, it’s very likely to clash
with some users’ background colour. For example if I print out some text as
<code>#EEEEEE</code>, it would be almost invisible on a white background, though it would
look fine on a dark background.</p>
<p>But if you stick to the default 16 base colours, you have a much better chance
that the user has configured those colours in their terminal emulator so that
they work reasonably well with their background color. Another reason to stick
to the default base 16 colours is that it makes less assumptions about what
colours the terminal emulator supports.</p>
<p>The only programs I usually see breaking this “rule” are text editors, for
example Helix by default will use a custom colorscheme with this very nice
purple background which is not a default ANSI colour. It seems fine for Helix
to break this rule since Helix isn’t a “core” program and I assume any Helix
user who doesn’t like that colorscheme will just change the theme.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-vaguely-support-readline-keybindings">rule 5: vaguely support readline keybindings</h3>
<p>Almost every program I use supports <code>readline</code> keybindings if it would make
sense to do so. For example, here are a bunch of different programs and a link
to where they define <code>Ctrl-E</code> to go to the end of the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>ipython (<a href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit/blob/a2a12300c635ab3c051566e363ed27d853af4b21/src/prompt_toolkit/key_binding/bindings/emacs.py#L72">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>atuin (<a href="https://github.com/atuinsh/atuin/blob/a67cfc82fe0dc907a01f07a0fd625701e062a33b/crates/atuin/src/command/client/search/interactive.rs#L407">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fzf (<a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/bb55045596d6d08445f3c6d320c3ec2b457462d1/src/terminal.go#L611">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>zsh (<a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/blob/86d5f24a3d28541f242eb3807379301ea976de87/Src/Zle/zle_bindings.c#L94">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/99fa8aaaa7956178973150a03ce4954ab17a197b/share/functions/fish_default_key_bindings.fish#L43">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
<li>tmux’s command prompt (<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/blob/ae8f2208c98e3c2d6e3fe4cad2281dce8fd11f31/key-bindings.c#L490">Ctrl-E defined here</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>None of those programs actually uses <code>readline</code> directly, they just sort of
mimic emacs/readline keybindings. They don’t always mimic them <em>exactly</em>: for
example atuin seems to use <code>Ctrl-A</code> as a prefix, so <code>Ctrl-A</code> doesn’t go to the
beginning of the line.</p>
<p>Also all of these programs seem to implement their own internal cut and paste
buffers so you can delete a line with <code>Ctrl-U</code> and then paste it with <code>Ctrl-Y</code>.</p>
<p>The exceptions to this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>some programs (like <code>git</code>, <code>cat</code>, and <code>nc</code>) don’t have any line editing support at all (except for backspace, <code>Ctrl-W</code>, and <code>Ctrl-U</code>)</li>
<li>as usual text editors are an exception, every text editor has its own
approach to editing text</li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote more about this “what keybindings does a program support?” question in
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/07/08/readline/">entering text in the terminal is complicated</a>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5-1-ctrl-w-should-delete-the-last-word">rule 5.1: Ctrl-W should delete the last word</h3>
<p>I’ve never seen a program (other than a text editor) where <code>Ctrl-W</code> <em>doesn’t</em>
delete the last word. This is similar to the <code>Ctrl-C</code> rule – by default if a
program is in “cooked mode”, the OS will delete the last word if you press
<code>Ctrl-W</code>, and delete the whole line if you press <code>Ctrl-U</code>. So usually programs
will imitate that behaviour.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any exceptions to this other than text editors but if there
are I’d love to hear about them!</p>
<h3 id="rule-6-disable-colours-when-writing-to-a-pipe">rule 6: disable colours when writing to a pipe</h3>
<p>Most programs will disable colours when writing to a pipe. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rg blah</code> will highlight all occurrences of <code>blah</code> in the output, but if the
output is to a pipe or a file, it’ll turn off the highlighting.</li>
<li><code>ls --color=auto</code> will use colour when writing to a terminal, but not when
writing to a pipe</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of those programs will also format their output differently when writing
to the terminal: <code>ls</code> will organize files into columns, and ripgrep will group
matches with headings.</p>
<p>If you want to force the program to use colour (for example because you want to
look at the colour), you can use <code>unbuffer</code> to force the program’s output to be
a tty like this:</p>
<pre><code>unbuffer rg blah |  less -R
</code></pre>
<p>I’m sure that there are some programs that “break” this rule but I can’t think
of any examples right now. Some programs have an <code>--color</code> flag that you can
use to force colour to be on, in the example above you could also do <code>rg --color=always | less -R</code>.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7-means-stdin-stdout">rule 7: <code>-</code> means stdin/stdout</h3>
<p>Usually if you pass <code>-</code> to a program instead of a filename, it’ll read from
stdin or write to stdout (whichever is appropriate). For example, if you want
to format the Python code that’s on your clipboard with <code>black</code> and then copy
it, you could run:</p>
<pre><code>pbpaste | black - | pbcopy
</code></pre>
<p>(<code>pbpaste</code> is a Mac program, you can do something similar on Linux with <code>xclip</code>)</p>
<p>My impression is that most programs implement this if it would make sense and I
can’t think of any exceptions right now, but I’m sure there are many
exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="these-rules-take-a-long-time-to-learn">these “rules” take a long time to learn</h3>
<p>These rules took me a long time for me to learn because I had to:</p>
<ol>
<li>learn that the rule applied anywhere at all ("<code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit programs")</li>
<li>notice some exceptions (“okay, <code>Ctrl-C</code> will exit <code>find</code> but not <code>less</code>”)</li>
<li>subconsciously figure out what the pattern is ("<code>Ctrl-C</code> will generally quit
noninteractive programs, but in interactive programs it might interrupt the
current operation instead of quitting the program")</li>
<li>eventually maybe formulate it into an explicit rule that I know</li>
</ol>
<p>A lot of my understanding of the terminal is honestly still in the
“subconscious pattern recognition” stage. The only reason I’ve been taking the
time to make things explicit at all is because I’ve been trying to explain how
it works to others. Hopefully writing down these “rules” explicitly will make
learning some of this stuff a little bit faster for others.</p>

The new version of Recall encrypts the screens it captures and, by default, it has a “Filter sensitive information,” setting enabled, which is supposed to prevent it from recording any app or website that is showing credit card numbers, social security numbers, or other important financial / personal info. In my tests, however, this filter only worked in some situations (on two e-commerce sites), leaving a gaping hole in the protection it promises.</p><p>When I entered a credit card number and a random username / password into a Windows Notepad window, Recall captured it, despite the fact that I had text such as “Capital One Visa” right next to the numbers. Similarly, when I filled out a loan application PDF in Microsoft Edge, entering a social <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/security">security</a> number, name and DOB, Recall captured that.

However, what my experiment proves is that it’s pretty much impossible for Microsoft’s AI filter to identify every situation where sensitive information is on screen and avoid capturing it. My examples were designed to test the filter, but they’re not fringe cases. Real people do put sensitive personal information into PDF forms. They write things down or copy and paste them into text files and then key them into websites that don’t look like typical shopping sites.</p><p>I asked Microsoft for a comment and the company responded by pointing me to part of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/previewing-recall-with-click-to-do-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1734023528877028&amp;usg=AOvVaw0YCoKJWhOGP5TcUKiKYE97" data-url="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/11/22/previewing-recall-with-click-to-do-on-copilot-pcs-with-windows-insiders-in-the-dev-channel/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1734023528877028&amp;usg=AOvVaw0YCoKJWhOGP5TcUKiKYE97" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>blog post on the Preview Recall</u></a>, which states:</p><p><em>“We’ve updated Recall to detect sensitive information like credit card details, passwords, and personal identification numbers. When detected, Recall won’t save or store those snapshots. We’ll continue to improve this functionality, and if you find sensitive information that should be filtered out, for your context, language, or geography, please let us know through Feedback Hub. We’ve also provided an option in Settings that we encourage you to enable that will anonymously share the apps and sites you prefer to be excluded from Recall to help us improve the product.”</em></p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tbEeKQ57ATUGUnUKRir5vA"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>So the company is promising that Recall will get better at filtering out sensitive information over time. But how much better it will get and how many holes will still remain is an open question.</p><h2 id="how-recall-works-3">How Recall Works</h2><p>Recall’s purpose is to provide searchable memory of all your computer activity, to become your one-stop digital memory. So the feature, which is only available on Copilot+ PCs, takes screenshots of everything you do on your PC, arranges those pictures in a timeline, and makes them searchable using natural language search. If you forgot what website you were visiting when you were considering buying a red sofa, you can search “sofa” and it should pull up a picture of the exact page you were on. Because it’s AI-powered, it also reads the text within images and lets you copy it.</p><p>The concern with Recall is that it’s keeping a digital record of everything you do and, no matter how secure, the record is there for bad actors to find. When Recall first appeared in Insider Builds last spring, researchers noticed that it wasn’t encrypting the screenshots it captured and was storing its database as plain text. The company responded to the negative press attention by pulling Recall from Insider builds and promising to bring it back only after some security upgrades.</p><p>The new version of Recall is now opt-in rather than opt-out – I got prompted to enable Recall immediately after installing the Insider Build. The pop-up prompt appeared as soon as my laptop rebooted after the updated.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-320-80.jpg" alt="Windows prompts you to enable recall at boot" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QaSQYn27Fwd3tzXfyT2wHP.jpg"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recall has a “sensitive information filter,” which is enabled by default and it appears to actually be encrypting the data it captures.

However, Windows Hello also allowed me to log in with a 4-digit PIN.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-320-80.png" alt="Windows Hello PIN login" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZP4WMw7Xafwc2xwbaJT2f.png"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, if a bad actor has access to your computer and knows your PIN, they could view Recall bypassing the biometric security checks.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						
<p>So I’m two months into trying to teach a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem (FLT) to a computer. Most of “how it’s going” is quite tedious and technical to explain: to cut a long story short, Wiles proved an “R=T” theorem and much of the work so far has gone into teaching the computer what R and T are; we still have not finished either definition. However my PhD student Andrew Yang has already proved the abstract commutative algebra result which we need (“if abstract rings R and T satisfy lots of technical conditions then they’re equal”), and this is an exciting first step. The current state of the write-up is <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/FLT/blueprint/">here</a>, and the system we are using is <a href="https://lean-fro.org/">Lean</a> and its mathematical library <a href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4">mathlib</a>, maintained by the <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean prover community</a>. If you know a bit of Lean and a bit of number theory then feel free to read the <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>, checkout the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ImperialCollegeLondon/projects/102">project dashboard</a> and claim an <a href="https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/issues">issue</a>. As I say, we’re two months in. However we already have one interesting story, which I felt was worth sharing. Who knows if it’s an indication of what is to come.</p>



<p>We’re not formalising the old-fashioned 1990s proof of FLT. Since then, work of many people (Diamond/Fujiwara, Kisin, Taylor, Scholze and several others) led to the proof being generalised and simplified, and part of the motivation of my work is not to just get FLT over the line but to prove these more general and powerful results. Why? Because if the AI mathematics revolution actually happens (which it might) and if Lean turns out to be an important component (which it might) then computers will be in a better position to start helping humans to push back the boundaries of modern number theory because of this formalization work, as they’ll have access to key modern definitions in a form which they understand. One concept which was not used in Wiles’ original proof but which is being used in the proof we’re formalizing, is crystalline cohomology, a theory developed in the 60s and 70s in Paris, with the foundations laid down by Berthelot following ideas of Grothendieck. The basic idea here is that the classical exponential and logarithm functions play a key role in differential geometry (relating Lie algebras and Lie groups, for example), and in particular in understanding de Rham cohomology, but they do not work in more arithmetic situations (for example in characteristic p); the theory of “divided power structures”, developed in the 1960s in a series of beautiful papers by Roby, play a crucial role in constructing an analogue of these functions which can be used in the arithmetic case. tl;dr: we need to teach the computer crystalline cohomology, so first we need to teach it divided powers.</p>



<p>Antoine Chambert-Loir and Maria Ines de Frutos Fernandez have been teaching the theory of divided powers to Lean, and over the summer Lean did that irritating thing which it sometimes does: it complained about the human presentation of an argument in the standard literature, and on closer inspection it turned out that the human argument left something to be desired. In particular a key lemma in Roby’s work seems to be incorrect. When Antoine told me this in a DM, he remarked that he would suppose I thought this was funny, and indeed the very long string of laughing emojis which he got back as a response to his message confirmed this. However Antoine, being rather more professional than me, argued that instead of me tweeting about the issue (which I can’t do anyway because I left Twitter and joined <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xenaproject.bsky.social">bluesky</a> yesterday), we should in fact attempt to fix the problem. We went about this in rather different ways. Antoine put it on his job list to look at, and I completely ignored the problem and just started occasionally mentioning to people that the proof was in trouble, in a weak sense. I say “in a weak sense” because this observation has to be put into some context. According to the way I currently view mathematics (as a formalist), the entire theory of crystalline cohomology vanished from the literature at the moment Antoine discovered the issue, with massive collateral damage (for example huge chunks of Scholze’s work just disappeared, entire books and papers vaporised etc). But this disappearance is only <em>temporary</em>. Crystalline cohomology is in no practical sense “wrong”. The theorems were still undoubtedly <em>correct</em>, it’s just that the proofs were as far as I am concerned <em>incomplete</em> (or at least, the ones Antoine and Maria Ines were following were), and unfortunately it is now our job to fix them. The thing I want to stress is that it was absolutely clear to both me and Antoine that the proofs of the main results were of course going to be <em>fixable</em>, even if an intermediate lemma was false, because crystalline cohomology has been used so much since the 1970s that if there were a problem with it, it would have come to light a long time ago. Every expert I’ve spoken to is in complete agreement on this point (and several even went so far as to claim that I’m making a fuss about nothing, but perhaps they don’t understand what formalization actually means in practice: you can’t just say “I’m sure it’s fixable” — you have to <strong>actually fix it</strong>). One added twist is that Roby, Grothendieck and Berthelot have all died, so we could not go back to the original experts and ask directly for help.</p>



<p>[For those that are interested in more technical details, here they are: Berthelot’s thesis does not develop the theory of divided powers from scratch, he uses Roby’s “Les algebres a puissances divisees”, published in Bull Sci Math, 2ieme serie, 89, 1965, pages 75-91. Lemme 8 (on p86) of that paper seems to be false and it’s not obvious how to repair the proof; the proof of the lemma misquotes another lemma of Roby from his 1963 Ann Sci ENS paper; the correct statement is Gamma_A(M) tensor_A R = Gamma_R(M tensor_A R) but one of the tensor products accidentally falls off in the application. This breaks Roby’s proof that the divided power algebra of a module has divided powers, and thus stops us from defining the ring A_{cris}.]</p>



<p>So as I say, Antoine worked on fixing the problem, whereas I just worked on gossiping about it to the experts, and I made the mistake of telling Tadashi Tokieda about it in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coffeezeeholloway/">coffeeshop in Islington</a>, he duly went back to Stanford and mentioned it to Brian Conrad, and the next thing I knew Conrad was in my inbox asking me what was all this about crystalline cohomology being wrong. I explained the technical details of the issue, Conrad agreed that there seemed to be a problem and he went off to think about it. Several hours later he got back to me and pointed out that another, different, proof of the claim that the universal divided power algebra of a module had divided powers was in the appendix to the Berthelot-Ogus book on crystalline cohomology, and that as far as Conrad was concerned this approach should be fine. The proof was back on! </p>



<p>And that is pretty much the end of the story, other than the fact that last month I visited Berkeley and I had lunch with Arthur Ogus, who I’ve known since I was a post-doc there in the 90s. I’d promised Arthur a story of how he’d saved Fermat’s Last Theorem, and over the meal I told him about how his appendix had dug me out of a hole. His response was “Oh! That appendix has several errors in it! But it’s OK, I think I know how to fix them.”</p>



<p>This story really highlights, to me, the poor job which humans do of documenting modern mathematics. There appear to be so many things which are “known to the experts” but not correctly documented. The experts are in agreement that the important ideas are robust enough to withstand knocks like this, but the <em>details</em> of what is actually going on might not actually be where you expect them to be. For me, this is just one of many reasons why humans might want to consider getting mathematics written down <em>properly</em>, i.e. in a formal system, where the chances of error are orders of magnitude smaller. However most mathematicians are not formalists, and for those people I need to justify my work in a different way. For those mathematicians, I argue that teaching machines our arguments is a crucial step towards getting machines to do it themselves. Until then, we seemed to be doomed to fix up human errors manually.</p>



<p>The story does have a happy ending though — two weeks ago Maria Ines gave <a href="https://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/222778">a talk</a> about formalization of divided powers in the Cambridge Formalization of Mathematics seminar (which was started by Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki a couple of years ago — thanks Angeliki!), and my understanding of Maria Ines’ talk is that these issues have now been sorted out. So we are actually back on track. Until the next time the literature lets us down…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>Medically-assisted dying – also known as voluntary euthanasia – accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023, new government data shows.<!-- --></p><p>The country's fifth annual report since euthanasia was legalised in 2016 showed around 15,300 people underwent assisted dying last year after being successful in their applications.<!-- --></p><p>The median age of this group was more than 77. The vast majority – around 96% - had a death deemed "reasonably foreseeable", due to severe medical conditions such as cancer.<!-- --></p><p>In the small minority of other cases, patients may not have been terminally ill, but sought an assisted death due to a long and complicated illness that had significantly impacted their quality of life.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Canada is among a few countries that have introduced assisted dying laws in the past decade. Others include Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria.<!-- --></p><p>In Canada, consenting adults can request medical assistance in dying from a healthcare provider if they have a serious and irremediable medical condition.<!-- --></p><p>Some provisions are in place, including a requirement of having two independent healthcare providers confirm that the patient is eligible before their request is approved.<!-- --></p><p>More than 320,000 people died in Canada in 2023, and 15,300 of those deaths - about one in 20 - were medically assisted.<!-- --></p><p>The figures released on Wednesday by Health Canada show that the rate of assisted dying in Canada increased by nearly 16% in 2023. This number is a sharp drop from the average increase of 31% in previous years.<!-- --></p><p>The report cautioned that it is too early to determine what caused the rate to slacken.<!-- --></p><p>For the first time, the report delved into race and ethnic data of those who died by euthanasia. <!-- --></p><p>Around 96% of recipients identified as white people, who account for about 70% of Canada's population. It is unclear what caused this disparity.<!-- --></p><p>The second most reported ethnic group was east Asians (1.8%), who account for about 5.7% of Canadians.<!-- --></p><p>Assisted dying continued to have the highest usage rate in Quebec, which accounted for nearly 37% of all euthanasia deaths, despite the province holding just 22% of Canada's population.<!-- --></p><p>Quebec's government launched a study earlier this year to examine why its euthanasia rate was so high.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>While the number of assisted deaths in Canada is growing, the country still falls behind the Netherlands, where euthanasia accounted for around 5% of total deaths last year.<!-- --></p><p>UK MPs voted late last month to pass a similar bill that gives terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death, though it will face months of further scrutiny before it could become law.<!-- --></p><p>As British MPs debated the legislation, Canada was cited by some as a cautionary tale due to its perceived lack of safeguards.<!-- --></p><p>Like the UK, Canada initially only legalised assisted dying for those whose death was "reasonably foreseeable".<!-- --></p><p>However, Canada expanded access in 2021 to people who may not have a terminal diagnosis, but want to end their life because of a chronic, debilitating condition.<!-- --></p><p>It was set to broaden access once again to people with mental illnesses earlier this year. <!-- --></p><p>But that was delayed for the second time after concerns were raised by Canadian provinces, which oversee healthcare delivery, about whether the system could cope with such an expansion.<!-- --></p><p>On Wednesday, Health Canada defended the procedure, saying that the criminal code sets out "strict eligibility" criteria.<!-- --></p><p>But Cardus, a Christian think tank, said the latest figures were "alarming" and showed Canada has one of the fastest growing euthanasia programmes in the world.<!-- --></p><p>A report released in October by Ontario - Canada's most populous province - has since shed some light on controversial cases where people were granted assisted dying when they were not nearing their natural death.<!-- --></p><p>One example included a woman in her 50s with a history of depression and suicidal thoughts who had a severe sensitivity to chemicals.<!-- --></p><p>Her request for euthanasia was granted after she failed to secure housing that could have met her medical needs.<!-- --></p><p>Another case made headlines in recent months of a Nova Scotia cancer patient who said she was asked if she was aware of assisted dying as an option twice as she underwent mastectomy surgeries.<!-- --></p><p>The question "came up in completely inappropriate places", she told the National Post.<!-- --></p><p>Canadian news outlets have also reported on cases where people with disabilities have considered assisted dying due to lack of housing or disability benefits.<!-- --></p><p><i id="clarification-12-december:-this-article's-introduction-has-been-amended-to-be-clearer-about-the-fact-that-these-figures-relate-to-voluntary-euthanasia-and-to-more-clearly-and-prominently-explain-the-background-to-the-data-for-two-groups-who-successfully-sought-medically-assisted-dying.">Clarification 12 December: This article's introduction has been amended to be clearer about the fact that these figures relate to voluntary euthanasia and to more clearly and prominently explain the background to the data for two groups who successfully sought medically assisted dying.<!-- --></i></p></div></div>]]></description>
