<p>Game Bub can play physical cartridges, as well as emulated cartridges using ROM files loaded from a microSD card. Game Bub also supports the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Link_Cable">Game Link Cable</a> in both GB and GBA modes for multiplayer games. I designed the hardware with a number of bonus features, like video out (HDMI) via a custom dock, a rumble motor, real-time clock (for certain games). Additionally, the hardware is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing future software improvements to expand its capabilities.</p>
<p>Game Bub has a custom-designed 6 layer PCB featuring a Xilinx XC7A100T FPGA with integrated memory,  display, speakers, rechargable battery, GB/GBA cartridge slot, all packaged up in a custom 3D-printed enclosure.</p>
<p>This writeup is a detailed description of how I developed and built Game Bub. I also wrote up a <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/handheld/docs/architecture.md">document explaining the architecture of Game Bub</a>, which is a much shorter read if you’re only interested in the technical details.</p>
<p>Check out the instructions, code, and design files <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub">on GitHub</a>. Note that building a Game Bub unit is fairly complex. If you might be interested in buying a complete Game Bub kit, please <a href="https://forms.gle/m1FFUqpCde7x5u5AA">fill out this form</a> to help me gauge interest.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I first started thinking about this project while I was finishing up work on <a href="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/fpga-gameboy-emulator/">my previous Game Boy FPGA emulator</a> in mid-2023.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun implementing a Game Boy at the hardware level, and I started thinking about how far I could take the project. I was using a Pynq-Z2 development board, which was definitely the right way to get started, but it came with a lot of limitations.</p>
<p>I had to use an external monitor for audio/video, and an external gamepad for input, but a real Game Boy, of course, is a portable handheld. I also wanted to add Game Boy Advance support, but the memory architecture of the Pynq-Z2 had access latency that <a href="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/fpga-gameboy-emulator/#fixing-an-audio-bug-on-the-game-boy-color">was just barely acceptable for the Game Boy</a>, and would have been completely unacceptable for the Game Boy Advance. I also wanted to make something less “hacky”: a real device that I could play and give to people, not just a bare PCB.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while there are open-source FPGA retrogaming projects (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MiSTer">MiSTer</a>), there doesn’t appear to be anything open-source that supports physical Game Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges, let alone an open-source handheld device.</p>
<p>Thus, I somewhat naively set out to design what would become by far my most complex electrical engineering and hardware design project to date.</p>
<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
<p>I set out some goals for the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a standalone, rechargable battery-powered FPGA handheld</li>
<li>Minimize cost and complexity by using off-the-shelf components wherever possible</li>
<li>Capable of playing Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games</li>
<li>Capable of using physical cartridges, or emulating cartridges (reading ROM files off of a microSD card)</li>
<li>Easy to use: graphical menu and in-game overlay</li>
<li>Integrated display and speakers, with headphone support</li>
<li>Integrated peripherals (rumble, real-time clock, accelerometer) for emulated cartridges</li>
<li>HDMI video output support for playing on a big screen</li>
<li>Decent looking design with good ergonomics</li>
<li>Expansion opportunities in the future: support for more systems, Wi-Fi, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, since I was building this project for fun and learning, I wanted to be able to fully understand every single component of the system. I wanted to use my own emulator cores (e.g. not just port them from <a href="https://mister-devel.github.io/MkDocs_MiSTer/">MiSTer</a>), do my own board design, and write my own drivers to interface with peripherals.</p>
<h3 id="a-brief-rant-about-fpga-retrogaming">A brief rant about FPGA retrogaming</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of misleading marketing and hype out there around FPGA retrogaming. Some claim that FPGA retrogaming devices are not emulators (because they supposedly “act like [the system] at the gate level”), that they achieve “perfect accuracy”, or that they’re superior to software emulators.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is blatantly wrong and actively harmful. FPGA retrogaming devices are emulators: they pretend to be something they’re not. And they’re only as accurate as they’re programmed to be, since they’re recreations. An FPGA can make certain aspects of accuracy easier to achieve, but it doesn’t guarantee it.</p>
<p>Software emulators can be extremely accurate. Furthermore, perfect accuracy (if it’s even possible) is by no means a requirement to play an entire system’s library of games. Some people claim that FPGA emulators are the only way to “preserve” a system, but I’d argue that software emulators are a significantly more accessible (no special hardware needed!) way to further this goal.</p>
<p>I believe that FPGA emulators have only one real advantage over software emulators: they can more easily interface with original hardware, such as physical cartridges or other consoles via link cables.</p>
<p>I did this project not because I think that FPGA emulators are inherently better than software emulators, but because I think they’re interesting and fun to build.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-design">High-level design</h2>
<p>I began work on the project by doing some initial research and sketching out a high level design.</p>
<p>My previous FPGA emulator project used a Xilinx Zynq chip, which integrates FPGA fabric (“PL”) with a dual-core ARM processor running Linux (“PS”). I implemented the entire emulator on the FPGA, and used the Linux system to configure the FPGA, render the UI, and load ROM files from the filesystem.</p>
<p>I decided to keep this same division of responsibilities: using the FPGA to do the core emulation, with a separate processor to do support tasks. However, to make the overall design easier to reason about, I decided to to use an FPGA-only chip (without any hard processor cores), and an external microcontroller (MCU) to do the tasks that the ARM cores did before.</p>
<p>The FPGA would consume input, directly interface to the game cartridges (through level shifters to support both the 3.3 volt GBA and 5 volt Game Boy), and output audio and video to the speakers and display. The MCU would handle the UI, read ROM files from the microSD card, initialize peripherals (display, DAC, IMU), handle power sequencing, and load the FPGA configuration.</p>
<p>I wanted to have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support: Wi-Fi for software updates, and the possibility of emulating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter">Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter</a>, and Bluetooth to support wireless game controllers (when connected to an external display). To reduce complexity (and avoid the need for careful RF design), I looked only for complete Wi-Fi/Bluetooth modules with integrated antennas.</p>
<figure>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also drew out rough sketches of what the final device might look like: placement of buttons, screen, speakers, ports, cartridge slot, and battery. I settled on a vertical Game Boy Color-esque design (as opposed to a horizontal Game Boy Advance-style design), because I felt that this would maximize the space in the back of the device for full-size Game Boy Color cartridges and a battery.</p>
<h2 id="component-selection-and-compromises">Component selection and compromises</h2>
<p>After sketching out the goals and high level design, I started component selection: picking out each non-trivial component of the system, evaluating features and requirements (e.g. how they communicate, power consumption and voltages needed).</p>
<p>Since I intended to have this manufactured and assembled at JLCPCB, I strongly preferred parts that were available in their part library. One technique I even used for narrowing down part choices was finding the relevant category in their part search, and sorting by their stock count.</p>
<h3 id="microcontroller">Microcontroller</h3>
<p>I initially planned to use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040">RP2040</a> microcontroller, with a separate ESP32-WROOM module to support Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The ESP32 supports both Bluetooth Classic and LE, which is essential for supporting a wide range of controllers, and the RP2040 has USB host support, to support wired controllers.</p>
<p>During the schematic design process, I ended up simplifying the RP2040 + ESP32 combination to just a single ESP32-S3 module for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I started running out of GPIOs on the RP2040, and I was dedicating 4 of them (2 for UART, 1 for reset, 1 for booting in firmware download mode) to communication with the ESP32. Plus, the ESP32-S3 has more GPIOs overall.</li>
<li>I wanted to write the MCU firmware in Rust, and the ESP32-S3 had support for the Rust standard library (via ESP-IDF and <a href="https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-hal">esp-idf-hal</a>). This seemed like it would be easier to get the software up and running.</li>
<li>Fewer components means easier routing and assembly</li>
<li>The ESP32-S3 has an SDIO module (for interfacing with the microSD card), and FAT filesystem support (via ESP-IDF). It would be possible to do this with the RP2040 PIO, but having a proper peripheral and driver for this makes it a lot easier.</li>
<li>The ESP32-S3 is more powerful than the RP2040, and would probably be able to render a smoother UI.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the ESP32-S3 has one main disadvantage compared to the original ESP32: it doesn’t have Bluetooth Classic support, only LE. This would greatly limit the range of supported wireless controllers, but I believed the compromise was worth it. I also decided to scrap USB host support, because supporting USB-C dual role (switchable device or host) would have added a lot of additional complexity.</p>
<p>If the RP2350 microcontroller (the successor to the RP2040) had been available when I started this project, I may very well have chosen it, since it has even more power, PIO blocks, memory, and GPIO pins. I might have paired it with an RM2 radio module for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>
<h3 id="display">Display</h3>
<p>I wanted a display that would support integer scaling for the Game Boy Advance, which has a 240x160 pixel screen. I was also looking for a screen roughly on the order of 3.0-3.5 inches wide (diagonal), to be comfortable to hold in the hand.</p>
<p>I found the ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD module from <a href="https://www.buydisplay.com/">EastRising</a>, with a 3.5 inch display, and a 320x480 pixel resolution. This allows for a 2x integer scale for the Game Boy Advance (and a 2x scale plus centering for the 160x144 Game Boy display). This checked off almost all of the boxes: integer scaling, a good size, available at a reasonable price, pretty good documentation (for the ILI9488 LCD controller).</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/er-tft035ips-6.jpg" alt="ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD module" width="1000" height="550"> <figcaption>
            <p>ER-TFT035IPS-6 LCD module</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The main issue, which actually ended up being fairly annoying, is that it’s a 320x480 display, not 480x320. Meaning, it’s oriented in portrait mode, not landscape. I rotated the device 90 degrees to fit in a landscape orientation, but this created two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>In landscape orientation, the bottom of the display (containing the LCD driver chip and the flex cable) faces to the left or the right, which means that larger bazels are required on the left and right of the display to center the “active area” of the LCD within the handheld.</li>
<li>In landscape orientation, the display refreshes from left to right, not top to bottom.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with refreshing from left to right is that the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance (and almost every other system) refresh from top to bottom. This means that the display can’t be refreshed perfectly in sync with the game (zero buffering), and single buffering leads to unsightly diagonal tearing. Instead, I had to use triple buffering, where the game is writing to one framebuffer, the LCD driver is reading from another buffer, and there’s one spare swap buffer. This increases the amount of memory used – and because it needed to be accessed by both the game and LCD driver simultaneously (dual port), it needed to be stored in internal block RAM in the FPGA, a scarce resource.</p>
<p>So, even though the Game Boy emulator uses &lt;10% of the total logic resources of the FPGA, and the Game Boy Advance uses around 30%, I had to use a large (more expensive, and power hungry) FPGA so that I had enough block RAM.</p>
<p>I also stuck a standard size HDMI port into the design, connected directly to the FPGA. HDMI has a few additional, non-video signals that need level shifting from 5V to 3.3V (I opted for discrete transistors), and it requires the source (me!) to supply a small amount of power.</p>
<h3 id="power">Power</h3>
<h4 id="battery">Battery</h4>
<p>I had never previously designed anything that used a lithium ion battery, so I had a fair amount of learning to do. <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/li-ion-and-lipoly-batteries/overview">Adafruit</a> was a helpful resource. I needed a way to charge the battery from USB power, and a way to measure how charged it is.</p>
<p>Lithium ion batteries can be dangerous if misused. Safely charging a battery is non-trivial, and requires a feedback loop and adjustable voltage sources. A dedicated IC seemed like the best way to do this. A lot of hobbyists use the ultra-cheap TP4056 1A battery charger, but I’d read about a lot of issues it has around safely charging the battery while using it. I decided instead to opt for the <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/bq24073.pdf">TI BQ2407x</a> series of battery charger ICs. They seem to be widely used in commercial products, came with a comprehensive datasheet, and had a few critical features: programmable input and charge current limits, safety timers, and “power path management” for safely charging the battery while the device is on.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are a few ways to measure the charge level of the battery, which generally relies on the fact that a lithium ion battery’s voltage depends on its charge level. A fully charged battery is about 4.2 volts, a battery with between 80% and 20% charge is about 3.7 volts, and below that a drained battery falls off pretty quickly to under 3.0 volts. If all you want is a coarse estimate of the battery level, you can use an ADC to read the voltage and estimate whether the battery is fully charged or nearly discharged. However, since the voltage curve is nearly flat between 20% and 80% charge (and is also dependent on the load), this can’t give the fine-grained battery percentage that we’re used to on phones and laptops. Instead, I opted for a discrete fuel gauge IC, the <a href="https://www.analog.com/en/products/max17048.html">MAX17048</a>. It’s simple to integrate and inexpensive.</p>
<h4 id="power-switch">Power switch</h4>
<p>I decided to use a push button for the main power switch, because I needed to be able to do a graceful shutdown, where the microcontroller could save state (e.g. the current save file for an emulated cartridge) before it actually powered off.</p>
<p>I used <a href="http://www.mosaic-industries.com/embedded-systems/microcontroller-projects/electronic-circuits/push-button-switch-turn-on/microcontroller-latching-on-off">this push-on hold-off circuit from Mosaic Industries</a>. The “hold to power off” feature is useful if I need the force the system off, for example if the microcontroller crashes or is misbehaving. The circuit is built out of discrete MOSFETs.</p>
<p>I briefly considered using an ultra-low power, always on microcontroller to act as a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_management_integrated_circuit">PMIC</a> provide power switch functionality (and perhaps avoid the need for a separate real-time clock IC, and even a battery gauge). While this would have been flexible and really cool, I figured it wasn’t worth the additional complexity.</p>
<h4 id="power-regulation">Power regulation</h4>
<p>The main system power ranges from about 3.4 V when the battery is discharged, to 4.2 V when the battery is fully charged, up to 5.0 V when the device is plugged in with USB.</p>
<p>The ESP32-S3 module required 3.3 V, and most of the other ICs in the system did too. The main exception is the FPGA, which requires a 1.0 V core power rail, a 1.8 V “auxiliary” power rail, and a 3.3 V power rail for I/O. Moreover, according to the <a href="https://docs.amd.com/v/u/en-US/ds181_Artix_7_Data_Sheet">Xilinx Artix-7 datasheet (DS181)</a>, these power rails need to be powered on in a particular sequence: for my use, this means 1.0 V, then 1.8 V, then 3.3 V. Additionally, I needed a 5.0 V supply to interface with Game Boy / Game Boy Color cartridges.</p>
<p>There are multi-rail power regulators available, and a lot of FPGA development boards use them. However, they all seemed to be expensive and difficult to purchase in low quantities. Instead, I opted for separate power regulators for each rail. I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_converter">buck converters</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regulator">linear regulators</a> to maximize power efficiency.</p>
<p>I used the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TLV62585">TLV62585</a> converter for the 3.3 V, 1.8 V, and 1.0 V rails. This is a simple, performant buck converter with a “power good” output, which is useful for power sequencing: you can connect the <em>power good</em> output of one regulator to the <em>enable</em> pin of the next regulator, to power on the rails in the desired order.</p>
<p>For the 5.0 V rail, I used the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TPS61022">TPS61022</a> boost converter. This converter is way overkill for the 5.0 V rail (which might use 75mA <em>max</em>), but it was readily available, and conveniently compatible with the same 1µH inductor as the buck converters.</p>
<p>According to the FPGA datasheet, the XC7A100T consumes more than 100mW of static power. That is, it consumes that as long as it’s connected to power, even if it’s doing absolutely nothing. I figured I might want to support a low power sleep mode, so I decided to split the FPGA into a separate power domain with an explicit power enable signal from the MCU. I also used an <a href="https://www.diodes.com/datasheet/download/AP2191.pdf">AP2191W</a> load switch for the FPGA’s 3.3 V rail to be able to keep the 1.0 V → 1.8 V → 3.3 V sequencing.</p>
<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<p>I wanted the device to have both speakers and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Ultimately, the FPGA generates an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S">I2S</a> digital audio signal, and I needed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter">DAC</a> to convert it to an analog audio signal, and then an amplifier to drive the speakers (or headphones). I wanted digital volume control (to support volume buttons, rather than a volume knob or slider), and I needed some way to switch the audio output between speakers and the headphones, depending on whether or not headphones are plugged in. With no real audio experience, this seemed like a daunting task.</p>
<p>While searching for multiple separate components, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TLV320DAC3101">TLV320DAC3101</a>. It combines a stereo DAC with a speaker amplifier and a headphone driver. Additionally, it supports digital volume control, and headphone detection. I think this chip is a good example of how thoughtful component selection can simplify the overall design. Looking through the datasheet, it required a 1.8 V core voltage (unlike essentially every other component other than the FPGA) and a fair amount of configuration registers to set over I2C, but it had all of the features I needed.</p>
<p>I was originally planning to have just a single (mono) speaker, but I figured if I had a stereo DAC, I might as well put two in there. I chose the <a href="https://www.sameskydevices.com/product/audio/speakers/miniature-(10-mm~40-mm)/ces-20134-088pmb">CES-20134-088PMB</a>, an enclosed microspeaker with a JST-SH connector. Having an enclosed speaker simplified audio design, because as it turns out, you can’t just stick a speaker to a board and expect it to sound okay (Same Sky, the manufacturer of that speaker, <a href="https://www.sameskydevices.com/blog/how-to-design-a-micro-speaker-enclosure">has a blog post explaining some of the nuances</a>).</p>
<h3 id="buttons">Buttons</h3>
<p>I prefer the feeling of clicky, tactile buttons (such as those found in the GBA SP, Nintendo DS (original), Nintendo 3DS, Switch) compared to “mushy” membrane buttons (such as those found in the Game Boy Color, original GBA, and Nintendo DS Lite). I learned that the tactile switches used in the GBA SP are a <a href="https://tech.alpsalpine.com/e/products/detail/SKRRAAE010/">widely available off-the-shelf part from Alps Alpine</a>. I used similar, but smaller buttons for the Start/Select/Home buttons, and a right-angle button from the same manufacturer for side volume and power buttons.</p>
<p>Although I only had plans to support Game Boy and Game Boy Advance (requiring a D-pad, A and B buttons, L and R shoulder buttons, and Start/Select), I opted to add two more “X” and “Y” face buttons to leave the possibility open of supporting more systems in the future.</p>
<p>The L and R buttons posed an additional challenge – I found numerous right-angle tactile buttons (to be soldered onto the back, facing towards the top). However, none of them seemed to have the actuator (the part of the button you make contact with) far enough away from the PCB to be easily pressed. At first, I thought about making a separate shoulder button board to move them at the correct distance, but then I started looking at what existing devices do for inspiration. The Game Boy Advance SP actually uses a more complex mechanism for the shoulder buttons: rather than a simple actuator like the face buttons, there’s a hinge with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_spring">torsion spring</a> that hits the actuator at an angle. This is actually part of what makes the shoulder buttons pleasant to press: you don’t need to hit them from exactly the right direction, because they pivot. I ended up just going with a standard right-angle tactile button, opting to solve the problem with the mechanism in the enclosure.</p>

<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>
<p>One of my main goals was to allow ROM files to be loaded from a microSD card, rather than only being able to be played from a physical cartridge. To do this, I’d need dedicated RAM for the FPGA to hold the game. Game Boy Advance games, typically, are a maximum of 32 MB. They don’t make SRAMs that large (and if they did, they’d be very expensive). Instead, I needed to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory">DRAM</a>.</p>
<p>Asynchronous SRAM is very simple: supply a read address to the address pins, and some amount of nanoseconds later, the data you’re reading appears on the data pins. DRAM is more complex: the simplest kind is “single data rate synchronous DRAM” (SDR SDRAM, or just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_dynamic_random-access_memory">SDRAM</a>, distinguishing it from the significantly more complex DDR SDRAM). However, even SDRAM is non-trivial to use. DRAM is organized into banks, rows, and columns, and accessing DRAM requires sending commands to “activate” (open) a rows before reading out “columns”, and then “precharging” (closing) a row. Handling all of this requires a DRAM controller (see this <a href="https://www.fpga4fun.com/SDRAM2.html">simple description of the state machine</a> required). This isn’t terribly complex, but I was signing myself up for more work.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I could have chosen a PSRAM chip (essentially DRAM with an integrated controller to make it have a more SRAM-like interface). However, I couldn’t find a PSRAM part that I was happy with (cost, availability, interface), and so I ended up going with the inexpensive W9825G6KH 32MB 16-bit SDRAM.</p>
<p>I also decided to stick a 512 KiB SRAM chip in the design in case I ended up needing some more simple memory later, like for emulating the SRAM used for Game Boy cartridge save files. Despite being 1/64 the capacity, this chip was about 3x the cost of the SDRAM. This ended up being a wise decision, since a lot of my internal FPGA block ram was eaten up by the triple buffer for the display (see above).</p>
<h3 id="cartridge-and-link-ports">Cartridge and Link Ports</h3>
<p>Of course, there’s no point to an FPGA emulator that can’t play actual cartridges or interact with other devices. The cartridge slot and link ports are no-name parts from Aliexpress, easily available for cheap. These seem to mostly be GBA SP compatible, and are often used as repair parts.</p>
<p>I’d already used these for my cartridge adapter board in <a href="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/fpga-gameboy-emulator/#using-real-cartridges-with-the-fpga">my first Game Boy FPGA project</a>, and so I used a similar design: 2x <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVCH16T245">16-bit level shifters</a> for the majority of the cartridge slot signals (since the Game Boy runs at 5V, which is incompatible with the FPGA), and a few <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVC1T45">1-bit level shifters with individual direction control</a> for some extra signals on the cartridge slot, as well as the four signals on the link port.</p>
<p>The Game Boy Advance can play both Game Boy [Color] and Game Boy Advance games. These run at different voltages and use different protocols, so the device need some way of determining which type of cartridge is inserted.</p>

</figure>

<p>The cartridges are physically different at the bottom: GBA cartridges (the top cartridge in the image) have a notch on either side. The GBA has a <em>detector switch</em> that senses the absence of a notch on an inserted cartridge and switches the device into Game Boy Color mode.</p>
<p>I measured the size and position of this notch, and searched Digi-Key and Mouser for switches that met these constraints. In the end, I was only able to find a single switch that would work.</p>
<h3 id="miscellaneous-peripherals">Miscellaneous peripherals</h3>
<p>I used the surprisingly cheap <a href="https://www.st.com/en/mems-and-sensors/lsm6ds3tr-c.html">LSM6DS3TR-C</a> IMU from ST. This tiny IMU has a 3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope, more than sufficient for emulating the few GB/GBA cartridges that have motion controls.</p>
<p>For keeping track of time even when the device was off, I used the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/part/PCF8563T">PCF8563T</a> real-time clock chip. I chose this because it was 1) I2C (no additional pins required) 2) cheap and 3) readily available from JLCPCB. Interestingly, all of the real-time clock chips I found count in seconds/minutes/hours/days/months/years. This makes sense for a really simple device with minimal computational power. However, it’s annoying for my purposes, since all I really want is a timestamp I can pass to some other datetime library, and converting between the calendar time and a unix timestamp is non-trivial due to how the chips incompletely handle leap years.</p>
<p>I picked up a few cheap coin vibration motors to use for vibration support (for the rare cartridge that had a built-in vibration motor).</p>
<p>I also used a <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TCA9535">TCA9535</a> I2C I/O expander to connect the face buttons to the MCU. I ran out of pins, and while I <em>could</em> have used the FPGA as a sort of I/O expander, I figured I’d make it simpler for myself (and allow the buttons to be used even if the FPGA was powered off) by letting the MCU read them itself.</p>
<h2 id="pcb-design">PCB Design</h2>
<h3 id="schematic">Schematic</h3>
<p>For this project, as with my previous ones, I used <a href="https://www.kicad.org/">KiCad</a> to create my schematic and do PCB layout. I really can’t recommend KiCad enough: it’s a great program, intuitive to use, and it’s free and open source.</p>
<p>This was a very ambitious project for my level of electrical engineering experience, and creating the schematic took a couple of weeks. I spent a lot of time designing the circuit for each component, because I was afraid I’d do something wrong and end up with a stack of useless boards without the skills needed to debug them. A lot of the component selection actually happened in parallel with schematic design, as I found new requirements or problems and had to change components.</p>
<p>I gained a lot of experience reading component datasheets. It’s a really valuable skill, both for component selection and for creating designs that use the components. Nearly every datasheet has a “typical application” section, where the manufacturer shows how the component would fit into a circuit. At minimum, this has power supply information (e.g. these voltages to these pins with these decoupling capacitors). For more complex components like the DAC, it also has information about power sequencing, different ways the device could be connected to the rest of the system, a register list, that sort of thing. Some components also included PCB layout recommendations. This information was all really helpful, and gave me a good deal of confidence that my board would work as long as I read through the datasheet and followed the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
<p>Then I got to the FPGA. Nearly every component has a single datasheet. Some of them have an additional application note or two. Particularly complex chips (like the ESP32-S3 microcontroller) have a separate datasheet, reference manual, and hardware design guide. The Xilinx Series 7 FPGAs have <em>dozens of datasheets</em>. Overviews, packaging and pinout, configuration guides, BGA design rules, power specifications, clocking resources, I/O specifications, PCB layout guides, design checklists… even a 4MB Excel spreadsheet for estimating power consumption! And believe me, Xilinx didn’t just write documentation for fun: there’s so much documentation because the chip <em>needs</em> this much documentation.</p>
<p>Designing with the FPGA was overwhelming, and <em>way</em> beyond my experience level. At several points I genuinely considered dropping the project altogether. Fortunately, I persevered, and gradually internalized a lot of the information. I also read through the schematics of any open-source Artix-7 development board I could get my hands on. Seeing what other people were doing gave me more confidence that I was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Eventually, I laid out all of the components, connected them, ensured all of the nets were labeled, and ran KiCad’s electrical rules checker (ERC) to find obvious mistakes, I moved on to layout.</p>
<h3 id="layout">Layout</h3>
<p>I did PCB layout at the same time as some of the initial enclosure CAD. The mechanics of how everything fit together influenced the placement of the display connector, cartridge slot, buttons, speakers, and connectors. After I came up with a plausible enclosure design, I placed some of the first key components onto the PCB and locked them into place while I did the rest of the routing.</p>

</figure>

<p>I first focused on components that would be hardest to route. Primarily, the FPGA: the package I was using (CSG324) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_grid_array">BGA</a>, 18x18 with 0.8mm pitch between pins. “Fanning out” all of the I/O signals requires careful routing, and at 0.8mm pitch, it’s difficult to do this routing with cheap PCB manufacturing techniques. I ended up being able to do this routing with a 6-layer PCB (three signal, two ground, one power), with 0.1mm track width and spacing, and 0.4/0.25 mm vias. Fortunately, this is all within the realm of JLCPCB’s capabilities.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/bga-fanout.png" alt="BGA fanout with thin traces and small vias" width="1442" height="1102"> <figcaption>
            <p>BGA fanout with thin traces and small vias</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I routed signals out from the FPGA to other parts, I assigned those signals to the FPGA pins. Similarly, with the MCU, I assigned signals to pins in a way that made routing easier. Certain signals had restrictions (e.g. on the FPGA, the main 50 MHz clock signal can only go into certain pins, or the configuration bitstream can only go to certain pins, or certain pins are differential pairs for HDMI output), but overall, I had a lot of flexibility with pin assignment.</p>
<p>KiCad has a feature where it automatically backs up your project as you work on it. I changed the settings to save every 5 minutes and not delete old backups, which allowed me to generate this timelapse of my layout process:</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>Once I finished placing and routing all of the components, I ran the design rules checker (DRC) and fixed issues. I hesitated for a while before sending the PCB for manufacturing. I re-read the schematics, reviewed the layout, and eventually felt confident enough that I was done. I submitted the order to JLCPCB, and after a few questions by their engineers about component placement, they started manufacturing it.</p>
<h2 id="board-testing-and-bring-up">Board testing and bring-up</h2>
<p>After two weeks or so, I received the assembled boards in the mail:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/rev1-initial-boards.jpg" alt="An assembled board and an unassembled board" width="1440" height="1026"> <figcaption>
            <p>An assembled board and an unassembled board</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First, I probed the power rail test points with a multimeter to check for shorts. Then, I plugged the boards in for the first time, and pressed the power button. To my delight, the green LED turned on, indicating that the power button circuit, power path, and 3.3V regulator worked. The microcontroller USB enumerated, and I could see that it logged some errors (since I hadn’t flashed anything to it yet).</p>
<p>I intended to write the MCU firmware in Rust, but I did initial board testing and bring-up with <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a>. This would let me interactively type in Python and write basic scripts to communicate with the peripherals on the board and make sure I had connected everything correctly. I didn’t have to worry about writing efficient or well-organized code, and could just focus on functionality.</p>
<p>I flashed the MicroPython firmware image, and wrote a couple lines of Python to blink the LED. I powered on the FPGA power domain, and checked that the <code>+1V0</code>, <code>+1V8</code>, and <code>+3V3_FPGA</code> rails had the correct voltage.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a simple bitstream for the FPGA that read the state of the buttons and produced a pattern on the shared signals between the FPGA and the MCU. I wrote simple Python code to configure the FPGA, loaded up the bitstream, and polled the signals from the FPGA. Pressing buttons changed the state, and confirmed that the FPGA was properly powered, and configurable from the MCU.</p>
<p>After I confirmed the FPGA worked, I started writing a simple display driver to initialize the LCD and push some pixels from the MCU over SPI. The initialization sequence uses a number of LCD-specific parameters (voltages, gamma correction, etc.), that I learned from the LCD manufacturer’s example code.</p>


<figure><video controls="" poster="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/lcd-first-signs-of-life-poster.jpg" preload="none">

            <p>(Slowly) pushing pixels to the LCD</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The LCD module’s controller, an ILI9488, has a few quirks: despite claiming that it supports 16-bit colors over SPI, it actually only supports 18-bit colors. This unfortunately meant that the MCU’s LCD driver would be more inefficient than I expected, since it has to expand 16-bit colors to 18-bit before sending them over the bus. This didn’t end up being a huge issue, however, because the FPGA is the one driving the display most of the time.</p>
<p>Another quirk (hardware bug?) is that the ILI9488 doesn’t stop driving its SPI output line, even when its chip-select signal is inactive. This means that the chip will interfere with any other communication on the bus… including the FPGA, which sits on the same bus. I never actually needed to read any data back from the LCD (and even if I did, it supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface#Three-wire">three-wire SPI</a>), so I just cut the trace between the LCD’s SDO line and the SPI bus.</p>

<h3 id="trouble-with-power-domains">Trouble with power domains</h3>
<p>I started trying to communicate with the I2C peripherals (I/O expander, RTC, etc.), and found that nothing was responding. A bit of probing with a logic analyzer revealed that the SCL/SDA lines were being held low, and that powering on the FPGA power domain let the lines be pulled high and communication to happen.</p>
<p>I deduced that this was due to the DAC, which had its IOVDD powered by <code>+3V3_FPGA</code>, which likely caused its protection diodes to pull the IO lines (SCL and SDA) low:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/dac-iovdd-issue.png" alt="The problematic portion of the schematic" width="1862" height="656"> <figcaption>
            <p>The problematic portion of the schematic</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I tested out this theory by cutting the PCB traces connecting the DAC’s IOVDD and <code>+3V3_FPGA</code> with a knife. After this, I2C worked even with the FPGA power disabled. Then, I tested a possible fix by adding a wire to power the DAC’s IOVDD from the <code>+3V3</code> rail. I confirmed that I could still talk to the other I2C devices, and once enabling FPGA power, that I could talk to the DAC too.</p>
<figure>

            <p>DAC IOVDD rework</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While bringing up the LCD, I saw that the FPGA was also pulling down the shared SPI bus lines while it was unpowered. Not enough to prevent communication with the LCD, but it still wasn’t great. Between this and the DAC issue, I learned an important EE lesson: be careful when connecting components in different power domains together. A tristate buffer, such as the <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/SN74LVC1G125">74LVC1G125</a>, could have helped here to isolate the buses.</p>
<p>Once I2C was working, I wrote some basic driver code for the fuel gauge, real-time clock, IMU, and I/O expander, just to check that they all worked correctly. I also checked that the MCU could read from and write to the attached microSD card.</p>
<h4 id="audio-and-video-output-from-the-fpga">Audio and video output from the FPGA</h4>
<p>Next, I updated my testing FPGA bitstream with a to output a test pattern over the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/01/25/displays-we-love-hacking-parallel-rgb/">LCD parallel interface (“DPI”)</a>, and a test tone to the DAC over the I2S interface. Then, I began poking on the MCU side to configure the LCD controller and DAC appropriately.</p>
<p>With some amount of trial and error, I convinced the LCD to accept input from the FPGA. Most of the trial and error revolved around the rotation of the LCD module. Soon after, I configured the DAC properly, and it played the test tone from the FPGA over the speakers and the headphones.</p>

<p>At this point, much of the board was working, so I soldered on the rest of the components (cartridge slot, cartridge switch, link port, shoulder buttons).</p>
<p>With the cartridge slot in place, I had everything I needed to port over the Game Boy emulator from my last project. I did a quick-and-dirty port of the emulator, with some hacking around to connect the core to the audio, video, and the physical cartridge. I was able to play the first Game Boy game on the device far sooner than I was expecting:</p>

<h4 id="fpga-communication-and-memory">FPGA communication and memory</h4>
<p>I spent the next month or so implementing things on the FPGA. I started on the SPI receiver implementation, so that the MCU and FPGA could communicate.</p>
<p>It was relatively straightforward to write <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/handheld/fpga/src/main/scala/platform/handheld/SpiReceiver.scala">the initial version</a>, which 4x oversampled the SPI signals from the main system clock. For the Game Boy, that was ~8 MHz, for a maximum SPI speed of 2 MHz. The MicroPython ESP32-S3 SPI implementation supported only single SPI, so that allowed for a maximum transfer speed of 256 KB/s. This was sufficient to do most of my initial testing, but I later <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/handheld/fpga/src/main/scala/platform/handheld/SpiReceiverFifo.scala">wrote an improved SPI receiver</a> to run with an internal 200 MHz clock (from a PLL that turned on and off with the chip-select signal to save power), communicating with the rest of the system via a pair of FIFOs. This added a lot of complexity and edge cases, but it greatly improved performance, allowing the bus to run at 40 MHz.</p>
<p>I wrote the SPI interface to the FPGA with memory-like semantics: each SPI transfer starts with a command byte, encoding whether it’s a read or write transfer, the size of each word in the transfer (8, 16, or 32 bits), and whether the “target address” should autoincrement as the transfer progresses. Then, a 32-bit address, followed by reading or writing the data. Each thing that the MCU might want to access (control registers, blocks of memory) are mapped into the 32-bit address space.</p>
<p>As with my previous FPGA project, I wrote almost all of the FPGA code in <a href="https://www.chisel-lang.org/">Chisel</a>, a Scala-based HDL. The remaining bits were the top-level Verilog. Chisel made it really simple to parametrize, compose, and test the various modules that I wrote.</p>
<p>Once I had the SPI receiver working, I wrote controllers for the on-board SRAM and SDRAM. The SRAM was relatively simple (although I still got it slightly wrong at first). The SDRAM was a bit tricky, and even as I write this I’m not quite satisfied with its performance, and intend to rewrite it in the future.</p>
<p>I exposed the SRAM and SDRAM interfaces to the MCU via SPI, which allowed me to read and write to these pieces of memory from the MCU. I used this a lot for testing: writing patterns into memory and reading them back to ensure that read and write both worked.</p>
<p>Side note: SDRAM has to be continuously refreshed, otherwise the stored data decays over time. It depends on the chip, but typically each row has to be read and written back (or auto-refreshed, which does the same thing) at least once every 64 milliseconds to avoid losing state. What I found interesting, however, is that the data can actually persist for quite a bit longer. I discovered that when I was reconfiguring the FPGA between tests, most of the test data that I had previously written would still stick around even without being refreshed. In the first few seconds some bits would start flipping, and over the course of a few minutes, most of what was written was completely unintelligible.</p>
<p>With the SDRAM controller and SPI receiver written, I was then able to implement the “emulated cartridge” part of the Game Boy emulator, where the MCU reads a ROM file off of the microSD card and sends it to the FPGA to be stored in SDRAM. Then, the FPGA “emulates” a cartridge (rather than interfacing with a real physical cartridge). After a few stupid mistakes, I was able to run test ROMs and homebrew. As an added bonus, since I was using my own SDRAM controller directly, I didn’t have any of <a href="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/fpga-gameboy-emulator/#fixing-an-audio-bug-on-the-game-boy-color">the performance issues I’d faced before</a> when accessing the ROM stored in memory.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-microcontroller-firmware-in-rust">Writing the microcontroller firmware in Rust</h2>
<p>By this point I had tested, in some form or another, all of the different components of the system. I’m really surprised that everything worked in my first board revision – even the rework I did early on wasn’t actually required for functionality.</p>
<p>I decided now was a good time to start building an interactive GUI. Up until this point, I had just been running commands in the MicroPython REPL. However, I didn’t want to build a whole UI in Python just to throw it away later, so I also started working on the “production” Rust firmware.</p>
<p>In the last few years, a lot of progress has been made towards making Rust on the ESP32 chips work well, even on the chips that use the Xtensa ISA. I followed the <a href="https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/">Rust on ESP Book</a> and quickly had an environment set up. I opted for the <a href="https://docs.esp-rs.org/book/overview/using-the-standard-library.html">“Rust with the Standard Library”</a> approach, so that I could benefit from <a href="https://idf.espressif.com/">ESP-IDF</a>, especially the built-in support for USB and SD cards with the FAT filesystem.</p>
<p>I started porting over the drivers I had written in Python. I found embedded Rust to be a bit verbose in some cases, but overall pleasant to use and worth the (little) trouble.</p>
<h3 id="gui">GUI</h3>
<p>I starting writing my own minimal GUI framework for basic menus. I poked around with the <a href="https://docs.rs/embedded-graphics/latest/embedded_graphics/"><code>embedded_graphics</code></a> library, but soon found that the typical patterns I was expecting to use weren’t a great fit for Rust. I also started planning out different screens and realized that I probably actually wanted to use a more comprehensive UI framework.</p>
<figure>

            <p>Early rom select screen</p>

<hr>
<p>Ultimately, I settled on <a href="https://github.com/slint-ui/slint">Slint</a>, a Rust-native declarative GUI framework with excellent support for embedded devices. Slint has a custom DSL to describe the UI and composable components. After a bit of practice I found myself to be really productive with it. I enjoyed using Slint, and I’d use it again in the future. The authors are responsive on GitHub, and the project has steadily improved over the year or so that I’ve been using it.</p>
<p>There were a few rough edges for my use case, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>The built-in GUI elements and examples were all heavily oriented around mouse or touchscreen navigation. Game Bub only has buttons for navigation, however, so I had to make my own widgets (buttons, lists) that worked with key navigation. This involved a few hacks, because Slint’s focus handling was a little bit simplistic.</li>
<li>The built-in GUI styles looked (in my opinion) bad on a low DPI screen. Text was excessively anti-aliased and hard to read at small sizes. This was also fixed by building my own widgets.</li>
<li>Slint doesn’t have a great story around supporting different “screens” – I had to build some of my own infrastructure to be able to support navigation between the main menu, games, rom select, settings, etc.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/screenshot-main-menu.png" alt="Main menu" width="480" height="320"> <figcaption>
            <p>Main menu</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The GUI is rendered on the MCU, and then the rendered framebuffer is sent over to the FPGA. Slint supports partial rendering, where only the parts of the screen that have changed are updated, which improved performance. The FPGA maintains a copy of the framebuffer and ultimately is responsible for driving the display. This has a few advantages over driving the display directly from the MCU:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending a framebuffer at 40 MHz QSPI to the FPGA is 16x faster than sending it to the LCD controller at 10 MHz (the fastest speed supported by the ILI9488)</li>
<li>The UI is rendered at 240x160 to improve performance and maintain the GBA aesthetic, but the LCD controller doesn’t have a scaler, so the MCU would have to send 4x the pixels. The FPGA can easily scale the UI framebuffer itself.</li>
<li>The FPGA can composite the emulator output with a semi-transparent “overlay” to support an in-game menu, volume / brightness bars, battery notifications, etc.</li>
<li>An external display (e.g. monitor or TV) can be driven by the FPGA via HDMI</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="firmware-improvements">Firmware improvements</h3>
<p>I spent some time making a variety of firmware improvements, mostly polish and quality-of-life. I added a settings screen to set the date and time, whether to use Game Boy (DMG) or Game Boy Color (CGB) mode when playing Game Boy games, etc.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/screenshot-settings-early.png" alt="Settings screen" width="480" height="320"> <figcaption>
            <p>Settings screen</p>
        </figcaption>

<p>Then I improved the ROM select file browser, and added a battery level indicator.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/screenshot-load-rom.png" alt="Rom select screen" width="480" height="320"> <figcaption>
            <p>Rom select screen</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I also got sick of having to take the microSD card out of the device and connect it to my computer through a series of adapters (microSD to SD to USB-A to USB-C), so I implemented a basic utility to expose the microSD card as a USB Mass Storage Device, using <a href="https://github.com/hathach/tinyusb">TinyUSB</a> and the ESP32-S3’s USB-OTG capabilities.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/screenshot-usb-storage.png" alt="USB Mass Storage screen" width="480" height="320"> <figcaption>
            <p>USB Mass Storage screen</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It was a little bit more difficult than I expected, because USB Mass Storage requires the device to provide raw block access. This means that the filesystem has to be unmounted by the device, otherwise the device and host could conflict and corrupt the filesystem. The ESP32-S3 also only supports USB Full Speed, for a practical maximum transfer speed of ~600KB/sec. It’s really useful for transferring save files or updating the FPGA bitstreams, but less useful for transferring a large number of ROM files.</p>
<p>Later, I implemented <a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs/MBC7.html">MBC7</a> support in the Game Boy emulator for Kirby Tilt ’n Tumble, using the on-board accelerometer.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-enclosure">Creating the enclosure</h2>
<p>After I implemented a decent amount of software functionality, I decided to finish the enclosure design. The bare board just wasn’t cutting it anymore, and the taped LCD module, loose speakers, and rubber-banded battery was fragile.</p>

<p>I came into this project without any CAD or 3D printing experience. I looked at a few different CAD software packages, and I ultimately settled on <a href="https://www.freecad.org/">FreeCAD</a>, primarily because it was free and open source. I learned how to use the software with some video tutorials. FreeCAD, unfortunately, was a little bit rough around the edges and I ended up running into some annoying issues. Nevertheless, I powered through and finished the design.</p>

<p>I found parametric modeling, where the geometry of the model is defined by constraints and dimensions, to be intuitive. However overall, I found 3D CAD to be very time consuming. I think a large part of this is my inexperience, but thinking in three dimensions is a lot more difficult than, say, a 2D PCB layout. Creating a full assembly was even more difficult: I had to visualize how the front and rear pieces would fit together, where the screws would go, and how the buttons, screen, speaker, cartridge slot, battery, and ports would all fit in. This project definitely pushed the boundaries of my (previously non-existent) product design skills.</p>
<p>After finishing the design, I printed out the technical drawing at a 1:1 scale and physically placed the board and other components down as a final check. Then, I sent it to JLCPCB for manufacturing. I opted for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">SLA resin printing</a>, for high precision and a smooth finish.</p>

<p>After a couple weeks, I got the finished enclosure and custom buttons back.</p>

<p>I wasn’t sure how dimensionally accurate the 3D printing would be, so I added a lot of extra clearance around the buttons and ports. As it turned out, the printing was very precise, so the buttons rattled around a little in the oversized button holes.</p>
<p>It’s a little bit chunky (smaller than an original Game Boy, though!) and the ergonomics aren’t ideal, but I was really happy to finally have an enclosure. It actually started (sort of) looking like a real product, and I wasn’t constantly worried about breaking it anymore.</p>
<h2 id="game-boy-advance-support">Game Boy Advance support</h2>
<p>In mid-April 2024, I started working on Game Boy Advance support. I had some prior familiarity with the system, having previously written <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gba-emulator">a Game Boy Advance emulator in Rust</a>.</p>
<p>I won’t go into all of the details of how I wrote the emulator here (this article is already long enough!). If you’re interested, my <a href="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/fpga-gameboy-emulator/">previous article about my Game Boy FPGA emulator</a> goes into detail about the general process of writing an emulator, and for a high-level introduction to the Game Boy Advance (from a technical perspective), I recommend <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/game-boy-advance/">Rodrigo Copetti’s article</a>. In general, I tried to implement the emulator the way it might actually have been implemented in the original hardware: each cycle of the FPGA corresponds to one actual hardware cycle (no cheating!).</p>
<p>As with the Game Boy, I did nearly all of my development with a simulator backed by <a href="https://www.veripool.org/verilator/">Verilator</a> and <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a>. By the end of the development process, the simulator was running at about 8% of the real-time speed (on an M3 MacBook Air with excellent single-core performance), which was a bit painful.</p>
<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>
<p>The Game Boy Advance CPU, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM7#ARM7TDMI">ARM7TDMI</a>, is significantly more complicated than the Game Boy’s SM83 (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80">Z80</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080">8080</a>-ish hybrid). However, in some ways, it was easier to understand and implement: the ARM7TDMI is much closer to a simple modern processor architecture, and it’s extensively documented by ARM. For example, the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0210/c/?lang=en">ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual</a> has block diagrams and detailed cycle-by-cycle instruction timing descriptions.</p>
<figure>

            <p>ARM7TDMI block diagram (source: <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0210/c/?lang=en">ARM7TDMI Technical Reference Manual</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I had a lot of fun <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/tree/handheld/fpga/src/main/scala/gba/cpu">implementing the CPU</a>. The architecture has a three-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute) – a division that feels natural when you implement it in hardware. The ARM7TDMI has two instruction sets: the standard 32-bit ARM instruction set, and the compressed 16-bit THUMB instruction set. I implemented the CPU the way it works in hardware, where the only difference between ARM and THUMB is the decode stage.</p>
<p>As I was implementing the CPU, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/handheld/fpga/src/test/scala/gba/cpu/ARM7TDMISpec.scala">test cases</a> for each instruction. Each test checks the functionality of the instruction: processor state, register values after, as well as the cycle-by-cycle behavior and interaction with the memory bus. This was helpful for catching regressions as I implemented more and more control logic. It was also really satisfying to be able to implement individual instructions, then write the tests, and check that everything worked.</p>
<p>Chisel made it easy to write out the <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/handheld/fpga/src/main/scala/gba/cpu/Control.scala">CPU control logic</a>. The CPU control logic is a state machine that generates microarchitectural control signals (e.g. bus A should hold the value from the first read register, bus B should hold an immediate value, the memory unit should start fetching the computed address, etc.). Chisel allowed me to collect common functionality into functions (e.g. <code>nextInstruction()</code> to set up the signals to dispatch the next decoded instruction, or <code>flushPipeline()</code> to signal that the pipeline should be flushed and a new instruction should be fetched from the current program counter).</p>
<p>I found it helpful to draw out timing diagrams with <a href="https://wavedrom.com/">WaveDrom</a> when working through instructions, especially to deal with the pipelined memory bus.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By mid-May (about a month later), I finished the CPU implementation (with occasional bug fixes after) and moved onto the rest of the system.</p>
<h3 id="ppu-mmio-and-everything-else">PPU, MMIO, and everything else</h3>
<p>Over the next month and a half, I implemented the majority of the rest of the Game Boy Advance. The CPU interacts with the rest of the system via <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek-gba-i-o-map.htm">memory-mapped IO (MMIO)</a> registers. Unlike the Game Boy CPU, which can only access memory a single byte at a time, the ARM7TDMI can make 8-bit, 16-bit, and 32-bit accesses. This complicates MMIO, and the different hardware registers and memory regions in the GBA respond to different access widths in different ways.</p>
<p>I started with the Picture Processing Unit (PPU), which produces the video output. The author of <a href="https://github.com/nba-emu/NanoBoyAdvance">NanoBoyAdvance</a>, fleroviux, had helpfully documented the <a href="https://nba-emu.github.io/hw-docs/ppu/ppu.html">PPU VRAM access patterns</a>, which gave a lot of insight into how the PPU might work internally. <a href="https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm">Tonc</a> was also immensely helpful for implementing the PPU and testing individual pieces of functionality.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/tonc-test.png" alt="(Sort of) running a Tonc PPU demo" width="963" height="699"> <figcaption>
            <p>(Sort of) running a Tonc PPU demo</p>

</figure>

<p>The PPU took a few weeks, and then I moved onto DMA, followed by hardware timers, and audio. Of course, as I’d try new tests, demos, and games, I’d uncover bugs and fix them.</p>

<h3 id="cartridge-support">Cartridge support</h3>
<p>Game Boy and Game Boy Advance cartridges use the same 32-pin connector. However, they work very differently. The Game Boy cartridge bus is asynchronous: the game outputs the 16-bit address (64 KiB address space) on one set of pins and lowers the <code>nRD</code> pin, some time later, the 8-bit read data from the ROM stabilizes on a separate set of pins.</p>
<p>For the GBA, Nintendo extended the bus data width to 16-bit and the address space to 25-bit (32 MiB). However, they kept roughly the same set of pins, accomplishing this by multiplexing the 24 data/address pins: the console outputs the address (in increments of the data word size of 16-bits, for a 24-bit physical address), then lowers the <code>nCS</code> signal to “latch” the address in the cartridge. Then, each time the console pulses the <code>nRD</code> pin, the cartridge increments its latched address and outputs the next data over the same pins. This allows for a continuous read of sequential data without having to send a new address for each access. The GBA also allows games to <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek-gba-system-control.htm">configure cartridge access timings</a> to support different ROM chips.</p>
<h4 id="cartridge-timing">Cartridge timing</h4>
<p>I had to do a lot of my own research here. Software emulators don’t need to care about the precise timing of the cartridge bus, so there wasn’t much documentation. To figure out the exact cycle-accurate timing, I used a <a href="https://www.saleae.com/">Saleae</a> logic analyzer and connected it to the cartridge bus. I wrote a test program for the GBA to do different types of accesses (reads, writes, sequential, non-sequential, DMA) with different timing configurations.</p>
<figure>

            <p>Portion of a trace</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After coming up with numerous scenarios (especially around the interaction between DMA and the CPU, and starting and stopping burst accesses), I came up with a consistent model for how cartridge accesses worked. I created some timing diagrams to help:</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/cartridge-timing-diagram.svg" alt="Timing diagram of a non-sequential access followed by a sequential access"> <figcaption>
            <p>Timing diagram of a non-sequential access followed by a sequential access</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, I started implementing the cartridge controller state machine based on my observations, paired with an emulated cartridge implementation. With the emulated cartridge, I was able to properly run real games in the simulator.</p>
<h4 id="running-it-on-the-fpga">Running it on the FPGA</h4>
<p>I quickly implemented physical cartridge support, to be able to finally run it on the actual FPGA. I connected the signals, built a new bitstream, and… it didn’t work at all. The Game Boy Advance boot screen ran, but it didn’t get any further than that. I implemented the emulated cartridge on the FPGA (reading ROM files from the SD card), and it worked! Which was great, but physical cartridges still didn’t.</p>
<p>I used the logic analyzer to observe how my emulator was interacting with the cartridge compared to how an actual GBA, and found numerous issues.</p>
<p>One of the first things I noticed was short <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch#Electronics_glitch">glitches</a> on the <code>nCS</code> line. I knew these had to be glitches (rather than incorrect logic), because they were 8 nanoseconds long, much shorter than the ~59.6ns clock period. Since the cartridge latches the address on a falling edge of <code>nCS</code>, glitches cause it to latch an address when it shouldn’t, screwing up reads.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/cartridge-bus-glitches.png" alt="Glitches on the cartridge bus" width="2177" height="600"> <figcaption>
            <p>Glitches on the cartridge bus</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here, I learned an important lesson in digital design: output signals should come directly from flip-flops, with no logic in between.</p>
<p>After each flip-flop outputs a new value (on the rising edge of the clock), the signals propagate through the chip. As they propagate, taking different paths of different lengths throughout the chip, the output from each lookup table (LUT) is unstable. These values only stabilize near the end of the clock cycle (assuming the design met timing closure), and then each flip-flop stores the stable value at the next rising edge. If you output a signal from logic, this instability is visible from outside of the chip, manifesting as glitches in the output signal. If you instead output the signal from a flip-flop, it’ll change only on each clock edge, remaining stable in the middle.</p>
<p>And of course, I had written the cartridge controller without thinking about this, and <em>all</em> of the output signals were generated from logic. I rewrote the controller to output everything from flip-flops, which had a series of cascading changes since all of the signals now had to be computed one clock cycle earlier than I expected.</p>
<p>There were other issues too – part of the problem was that my emulated cartridge model was too permissive, and didn’t catch some fairly obvious incorrect behavior. After a few days of intensive debugging with the logic analyzer, I got to the point where I could play games from physical cartridges.</p>

<h4 id="cartridge-prefetch-buffer">Cartridge prefetch buffer</h4>
<p>The ARM7TDMI has a single shared instruction and data memory bus. As a result, a long series of sequential memory accesses is rare. Even a linear piece of code without branches that includes “load” or “store” instructions would produce a series of non-sequential memory accesses, as the CPU fetches an instruction from one location, loads a register from a different location, and then goes back to fetching the next instruction.</p>
<p>This poses a real performance issue on the GBA, because every non-sequential access from the cartridge incurs a multi-cycle penalty. Nintendo attempted to mitigate this somewhat with the “prefetch buffer” (<a href="https://mgba.io/2015/06/27/cycle-counting-prefetch/#game-pak-prefetch">read this post by endrift, the author of mGBA, for more details</a>) which attempts to keep a cartridge read burst active between CPU accesses. Without emulating the prefetch buffer, some games lag (I noticed this the most in Mario Kart Super Circuit, and some rooms of Metroid: Zero Mission).</p>
<p>The prefetch buffer, while simple in theory, is not well documented and has a lot of corner cases and weird interactions. Emulator developers often start by taking a shortcut: making all cartridge accesses take a single cycle when the prefetch buffer is enabled. This wouldn’t work for me, since I actually had to interface with the physical cartridge.</p>
<p>So, I set out to do some more research to figure out exactly how the prefetch buffer worked. After making some educated guesses and tests, I came up with a reasonable model of how it might work.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/prefetch-notes.jpg" alt="Notes about the prefetch state machine" width="1440" height="1744"> <figcaption>
            <p>Notes about the prefetch state machine</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Actually implementing it took a lot of work, and I kept stumbling upon more and more corner cases. Eventually I got to the point where all games appeared to run at full speed, and most importantly, didn’t randomly crash. My implementation isn’t perfect: there are still a few <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/suite">mGBA test suite</a> timing tests I don’t pass, but it’s certainly sufficient to play games.</p>
<h3 id="link-cable-support">Link cable support</h3>
<p>I also added support for the GBA link cable, for multiplayer games. The GBA supports <a href="http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek-gba-communication-ports.htm">a few different physical protocols</a> with the link cable:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Normal</em>: standard duplex SPI, used for communicating with accessories</li>
<li><em>Multiplayer</em>: custom multi-drop UART-like protocol, used to link up to four GBAs together for multiplayer games</li>
<li><em>Joybus</em>: the Nintendo N64 and GameCube controller protocol, used to connect to a GameCube</li>
<li><em>UART</em>: duplex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a> with flow control, <em>not used by games</em></li>
<li><em>General Purpose</em>: controlling the four pins individually as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_input/output">GPIO</a>, <em>not used by games</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The timing of these isn’t well documented, so I did my own research.</p>

<p>I did a lot of testing with examples from the <a href="https://github.com/afska/gba-link-connection">gba-link-connection</a> library, intended for homebrew GBA games, but helpful for testing the different transfer modes in a controlled environment.</p>

The adapter didn’t quite fit against the Game Bub enclosure, so I had to take it apart for testing.</p>

<h3 id="test-roms-and-accuracy">Test ROMs and accuracy</h3>
<p>During the emulator development, I had used various test ROMS (mentioned before) to test basic functionality in isolation. As my emulator became mature enough to run commercial games, however, I started to shift some of my focus to accuracy-focused test ROMs.</p>
<p>These test ROMs (such as the <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/suite">mGBA test suite</a>) generally test really specific hardware quirks and timing. For example, they might test what happens when you run an instruction that ARM calls “unpredictable”, or the exact number of cycles it takes to service an interrupt in specific scenarios, or <a href="https://bmchtech.github.io/post/multiply/">the value of the “carry” flag after performing a multiplication</a>. These are the kinds of things that don’t actually matter for playing games, but present a fun challenge and a way to “score” your emulator against others. This also highlights the collaborative nature of the emulation development community: people sharing their research and helping each other out.</p>
<p>I won’t talk about all of the tests here (for my emulator’s test results, <a href="https://github.com/elipsitz/gamebub/blob/handheld/docs/accuracy.md">see this page</a>). But I do want to mention the <a href="https://tcrf.net/AGS_Aging_Cartridge"><strong>AGB Aging Cartridge</strong></a>. This is an official test cartridge from Nintendo, likely used as part of a factory test or RMA procedure. Apparently, Nintendo has <em>also</em> used it to test their emulators (e.g. their GBA emulator on the Nintendo Switch). This test has generally been considered to be difficult to pass (it tests some specific hardware quirks), but it’s easier now that the tests have been <a href="https://github.com/DenSinH/AGSTests/">thoroughly reverse engineered and documented</a>. Still, passing it is a nice milestone:</p>

<h2 id="second-hardware-revision">Second hardware revision</h2>
<p>Towards the end of 2024, approximately one year after I originally designed Game Bub, I decided to make a second hardware revision. Over the past year, I had been keeping track of all of the things I would want to change in a future revision. Since the first version of Game Bub miraculously worked without any major issues, this list was primarily minor issues and ergonomics changes.</p>
<h3 id="pcb">PCB</h3>
<p>I fixed the <a href="#trouble-with-power-domains">minor I2C power issues</a>, removed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_designator">reference designators</a> from the PCB silkscreen (they looked messy with the dense board, and I didn’t use them for anything anyway), and changed around some test points. I improved the rumble circuit to be more reponsive, and switched to a PCB-mounted vibration motor.</p>
<p>The first version of Game Bub was fairly thick, measuring 12.9mm at the top and 21.9mm on the bottom. The thickness of the rear enclosure was dictated by the thickness of Game Boy cartridges, but I made several changes to the front. I moved the <em>incredibly tall</em> (8.5mm!) link port to the back, and removed the HDMI port (more on that later). I changed the headphone jack (5.0mm tall – no wonder they started getting removed from phones) to a mid-mount one that sunk into the PCB and reduced the overall height.</p>
<p>I also switched from an <code>ESP32-S3-WROOM-1</code> module (3.1mm depth) to an <code>ESP32-S3-MINI-1</code> (2.4mm depth). I should have done this from the beginning, I just didn’t even know the ESP32-S3-MINI existed. This had the side effect of giving me 3 more GPIOs, which allowed me to put the FPGA and LCD on separate SPI busses, avoiding the minor issue of an unpowered FPGA interfering with LCD communication, and allowed for faster boot because the LCD could be configured at the same time as the FPGA.</p>
<p>I switched the speakers, from the fully-enclosed <a href="https://www.sameskydevices.com/product/audio/speakers/miniature-(10-mm~40-mm)/ces-20134-088pmb">CES-20134-088PMB</a> to the <a href="https://www.sameskydevices.com/product/audio/speakers/miniature-(10-mm~40-mm)/cms-160903-18s-x8">CMS-160903-18S-X8</a>. I made this change primarily for ease of assembly. The first speaker had a wire connector that plugged into the board, and I found it difficult to connect during assembly without having the wire interfere with buttons. The new speaker is smaller and has a spring contact connector, so it just presses against the PCB as the device is assembled. This required some speaker enclosure design – an unenclosed speaker in free air sounds quiet and tinny.</p>
<p>I reworked the layout of the face buttons and D-pad to match the spacing of the Nintendo DSi. This allowed me to use the silicone membranes from the DSi for an improved button feel and reduced rattling. I was also hoping to use the plastic buttons from the DSi (which were higher quality compared to my 3D printed buttons), but even with the new thinner design, the buttons weren’t quite tall enough to be easily pressed.</p>
<p>I created another timelapse of my modifications to produce the second version of the PCB:</p>

<h3 id="enclosure">Enclosure</h3>
<p>For the second revision of the enclosure, I switched to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_360">Fusion 360</a> for the CAD work. While I would have preferred to keep using FreeCAD, I found that it was making it harder for me to be productive. Fusion 360 has a free version for hobbyists (with some limitations that have gradually increased over time), and overall I’ve found it very pleasant to use.</p>

<p>Unlike with the first revision, I waited until I had a final design for both the enclosure and the PCB before getting anything manufactured. This let me go back and forth, making small modifications to each of them as needed.</p>
<p>I wanted to make the end result look more polished and professional, so I contracted a factory to produce custom LCD cover glass, made out of 0.7mm thick tempered glass with a black silkscreen. It was relatively expensive for a low quantity order, but I’m really happy with how it turned out.</p>

<h3 id="manufacturing-and-assembly">Manufacturing and assembly</h3>
<p>I got the PCBs manufactured and assembled, this time with black solder mask to look <em>cool</em>.</p>

<p>I had two enclosures made. The first was black PA-12 Nylon, printed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-jet_fusion">MJF</a>. Nylon is strong and durable, and the MJF 3D printing technology produces a slightly grainy surface that’s really pleasant to hold in your hand.</p>

<p>The second one was made of transparent resin (SLA, like before). This lets me show off the PCB that I worked so hard on, and evokes the transparent electronics trend from the 90s.</p>

<p>Assembly was a lot easier this time around: the silicone membranes held the face buttons in place, the speakers had a spring contact instead of wires, and the shoulder button assembly was better. In the first revision, I had excessively large tolerances because I wasn’t sure how precise the 3D printing would be. In the second version, I was able to shrink these.</p>
<p>The final product looked and felt a lot better, too. The edges were more rounded, and the device was thinner and easier to hold. The buttons felt <em>much</em> better to press and didn’t rattle around, and the cover glass over the LCD added polish.</p>

<h3 id="dock">Dock</h3>
<p>I previously mentioned that I removed the full-size HDMI port from the first revision. I had first planned to change it to a mini-HDMI or micro-HDMI port to reduce the size, but I was worried about durability.</p>
<p>What I <em>really</em> wanted to do was output video through the USB-C port, avoiding the need for any HDMI port at all. Unfortunately, I had already concluded earlier that I wouldn’t be able to output <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort">DisplayPort</a> video signals from the FPGA, which meant that I couldn’t use the standard USB-C DisplayPort alternate mode.</p>
<p>However, an idea struck me towards the end of 2024: I didn’t actually <em>need</em> to use the DisplayPort alt-mode. The USB-C connector, in addition to the USB 2.0 D+/D- pins, has four differential pairs (for USB superspeed). Conveniently, HDMI <em>also</em> uses four differential pairs. The USB specification allows for vendor-specific alt-modes, so I could just implement my own, outputting the HDMI signal directly from the FPGA over the additional pins. Then I could build a custom dock that takes those pins and connects them to the data lines of an HDMI port.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/usb-c-pinout.png" alt="USB-C receptacle pinout with super-speed pairs highlighted (source: Chindi.ap on Wikipedia)" width="1290" height="478"> <figcaption>
            <p>USB-C receptacle pinout with super-speed pairs highlighted (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USB_Type-C_Receptacle_Pinout.svg">source: Chindi.ap on Wikipedia</a>)</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>According to the USB specification, alternate modes must be negotiated by both sides first, using the USB-C Power Delivery (USB-PD) protocol, to prevent them from interfering with devices that aren’t expecting them. I don’t actually have a USB-PD controller in Game Bub (too much added complexity), so I took a shortcut: have a microcontroller in the dock communicate with the Game Bub over regular USB and perform a handshake before enabling HDMI output from the FPGA. Once Game Bub detects that it’s been disconnected from the dock, it can just switch back to using the internal display.</p>
<p>I realized that the dock also presents another opportunity for controller support. I originally wanted to build wireless controller support into the handheld, but the ESP32-S3 only supports Bluetooth Low Energy, and the majority of controllers use Bluetooth Classic. Fortunately, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi_Pico">Raspberry Pi Pico W</a> (with an RP2040 MCU) supports both types of Bluetooth, so I just decided to use that as the microcontroller on the dock. Game controllers connect to the dock over Bluetooth, and the Pico sends the controller inputs to the device. I wired up the <code>SBU1</code> and <code>SBU2</code> USB-C pins as a direct connection between the FPGA and the dock for low latency input.</p>
<p>The RP2040 acts as the USB host, and Game Bub only needs to be a device. I also added a USB hub chip and some additional USB ports on the back of the dock to allow for wired controller support too. Just like with wireless controllers, the dock handles the direct controller communication, and just passes inputs back to the main Game Bub unit.</p>
<p>Since the dock is so simple (comparatively), it only took about a day to design and lay out.</p>
<figure>
    <img loading="lazy" src="https://eli.lipsitz.net/posts/introducing-gamebub/media/dock-pcb.jpg" alt="Assembled dock PCB" width="1440" height="1016"> <figcaption>
            <p>Assembled dock PCB</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I had also hoped to use the dock to solve another problem around HDMI output: HDMI sinks (monitors, TVs) pull the HDMI data lines up to 3.3 volts, and can actually backfeed power to the HDMI source. For Game Bub, this meant that a powered-off unit would turn itself on when connected over HDMI. I used a HDMI buffer chip in the dock to try to alleviate this problem, but the chip I used wasn’t actually properly suited to this use-case and interfered with video output, so I had to carefully rework the board to bypass the chip. I’ll have to fix it in a later revision.</p>

<p>After the rework, HDMI output worked! The rest of the features are still a work in progress.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Congratulations on reading this far! This writeup ended up being incredibly long, even with a lot of details left out.</p>
<p>I’m proud of what I accomplished over the last year and a half: I met all of my goals to produce a polished handheld FPGA retrogaming device. I pushed my electrical engineering and product design skills to the limit, and learned a lot in the process. Professional product and hardware designers deserve <em>so much</em> respect.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>
<p>I deliberately designed this project with lots of possible extension opportunities to keep me occupied for a long time. I worked hard to get to the point where I’m comfortable sharing Game Bub with the world, but I still have a long list of TODOs for the future.</p>
<p>In the near term, I’m going to work on finishing the dock, implementing wireless controller support (and maybe wired). I plan to use the <a href="https://github.com/ricardoquesada/bluepad32">Bluepad32</a> library to do so.</p>
<p>I also want to improve the accuracy of my Game Boy Advance emulator: my goal here is to someday pass the entire <a href="https://github.com/mgba-emu/suite">mGBA test suite</a>. I hope that I can contribute back to the wonderful <em>emudev</em> community with my emulator, and I plan to write-up some of my research around the GBA cartridge interface and link port.</p>
<p>I have a long list of mostly minor changes to make to the MCU firmware: improving UI render performance, bits of polish like low battery notifications, eliminating display glitching when reloading the FPGA, and that sort of thing. I also plan to add more utilities, like a cartridge dumper and save backup/restore feature.</p>
<p>Some day, I want to emulate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Wireless_Adapter">Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter</a> over Wi-Fi, e.g. with <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32s3/api-reference/network/esp_now.html">ESP-NOW</a>. This won’t be compatible with the original wireless adapter, unfortunately, since that uses raw 2.4 GHz modulation rather than Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>I added a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pmod_Interface">Pmod</a>-compatible header at the top of the device for future hardware expansion. I might make a few add-on boards to support <a href="https://gbdev.io/pandocs/IR.html">Game Boy IR communication</a>, a solar sensor for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boktai:_The_Sun_Is_in_Your_Hand">Boktai</a>, or maybe even a basic webcam for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Camera">Game Boy Camera</a> emulation.</p>
<h3 id="wishlist">Wishlist</h3>
<p>I designed Game Bub with extremely low production volumes in mind, using off-the-shelf commodity parts to keep the overall cost down. However, there are a few things I would have liked to be able to do, but are only possible with much higher volumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A better LCD module (likely custom): native landscape mode to avoid the need for triple-buffering. Ideally a 720x480 resolution display, to allow for 3x GBA scaling and filter effects.</li>
<li>High-quality injection molded case and buttons: 3D printing is great for low volume production, but an injection molded case would be great. It would be more precise (allowing for tighter tolerances), stronger, and allow for significantly more color options.</li>
<li>Custom battery pack: or at least customizing the length of the connector wire. The current solution is hacky and doesn’t make the best use of internal space, due to limited off-the-shelf battery options.</li>
<li>Smaller BGA parts for SRAM and SDRAM to free up board space (and move internal signals to 1.8 volts): this is actually something that would be possible in smaller volumes too, if I were willing to send parts from Mouser or DigiKey to JLCPCB for assembly.</li>
</ul>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bandwidth">https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-bandwidth</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43027266">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="It’s Time To Rethink 6G"><p><strong>Is the worldwide race</strong> to keep expanding mobile bandwidth a fool’s errand? Could maximum data speeds—on <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mobile-devices">mobile devices</a>, at home, at work—be approaching “fast enough” for most people for most purposes?
</p><p>
	These heretical questions are worth asking, because industry bandwidth tracking data has lately been revealing something surprising: Terrestrial and mobile-data growth is slowing down. In fact, absent a dramatic change in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/consumer-tech">consumer tech</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/broadband">broadband</a> usage patterns, data-rate demand appears set to top out below 1 billion bits per second (1 gigabit per second) in just a few years.
</p><p>
	This is a big deal. A presumption of endless growth in wireless and terrestrial broadband <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/data-rates">data rates</a> has for decades been a key driver behind <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telecom">telecom</a> research funding. To keep telecom’s R&amp;D engine rooms revving, research teams around the world have innovated a seemingly endless succession of technologies to expand bandwidth rates, such as 2G’s 
	<a href="https://telephoneworld.org/cellular-phone-history/the-first-digital-cellular-systems-tdma-gsm-and-iden-2g/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">move to digital cell networks</a>, 3G’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enhanced data-transfer capabilities</a>, and 5G’s <a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/2019-the-year-of-5g" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">low-latency wireless connectivity</a>.
</p><p>
	Yet present-day consumer usage appears set to throw a spanner in the works. Typical real-world <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/5g">5G</a> data rates 
	<a href="https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/performance" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">today achieve</a> up to 500 megabits per second for download speeds (and less for uploads). And some initial studies suggest <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/6g">6G</a> networks could<a href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/communications/6g-speeds-hit-100-gbps-in-new-test-500-times-faster-than-average-5g-cellphones" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> one day supply</a> data at 100 Gb/s. But the demand side of the equation suggests a very different situation.
</p><p>Mainstream consumer applications requiring more than 1 Gb/s border on the nonexistent.</p><p>
	This is in part because mobile applications that need more than 15 to 20 Mb/s are rare, while mainstream consumer applications requiring more than 1 Gb/s border on the nonexistent.
</p><p>
	At most, meeting the demand for multiple simultaneous active applications and users requires hundreds of Mb/s range. To date, no new consumer technologies have emerged to expand the bandwidth margins much beyond the 1 Gb/s plateau.
</p><p>
	Yet wireless companies and researchers today still set their sights on a marketplace where consumer demand will gobble up as much bandwidth as can be provided by their <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mobile-networks">mobile networks</a>. The thinking here seems to be that if more bandwidth is available, new use cases and applications will spontaneously emerge to consume it.
</p><p>
	Is that such a foregone conclusion, though? Many technologies have had phases where customers eagerly embrace every improvement in some parameter—until a saturation point is reached and improvements are ultimately met with a collective shrug.
</p><p>
	Consider a very brief history of airspeed in commercial air travel. Passenger aircraft today fly at around 900 kilometers per hour—and have continued to traverse the skies at the same airspeed range for the past five decades. Although <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/supersonic">supersonic</a> passenger aircraft found a niche from the 1970s through the early 2000s with 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Concorde</a>, commercial supersonic transport is no longer available for the mainstream consumer marketplace today.
</p><p>
	To be clear, there may still be niche use cases for many gigabits per second of wireless bandwidth—just as there may still be executives or world leaders who continue to look forward to 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-new-supersonic-boom" target="_self">spanning the globe at supersonic speeds</a>.
</p><p>
	But what if the vast majority of 6G’s consumer bandwidth demand ultimately winds up resembling today’s 5G <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/profile">profile</a>? It’s a possibility worth imagining.
</p><h2>Consider a Bandwidth-Saturated World</h2><p>
	Transmitting high-end <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/4k-video">4K video</a> today 
	<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">requires</a> 15 Mb/s, according to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>. Home broadband upgrades from, say, hundreds of Mb/s to 1,000 Mb/s (or 1 Gb/s) typically make little to no noticeable difference <a href="https://www.highspeedinternet.com/how-much-internet-speed-do-i-need" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">for the average end user</a>. Likewise, for those with good <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/4g">4G</a> connectivity, 5G makes <a href="https://news.virginmediao2.co.uk/leaving-the-vanity-metrics-behind-and-focusing-on-what-matters-customer-experience/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">much less of an improvement </a>on the mobile experience than advertisers like to claim—despite 5G networks being, <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/what-is-5g/what-are-5g-speeds.html#~q-a" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to Cisco</a>, 1.4 to 14 times as fast as 4G.
</p><p>
	So, broadly, for a typical mobile device today, going much above 15 Mb/s borders on pointless. For a home, assuming two or three inhabitants all separately browsing or watching, somewhere between 100 Mb/s and 1 Gb/s marks the approximate saturation point beyond which further improvements become less and less noticeable, for most use cases.
</p><p>
	Probing a more extreme use case, one of the largest bandwidth requirements in recent consumer tech is 
	<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, whose “<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-may-take-an-enormous-amount-of-internet-bandwidth" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">jaw-dropping bandwidth demand</a>,” in the words of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/windows">Windows</a> Central, amounts to a maximum of 180 Mb/s.
</p><p>
	Stop to think about that for one moment. Here is a leading-edge tech product requiring less than one-fifth of 1 Gb/s, and such a voracious bandwidth appetite today is considered “jaw-dropping.”
</p><p>
	But what about the need to “future proof” the world’s networks? Perhaps most mobile and terrestrial networks don’t need many-Gb/s connectivity now, say the bigger-is-always-better proponents. But the world will soon!
</p><p>
	For starters, then, what bandwidth-hogging technologies are today on the horizon?
</p><p>
	In September, Apple unveiled its <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/iphone">iPhone</a> 16, which CEO <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/tim-cook">Tim Cook</a><a href="https://www.fierce-network.com/modernization/killer-app-5g-will-arrive-next-week" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said </a>would feature <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/generative-ai">generative AI</a> broadly “across [Apple] products.” Could Apple’s new AI capabilities perhaps be a looming, bandwidth-consuming dark horse?
</p><p>
	One high-bandwidth use case would involve the latest iPhone using the camera to recognize a scene and comment on what’s in it. However, that’s not dissimilar to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/google">Google</a> Lens’s 
	<a href="https://lens.google/howlensworks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">visual search feature</a>, which hasn’t markedly changed <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/network-traffic">network traffic</a>. Indeed, this sort of feature, perhaps used a few times per day, could require bandwidth equivalent to a second or two of high-definition video. None of this would come close to saturating the general bandwidth capacities noted above.
</p><p>
	To play devil’s advocate a little more, consider a representative batch of five soon-to-be-scaled-up, potentially high-bandwidth consumer technologies that 
	<em><em>do</em></em> already exist. Do any of them appear poised to generate the many-Gb/s demand that present-day net usage does not?
</p><p>
	What about <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/autonomous-cars">autonomous cars</a>, for instance? Surely they’ll need as much bandwidth as they can possibly be given.
</p><p>
	Yet, the precious few autonomous cars out in the world today are generally designed to work 
	<a href="https://stlpartners.com/articles/private-cellular/are-automated-vehicles-really-a-killer-use-case-for-5g/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">without much </a>in the way of instantaneous <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet">Internet</a> communication. And no autonomous tech around the bend appears set to change the equation substantially, concerning instantaneous bandwidth needs. The future of autonomy may be revolutionary and ultimately inevitable, but it doesn’t appear to require network connectivity much beyond a decent 5G connection.
</p><p>No new technology has emerged that demands network requirements much beyond what 4G and 5G already deliver. </p><p>
	Much the same argument holds for the 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/internet-of-things" target="_self">Internet of things</a> (<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/iot">IoT</a>), which is not expected to increase network traffic <a href="https://www.eseye.com/resources/blogs/high-data-low-latency-iot-connectivity/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">above what a decent 4G connection could yield</a>.
</p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/holographic">
	Holographic</a> communications likewise offer no greater bandwidth sink than any of the above case studies do. For a typical user, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/holograms">holograms</a> are in fact just stereographic video projections. So if a 
	<a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">single 4K stream demands 15 Mb/s</a>, then <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/stereo">stereo</a> 4K streams would require 30 Mb/s. Of course, sophisticated representations of entire 3D scenes for large groups of users interacting with one another in-world could conceivably push bandwidth requirements up. But at this point, we’re getting into <em><em>Matrix</em></em>-like imagined technologies without any solid evidence to suggest a good 4G or 5G connection wouldn’t meet the tech’s bandwidth demands.
</p><p>
	AI in general is the wild card in the deck. The mysterious future directions for this technology suggest that AI broadband and wireless bandwidth needs could conceivably exceed 1 Gb/s. But consider at least the known knowns in the equation: At the moment, present-day AI applications involve small amounts of prompt text or a few images or video clips sent to and from an edge device like a smartphone or a consumer tablet. Even if one allows for the prompt text and photo and video bandwidth requirements to dramatically expand from there, it seems unlikely to match or exceed the already strenuous requirements of a simple 4K video stream. Which, as noted above, would appear to suggest modest bandwidth demands in the range of 15 Mb/s.
</p><p>
	The <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/metaverse">metaverse</a>, meanwhile, has flopped. But even if it picks up steam again tomorrow, current estimates of its bandwidth needs run from 
	<a href="https://www.iceconnect.com/blog/tech-tips/metaverse-network-requirements/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">100 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s</a>—all within 5G’s range. Admittedly, the most aggressive longer-term forecasts for the metaverse suggest that cutting-edge applications could demand as much as <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/wifi/when-will-wi-fi-really-support-the-metaverse-" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">5 Gb/s</a> bandwidth. And while it’s true that in January, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/verizon">Verizon</a> delivered more than 5 Gb/s bandwidth in an <a href="https://voip.review/2025/01/09/verizons-5g-lab-trial-achieves-groundbreaking-5-5-gbps-speed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">experimental 5G network</a>, that result is unlikely to be replicable for most consumers in most settings anytime soon.
</p><p>
	Yet, even allowing for the practical unreachability of 5 Gb/s speeds on a real-world <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/5g-network">5G network</a>, a reader should still weigh the fact that any such imagined applications that might ultimately consume 5 Gb/s of bandwidth represent an extreme. And only the upper end of that subset is what might one day exceed data speeds that present-day 5G tech delivers.
</p><p>
	I would argue, in other words, that no new technology has emerged that demands network requirements much beyond what 4G and 5G already deliver. So at this point future-proofing telecom in the anticipation of tens or more Gb/s of consumer bandwidth demand seems like expensive insurance being taken out against an improbable event.
</p><h2>Consumers Have Already Discovered the Gigabit Plateau</h2><p>
	As can be seen in the charts below—excerpted from my book, 
	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Telecoms-History-Prof-William-Webb/dp/B0D83Z5FYJ" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em><em>The End of Telecoms History</em></em></a>, and compiled from a mix of sources, including <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cisco">Cisco</a> and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/barclays">Barclays</a> Research—a downward trend in data growth has been evident for at least the past decade.
</p><p>
	The statistics being tracked in the charts “Growth of Mobile-Data Usage” and “Growth of Landline-Data Usage” may seem a little counterintuitive at first. But it’s important to clarify that these charts do 
	<em><em>not</em></em> suggest that overall bandwidth usage is declining. Rather, the conclusion these charts lead to is that the rate of bandwidth <em><em>growth</em></em> is slowing.</p><p>
	Let’s start with mobile data. Between 2015 and 2023, there’s a consistent decline in bandwidth growth of some 6 percent per year. The overall trend is a little harder to interpret in landline bandwidth data, because there’s a large COVID-related peak in 2020 and 2021. But even after accounting for this entirely understandable anomaly, the trend is that home and office broadband growth fell on average by around 3 percent per year between 2015 and 2023.</p><p>Extrapolating the trends from both of these curves leads to the ultimate conclusion that data growth should ultimately fall to zero or at least a negligibly small number by around 2027.
</p><p>
	This is an unpopular conclusion. It runs contrary to the persistent drumbeat of a many-Gb/s future that telecom “experts” have been claiming for years. For example, in November 2023 the Biden <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/white-house">White House</a> published its 
	<a href="https://www.ntia.gov/sites/default/files/publications/national_spectrum_strategy_final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">spectrum strategy</a>, which states, “According to one estimate, data traffic on macro <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cellular-networks">cellular networks</a> is expected to increase by over 250 percent in the next 5 years, and over 500 percent in the next 10 years.”
</p><p>
	Additionally, the Stockholm-based telecom company <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/ericsson">Ericsson</a> recently 
	<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/reports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">predicted</a> near-term “surge[s] in mobile data traffic.” And the United Kingdom’s telecommunications <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/regulator">regulator</a>, Ofcom <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0036/248769/conclusions-mobile-spectrum-demand-and-markets.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forecast</a> a bandwidth growth-rate of 40 percent for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>
But, as shown in the charts here, many mobile and Internet users in the developed world seem to be accessing all the bandwidth they need. Data rates are no longer the constraining and determinative factor that they used to be.
</p><p>
	The need to continue developing faster and bigger networks may therefore be overplayed today. That chapter of the Internet’s history is arguably now over, or it soon will be.
</p><h2>The Telecom Industry Will Be Shifting <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gears">Gears</a>, Too</h2><p>
	The implications of having enough coverage and bandwidth are most obvious in the equipment-supply industry.
</p><p>
	Major network suppliers may need to become accustomed to the new reality of data rates leveling out. Are 
	<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2024/3/ericsson-announces-headcount-reduction" target="_blank">Ericsson’s</a> and <a href="https://techblog.comsoc.org/2024/04/18/nokia-like-ericsson-announces-fresh-wave-of-job-cuts/" target="_blank">Nokia’s</a><a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/press-releases/2024/3/ericsson-announces-headcount-reduction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"></a>recent <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/layoffs">layoffs</a> and the bankruptcies of smaller suppliers (such as <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/finance/airspan-to-return-to-private-life-through-bankruptcy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Airspan Networks</a>) a harbinger of what’s coming for telecom markets?
</p><p>
	Operators are already 
	<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/telecommunications-industry-outlook.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">investing less</a> in 5G equipment and are likely already close to “maintenance only” spending. Most mobile and fixed operators have <a href="https://tefficient.com/analysis/public-industry-analysis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not seen revenue growth above inflation </a>for many years but hold out hope that somehow this will turn around. Perhaps, though, if the numbers referenced here are to be believed, that turnaround isn’t coming.
</p><p><img alt="An illustration of a man holding a bottle full of items and pouring it out. " data-rm-shortcode-id="f6a474cc701b85a3f800ae7f2931f6ca" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-man-holding-a-bottle-full-of-items-and-pouring-it-out.png?id=56272704&amp;width=980" height="1351" id="3694e" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/an-illustration-of-a-man-holding-a-bottle-full-of-items-and-pouring-it-out.png?id=56272704&amp;width=980" width="2011"><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Davide Comai</small></p><p>
	Telecommunications has historically been a high-growth industry, but current trends suggest it’s heading toward something more static—more like a public utility, where in this case the public good is delivering data connectivity reliably. Extrapolating these trends, equipment suppliers won’t need to invest as much on bandwidth expansion but instead will focus on improving the margins on existing lines of products.
</p><p>
	Some degree of bandwidth expansion for 6G networks will still be necessary. The metaverse example above suggests a range of “ceiling heights” in the maximum Gb/s that users will demand in the years ahead. For most, 1 Gb/s still appears to be more than enough. For those who use high-end applications like future immersive <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/virtual-worlds">virtual worlds</a>, perhaps that ceiling is closer to 5 Gb/s. But concentrating research efforts on 6G deployments that can deliver 10 Gb/s and higher for everyone appears not to be grounded in any currently imaginable consumer technologies.
</p><p>
	To adjust to a potential new reality of operating their <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wireless-networks">wireless networks</a> at closer to utility-like or commodity-like terms, many telecom companies may face a future of restructuring and cost cutting. A useful analogy here are budget <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/airlines">airlines</a>, which thrive because most consumers select their airfare on the basis of cost. Similarly, the way for future telecom companies to win a larger share of the customer base may be increasingly dictated not by technological innovation but by price and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/customer-service">customer service.
</a></p><p>
	To be clear, the need for new telecom research will continue. But with bandwidth expansion deprioritized, other innovations will certainly include cheaper and more efficient or more reliable ways to deliver existing services.
</p><p>
	If consumer demand for ever more mobile data continues to dry up, regulators would no longer need to 
	<a href="https://lightyear.ai/blogs/fcc-spectrum-auctions-explained" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">find new spectrum bands for cellular every few years</a> and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_auction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">conduct auctions</a>. Indeed, the demand for spectrum may abate across most areas. Regulators may also have to consider whether fewer operators may be better for a country, with perhaps only a single underlying fixed and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/mobile-network">mobile network</a> in many places—just as utilities for electricity, water, gas, and the like are often structured around single (or a limited set of) operators.
</p><p>
	Finally, politicians will need to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/rethink">rethink</a> their desire to be at the forefront of metrics such as homes connected by fiber, 5G deployment, or national leadership in 6G. That’s a bit like wanting to be top of the league for the number of Ferraris per capita. Instead, the number of homes with sufficient connectivity and percentage of the country covered by 10 Mb/s mobile may be better metrics to pursue as policy goals.
</p><p>
	Another area of research will surely involve widening coverage in underserved areas and regions of the world—while still keeping costs low with more environmentally friendly solutions. Outside of urban areas, broadband is sometimes slow, with mobile connectivity nonexistent. Even urban areas contain so-called 
	<a href="https://totaltele.com/government-landlords-or-operators-who-is-responsible-for-tackling-the-uks-urban-not-spots/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">not-spots</a>, while <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/blog/2021/11/delivering-consistent-high-performance-indoor-5g-experience" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indoor coverage</a> can be particularly problematic, especially when the building is clad with materials that are near-impenetrable to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/radio-waves">radio waves.
</a></p><p>
	Broadly, there are two main ways for telecoms to shore up the current <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/digital-divide">digital divide</a>. The first is regulatory. Government funding, whether through new regulation and existing grants already on the books, can go to telecom providers in many regions that have been identified for broadband expansion. Indirect sources of funding should not be overlooked either—for instance, to allow operators to retain radio-spectrum license fees and without paying auction fees.
</p><p>
	The second component is technological. Lower-cost rural telecom deployments could include 
	<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/satellite-cellphone-starlink" target="_self">satellite Internet deployments</a>. Better indoor coverage can happen via <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/private-5g-vodafone" target="_self">private 5G networks</a> or through improved access to existing and enhanced <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/wi-fi">Wi-Fi.
</a></p><p>
	The above scenarios represent a major change of direction—from an industry built around innovating a new mobile generation every decade toward an industry focused on delivering lower prices and increased reliability. The coming 6G age might not be what telecom forecasters imagine. Its dawn may not herald a bold summit push toward 10 Gb/s and beyond. Instead, the 6G age could usher in something closer to an adjustment period, with the greatest opportunities for those who best understand how to benefit from the end of the era of rapid bandwidth growth in <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/telecom-history">telecom history</a>.

He had a long, scruffy beard and spoke in a plodding, measured way. His stalling quirk was a long, ponderous ‘well, yes…’. For much of his career, he biked to campus. From his stuffy office on the fifth floor of the Luskin School of Public Affairs at UCLA, he had chosen to make parking the focus of his studies—an impossibly boring topic, even by the low standards of a city planning department.</p><p>Yet by the final accounting, Shoup has a strong claim on being the scholar who will have had the greatest impact on your day-to-day life, radically changing how we approach the unglamorous problem of how and where we park our cars—and, in turn, where we can live, how we move about, and the form our cities take.</p><p><span>Inspired by his work, San Francisco formally adopted demand-based pricing for curb parking in 2017. That same year, Hartford and Buffalo abolished minimum off-street parking requirements citywide. In 2022, California abolished them within a half-mile of transit statewide; around the same time, New Zealand abolished them nationwide. With religious zeal, an </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAnpy9BhAkEiwA-P8N4qY59-S8EHnWZJpXtajYkCofJDpiWqIDSLlG0x1rjC3SoaXdRQxa4hoCXXgQAvD_BwE" rel="">army</a><span> of self-identified </span><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/70015940360/" rel="">shoupistas</a></em><span> has gone on to implement his ideas in thousands of cities across dozens of countries—and this is likely only the beginning.</span></p><p>The old professor resisted attempts to hitch his ideas to any particular creed—except Georgism, that school so preoccupied with how we price land. Parking reform is neither conservative nor progressive, neither libertarian nor socialist. (It’s all of these things, Shoup certainly would have argued.) He definitely wouldn’t have identified as a Marxist. And yet, he fully realized that old exhortation from Marx that ‘philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it.’</p><p>In a world full of professors with fine enough ideas, what made Shoup different?</p><p><span>The premise of </span><em>The High Cost of Free Parking</em><span>, Shoup’s 800-page </span><em>magnum opus</em><span>, is as simple as it is provocative: parking is nearly always too cheap.</span></p><p><span>An unfortunate fact about cars is that they occupy a lot of space. Worse yet, they only spend about five percent of their lifespan in motion. The remaining 95 percent of the time, we must find a place to put them. When Americans first started buying cars </span><em>en masse</em><span> in the early twentieth century, the solution seemed obvious: park them along the curb. In the most radical shift in city planning in human history, urban streets—once the site of gathering, selling, and playing—were redesigned around moving and storing cars.</span></p><p>The result was a classic ‘tragedy of the commons’ situation: When a good is unpriced, we naturally overconsume it. In pure economics terms, the demand for a good at a price of zero nearly always exceeds the supply, resulting in scarcity. Hence, the ‘tragedy.’ In the case of curb parking, unpriced curbs rapidly fill up with cars whose drivers have no incentive to free up space. Thus, the state of a typical residential street: a travel lane or two framed by two parking lanes lined with cars that rarely move.</p><p><span>All of this ‘free’ curb parking is hardly free. Rather, the typical driver must instead spend time cruising around, looking for parking. One </span><a href="http://shoup.bol.ucla.edu/CruisingForParkingAccess.pdf" rel="">survey</a><span> of the literature suggests that drivers in the typical American city spend an average of eight minutes looking for parking at the end of each trip. If a driver makes seven trips like this a week, she will waste nearly 49 hours each year merely looking for parking. If she values her time at the median US hourly wage, these delays will cost $1,898.75.</span></p><p><span>The hidden costs of ‘free’ curb parking only start there. The same surveys suggest that around a </span><em>third</em><span> of all drivers in the typical American city are actively cruising for parking. The share is likely even higher in dense residential neighborhoods like South Philadelphia or Boston’s Back Bay. If we could flip a switch and reduce traffic by 30 percent—with all the attendant costs to air quality, street safety, honking, wasted time, and street damage—we would almost certainly do it.</span></p><p>As the token economist in UCLA’s planning department, Shoup recognized the solution: price the commons. If you set a high enough price, at least one spot will always be available. Nobody will have any incentive to waste their time cruising. Better yet, if prices can fluctuate in response to demand, drivers will be incentivized to adjust their trips efficiently. Those with options could instead take the bus, minimize driving at peak times, or park a little further away and walk the rest of the way. Thus, the demand and supply would naturally equilibrate.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png" width="1267" height="1127" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1127,&quot;width&quot;:1267,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feb16a056-f336-48a5-91f4-69dbd7f74b8e_1267x1127.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><span>From Carl C. Magee’s 1935 patent for a coin-operated parking meter. (Source: </span><a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2118318A/en" rel="">Google Patents</a><span>)</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In fits and starts, cities have tried to price curb parking. In 1935, Oklahoma City installed a newfangled device called the ‘Park-O-Meter’ at the behest of downtown merchants with a financial interest in parking turnover. Absent pricing, commuters would fill up the spots each morning, boxing out shoppers. Yet properly priced curb parking remains the exception. The vast majority of curb parking remains ‘free.’ In New York City, where every square inch of land is enormously valuable, </span><a href="http://park-o-meter/" rel="">97 percent</a><span> of curb parking is unpriced.</span></p><p><span>Why? In the </span><em>Seinfeld</em><span> episode aptly named ‘The Parking Space,’ George balks at Elaine’s suggestion that he pull into a paid garage rather than waste time cruising. ‘It's like going to a prostitute. Why should I pay when, if I apply myself, maybe I can get it for free?’ To the extent </span><em>homo sapien</em><span> falls short of </span><em>homo economicus</em><span>, the politics of pricing curb parking are bleak. We struggle to make sense of the time value of money and hate paying for something we had thought of as free—even if doing so would improve our lives. (Not to imply that you should pay for sex.)</span></p><p><span>Instead, American city planners turned to minimum off-street parking requirements, ‘solving’ the parking problem by mandating that</span><em> </em><span>vast amounts</span><em> </em><span>of it be built as part of any new residential or commercial development. In 1923, Columbus, Ohio, became the first city to require that any new apartment building provide each unit with at least one off-street parking space. Over the next century, such mandates rapidly spread worldwide, becoming a mainstay of modern land-use planning.</span></p><p><span>Today, residential developers are nearly always required to supply one parking space per housing unit. Commercial developers must build anywhere from 2.5 to 10 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet (93 square meters) of office or retail space. These rules are frequently </span><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4z3061mk" rel="">amusing</a><span> in a byzantine way: In one city, gyms must provide one parking space for every 2,500 gallons of water in a pool, as if deeper pools invite more patrons. In another city, nunneries must provide one parking space for every 10 nuns. What happened to church vans?</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png" width="1456" height="618" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:618,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae17e1ba-c28d-40c6-b672-af7fcf9d154e_1600x679.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><span>A sample of Houston’s minimum off-street parking requirements.

If you submitted such work as part of an introductory statistics course, the professor would likely ask you to come to his office hours. And yet it became official policy in cities the world over.</span></p><p>Nor are minimum parking requirements even needed: developers have the knowledge and incentives to provide the appropriate amount of off-street parking. If a developer builds too little parking, she will struggle to attract tenants and command lower rents. If she builds too much parking, she will find she cannot compete with other developers on cost. In contexts where no minimum requirements exist, but parking is still needed, developers virtually always provide it. For all their faults, markets have a way of solving issues like this.</p><p><span>The practical effect of these requirements is to force the construction of far more off-street parking than could ever conceivably be necessary. As the Strong Towners have long </span><a href="https://www.strongtowns.org/blackfridayparking" rel="">documented</a><span>, suburban shopping mall parking lots are so cartoonishly overbuilt as a result of minimum off-street parking requirements, that they usually sit empty even on Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year.</span></p><p>Minimum parking requirements might seem innocuous. But it’s hard to overstate the deleterious effect they’ve had on the form of our cities. In neighborhoods built before the car, they made a wave of demolitions legally necessary. Today, over a third of the typical American downtown is now taken up by surface parking lots—and that’s before considering parking garages. In the suburbs, built out consistent with these rules, the result is a landscape of garden apartments, strip malls, and office parks surrounded by acres of parking lots that are virtually never full.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png" width="1456" height="884" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:884,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3636605c-3a62-4642-b6fe-12483585439b_1600x971.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em><span>In Lexington, Kentucky—a typical example—approximately 38 percent of downtown is covered by surface parking. Happily, the city scrapped minimum off-street parking requirements citywide in 2022. (Source: </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/resources/parking-lot-map/" rel="">Parking Reform Network</a><span>)</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Of course, none of this off-street parking is ‘free’ either. All of this parking takes up space and increases development costs. In the worst case—as with the adaptive reuse of historic buildings or the construction of infill housing—it may make development altogether infeasible. In the best case, it merely makes development more expensive. Estimates </span><a href="https://la.streetsblog.org/2014/10/17/new-ca-database-shows-how-much-parking-costs-and-how-little-its-used" rel="">vary</a><span>, but each additional parking space adds as much as $20,000, $50,000, or $80,000 to the cost of a project, based on whether it involves a surface lot, above-ground garage, or below-ground garage, respectively.</span></p><p>These costs don’t magically disappear. Instead, they translate into higher prices. You might think that Whole Foods parking spot was free, but you can be sure you’re paying for it in more expensive groceries. The impact of minimum parking requirements on housing affordability has earned them the special ire of YIMBYs, who would like to see higher rates of construction and lower prices.</p><p>To understand why, imagine a 675 square foot (63 square meter) two-bedroom apartment—hardly glamorous, but the sort of accessible housing many cities need to get costs under control. In much of the US, a developer could profitably bring this unit to market for under $300,000. But if the city imposes a parking requirement of two spaces per unit or one space per bedroom, it could increase the cost of the unit by as much as a third, requiring future residents to consume as much parking space as they do living space. Many families might happily make that tradeoff. But the thing about a requirement is that you don’t have a choice.</p><p><span>Indeed, the most pernicious thing about these requirements is that they write automobile dependence into law. Perhaps most people like living amid vast parking lots and towering parking garages, spending thousands of dollars each year to shuttle themselves by car. Perhaps nobody wants a smaller, more affordable apartment in a neighborhood where they can safely walk to a storefront café or barbershop, or hop on a subway downtown. Less sophisticated observers insist that everything that exists is merely what consumers </span><em>prefer</em><span>. But in a world without choices, who is to say?</span></p><p>At this point, the typical policy essay would end: In my infinite wisdom, I have shown yet another way in which the world is bad. But I’m sorry to say that the politics of this suboptimal equilibrium are solid. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy for planners to keep curb parking ‘free,’ no matter the harm, while mandating the construction of endless ‘free’ off-street parking that will quietly increase costs in every other aspect of life. Oh, well.</p><p><span>But that’s not where our story ends. In 2005, Donald Shoup published </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Cost-Free-Parking-Updated/dp/193236496X" rel="">The High Cost of Free Parking</a></em><span>. As an academic treatise, it’s a profoundly weird text: the obligatory scholarly patter about what we </span><em>still don’t know</em><span> is absent. The wonky theory, supply-demand curves, and tables of figures are all there, but they’re punctuated by jokes, media snippets, personal anecdotes, and more than a few peculiar allegorical digressions. Taken collectively, it’s the closest a city planning textbook will ever come to </span><em>House of Leaves</em><span>.</span></p><p>It is also strikingly practical. Shoup empathized with the plight of the typical planner: Yes, we know that minimum off-street parking requirements cause all sorts of problems. But if we don’t impose them, we’ll need to price curb parking to avoid a tragedy of the commons situation—and pricing curb parking is beyond the pale.</p><p>His solution to this political problem would end up being his greatest contribution: parking benefits districts. If you take curb parking revenue and invest it in conspicuous local improvements, such as street trees, repaved sidewalks, or regular street sweeping, locals will not only support pricing curb parking—they will often demand it. Once a parking benefits district is established, the politics of pricing curb parking will be secure, and planners can remove minimum off-street parking requirements without fear of backlash.</p><p>As Shoup would readily admit, the idea wasn’t handed down from heaven—though Pasadena comes close. In 1993, the city started installing parking meters in what was then a rundown downtown. Customers, merchants, and landlords balked. As a compromise, city leaders agreed to allocate a share of the revenue to local improvements. Streets were repaved, palm trees replanted, graffiti removed, and sidewalks regularly power-washed. Thirty years later, Old Pasadena is one of the poshest shopping districts in North America.</p><p><span>The release of </span><em>The High Cost of Free Parking </em><span>in 2005 immediately generated buzz among practicing city planners. By then, Shoup had spent decades training generations of planning practitioners and scholars—including </span><a href="https://www.lewis.ucla.edu/research/its-time-to-end-single-family-zoning/" rel="">Michael Manville</a><span>, the current chair of the UCLA planning department—turning parking studies into a lively discipline. In its official </span><a href="https://www.planning.org/timeline/" rel="">timeline</a><span>, the American Planning Association recognizes the book’s publication as one of the seven most important things to happen in planning over the past 25 years.</span></p><p><span>Shortly after its publication, </span><a href="https://siegman.biz/" rel="">Patrick Siegman</a><span>, a planning consultant and early Shoup acolyte, went on a rant about parking at Zeitgeist, a popular bicyclist bar in San Francisco. His conversation partner, local bicycling advocate Dave Snyder </span><a href="https://streetsblog.libsyn.com/replay-the-first-shoupista" rel="">interjected</a><span>: ‘Oh, you’re just a </span><em>shoupista</em><span>.’ The name stuck. A movement had been born. At the depths of the Great Recession in 2008—planners no doubt finding themselves with a lot of free time—a group of </span><em>shoupistas</em><span> started a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/70015940360/" rel="">Facebook Group</a><span> to take turns ranting at each other about parking.</span></p><p><span>Across California, planners wasted no time rebuilding parking policy along </span><em>shoupista </em><span>lines.</span><em> </em><span>In 2005, Redwood City overhauled its downtown parking management with the goal of ensuring that at least one or two spaces were always available on each block, eliminating cruising and improving walkability. Closer to home, Ventura started pricing curb parking in 2010, directing part of the revenue into free public WiFi. In Los Angeles, LA Express Park brought sanity to downtown parking in 2012. It was a revolution from above.</span></p><p>In retrospect, these were just a trial run for what would be the most thoroughgoing implementation of Shoup’s ideas: SFPark. Program director Jay Primus’ goal was not merely to install parking meters in a few busy areas. Rather, the goal was to take the program citywide, with prices fluctuating based on demand using sensor-based monitoring. Prices would then be communicated via an app, allowing drivers to make tradeoffs in real time.</p><p>The result was a rare win for San Francisco governance: We know from pilot areas that implementing demand-based pricing reduced congestion and parking citations while speeding up transit and increasing overall sales tax revenue. The program is now widely regarded as a model for parking management.</p><p><span>Alongside these California developments, the revolution was being </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0739456X221141317" rel="">exported</a><span>, with </span><em>shoupistas</em><span> guiding the creation of parking benefits districts in cities like Bangalore, Beijing, and Mexico City.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/caead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcaead43d-4412-45eb-a41b-2a1e489dd9b5_1024x768.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>A </em><span>shoupista</span><em> Valentine’s Day card.

My sincere apologies for cutting out Anchorage, which did so in 2022. (Source: </span><a href="https://parkingreform.org/resources/mandates-map/" rel="">Parking Reform Network</a><span>)</span></em></figcaption></figure></div><p>In 2005, ideas like implementing dynamic curb pricing or abolishing minimum off-street parking requirements were unthinkable. A mere twenty years later, they now seem inevitable.</p><p><span>Academia is overflowing with hard-working professors with clever ideas that go nowhere. Yet Donald Shoup, perhaps the most unlikely candidate, somehow managed to kick off an international movement and usher in a wave of policy reform. What gives? In my capacity as the teaching assistant for his legendary ‘Parking and the City’ course at UCLA these past four years, I spent a lot of time puzzling over this question. Every quarter I helped teach the course, we had to expand</span><em> </em><span>the capacity to let in students desperate to take it. I have come to at least three conclusions.</span></p><p><span>First, Shoup picked a topic that was simultaneously important, tractable, and neglected. If you ever had more than a 30-minute conversation with him, you no doubt heard the following </span><em>shoupism</em><span>: ‘I’m a bottom feeder. But there’s a lot of food down here.’ The way we manage parking is of profound importance to nearly every aspect of our lives. It’s also something local planners have a lot of control over. And yet, before Shoup took up the issue, there was virtually no scholarship on parking—and even less in the way of activism around the issue. We could use a Donald Shoup on many more issues.</span></p><p><span>The addicting thing about </span><em>shoupism</em><span> is that, once you’re on board, you start to see parking everywhere: A story in the newspaper about two drivers getting in a fight over parking? Well, the parking must have been underpriced. (Henry Grabar starts his excellent </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paved-Paradise-Parking-Explains-World-ebook/dp/B0B9657N8R?crid=WX6CWUYNQ9O1&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.NMGoF--EHvwqkI4jnnTDimMBv7rxjxn-vjI0yB20-casBXi6MBQ5rnxu7admCuO3.vB4jYDonGpO6S2akcpZLI1ep0vaKMviCKvbL47OjOt8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=henry+grabar+-+paved+paradise&amp;qid=1739161537&amp;sprefix=henry+grabar%2Caps%2C151&amp;sr=8-1" rel="">book</a><span> on parking by inviting the reader to try to make sense of such a seemingly senseless story.) Finding yourself depressed by yet another town gutted by parking? That’s the minimum off-street parking requirements for you. You know you’ve fully come around when you start taking strange pleasure in paying for parking.</span></p><p><span>Second, Shoup exercised unparalleled message discipline. He </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Donald-Shoup-2/publication/235359735_Problems_with_Parking_Requirements_in_Zoning_Ordinances/links/00b7d53c67e54d6780000000/Problems-with-Parking-Requirements-in-Zoning-Ordinances.pdf?origin=journalDetail&amp;_tp=eyJwYWdlIjoiam91cm5hbERldGFpbCJ9" rel="">published</a><span> his first paper on the topic in 1978 and spent the next half-century writing on little else. Aware of the responsibility of his celebrity, Shoup studiously avoided taking a position on almost any other issue. When protesters and counter-protesters flooded UCLA’s campus in response to the Israel-Palestine conflict, I asked for his take. ‘I’m just wondering where they all parked,’ he replied.</span></p><p><span>Indeed, Shoup worked hard to make his ideas palatable across the political spectrum. Are you a conservative? People should pay for the services they consume. Are you a progressive? All this unnecessary driving can’t be good for the environment. Are you a libertarian? Clearly, the solution to scarcity is prices and markets. Are you a socialist? Let’s stop privatizing the public realm by turning it into a free parking lot. As a result, the typical </span><em>shoupista</em><span> gathering is an oasis of peaceful coexistence.</span></p><p>Finally, Shoup built up the next generation. He not only trained many young planning practitioners and scholars—he often bent over backward to help them start their careers. Shoup eagerly responded to emails from planners in even the most unremarkable small towns and often helped young scholars to co-author some of their first research on parking. In his seminars, students were encouraged to publish their work via op-eds or academic papers. Regularly, I hear from former students telling me it changed the course of their careers.</p><p><span>Nor did Shoup shy away from activism: When the aforementioned California </span><a href="https://cayimby.org/legislation/ab-2097/" rel="">bill</a><span> was in trouble, he sprung into action, calling everyone in Sacramento who would listen. (The bill’s author, </span><a href="https://x.com/LauraFriedmanCA/status/1888282324116389944" rel="">Laura Friedman</a><span>, is now one of at least a dozen </span><a href="https://lede-admin.usa.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/46/2021/11/ilhan-omar-with-shoup-book.jpg?w=1420&amp;quality=75" rel="">self-identified</a><span> </span><em>shoupistas</em><span> in Congress.) In the last quarter Shoup taught, he had students pestering UCLA administrators with memos </span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/california-vehicular-homelessness-car-dwelling-los-angeles/674901/" rel="">explaining</a><span> why they should designate safe parking sites for homeless students. When Los Angeles seemed poised to end a pandemic-era order allowing outdoor dining on parking lots, he worked with former students to make the </span><a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/1p53w0bx" rel="">case</a><span> against a crackdown.</span></p><p>If you were ever trying to visit Shoup on campus, you probably didn’t need to look up his office number. His was the room with the door covered with newspaper comics about parking—and the source of periodic laughter. When my book on zoning was about to come out, Shoup counseled: when you work on a superficially boring topic, you have to start by making it funny. One of Shoup’s favorite ways to open a talk was by noting that ‘in an audience this large, some of you were probably conceived in a parked car.’</p><p>Perhaps being able to laugh at a problem is the first step toward fixing it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/the-prophet-of-parking?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

  <em>A PostgreSQL assistant for developers<br>
      designed to help understand and optimize PostgreSQL database performance.</em>
  <br>
</p>
<p dir="auto">PgAssistant is an open-source tool designed to help developers understand and optimize their PostgreSQL database performance. It provides insights into database behavior, identifies schema-related issues, and assists in correcting them. Additionally, PgAssistant makes it easy to manage a library of specific SQL queries useful for your project through a simple JSON file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Database Behavior Analysis</strong>: Understand how your PostgreSQL database is performing with detailed analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Schema Optimization</strong>: Identify and correct <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/issues.png">issues</a> related to your database schema.</li>
<li><strong>Query Library Management</strong>: Easily manage a library of specific SQL queries using a <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/myqueries.png">JSON file</a>.</li>
<li><strong>User-Friendly Interface</strong>: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.</li>
<li><strong>Lint SQL Code</strong>: Pgassistant is using Python <strong>Sqlfluff</strong> to lint your SQL code</li>
<li><strong>OpenAI helper</strong>: If you have an OpenAI account, the interface can query OpenAI to help you understand your query plan and optimize your SQL queries</li>
<li><strong>Local LLM helper</strong>: If you run a local LLM like <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/llama.png"><strong>ollama</strong></a>, you can use it also with pgAssistant</li>
<li><strong>LLM helper</strong>: If you use a different LLM than OpenAI or ollama, PgAssistant will help you correctly formulate a query to prompt your preferred <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/prompt.png">LLM engine</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Get DDL</strong>: get DDL of Top <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/ddl.png">queries</a> - pgAssistant is using <strong>pg_dump</strong> to achieve this.</li>
<li><strong>PGTune</strong>: <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/pgtune.png">PGTune</a> is on board. Connected to your DB, pgAssistant can help your ALTER SYSTEM parameters !</li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: based on pgTune recommandations, pgAssistant can help you writing a <a href="https://github.com/nexsol-technologies/pgassistant/blob/main/media/pgtune-docker.png">docker-compose</a></li>

<p dir="auto">pgAssistant needs the <strong>pg_stat_statements</strong> postgresql module to run.</p>
<p dir="auto">To activate this module on your database is very simple. Below, you will find an example of how to activate it if you are in a Docker environment, as well as the PostgreSQL documentation.</p>

          <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"string"</span>
        <span>}</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span></code></pre><p>It seemed the Google-wide block user functionality was based on an obfuscated Gaia ID as well as a display name for that blocked user. The obfuscated Gaia ID is just a Google account identifier.<br>‎</p>
<p>That seemed perfectly fine until I remembered <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6388749#zippy=%2Cuse-youtube-to-block-an-account">this support page</a>:<br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/use_youtube_to_block.png"></p>
<p>‎</p>
<p>So, if you block someone on YouTube, you can leak their Google account identifier? I tested it out. I went to a random livestream, blocked a user and sure enough, it showed up in <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist">https://myaccount.google.com/blocklist</a><br>‎</p>
<p><img src="https://brutecat.com/assets/leaking-youtube-emails/blocked_user.png"></p>
<p>The fallback name was set as their channel name <strong>Mega Prime</strong> and the profile ID was their obfuscated Gaia ID <strong>107183641464576740691</strong><br>‎</p>
<p>This was super strange to me because YouTube should never leak the underlying Google account of a YouTube channel. In the past, there's been several bugs to <a href="https://sector035.nl/articles/2022-35">resolve these to an email address</a>, so I was confident there was still a Gaia ID to Email in some old obscure Google product.</p>

              Escalating this to 4 billion YouTube channels

<p>I tried leaking the full request proto via my tool <a href="https://github.com/ddd/googleapi_tools/tree/main/req2proto">req2proto</a>, but there was nothing about disabling the email notification:</p>

              Putting it all together
            </h3><p>We basically have the full attack chain, we just have to put it together.<br>‎</p>
<ol>
<li>Leak the obfuscated Gaia ID of the YouTube channel from the Innertube endpoint <code>/get_item_context_menu</code></li>
<li>Share the Pixel recording with an extremely long name with the target to convert the Gaia ID to an email</li>
<li>Remove the target from the Pixel recording (cleanup)<br>‎</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a POC of the exploit in action:</p>

              Timeline
            </h3><ul>
<li>15/09/24 - Report sent to vendor</li>
<li>16/09/24 - Vendor triaged report</li>
<li>16/09/24 - 🎉 <strong>Nice catch!</strong></li>
<li>03/10/24 - Panel marks it as duplicate of existing-tracked bug, does botched patch of initial YouTube obfuscated Gaia ID disclosure</li>
<li>03/10/24 - Clarified to vendor that they haven't recognized Pixel recorder as vulnerability itself (since obfuscated Gaia IDs are leaked for Google Maps/Play reviewers) and provided vendor a work-around method to once again leak YouTube channel obfuscated Gaia IDs</li>
<li>05/11/24 - <strong>Panel awards $3,133.</strong> Rationale: Exploitation likelihood is medium. Issue qualified as an abuse-related methodology with high impact.</li>
<li>03/12/24 - Product team sent report back to panel for additional reward consideration, coordinates disclosure for 03/02/2025</li>
<li>12/12/24 - <strong>Panel awards an additional $7,500.</strong> Rationale: Exploitation likelihood is high. Issue qualified as an abuse-related methodology with high impact. Applied 1 downgrade from the base amount due to complexity of attack chain required.</li>
<li>29/01/25 - Vendor requests extension for disclosure to 12/02/2025</li>
<li>09/02/25 - Confirm to vendor that both parts of the exploit have been fixed (T+147 days since disclosure)</li>
<li>12/02/25 - Report disclosed</li>

Basic match statistics are available, but accessing moment-by-moment gameplay data is near impossible. This article demonstrates how to create a high-fidelity dataset by reverse engineering the game engine, capturing information such as precise player positions to ability usage timings and damage calculations.</p> <p>Current League of Legends datasets and analytics tools face several limitations:</p> <ul> <li>Granularity: Most available data comes from Riot’s public APIs, which only provide aggregated statistics (total kills, gold earned, etc.) rather than detailed gameplay events</li> <li>Precision: Existing tools that sample game state often miss critical micro-interactions</li> <li>Completeness: Important gameplay elements like exact ability used, hiding in fog, positions data are missing</li> </ul> <p>Because of this third-party developers can only build basic tools and datasets. We haven’t seen announcements with regards to game-playing agents unlike other games where high fidelity data has enabled breakthoughs in reinforcement learning ~ <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-five/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenAI5</a>, <a href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphastar-grandmaster-level-in-starcraft-ii-using-multi-agent-reinforcement-learning/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AlphaStar</a>.</p> <p>I built a tool that can create high fidelity datasets. It directly decrypts and processes the game’s internal replay files, but keeps the game’s native data format. It can capture precise details like ability usage, movement, and state changes at millisecond intervals and can scale efficiently.</p> <p>I’ll walk through the technical challenges involved in reverse engineering League’s proprietary game engine and replay format. These methods can be applied to similar problems in data extraction.</p> <details> <summary>Expand to show sample of data scraped from a game</summary> <div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

However, detailed, fine-grained data remains relatively hard to obtain.</p> <p>Typical data sources provide only limited, high-level information. Despite these limitations, people build basic models use this data to build basic win prediction models <span></span><span><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/neelkudu28/league-of-legends-win-prediction-using-pycaret" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kaggle</a></span> or create user interfaces for gameplay analysis<span></span><span><a href="https://mobalytics.gg/lol?int_source=homepage&amp;int_medium=mainbutton" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Mobalytics</a></span>.</p> <p>The following section provides different ways to fetch data and what datasets exist out there.

</code></pre></div> </details> <p>The Live Client API provides more granular data than the Match API by including timestamps for key events like deaths, turret destructions, and objective kills. However, it still lacks crucial gameplay details such as player positions, ability usage, and combat interactions.</p> <p>Several public datasets are available, with Kaggle being a prominent source. A <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/servietsky/league-of-legends-what-to-do-in-first-10-min#1.-Libraries-for-Fun-" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">popular Kaggle example</a> demonstrates typical data granularity ~ per-game totals (dragon/baron kills, champion kills, wards placed), and per-minute metrics (CS/gold rates).

In the TakeDamagePacket example, when checking if Ezreal is the target, the <code>id</code> field is decrypted, compared, and immediately re-encrypted and deleted.

The packet object maintains encrypted chunk data, only decrypting fields when they’re accessed - as explained in the <a href="#emulator-and-decrypytion-background">emulator and decryption section</a>. Let’s examine how this works in practice by analyzing the TakeDamage function, focusing on two key pieces of information that we want to extract: who is taking damage and how much damage they’ve taken.</p> <details> <summary>Click to expand to view the raw decompiled TakeDamage function</summary> <div><pre><code><span>char</span> <span>__fastcall</span> <span>TakeDamage</span><span>(</span><span>__int64</span> <span>idk</span><span>,</span> <span>__int64</span> <span>packet</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>Tthe second parameter to <code>GetInternalObjectFromID</code> is the id that are the source and target network ids. The functions converts the network ids to the game engine objects by looking through a map of <code>[id -&gt; object pointer]</code>. Then, to apply damage to the target object, there’s a call to obj, using its vtable at offset <code>0x1920</code> to apply damage. The conversion using <code>_mm_cvtsi32_si128</code> just puts the bytes into the <code>xmm0</code> register because the function takes in a float.</p> </details> <p>The code can be boiled down to this</p> <div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>TakeDamage</span><span>(</span><span>__int64</span> <span>idk</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>packet_buffer</span><span>)</span>

It works by inserting a software breakpoint (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INT_(x86_instruction)" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">INT3 instruction on x86 CPUs</a>) and creating an exception handler that lookups the corresponding the function to call that is mapped to the breakpoint.

    <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12800">View PDF</a></p><blockquote>
            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces a new data-structural object that we call the tiny pointer. In many applications, traditional $\log n $-bit pointers can be replaced with $o (\log n )$-bit tiny pointers at the cost of only a constant-factor time overhead. We develop a comprehensive theory of tiny pointers, and give optimal constructions for both fixed-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which all of the tiny pointers must be the same size) and variable-size tiny pointers (i.e., settings in which the average tiny-pointer size must be small, but some tiny pointers can be larger). If a tiny pointer references an element in an array filled to load factor $1 - 1 / k$, then the optimal tiny-pointer size is $\Theta(\log \log \log n + \log k) $ bits in the fixed-size case, and $ \Theta (\log k) $ expected bits in the variable-size case. Our tiny-pointer constructions also require us to revisit several classic problems having to do with balls and bins; these results may be of independent interest.
<br>Using tiny pointers, we revisit five classic data-structure problems: the data-retrieval problem, succinct dynamic binary search trees, space-efficient stable dictionaries, space-efficient dictionaries with variable-size keys, and the internal-memory stash problem. These are all well-studied problems, and in each case tiny pointers allow for us to take a natural space-inefficient solution that uses pointers and make it space-efficient for free.

<p>On Tuesday, Vance told the assembled leaders the US would not relinquish its lead in AI, while also warning countries not to sign AI deals with “authoritarian regimes,” in a thinly veiled jab against China.</p>
<p>“Partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in and seize your information infrastructure,” Vance said, referring to CCTV and 5G as previous examples where “cheap tech... [was] heavily subsidized and exported by authoritarian regimes.”</p>
<p>Among the priorities set out in the joint declaration signed by countries including China, India, and Germany was “reinforcing international co-operation to promote co-ordination in international governance.”</p>
<p>Such language put off the US, which did not agree on the terminology around multilateralism and international collaboration, said an official from one of the countries that signed the document.</p>
<p>The US also had concerns that Current AI, the foundation launched by France during the summit, would be used to funnel money to French-speaking countries, the official said.</p>
<p>Vance’s speech was “a 180-degree turnaround from what we saw with the Biden administration,” said Keegan McBride, a lecturer at the Oxford Internet Institute, who studies the geopolitics of AI.</p>
<p>The narrative around Macron’s summit was about pushing alternatives to the US-led drive to develop AI technologies. Following the launch of powerful open models from DeepSeek, Europeans had felt like they had a fleeting chance to compete in AI, said Frederike Kaltheuner, senior EU and global governance lead at the AI Now Institute, an AI research institute.</p>
<p>“Vance just dumped water all over that. [It] was like, ‘Yeah, that’s cute. But guess what? You know you’re actually not the ones who are making the calls here. It’s us,’” said McBride.</p>

<p>Is it really possible to encode arbitrary data in a single emoji?</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> yes, although I found an approach without ZWJ. In fact, you can encode data in <em>any</em> unicode character.

<h2 id="some-background">Some background</h2>
<p>Unicode represents text as a sequence of <em>codepoints</em>, each of which is basically just a number that the Unicode Consortium has assigned meaning to.
Usually, a specific codepoint is written as <code>U+XXXX</code>, where <code>XXXX</code> is a number represented as uppercase hexadecimal.</p>
<p>For simple latin-alphabet text, there is a one-to-one mapping between Unicode codepoints and characters that appear on-screen. For example,
<code>U+0067</code> represents the character <code>g</code>.</p>
<p>For other writing systems, some on-screen characters may be represented by multiple codepoints. The character की
(in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari">Devanagari script</a>) is represented by a consecutive pairing of the codepoints <code>U+0915</code> and <code>U+0940</code>.</p>
<h2 id="variation-selectors">Variation selectors</h2>
<p>Unicode designates 256 codepoints as “variation selectors”, named VS-1 to VS-256. These have no on-screen representation of their own, but are used to modify
the presentation of the preceeding character.</p>
<p>Most unicode characters do not have variations associated with them. Since unicode is an evolving standard and aims to be future-compatible,
variation selectors are supposed to be preserved during transformations, even if their meaning is not known by the code handling them.
So the codepoint <code>U+0067</code> (“g”) followed by <code>U+FE01</code> (VS-2) renders as a lowercase “g”, exactly the same as <code>U+0067</code> alone. But if you copy and paste it, the
variation selector will tag along with it.</p>
<p>Since 256 is exactly enough variations to represent a single byte, this gives us a way to “hide” one byte of data in any other unicode codepoint.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/">Unicode spec</a> does not specifically say anything about sequences
of multiple variation selectors, except to imply that they should be ignored during rendering.</p>
<p><em>See where I’m going with this?</em></p>
<p>We can concatenate a sequence of variation selectors together to represent any arbitrary byte string.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say we want to encode the data <code>[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]</code>, which represents the text “hello”. We can do this by
converting each byte into a corresponding variation selector, and then concatenating them together.</p>
<p>The variation selectors are broken into two ranges of codepoints: the original set of 16 at
<a href="https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_FE00.html"><code>U+FE00 .. U+FE0F</code></a>, and remaining 240 at <a href="https://unicode.org/charts/nameslist/n_E0100.html"><code>U+E0100 .. U+E01EF</code></a> (ranges inclusive).</p>
<p>To convert from a byte to a variation selector, we can do something like this Rust code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>byte_to_variation_selector</span>(byte: <span>u8</span>) -&gt; <span>char</span> {
    <span>if</span> byte <span>&lt;</span> <span>16</span> {
        char::from_u32(<span>0xFE00</span> <span>+</span> byte <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>).unwrap()
    } <span>else</span> {
        char::from_u32(<span>0xE0100</span> <span>+</span> (byte <span>-</span> <span>16</span>) <span>as</span> <span>u32</span>).unwrap()
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>To encode a series of bytes, we can concatenate a number of these variation selectors after a base character.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>encode</span>(base: <span>char</span>, bytes: <span>&amp;</span>[<span>u8</span>]) -&gt; String {
    <span>let</span> <span>mut</span> result <span>=</span> String::new();
    result.push(base);
    <span>for</span> byte <span>in</span> bytes {
        result.push(byte_to_variation_selector(<span>*</span>byte));
    }
    result
}
</code></pre></div><p>Then to encode the bytes <code>[0x68, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x6f]</code>, we can run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{}"</span>, encode(<span>'😊'</span>, <span>&amp;</span>[<span>0x68</span>, <span>0x65</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6f</span>]));
}
</code></pre></div><p>Which outputs</p>
<pre><code>😊󠅘󠅕󠅜󠅜󠅟
</code></pre><p>It just looks like a regular emoji, but try pasting it into <a href="https://emoji.paulbutler.org/?mode=decode">the decoder</a>.</p>
<p>If we instead use the debug formatter, we see what’s going on:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {
    println<span>!</span>(<span>"{:?}"</span>, encode(<span>'😊'</span>, <span>&amp;</span>[<span>0x68</span>, <span>0x65</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6c</span>, <span>0x6f</span>]));
}
</code></pre></div><p>This prints:</p>
<pre><code>"😊\u{e0158}\u{e0155}\u{e015c}\u{e015c}\u{e015f}"
</code></pre><p>This reveals the characters that were “hidden”&nbsp;in the original output.</p>
<h2 id="decoding">Decoding</h2>
<p>Decoding is similarly straightforward.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>variation_selector_to_byte</span>(variation_selector: <span>char</span>) -&gt; Option<span>&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;</span> {

<h2 id="can-this-be-abused">Can this be abused?</h2>
<p>To be clear, this is an abuse of unicode and you shouldn’t do it. If your mind is wandering to practical use cases for this, shut it down.</p>
<p>That said, I can think of a couple of nefarious ways this could be (ab)used:</p>
<h3 id="1-sneaking-data-past-human-content-filters">1. Sneaking data past human content filters</h3>
<p>Since data encoded this way are invisible once rendered, a human moderator or reviewer will not know they are there.</p>
<h3 id="2-watermarking-text">2. Watermarking text</h3>
<p>There are techniques for using subtle variations in text to “watermark” a message, so that if it is sent to a number of people and then
leaked, it’s possible to trace it to the original recipient. Variation selector sequences are a way to do this that survives most copy/pastes
and allows arbitrary data density. You could go so far as to watermark <em>every single character</em> if you wanted to.</p>

            <pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 08:50:08 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66431436/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone-is-horribly-slow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66431436/pushing-to-github-after-a-shallow-clone-is-horribly-slow</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023283">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>TL;DR: use <code>--depth 2</code>.  Read on for why.</p>
<p>Shallow clones (<em>can</em>, but not necessarily <em>must</em>) defeat an important optimization.  In your case this happens for the first push, but not for subsequent pushes.  Other defeating cases can occur so other pushes might also be slow.</p>
<p>We start with the fact that Git is really all about commits,<sup>1</sup> which are shaped into a Directed Acyclic Graph.  The graph has vertices or nodes—whichever term you prefer—that are numbered, by commit hash IDs.  Relatively immaterial here, but helpful for concreteness, is the fact that the edges / arcs between the nodes are stored as part of the nodes themselves, rather than being kept separately.  Each node stores the hash IDs of its predecessor nodes.</p>
<p>A repository is, at heart, a database of these commit objects.  A complete—non-shallow—repository has the entire graph, from every root to every tip commit.  A <em>single-branch</em> clone potentially drops some part of the graph, but never has any "gaps" in the graph.  For instance, given:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>we can drop either tip and the nodes on that row, but not the nodes and root on the middle row.  In all of these cases, then, we can—as Git always does—start at the tip and work backwards and eventually arrive at the root.</p>
<p>Now, there are two properties of each node that are important here:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <em>number</em> is <em>unique</em>.  It's a universally unique ID.  <em>No</em> node in <em>any</em> other Git repository (that we'll meet anyway) can re-use that ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The <em>data</em> in the node are strictly read-only.  That includes the outgoing edge links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What this means is that if we have a <em>gap-free</em> repository—one that's either totally complete, or at least as complete as required for the tip commits it contains—on each side of a sender-to-receiver operation, we can have the <em>sending</em> repository simply enumerate for us some set of commits, by their numbers.  If we, the receiving repository, lack that commit, we ask the sender to send it and also to tell us the numbers of its parent commit(s).  The sender does that, and we see if we have those commits.  For any that we lack, we ask the sender to send those and also tell us the numbers of their parent commits, and so on.</p>
<p>This means that if <em>we</em> have:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>and <em>they</em> have:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1--new
          /
root--node
</code></pre>
<p>then <em>they</em> will announce to use the hash ID of commit <code>new</code>.  We don't have that one, so they should add it to a pile of commits to send, and announce to us the hash ID of commit <code>tip1</code> as well.  We <em>do</em> have <code>tip1</code> so we just tell them: <em>We already have <code>tip1</code>: you do not need to send it.</em></p>
<p>Here's the optimization: <em>We just told them about <strong>every commit we have</strong> from <code>tip1</code> all the way back to <code>root</code>.</em>  Our <em>no thanks, we have that one</em> offer to their reply to <em>I can send you <code>tip1</code></em> tells them about not just the one commit and its files, but also every predecessor commit and all of <em>their</em> files as well.</p>
<p><strong>They now know that when they send us commit <code>new</code>, they need only send tree and blob ("file") objects that do not appear in predecessor commits.</strong>  Moreover, they can compress these tree and blob objects against tree and blob objects in any <em>previous</em> commit, from <code>tip1</code> all the way back to <code>root</code>.  So the sender can send <em>far</em> less data than would otherwise be required to send the entire commit, with its full snapshot of every file.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tree objects and blob objects are primarily found <em>via</em> commits.  Annotated tag objects add one small wrinkle to the picture, and having an annotated tag that points directly to a tree or blob adds another, but neither defeats the standard optimization.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Compare to when the sender is a shallow repository</h3>
<p>A <em>shallow repository</em> is one in which some commit(s) are marked-up artificially as being root commits.  The commit object actually has the right parent hash IDs, but the Git in which this commit object lives has a file<sup>2</sup> that says: <em>We don't know anything about the parents of commit <code>tip1</code>.  Don't try to look for any: pretend, instead, that <code>tip1</code> is a root commit, with no parents.</em></p>
<p>This means the sending Git, instead of having:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1
          /
root--node
</code></pre>
<p>has just:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1
</code></pre>
<p>In this repository, we add our new commit:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1--new
</code></pre>
<p>and now we have our Git call up their Git and offer it new commits.  First we offer <code>new</code>.  They say <em>I don't have that one, what else can you send?</em>  We would offer <code>slightly-mangled-tip1</code>, but <strong>we can't do that</strong> because when we read it in, we mangle it.  So we say: <em>Sorry, that's all we have for you.</em></p>
<p>They say: <em>Okay then, send us commit <code>new</code>.</em></p>
<p>On our end, then, we look at commit <code>new</code>.  It has a full snapshot of <em>every file</em>.  We don't know if they have <em>any</em> of these files.  So we pack up the entire thing and send <em>all</em> of it.</p>
<p>They receive it all, unpack it, find that we've duplicated 99% of what they already have, ignore the extra copies, and take the new commit and put it in their repository:</p>
<pre><code>           node--node--tip1--new
          /
root--node
          \
           node--node--tip2
</code></pre>
<p>The next time we run <code>git push</code>, we have this:</p>
<pre><code>      slightly-mangled-tip1--new--new2
</code></pre>
<p>We offer them <code>new2</code>; they say <em>I don't have that one, what's its parent</em> and we say <code>new</code> and they say <em>oh I have that one, don't bother sending it</em>.  This time, we see that they have almost every file already, and don't bother sending all those tree and blob objects <em>and</em> can compress any <em>new</em> tree and blob objects based on what's in commit <code>new</code>.  (We still can't use the slightly-manged tip1 commit, nor of course any of the missing previous commits, but just being able to eliminate all unchanged files is huge.)</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>2</sup>Or other mechanism, but currently, it is a file named <code>.git/shallow</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What you can do about this</h3>
<p>Given that you intend to run <code>git push</code>, you'll get a lot of mileage out of having one un-mangled commit "between" the shallow graft point and a branch tip.  So do your <code>git clone</code> with <code>--depth 2</code>.  You'll get a slightly bigger client Git repository, but that first <code>git push</code> will go much faster.</p>
<p>That is, you'll start with:</p>
<pre><code>slightly-mangled-node--tip1
</code></pre>
<p>on the client.  The first <em>new</em> commit will result in:</p>
<pre><code>slightly-mangled-node--tip1--new
</code></pre>
<p>and this time your Git will be able to offer <code>tip1</code> to their Git during the first push, which will trigger the optimization.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/shutdown.asp">https://webb-site.com/articles/shutdown.asp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023141">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



	<p>Unfortunately, there are going to be some more changes around here. Our founder explains why.</p>

<h2>The coming end of Webb-site<br>
<span>12 February 2025</span></h2>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>When I <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/editor200608.asp">disclosed</a> my metastatic prostate cancer in Jun-2020, I didn't 
expect to live as long as I now have - the
<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/prostate-cancer/prostate-cancer-prognosis" target="_blank">
5-year survival</a> (which I am now approaching) is about 30%. However, after exhausting 4 lines of therapy and 
resorting to experimental treatments that are only available overseas, I have now reached the point where outcomes are 
measured in months rather than years and my symptoms and side-effects are making it harder to function. I hope to reach 
60 in August and all I want for my birthday is another one, but before I become more dysfunctional, I need to make plans 
for the orderly conclusion of this pro bono, loss-making work rather than leave managing it as a burden for my family. 
One of the few benefits of knowing that you're dying is being able to plan the end on your own terms.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub">Webb-site Database</a> has grown over the years to include an enormous amount of material. 
Much of it is collected by automated methods - I kept up my coding skills from the 1980s when I wrote books and games 
for the first generation of home computers. But even in the dawning era of artificial intelligence, there are some 
datasets which (so far) can only be accurately maintained by human judgment, for example, carefully parsing corporate 
announcements to determine which individual has been appointed to a board, as many individuals share the same name and 
no ID numbers are disclosed. Similarly, we track the membership of over 800 HK <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/cat.asp?c=3">statutory</a> 
and <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/cat.asp?c=7">advisory</a> bodies - everything from the Executive and Legislative Councils down to 
the Dogs and Cats Classification Board.</p>
<p>So a loyal assistant whom I have employed for 22 years has been maintaining anything that I can't automate. All-in, 
I've spent over HK$10m since 2003 building and operating the database, not counting the considerable opportunity cost of 
my own time. I know that the database has been useful to journalists, regulators, researchers and of course investors, 
as they have often told me so.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since my cancer diagnosis, which came just after HK quarantined its borders for COVID. Since then, 
I deciphered the pseudo-disclosure on who received over HK$90bn of hand-outs under the so-called
<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/esstop.asp">Employment Support Scheme</a>, draining a substantial portion of HK's fiscal reserves. I 
also tracked <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/vax.asp">vaccination rates</a>, <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/hkpax.asp">immigration data</a> and
<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/HKflightscan.asp">airport flight statistics</a>, which we contine to collect. I've also been 
collecting data on <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/jail.asp">HK prisoners</a>, a record 39% of whom (at 30-Sep-2024) are unconvicted 
and on remand - presumed innocent under law. And I've built a complete history of the <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/govac.asp">HKSAR 
Government Accounts</a> from Apr-1998 to Mar-2024, with thousands of line items. Of course, I've also made more time for 
family, and managed to visit numerous places after the borders reopened. The bucket list is still long, but time is 
short. </p>
<p>In 2020, I did explore moving the Webb-site Database to the University of Hong Kong (our oldest university), where a 
fully-staffed "Webb Centre for Public Transparency" could build a much larger database around it, including datasets 
from PhD researchers on social, economic, health and legal matters in the Asia region. The Centre would have been 
apolitical, expressing no opinion other than to advocate accessibility of public data, and would have included 
representation from other HK universities to encourage collaboration. I and other donors would have made substantial 
contributions to the endowment needed to launch it. The relevant faculty heads were all in favour, but in a 
post-National Security Law environment, the detailed proposal was rejected by the university's "Senior Management Team". 
You can draw your own conclusions about why that might be.</p>
<p>In 2024, I <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/paybase.asp">launched</a> a pilot project to crowd-source data collection on HK 
directors' pay from annual reports stretching back to 2005. After an initial flurry of interest, a handful of diligent 
volunteers continue with this work, but it is clear to me that this is not a viable way to expand the data collection 
effort to other datasets that we manually maintain. Even if it were, someone would have to maintain the server and 
software and arbitrate disputes.</p>
<p>So that leaves me out of options and nearly out of time. Accordingly, I plan the following steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>All manual data collection by my assistant on <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/#hkboards">directors</a> and supervisors of HK-listed 
	companies and their <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/roles.asp">advisers</a> (bankers, lawyers, auditors, financial advisors etc) 
	will cease, effective 31-Mar-2025.</li>
	<li>The directors' pay database project will continue for financial year-ends up to 31-Dec-2024 (the Listing Rules 
	deadline for publishing the annual reports is 30-Apr-2025). I ask the volunteers to focus on completing and 
	verifying the dataset from 2005 to 2024. I will then make the full dataset available for download.</li>
	<li>Automated data collection (for example, the <a href="https://webb-site.com/ccass/bigchanges.asp">CCASS Analysis System</a>,
	<a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/SFClicount.asp">SFC licensees</a>, <a href="https://webb-site.com/dbpub/hksolfirms.asp">HK law firms</a>) will 
	continue until the first annual expiry date (31-Oct) for the Webb-site server (in New York State) after my death, 
	but individual datasets may cease earlier if the collection software breaks and I am either dead or too ill to 
	update it.</li>
	<li>When the server shuts down, Webb-site (including all the <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/">editorial content</a> since 
	foundation in 1998) will disappear, but most of our articles can be found in the
	<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250000000000*/Webb-site.com" target="_blank">Internet Archive</a>, which will 
	hopefully keep running for much longer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Webb-site and I have, in my judgment, achieved a lot of what I set out to do when I founded it in 1998, but much remains 
unresolved and new economic problems have arisen in HK since then, particularly arising from excessive central planning, 
intervention and government spending in what was once a very free market economy, but also ongoing protection of vested 
interests which inhibits reforms that would benefit the economy and the people of HK. Much of this is in the <a href="https://webb-site.com/articles/">
subject archive</a>, but I'll try to leave behind some thoughts on this with a few more articles before I check out, 
health permitting.</p>
<p><em>Carpe diem, and Ga Yau!</em></p>

<p>Tesla’s sales have dropped nearly 60% in January in Germany compared to the same period last year. The same thing is happening throughout Europe.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, we reported that <a href="https://electrek.co/2025/02/03/tesla-tsla-sales-are-dropping-like-a-rock-in-europe-but-its-not-just-because-of-elon-musk/">Tesla’s sales crashed throughout all European markets in January</a>.</p>



<p>The two main reasons are believed to be the introduction of the new Model Y and the disapproval of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his meddling in politics, which is especially not appreciated in Europe.</p>



<p>At the time, we didn’t have the number from Germany, but now we do.</p>	
	



<p>Reuters reported that Tesla’s sales were down 59.5% in January:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>German road traffic agency KBA’s website on Wednesday showed the number of newly registered Tesla cars fell 59.5% to 1,277 in January, while the overall German market was down just 2.8% at slightly more than 207,000 vehicles during the month.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is undoubtedly a Tesla problem because the German auto market was down just 2.8% in January, and the battery-electric market was up 53.5% during the period.</p>



<p>These are now Tesla’s sales in Europe in 2025 compared to 2024:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Country</th><th>Jan-25</th><th>Jan-24</th><th>% YoY</th></tr><tr><td><strong>Germany</strong></td><td>1,277</td><td>3,150</td><td>-59.5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>UK</strong></td><td>1,293</td><td>1,581</td><td>-18.2%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>France</strong></td><td>1,141</td><td>3,118</td><td>-63.4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Netherlands</strong></td><td>926</td><td>1,610</td><td>-42.5%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Norway</strong></td><td>663</td><td>1,109</td><td>-40.2%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Spain</strong></td><td>269</td><td>1,094</td><td>-75.4%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sweden</strong></td><td>394</td><td>730</td><td>-46.0%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Denmark</strong></td><td>451</td><td>763</td><td>-40.9%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Portugal</strong></td><td>380</td><td>551</td><td>-31.0%</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>6,794</strong></td><td><strong>13,706</strong></td><td><strong>-50.4%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>This is pretty nuts. Obviously, Tesla will use the Model Y transition as an excuse, and there’s some truth to it. However, Tesla was transitioning the Model 3 around the same time last year, which also negatively affected 2024 sales.</p>




	<p>Now, it’s true that Model Y is more impactful than Model 3, but I think it’s also clear that the Musk effect is at play too, it’s just impossible to tell by how much.</p>



<p>But I do think it will be quite disastrous, especially considering the Model Y refresh is not significant enough to convince people who are on the fence.</p>



<p>It feels like the negative sentiment toward Tesla is still gaining momentum rather than slowing down.</p>



<p>That’s not good for the EV industry. At least they have more options in Europe. It will hit even harder if we start seeing a similar impact on Tesla in the US.</p>

                                        <p>BEIJING (AP) — Zhang Yazhou was sitting in the passenger seat of her Tesla Model 3 when she said she heard her father’s panicked voice: The brakes don’t work! Approaching a red light, her father swerved around two cars before plowing into an SUV and a sedan and crashing into a large concrete barrier.</p><p>Stunned, Zhang gazed at the deflating airbag in front of her. She could never have imagined what was to come: <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-tesla-investigations-doge-crashes-f0c49a8fdf900d72eac541e4f699c5ac">Tesla</a></span> sued her for defamation for complaining publicly about the car’s brakes — and won. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize to the $1.1 trillion company.</p><p>Zhang is not the only one to find herself in the crosshairs of Tesla, which is led by Elon Musk, among the richest men in the world and a self-described “ <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1499976967105433600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free speech absolutist</a></span>.” Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures. </p><p>The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press. Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments, including Zhang’s, are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.</p>
    

<p>It is not common practice for automakers — in China or elsewhere — to sue their customers. But Tesla has pioneered an aggressive legal strategy and leveraged the patronage of powerful leaders in China’s ruling Communist Party to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.</p>
    
    
    
<p>The AP review of Tesla’s record in China comes as Musk is wielding significant influence in President Donald Trump’s new administration, leading an effort to rapidly shrink the size of the federal government and oust employees deemed disloyal to the president. His actions have raised <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-trump-tesla-investigations-doge-crashes-f0c49a8fdf900d72eac541e4f699c5ac">concerns that Musk is weakening the U.S. system of checks and balances, in part, to benefit Tesla</a></span> and his other companies. </p><p>In the United States, Musk has found a powerful ally in Trump. Together, they have ransacked the federal government, freezing spending, suspending programs and dismissing prosecutors, government watchdogs and others that have traditionally acted as guardrails.</p><p>Tesla officials in China and the United States did not reply to requests for comment.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Tesla’s record in China shows how Musk has thrived in a system in which regulators, the media and the courts — which must all ultimately answer to the ruling Communist Party — are, by design, somewhat intertwined.</p><p>Tesla has profited from the largesse of the Chinese state, winning unprecedented regulatory benefits, below-market rate loans and large tax breaks. With a few pointed exceptions, Tesla has enjoyed largely ingratiating coverage in the Chinese press, and journalists told AP they have been instructed to avoid negative coverage of the automaker. </p><p>Tesla’s windfall has extended to the courts — and not just in legal actions Tesla has brought against customers. In a review of public court documents, AP found that Tesla won nearly 90% of civil cases over safety, quality or contract disputes brought by customers.</p><p>“The government gave Tesla a super status that put consumers in a very vulnerable position,” said Qiao Yudong, a former lawyer for American sports car company Saleen Automotive in China. “That’s why some consumers had to resort to extreme actions.”</p><p>One of those desperate customers was Zhang.</p><h2>Burning with anger</h2><p>The February 2021 crash in central China’s Henan province sent Zhang’s mother and father, who had a concussion, to the hospital for four days, medical records show. Zhang — who was unharmed in the accident, as was her baby niece — wanted to understand what had happened: How could her dream car have turned into such a nightmare?</p><div data-align-center="">

Zhang, however, insisted that the brakes had malfunctioned, sending the car out of control. She filed a complaint with a local market regulator, requesting a refund and compensation. Teslas are among the most computerized cars on the market, so Zhang asked the automaker to turn over the full pre-crash data from her car, hoping it might help explain what went wrong. Tesla refused.</p><p>“Tesla’s employees were very arrogant and tough in dealing with my complaints,” Zhang said in an interview. “I was burning with anger.”</p>
    

<p>After weeks of stewing, she draped her damaged car with a banner proclaiming “Tesla brake failure” in front of the Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, some 200 km (124 miles) from her home. She sat on the Tesla’s roof and blared her protest through a bullhorn: “Tesla Model 3 brakes failed,” she said. “A family of four almost died.” The next month, she parked her damaged car outside an auto show in Zhengzhou. It was all to no avail — Tesla refused to turn over the full data and mediation went nowhere.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>Some observers speculated that Zhang’s protest had been orchestrated -- perhaps by a competitor or by the Chinese government itself to pressure Tesla to conform with Chinese regulations. Tesla alleged that Zhang hadn’t acted on her own. A top executive speculated to Chinese media that she “had someone behind her” and said Zhang was making a fuss because she just wanted higher compensation.</p><p>Zhang insisted she acted on her own — and out of anguish. Outraged, she sued Tesla for defamation, arguing that the executive’s comments unjustly cast her as a troublemaker to deflect attention from the company’s own shortcomings. </p><p>And then she found herself on the receiving end of a lawsuit filed by Tesla.</p>
    

<h2>The odds are against you</h2><p>Tesla said Zhang had deliberately spread false information that damaged the brand and asked for 5 million yuan ($684,000) in damages.</p><p>The case, which a court took up in October 2021, came as Tesla faced a barrage of criticism in China.</p><p>Dozens of Tesla owners had been publicly complaining about alleged brake failures, battery fires, unintended acceleration and other defects, as well as what they claimed were misleading sales practices. The same month as Zhang’s crash, Chinese regulators summoned Tesla to respond to quality concerns raised by such reports.</p><p>Zhang’s emotional protest sparked a rare burst of criticism of Tesla in Chinese media. Under pressure from regulators, Tesla finally released the data from her car, which the company said showed her father had been driving nearly 120 km per hour (75 mph) and that the brakes had functioned to reduce the magnitude of the collision.</p><p>Tesla had finally given Zhang what she’d been asking for, but they’d published the data publicly and included her vehicle identification number. She said she and her family started getting threatened and doxed online. Besides, she wondered, how could she be sure Tesla hadn’t modified or redacted the data from her car? It was less than the victory she’d hoped for. Feeling besieged, she sued Tesla a second time, in March 2022, for invading her privacy.</p><p>Zhang lost both cases she brought against Tesla.</p><p>Meanwhile, the defamation case against her was grinding along. Back in court as a defendant, Zhang was unable to prove that the brakes on her Tesla had indeed failed. In a closed trial, a Shanghai court ruled in May 2024 that Zhang’s public complaints went beyond what magistrates considered reasonable, factual criticism and ordered her to publicly apologize and pay 170,000 RMB ($23,000) to cover damages and the legal costs of the world’s most valuable car company.</p><p>Zhang appealed the ruling. She maintains that her lawsuit is a cry for transparency and accountability and that a company as rich and powerful as Tesla should be able to tolerate legitimate criticism from its customers.</p><p>“I refuse to accept it,” Zhang told the Associated Press, “As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.”</p><p>Her odds of winning the appeal against Tesla do not look good. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it’s also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.</p><p>An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgements in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.</p><p>In a statement to AP, the Shanghai High People’s Court said that judgments are the result of a “fair trial” based on “the objective facts of the case.” </p><p>“It cannot be assumed that the party has received ‘special protection’ or ‘special treatment’ because of their victory,” the court wrote.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

                </div><p>While some auto industry experts in China say it’s generally difficult for customers to win cases against car companies, others say it’s remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.</p><p>“For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,” said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd., an advisory firm based in Shanghai, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. “The odds are stacked against you. It’s like going to the casino and winning every hand.”</p>
    

<h2>The power of patronage</h2><p>Tesla’s commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China’s premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping. It was under his watch, in 2019, that Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China’s financial capital.</p><div data-align-center="">

China also adopted an emissions credit scheme modeled after a U.S. program that has generated billions in income for Tesla.</p><p>In January 2020, one year after breaking ground, Elon Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. Tesla turned an <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-67705113fb4f895bd051a1bee1d23518">annual profit for the first time in its history</a></span> that year, and Musk was declared the world’s richest person in January 2021.</p><p>China got what it wanted, too: Tesla was a potent catalyst for domestic production and consumption. Before Tesla’s arrival, new energy vehicles accounted for around five percent of China’s auto market. Today, analysts say, more than half of passenger vehicles sold retail in China are powered by an electric motor. Chinese battery maker CATL, a key Tesla supplier, has embedded itself in global supply chains to become the world’s largest EV-battery maker. China’s BYD is now the world’s largest electric vehicle manufacturer and a growing competitive threat to legacy carmakers in the West.</p><p>“Tesla had a large part to play in that,” said Tu Le, the managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a consulting firm. Tu said the way the government smoothed the way for Musk’s factory was critical. “It was a swampy field on the outskirts of Shanghai. A year later they’re rolling cars off the line,” he said. “I don’t know if that happens anywhere else in the world.”</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>Requests for comment to the State Council, which is run by Li Qiang and oversees China’s government ministries, went unanswered.</p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/china-tesla-elon-musk-c3777d00c183bc88408407e30bb75b1f">Musk still swings by to meet Li</a></span> when he goes to China. Their encounters underscore the complexity of Musk’s overlapping interests as a businessman and the most China-friendly member of Trump’s inner circle.</p><p>Musk’s “greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,” said Russo, the auto strategist in Shanghai. “He’s done a good job of it in China and he’s done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.”</p><h2>A chilling effect</h2><p>Safety advocates worry about the implications of Musk’s proximity to power in the United States. Federal investigations and safety initiatives Musk has long railed against could be easily snuffed out by the new administration.</p><p>In the U.S., Tesla also has been subject to a raft of customer safety complaints and lawsuits over autopilot function, battery charging, alleged suspension defects, sudden braking or acceleration, faulty airbags and allegedly monopolistic practices on repairs and parts. Judges have dismissed some cases. In others, Tesla settled out of court or paid hefty settlements.</p><p>Tesla has not publicly sued any of its U.S. customers for speaking out, though in January, Musk said on X that “maybe it is time” to sue media outlets for coverage that could stain Tesla’s brand. His post has been viewed more than 22 million times.</p><p>Tesla has already successfully done that in China.</p><p>Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.</p><p>“We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,” a tech reporter told AP.</p>
    

<p>Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk’s company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. It was unhappy about PingWest’s report that claimed Tesla’s Shanghai factory was a “sweatshop.” The news website ifeng.com drew Tesla’s ire over a story that explored the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla. PingWest had to apologize and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com.</p><p>Tesla is not the only company in its industry to sue its critics. BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.</p><p>Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors — in going after car owners who suffered crashes.</p><p>“Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,” said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,200) after he wrote about Tesla’s alleged brake failures. He has appealed the verdict. “Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.”</p><p>Chen Junyi got the message. He lost control of his Model 3 and plowed into a dozen cars in a parking lot at high speed in August 2020. He claimed the brakes had failed. He told Chinese media at the time that he broke his back and four ribs and had to have 30 centimeters (12 inches) of his small intestine removed. Chen took to social media and warned people not to buy Tesla, raising his shirt to reveal the long, gnarled scar that runs up his abdomen.</p><p>Tesla maintained the accident was Chen’s fault, citing a technical review that found the car was accelerating and not braking in the seconds before the crash, and sued him for making false claims.</p><p>“Tesla should proactively respond to consumers instead of using its superior resources and filing lawsuits against consumers who are at a disadvantage,” Chen said in a court statement reviewed by AP. “I almost lost my life because of the car accident. I lost my job and income. I am under tremendous economic pressure.”</p><hr><div data-align-center="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>The flap of a butterfly’s wings on one continent, so the story goes, can cause a tornado a year later in another. Here’s my story of how something like that can happen on the web too.</p><h2 id="im-on-a-boat">I’m on a boat</h2><p>First, the back story. Last year, after a wonderful ten years at Facebook (and then Meta), I left my position as Engineering Director, and, with my wife Jayne, moved onboard our sailing boat, <a href="https://scoutsailing.com/">Scout</a>. We quickly got accustomed to a life of going wherever or whenever the weather wanted to take us.</p><p>But there’s a lot of downtime on a boat. Me? I’ve been using this opportunity to grow and maintain an open source project called <a href="https://tinybase.org/">TinyBase</a>, a way to store structured data in a browser and react to its changes.</p><p>As I got TinyBase going last year, there were two tweets that really got my attention. The first was from Cory House who drew attention to “<a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1492203985335373825">a new collaborative software architecture</a>” (and as follow up gave the project a well-needed and generous <a href="https://twitter.com/housecor/status/1492859757941637126">shout out</a>!). The second was from Geoffrey Litt, who, with colleagues, published <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1499083601387864069">an excellent essay</a> about running relational, reactive databases on the client.</p><p>Both referred to the phrase “Local-First”, and I wanted to know more. Over a decade ago, I’d been swept up in the “<a href="https://www.lukew.com/resources/mobile_first.asp">Mobile-First</a>” movement, and this second “First” sounded just as intriguing - especially given my new maritime circumstances.</p><h2 id="but-what-is-this-local-first-you-speak-of">But what is this Local-First you speak of?</h2><p>You see, connectivity is generally good on a boat - wifi, cell coverage, and satellite options abound - so we survive. But when it isn’t good, it <em>really</em> isn’t good. And then suddenly, it dawns on you just how much of your life is beholden to the cloud. Your documents don’t load. Your photos don’t sync. Your messages don’t send. Without necessarily consciously realizing it, we have all moved most of our online existence to <a href="https://www.chriswatterston.com/article/success-of-my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker">other people’s computers</a>!</p><p>Now, of course, there are many advantages to this shift: collaboration, backups, multi-device access, and so on. But it’s a trade! In exchange, we’ve lost the ability to work offline, user experience and performance, and indeed true dominion over our own data.</p><p>I was fascinated by this shift, but also surprised by how much we all - both users and developers - have taken this for granted. It’s almost heretical to build a web-based application that <em>doesn’t</em> have the cloud as the source of truth for data, and the client as merely a dumb display of a cached copy of it. I wondered why.</p><p>As I disappeared down this rabbit-hole, I quickly stumbled on the canonical essay on the topic, “<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">Local-first software: you own your data, in spite of the cloud</a>”, by research lab Ink &amp; Switch. In summary, they identify seven principles for local-first applications:</p><ul><li>No spinners: your work at your fingertips</li><li>Your work is not trapped on one device\</li><li>The network is optional</li><li>Seamless collaboration with your colleagues</li><li>Your work should continue to be accessible indefinitely</li><li>Security and privacy by default</li><li>You retain ultimate ownership and control</li></ul><p>Now we’re talking!</p><p>But I was equally surprised by how little this was being discussed, or (as far as I could tell) practiced in the real world. While there seemed to be endless threads on Twitter about server-side React (to get the UI generation closer to the data), no-one was talking about the opposite: moving the <em>data</em> to be closer to the UI, and onto the client!</p><p>Nevertheless, I realized that TinyBase could theoretically fit nicely into this picture: a way to have a structured store of data on the client side (with a close-by binding to the user interface), and took the slightly cheeky opportunity to update the project’s strap line: “The reactive data store for local-first apps”.</p><p>Still, I wasn’t exactly sure that people knew what “local-first” meant. What could I do about that?</p><h2 id="a-butterfly-flaps-the-creation-of-localfirstwebdev">A butterfly flaps: the creation of localfirstweb.dev</h2><p>In a previous life, I had worked with some excellent developer relations teams, and if there’s one thing I remembered from then, it was that one of the ingredients of raising awareness around a topic is to have a good landing page. And it didn’t seem like such a thing existed for local-first.</p><p>The Ink &amp; Switch article was a great start, but as I explored, I came across many projects from people trying to build the scaffolding for a local-first future - databases, synchronization techniques, best practices. But they were scattered around and I could see a lot of value in curating a list of the activity that was happening in this space.</p><p>So, one free day on the boat, I rolled up my sleeves, dusted down some old Jekyll skills, and got started. I didn’t really have much more of a plan than to take my ‘local first’ browser bookmark folder and put all the items onto the page: basically a web directory just like it was 1994!</p><p>A few hours later, I had the skeleton of <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">localfirstweb.dev</a> up and running - my first .dev domain too! - and published with GitHub Pages. Add in a quick <a href="https://twitter.com/jamespearce/status/1623773053447729152">launch tweet</a>, some mentions to some of the projects on the page, and it was done. I didn’t really expect to hear much more.</p><p>Time passed. But not very much!</p><p>Well of course, the likes started coming. And then the retweets. And then the pull requests. Within <em>literally</em> an hour, I could see the site getting traction. And, rather humbly, it was extremely surprising. After all, it was just a list of links! But apparently the concept struck a chord, and perhaps a lot of latent interest in the idea suddenly had a focus.</p><h2 id="enter-yonatan">Enter Yonatan</h2><p>Evidently that interest was quickly going to outgrow my static web page. And as if to make sure I got that point, I got a message from Yonatan (<a href="https://twitter.com/founderYonz">@founderYonz</a>), a Harvard Business School graduate who started using TinyBase after discovering my <a href="https://tripleodeon.com/2022/11/closing-the-gap-between-your-users-and-their-data">local-first talk</a> @JavaScriptCon. The two of us had been chatting about creating a local-first world. He spotted that it needed to become more of a human community with people buying into the movement - especially if the goal was to raise awareness of the local-first architecture across the industry as a whole.</p><p>And within a day, he leapt to action, and set up a <a href="https://discord.gg/lfwdev">Discord server</a> with the new logo, added a link to it from the top of the site, and was busy welcoming and introducing all the new members as they joined. He had people building apps, people building frameworks, people who just wanted to hang out and chat about CRDTs and the like. The start of a community!</p><p>Yonatan’s energy was infectious, and within just days, the ideas started flowing. What about swag? What about a newsletter? What about a conference? We agreed that the first step would be giving people a chance to get together, at least online, and the first meetup was scheduled for February 28th.</p><p>The first meetup, held in February, exceeded everyone’s expectations. Honored to be joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/pvh">Peter van Hardenberg</a> from Ink &amp; Switch - ‘the father of local-first’ - and other speakers, the community heard kick-off keynotes, deep dives into sync technologies, and a lengthy and rich Q&amp;A session.</p><p>Since that first meetup, there have been three further blockbuster meetups, five paper reading group sessions and ~700 members building, discussing and sharing their passion for local-first. (In a follow on post, Yonatan will dig into the work behind the LoFi community!)</p><p>But here’s my chance to say something very important. It doesn’t take on that life of its own <em>on its own</em>. While my personal involvement has stayed lightweight, the lion’s share of the community curation and leadership has been squarely on Yonatan’s shoulders. While on one hand I am surprised at how quickly things have grown, on the other, I shouldn’t be, knowing that it’s in his safe and motivated hands. In case I don’t say it enough, I want to recognize how awesome he has been in driving #lfw.dev forward.</p><h2 id="onwards-and-upwards">Onwards and upwards</h2><p>Local-first as a movement still seems to be young. The principles are solid, the enthusiasm is strong, and examples of it in use are appearing.</p><p>But there is a long way to go! There are still not as many local-first apps in production as you might think, perhaps because they are still a little harder to build - and the infrastructure to make that task easier is still being built out.</p><p>But the demand is clearly there, both for applications that meet these ideals, and certainly for this community of builders who want to make this happen. These are people who are willing to question some of the assumptions of the current status quo of web development, and who want to help shape a future of something a little different.</p><p>And as for me? I’m proud of the fact that I built a web page that catalyzed hundreds of people to come together to work on a shared vision. But it was just a web page! And really the credit for where this community is today rests squarely with other giants upon whose shoulders I merely wrote some HTML - and to Yonatan in particular who has shown ceaseless energy and commitment in getting things going.</p><p>Again, I’m reminded of Lorenz’s assertion about butterflies and tornados when I think back on this series of extraordinary events from the last few months. A web page flapped its wings, and, as others took the initiative and ran with it, the resulting community tornado was a wonder to watch. Here’s to a local-first future!</p><p>–</p><p>Want to know more and get involved? What better time to get involved than our next meetup? We’ll see you there!</p><p><a href="https://discord.gg/cVYugNvT?event=1102927548079423518" target="_blank"><img src="https://localfirstweb.dev/assets/images/meetup4.png"> </a></p></article></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021515">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Introduction</h2><a id="user-content-introduction" aria-label="Permalink: Introduction" href="#introduction"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is a powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control" rel="nofollow">version control system</a>
for software projects. You use it to get a copy of your code, track changes
to the code, and finally publish those changes for others to see and use.
It is designed from the ground up to be easy to use—whether you're new or
experienced, working on brand new projects alone, or large scale software
projects with large histories and teams.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is unlike most other systems, because internally it abstracts the user
interface and version control algorithms from the <em>storage systems</em> used to
serve your content. This allows it to serve as a VCS with many possible physical
backends, that may have their own data or networking models—like <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" rel="nofollow">Mercurial</a> or
<a href="https://www.breezy-vcs.org/" rel="nofollow">Breezy</a>, or hybrid systems like Google's cloud-based design, <a href="https://youtu.be/W71BTkUbdqE?t=645" rel="nofollow">Piper/CitC</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, we use Git repositories as a storage layer to serve and track content,
making it <strong>compatible with many of your favorite Git-based tools, right now!</strong>
All core developers use Jujutsu to develop Jujutsu, right here on GitHub. But it
should hopefully work with your favorite Git forges, too.</p>
<p dir="auto">We combine many distinct design choices and concepts from other version control
systems into a single tool. Some of those sources of inspiration include:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Git</strong>: We make an effort to <a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/jj-vcs/jj/discussions/49/hovercard">be fast</a>—with a snappy UX, efficient
algorithms, correct data structures, and good-old-fashioned attention to
detail. The default storage backend uses Git repositories for "physical
storage", for wide interoperability and ease of onboarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Mercurial &amp; Sapling</strong>: There are many Mercurial-inspired features, such as
the <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/revsets/" rel="nofollow">revset</a> language to select commits. There is <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-comparison/#the-index" rel="nofollow">no explicit index</a>
or staging area. Branches are "anonymous" like Mercurial, so you don't need
to make up a name for each small change. Primitives for rewriting history are
powerful and simple. Formatting output is done with a robust template language
that can be configured by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Darcs</strong>: Jujutsu keeps track of conflicts as <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/conflicts/" rel="nofollow">first-class
objects</a> in its model; they are first-class in the same way commits
are, while alternatives like Git simply think of conflicts as textual diffs.
While not as rigorous as systems like Darcs (which is based on a formalized
theory of patches, as opposed to snapshots), the effect is that many forms of
conflict resolution can be performed and propagated automatically.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">And it adds several innovative, useful features of its own:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Working-copy-as-a-commit</strong>: Changes to files are <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/working-copy/" rel="nofollow">recorded automatically</a>
as normal commits, and amended on every subsequent change. This "snapshot"
design simplifies the user-facing data model (commits are the only visible
object), simplifies internal algorithms, and completely subsumes features like
Git's stashes or the index/staging-area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Operation log &amp; undo</strong>: Jujutsu records every operation that is performed on the
repository, from commits, to pulls, to pushes. This makes debugging problems like
"what just happened?" or "how did I end up here?" easier, <em>especially</em> when
you're helping your coworker answer those questions about their repository!
And because everything is recorded, you can undo that mistake you just made
with ease. Version control has finally entered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo#History" rel="nofollow">the 1960s</a>!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Automatic rebase and conflict resolution</strong>: When you modify a commit, every
descendent is automatically rebased on top of the freshly-modified one. This
makes "patch-based" workflows a breeze. If you resolve a conflict in a commit,
the <em>resolution</em> of that conflict is also propagated through descendants as
well. In effect, this is a completely transparent version of <code>git rebase --update-refs</code> combined with <code>git rerere</code>, supported by design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Warning</p><p dir="auto">The following features are available for use, but experimental; they may have
bugs, backwards incompatible storage changes, and user-interface changes!</p>
</div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Safe, concurrent replication</strong>: Have you ever wanted to store your version
controlled repositories inside a Dropbox folder? Or continuously backup
repositories to S3? No? Well, now you can!</p>
<p dir="auto">The fundamental problem with using filesystems like Dropbox and backup tools
like <code>rsync</code> on your typical Git/Mercurial repositories is that they rely
on <em>local filesystem operations</em> being atomic, serialized, and non-concurrent
with respect to other reads and writes—which is <em>not</em> true when operating on
distributed file systems, or when operations like concurrent file copies (for
backup) happen while lock files are being held.</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is instead designed to be <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/technical/concurrency/" rel="nofollow">safe under concurrent scenarios</a>;
simply using rsync or Dropbox and then using that resulting repository
should never result in a repository in a <em>corrupt state</em>. The worst that
<em>should</em> happen is that it will expose conflicts between the local and remote
state, leaving you to resolve them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The command-line tool is called <code>jj</code> for now because it's easy to type and easy
to replace (rare in English). The project is called "Jujutsu" because it matches
"jj".</p>
<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is relatively young, with lots of work to still be done. If you have any

<p dir="auto">Jujutsu is designed so that the underlying data and storage model is abstract.
Today, it features two <a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#backend" rel="nofollow">backends</a>—one of them uses a Git repository for storage,
while the other is a native storage backend<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-native-backend-cc1951e102a1d6fc899c5083849f5937" id="user-content-fnref-native-backend-cc1951e102a1d6fc899c5083849f5937" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. The Git backend
uses the <a href="https://libgit2.org/" rel="nofollow">libgit2</a> C library and the
<a href="https://github.com/Byron/gitoxide">gitoxide</a> Rust library.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Git backend is fully featured and maintained, and allows you to use Jujutsu
with any Git remote. The commits you create will look like regular Git commits.
You can fetch branches from a regular Git remote and push branches to the
remote. You can always switch back to Git.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is how you can explore a GitHub repository with <code>jj</code>.</p>

files..."), and there is no need for <code>git stash</code>. Also, because the working copy
is a commit, commands work the same way on the working-copy commit as on any
other commit, so you can set the commit message before you're done with the
changes.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/working_copy.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/working_copy.png"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">With Jujutsu, the working copy plays a smaller role than with Git. Commands
snapshot the working copy before they start, then they update the repo, and then
the working copy is updated (if the working-copy commit was modified). Almost
all commands (even checkout!) operate on the commits in the repo, leaving the
common functionality of snapshotting and updating of the working copy to
centralized code. For example, <code>jj restore</code> (similar to <code>git restore</code>) can
restore from any commit and into any commit, and <code>jj describe</code> can set the
commit message of any commit (defaults to the working-copy commit).</p>

<p dir="auto">All operations you perform in the repo are recorded, along with a snapshot of
the repo state after the operation. This means that you can easily revert to an
earlier repo state, or to simply undo a particular operation (which does not
necessarily have to be the most recent operation).</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/blob/main/demos/operation_log.png"><img src="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/raw/main/demos/operation_log.png"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">If an operation results in
<a href="https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/glossary#conflict" rel="nofollow">conflicts</a>,
information about those conflicts will be recorded in the commit(s). The
operation will succeed. You can then resolve the conflicts later. One
consequence of this design is that there's no need to continue interrupted
operations. Instead, you get a single workflow for resolving conflicts,
regardless of which command caused them. This design also lets Jujutsu rebase
merge commits correctly (unlike both Git and Mercurial).</p>
<p dir="auto">Basic conflict resolution:</p>

<p dir="auto">Juggling conflicts:</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Automatic rebase</h3><a id="user-content-automatic-rebase" aria-label="Permalink: Automatic rebase" href="#automatic-rebase"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Whenever you modify a commit, any descendants of the old commit will be rebased
onto the new commit. Thanks to the conflict design described above, that can be
done even if there are conflicts. Bookmarks pointing to rebased commits will be
updated. So will the working copy if it points to a rebased commit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comprehensive support for rewriting history</h3><a id="user-content-comprehensive-support-for-rewriting-history" aria-label="Permalink: Comprehensive support for rewriting history" href="#comprehensive-support-for-rewriting-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Besides the usual rebase command, there's <code>jj describe</code> for editing the
description (commit message) of an arbitrary commit. There's also <code>jj diffedit</code>,
which lets you edit the changes in a commit without checking it out. To split
a commit into two, use <code>jj split</code>. You can even move part of the changes in a
commit to any other commit using <code>jj squash -i --from X --into Y</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2><a id="user-content-status" aria-label="Permalink: Status" href="#status"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The tool is fairly feature-complete, but some important features like support
for Git submodules are not yet completed. There
are also several performance bugs. It's likely that workflows and setups
different from what the core developers use are not well supported, e.g. there
is no native support for email-based workflows.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today, all core developers use <code>jj</code> to work on <code>jj</code>. I (Martin von Zweigbergk)
have almost exclusively used <code>jj</code> to develop the project itself since early
January 2021. I haven't had to re-clone from source (I don't think I've even had
to restore from backup).</p>
<p dir="auto">There <em>will</em> be changes to workflows and backward-incompatible changes to the
on-disk formats before version 1.0.0. Even the binary's name may change (i.e.
away from <code>jj</code>). For any format changes, we'll try to implement transparent
upgrades (as we've done with recent changes), or provide upgrade commands or
scripts if requested.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://lithub.com/resist-authoritarianism-by-refusing-to-obey-in-advance/">https://lithub.com/resist-authoritarianism-by-refusing-to-obey-in-advance/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43021333">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							        
									<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>Do not obey in advance.</strong></p>
<p><em>Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked. A citizen who adapts in this way is teaching power what it can do.</em></p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Anticipatory obedience is a political tragedy. Perhaps rulers did not initially know that citizens were willing to compromise this value or that principle. Perhaps a new regime did not at first have the direct means of influencing citizens one way or another. After the German elections of 1932, which permitted Adolf Hitler to form a government, or the Czechoslovak elections of 1946, where communists were victorious, the next crucial step was anticipatory obedience. Because enough people in both cases voluntarily extended their services to the new leaders, Nazis and communists alike realized that they could move quickly toward a full regime change. The first heedless acts of conformity could not then be reversed.</p>
<p>In early 1938, Adolf Hitler, by then securely in power in Germany, was threatening to annex neighboring Austria. After the Austrian chancellor conceded, it was the Austrians’ anticipatory obedience that decided the fate of Austrian Jews. Local Austrian Nazis captured Jews and forced them to scrub the streets to remove symbols of independent Austria. Crucially, people who were not Nazis looked on with interest and amusement. Nazis who had kept lists of Jewish property stole what they could. Crucially, others who were not Nazis joined in the theft. As the political theorist Hannah Arendt remembered, “when German troops invaded the country and Gentile neighbors started riots at Jewish homes, Austrian Jews began to commit suicide.”</p>
<p>The anticipatory obedience of Austrians in March 1938 taught the high Nazi leadership what was possible. It was in Vienna that August that Adolf Eichmann established the Central Office for Jewish Emigration. In November 1938, following the Austrian example of March, German Nazis organized the national pogrom known as <em>Kristallnacht.</em></p>
<p>In 1941, when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, the SS took the initiative to devise the methods of mass killing without orders to do so. They&nbsp; guessed&nbsp; what their superiors wanted and demonstrated what was possible. It was far more than Hitler had thought.</p>
<p>At the very beginning, anticipatory obedience means adapting instinctively, without reflecting, to a new situation. Do only Germans do such things? The Yale psychologist Stanley Milgram, contemplating Nazi atrocities, wanted to show that there was a particular authoritarian personality that explained why Germans behaved as they had. He devised an experiment to test the proposition, but failed to get permission to carry it out in Germany. So he undertook it instead in a Yale University building in 1961—at around the same time that Adolf Eichmann was being tried in Jerusalem for his part in the Nazi Holocaust of the Jews.</p>
<p>Milgram told his subjects (some Yale students, some New Haven residents) that they would be applying an electrical shock to other participants in an experiment about learning. In fact, the people attached to the wires on the other side of a window were in on the scheme with Milgram, and only pretended to be shocked. As the subjects (thought they) shocked the (people they thought were) participants in a learning experiment, they saw a horrible sight. People whom they did not know, and against whom they had no grievance, seemed to be suffering greatly—pounding the glass and complaining of heart pain. Even so, most subjects followed Milgram’s instructions and continued to apply (what they thought were) ever greater shocks until the victims appeared to die. Even those who did not proceed all the way to the (apparent) killing of their fellow human beings left without inquiring about the health of the other participants.</p>
<p>Milgram grasped that people are remarkably receptive to new rules in a new setting. They are surprisingly willing to harm and&nbsp; kill others&nbsp; in the service of some new purpose if they are so instructed by a new authority. “I found so much obedience,” Milgram remembered, “that I hardly saw the need for taking the experiment to Germany.”</p>

Cells in my husband Jake’s body divided, killing him. Cells in my body divided, giving our daughter Athena life.</span></p><p>I didn’t survive.</p><p>The “I” that I used to be—someone who didn’t know what it was like to watch the man she loved dismantled ruthlessly by cancer—died with Jake on August 8th. What was left of her died in childbirth.</p><p><span>Grief and Motherhood have changed the structure of my brain.

I’m forgetful. Anxious. There’s a new sense of paralysis. When Jake was alive, I felt capable. I monitored clinical trials, kept up to date on head and neck cancer research, and oversaw his medical care. I wrote and podcasted. I managed IVF, pregnancy, and bursts of full-time work. </span></p><p><span>My mind and body were fueled by adrenaline and cortisol; there was so little time to do and say everything we wanted. While </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/21/i-know-what-happens-to-me-after-i-die-but-what-about-those-left-behind/" rel="">nothing remained unsaid between us</a><span>, there’s so much that remains unfinished. In a letter Jake left for me to read when I went into labor with Athena, he wrote:</span></p><p><em>“Now the future is here, and, if I were next to you, I’d be absurdly excited. But you’re the person who has to make the future actually happen.”</em></p><p>Making it happen feels Sisyphean. The simplest tasks, which barely required a second thought when Jake was alive now feel insurmountable, if I can even remember what it was I meant to complete. I’m becoming an unlikely Zen master. Grief demands my brain sit in the pain of right now.</p><p><span>The assault on my hippocampus has continued in new motherhood. Surging hormones triggered further pruning of my grey matter, sharpening the areas responsible for emotion and theory of mind</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-2-156832468" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>. It makes biological sense. Being able to better imagine the perspective of a tiny, nonverbal (though loudly screaming) human being will improve my bond with my infant daughter.</span></p><p>These simultaneous, structural changes caused by death and birth augment each another in upsetting ways. A porousness now exists between my feelings towards Athena and Jake. I’m unable to remember if I’ve checked on Athena, or checked on her thoroughly enough, peeking to watch the soft rise and fall of her ribs throughout the night, the way I used to compulsively check on Jake to make sure he was still breathing. In the silent calm of breastfeeding my mind wanders to Jake’s last hours, sliding into vivid, waking dreams of what he might have been thinking and feeling.</p><p><strong>Friends have told me that they’re relieved I seem “like myself”</strong><span> even after everything that’s happened. I don’t understand how that’s possible when I frequently don’t feel like I have a self to be. Jake and I became so entangled in these last few years that it still seems like many of my thoughts belong to both of us. And in a way, they do. The Default Mode Network, a part of the brain largely responsible for self-perception, has expanded its connections in response to birth and death, destroying the illusion of individuality to include Jake and Athena in my sense of “I." </span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-3-156832468" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p><span>Even my body is a chimera.

It’s a comfort to think parts of Athena, parts that also carry Jake’s genetic code, might be forever held inside me. These cells are often found coalescing in areas of pain and hurt. These cells —their cells—must be everywhere.</span></p><p>I don’t feel like myself because I’m not only myself. I’m Jake. I’m Athena.</p><p><span>I’m also a new widow, a new mother. I’m only just starting to understand what it means to be those things as I develop my relationships within those identities. Jake wrote that </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/10/16/how-do-you-say-goodbye/" rel="">we live for other people</a><span>, but we also know ourselves in relation to them. Heidegger philosophized that we develop our sense of self along with “others,” or those from whom one cannot distinguish themselves.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-5-156832468" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Walt Whitman put it more succinctly: “I am large, I contain multitudes.”</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-156832468" href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive#footnote-6-156832468" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span><span> </span></p><p>There is no “I” in relation to nothing else or no one else, except as a description of death. Who I become will be largely dependent on who I become it with.</p><p><strong>Grief and Motherhood have also transformed me in visible ways.</strong></p><p>In photos taken during the last months of Jake’s life, I look like I’m clenching my entire body to keep everything from falling apart. I’m braced for impact. There’s an intensity to my face as I look at Jake as if I’m willing him to live using the power of my mind; it was a face that still believed he might.</p><p>Pregnancy was a more obvious transmutation. A revolution of flesh. The skin on my chest browned, as did a thin strip of skin from my belly button to my pubis. My gums bled. Everything grew—my breasts, my hips, my hair, my feet—as the internal upheaval I felt was progressively presented to the world. </p><p>Athena asserted the duality of my body by furiously thrashing. The placenta, an organ we grew together and shared, had implanted on the posterior wall of my uterus, so it was easy to see her hands, feet and knees as they punched and kicked outwards.</p><p>My belly, a shockingly hard swell of muscle, matched the tension I held in my face. By the ninth month, the skin on my abdomen felt so tight I thought I might split like an overripe peach.</p><p><strong>Now, I’ve been emptied. Jake is dead. Athena’s been born.</strong><span> All those unfilled spaces within me are on display. There’s a softness, a slack, not only to my belly, but to my entire body. My jaw has unclenched, letting my lips part in a subtle “o” of shock. The area under my eyes has hollowed; my gaze is unfocused, dazed from sleep deprivation and frank confusion at what my life has become.</span></p><p>In a culture obsessed with snapping back there’s little warning that the body is a fragile garment, an easily overstretched sweater that never returns to its original shape. I’ve unraveled.</p><p>When I look in the mirror now, I notice all the places where my body reveals what I’ve been through. And I wonder, in a way that I wouldn’t if Jake were still alive, how this new body appears to others who don’t view it through a lens of love.</p><p><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/08/23/seeing-as-a-doctor-seeing-as-a-wife/" rel="">I’ve written:</a></p><blockquote><p><span>No one will ever see me the way Jake can, again. When Jake looks at me, he sees me at 25, showing up to our first date in a grey mini-dress, black boots and red lipstick. He sees me at 29 in a striped bra and panty set in our 35th story Seattle hotel room, pressing me against the cold glass. And he also sees me as I am now. I’m all these ages at once, as he is to me. Love isn’t blind only to ugliness, but to decay. Look at two 80-year-olds gazing at each other like teenagers and you’ll know what I mean. When I lose Jake, I’ll lose someone ever seeing me throughout all my ages again. I’ve said that </span><a href="https://jakeseliger.com/2023/07/24/what-its-like-to-be-married-to-a-dying-man/" rel="">parts of me will die with him</a><span>, and mean more than the parts of my heart and the parts of my personality that act in relation to his. I mean entire eras of my life, all the views he was privy to, and therefore, much of my youth, goes as well. No one—even if I find love again one day, as Jake has urged me to do—will ever look at me and see me at 32, skinny dipping on a trip to Gunnison nude beach in New Jersey with a group of friends, laughing at how cold the water is under the sun of a hot summer day.</span></p></blockquote><p>Jake used to tickle the hair at the nape of my neck and whisper teasingly that he’d found new grey hairs. If I acted self-consciously, he’d tell me,“You look beautiful,” and I’d believe him. Before chemo took his hair, I’d let Jake’s dark curls wrap around my finger and count each of his greys like tiny victories. He was beautiful, too.</p><p>I used to feel like we were getting older together. Now I just feel like I'm getting old. I hadn't realized how different those two feelings are.</p><p>Imperfections that Jake loved about me, or would love about me if he were alive to see them, seem like liabilities now. I’m awkward, unsure how to display myself to the world. There’s a pubertal quality to grief and motherhood in midlife. Even calling it midlife, which suggests continuity, feels wrong. This is a new life. A new mind. A new body.</p><p><strong>Forty was a year of want: </strong><span>I wanted Jake to live. I wanted to keep feeling his body beside me in bed at night. I wanted to help him build a meaningful future even as life as we knew it fell apart. I wanted him to meet our daughter. I wanted to watch him rock her when she cried. I wanted to keep writing with Jake. I wanted to finish our book together. I wanted to read with him on the couch every afternoon and go on walks through the neighborhood at night. I wanted (and thought we almost had) a miracle cure. I wanted to successfully manage his medical care. I wanted him to start breathing again, for his heart to start beating again. I wanted him to walk through the front door again. I wanted him to hold my hand when my contractions started. I wanted him to tell me I was beautiful the first time I held our daughter in my arms. I wanted miracles.</span></p><p>I didn’t get miracles.</p><p>Today I turn forty-one.</p><p><span>My heart still beats with </span><em>I want, I want, I want</em><span>. Only now I don’t know what I want.</span></p><p>But my heart still beats.</p><p>The average life expectancy of a woman in the United States is 77.32 years old. My grandmother lived to be 98. I might have 40, 50, or even 60 years to fill depending on improvements in medical technology. Fifty years is a lot of time. It’s also no time at all.</p><p><strong>Last night, at midnight, I texted Jake's phone</strong><span>, which I haven’t been able to bring myself to disconnect.</span></p><p><em>“How is this our life?”</em></p><p>It isn’t our life. Not anymore. Now it’s my life, whatever that’s going to mean.</p><p>I promised Jake I’d build that new life. And yet, the woman who made that promise is gone. She couldn’t have foreseen life now: that I’d cry inconsolably in the pasta aisle of a Sprouts grocery store because I forgot the brand of anchovy paste Jake used when cooking my favorite beef stew; that I’d feel a shocking nova of love each morning when my daughter’s little face smiles at me. </p><p>Time keeps dragging me forward, whether I can see ahead or not. And in the darkest hours, of which there are many, I try to remind myself that I didn’t know what happiness looked like before I had it the first time, either.</p><p><em><span>If you’ve gotten this far, </span><a href="https://gofund.me/2495a9b2" rel="">consider the Go Fund Me</a><span> that is supporting our daughter Athena’s care and future. </span></em></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://bessstillman.substack.com/p/the-year-i-didnt-survive?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic" width="1456" height="1051" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1051,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:535567,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/heic&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F614dcf80-c554-4c11-b699-df0497b4b436_2284x1649.heic 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>

        <section>
            <p>In the year 2030, no one will remember Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="portability">Portability</h2><p>Containers solved a lot of important problems in software development. We had VMs before containers, but they were not as ergonomic to use. The experience of containers was, by comparison, a true delight. Fast(er) builds, near-instant startup, no virtualization, etc.</p><p>Now we're in an era where containers are annoying to work with. The promise of DevOps has been eroded by complicated tooling and tight coupling of program-container-linux. In my experience, developers want to write code and ship features to hit their quarterly goals. Learning how to use Docker is a distraction. No one has a goal to "improve Docker build times" unless you're part of the new PlatformOps (formerly DevOps (formerly Ops)) team.</p><p>My money is on WebAssembly (WASM) to replace containers. It already has in some places. WebAssembly is a true write-once-run-anywhere experience. (Anywhere that can spin up a V8 engine, which is a lot of places these days.) You can compile several languages into WebAssembly already. <a href="https://github.com/RustPython/RustPython">Languages</a> that can't be compiled will eventually have their own interpreters compiled to WebAssembly. The main thing holding back wider adoption is a lack of system interfaces. File access, networking, etc. But it's just a matter of time before these features get integrated.</p><p>A very obvious argument against WASM succeeding is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It's almost exactly the same promise: write once, run anywhere. After all, over 3 billion devices run Java. There are many languages that run on the JVM: Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure, Jython, etc. The biggest limitation is that JVM bytecode cannot run in a web browser (RIP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet">Java Applets</a>). Web browsers are a crucial target for app development. Anyone that wants to share code between platforms will avoid the JVM. There is an interesting, slow-moving trend away from the JVM and towards statically compiled binaries. See: GraalVM, Kotlin Native, Scala Native, Jank.</p><h2 id="microservices">Microservices</h2><p>In a microservice architecture, you communicate with other services through HTTP or RPC calls, or using a message broker. This decoupling has important tradeoffs. The success of the model suggests most companies find the benefits outweigh the costs. Importantly, it creates strict boundaries between parts of your system. Conway's Law, etc. You don't <em>need</em> network boundaries to create good encapsulation, but it sure helps when you have a lot of developers.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest downside is the cost associated with having many small services communicating over a network. Not only do you pay for the bandwidth and resource overhead, but you have to engineer solutions to improve the reliability of each system in the face of network partitions.</p><p>With the advent of "serverless" platforms like AWS Lambda, you can take microservices to the extreme: just deploy single functions in the cloud. My favorite serverless model is Cloudflare Workers. If you have one Worker call another Worker, there is no actual network request. Instead, it just calls the Worker code in the same V8 runtime. Meaning you don't pay the cost of a network roundtrip.</p><p>Importantly, Cloudflare Workers all run in V8 sandboxes. There are no containers. You have the option of writing your worker in JavaScript/TypeScript, or compiled WASM. A container cannot call another container in the same process. But V8 can. In other words: by deploying WASM in V8 sandboxes, you get all of the developer benefits of microservices with all of the runtime benefits of monoliths. Cloudflare is not the only provider doing this. Wasmer is trying to build a solution in this space as well.</p><h2 id="adoption">Adoption</h2><p>WebAssembly is still a young technology. But it's rapidly developing, and support seems to be growing. Maybe it doesn't work for you <em>yet</em>, but keep an eye on it. Try developing on Cloudflare to see what the future looks like. (TV infomercial voice): if you or a loved one are building Docker images, you may be entitled to a better experience.</p><p>If you primarily develop in languages like Python, Ruby, or PHP, be patient. I recommend adding a compiled language like Go or Rust to your <a href="https://charity.wtf/2018/12/02/software-sprawl-the-golden-path-and-scaling-teams-with-agency/">Golden Path</a> so you can be prepared when the WASM reckoning is upon us.</p>
