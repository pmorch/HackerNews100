<p>The Chrome team is excited to announce that WebGPU is now enabled by default in Chrome 121 on devices running Android 12 and greater powered by Qualcomm and ARM GPUs.</p>

<p>Support will gradually expand to encompass a wider range of Android devices, including those running on Android 11 in a near future. This expansion will be dependent on further testing and optimization to ensure a seamless experience across a broader range of hardware configurations. See <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1497815">issue chromium:1497815</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use_dxc_instead_of_fxc_for_shader_compilation_on_windows" data-text="Use DXC instead of FXC for shader compilation on Windows" tabindex="-1">Use DXC instead of FXC for shader compilation on Windows</h2>

<p>Chrome now uses the power of <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/wiki">DXC</a> (DirectX Compiler) to compile shaders on Windows D3D12 machines equipped with SM6+ graphics hardware. Previously, WebGPU relied on FXC (FX Compiler) for shader compilation on Windows. While functional, FXC lacked the feature set and performance optimizations present in DXC.</p>

<p>Initial testing shows a 20% average increase in compute shader compilation speed when using DXC compared to FXC.</p>

<h2 id="timestamp_queries_in_compute_and_render_passes" data-text="Timestamp queries in compute and render passes" tabindex="-1">Timestamp queries in compute and render passes</h2>

<p><a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#timestamp">Timestamp queries</a> allow WebGPU applications to measure precisely (down to the nanosecond) how much time their GPU commands take to execute compute and render passes. They are heavily used to gain insights into the performance and behavior of GPU workloads.</p>

<p>When the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"timestamp-query"</code> feature is available in a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUAdapter</code>, you can now do the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Request a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUDevice</code> with the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"timestamp-query"</code> feature.</li>
<li>Create a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUQuerySet</code> of type <code translate="no" dir="ltr">"timestamp"</code>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpucomputepassdescriptor-timestampwrites"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUComputePassDescriptor.timestampWrites</code></a> and <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpurenderpassdescriptor-timestampwrites"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPURenderPassDescriptor.timestampWrites</code></a> to define where to write timestamp values in <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUQuerySet</code>.</li>
<li>Resolve timestamp values into a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUBuffer</code> with <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#dom-gpucommandencoder-resolvequeryset"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">resolveQuerySet()</code></a>.</li>
<li>Read timestamp values back by copying the results from the <code translate="no" dir="ltr">GPUBuffer</code> to the CPU.</li>
<li>Decode timestamp values as a <code translate="no" dir="ltr">BigInt64Array</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>See the following example and issue <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/dawn/issues/detail?id=1800">dawn:1800</a>.</p>
<pre translate="no" dir="ltr"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
if (!adapter.features.has("timestamp-query")) {
  throw new Error("Timestamp query feature is not available");
}
// Explicitly request timestamp query feature.
const device = await adapter.requestDevice({
  requiredFeatures: ["timestamp-query"],
});
const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder();

// Create a GPUQuerySet which holds 2 timestamp query results: one for the
// beginning and one for the end of compute pass execution.
const querySet = device.createQuerySet({ type: "timestamp", count: 2 });
const timestampWrites = {
  querySet,
  beginningOfPassWriteIndex: 0, // Write timestamp in index 0 when pass begins.
  endOfPassWriteIndex: 1, // Write timestamp in index 1 when pass ends.
};
const passEncoder = commandEncoder.beginComputePass({ timestampWrites });
// TODO: Set pipeline, bind group, and dispatch work to be performed.
passEncoder.end();

// Resolve timestamps in nanoseconds as a 64-bit unsigned integer into a GPUBuffer.
const size = 2 * BigInt64Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT;
const resolveBuffer = device.createBuffer({
  size,
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.QUERY_RESOLVE | GPUBufferUsage.COPY_SRC,
});
commandEncoder.resolveQuerySet(querySet, 0, 2, resolveBuffer, 0);

// Read GPUBuffer memory.
const resultBuffer = device.createBuffer({
  size,
  usage: GPUBufferUsage.COPY_DST | GPUBufferUsage.MAP_READ,
});
commandEncoder.copyBufferToBuffer(resolveBuffer, 0, resultBuffer, 0, size);

// Submit commands to the GPU.
device.queue.submit([commandEncoder.finish()]);

// Log compute pass duration in nanoseconds.
await resultBuffer.mapAsync(GPUMapMode.READ);
const times = new BigInt64Array(resultBuffer.getMappedRange());
console.log(`Compute pass duration: ${Number(times[1] - times[0])}ns`);
resultBuffer.unmap();
</code></pre>
<p>Due to <a href="https://gpuweb.github.io/gpuweb/#security-timing-device">timing attack</a> concerns, timestamp queries are quantized with a resolution of 100 microseconds, which provides a good compromise between precision and security. In Chrome browser, you can disable timestamp quantization by enabling the "WebGPU Developer Features" <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/chrome-flags#chromeflags">flag</a> at <code translate="no" dir="ltr">chrome://flags/#enable-webgpu-developer-features</code> during the development of your app. See <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-webgpu-120#timestamp_queries_quantization">Timestamp queries quantization</a> to learn more.</p>

<p>As GPUs may reset the timestamp counter occasionally, which can result in unexpected values such as negative deltas between timestamps, I recommend you check out the <a href="https://github.com/webgpu/webgpu-samples/compare/d67ae2acb40bebfa7c7705cd28175b44fbb03b59..e59b76695212208600f5bbb5423895e6d440fd90#diff-fe64f06098aed64ad6bbd885ad77dc50f7fa856829bf22545d3aa1baaad1c0b8">git diff changes</a> that adds timestamp query support to the following <a href="https://webgpu.github.io/webgpu-samples/samples/computeBoids">Compute Boids</a> sample.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Haier" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/01/18/haier.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>Appliances giant Haier issued a takedown notice to a software developer for creating Home Assistant integration plugins for the company's home appliances and releasing them on GitHub.</p>
<p>Haier is a multinational home appliances and consumer electronics corporation selling a wide range of products under the brands General Electric Appliances, Hotpoint, Hoover, Fisher &amp; Paykel, and Candy.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, German software developer Andre Basche, who maintains plugins for the Home Assistant integration for Haier's hOn smart control app, claimed to receive a legal threat demanding the immediate removal of his tools from the GitHub platform.</p>
<p>Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform enabling users to control and automate their smart home devices from a centralized interface. Apart from convenience and cost, Home Assistant offers superior security and privacy options not available on similar commercial apps.</p>
<p>The plugins offered in the GitHub repositories enable users to control Haier, Candy, and Hoover air conditioners, purifiers, dishwashers, induction hobs, ovens, fridges, washing machines, and dryers through Home Assistant.</p>
<p>According to a notice published by the repository owner, Haier claims these plugins cause the firm significant financial damage and violate copyright laws, requiring the developer to take them down to avoid further legal action.</p>
<p>"We are writing to inform you that we have discovered two Home Assistant integration plug-ins developed by you (https://github.com/Andre0512/hon and https://github.com/Andre0512/pyhOn) that are in violation of our terms of service,"&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Andre0512/hOn" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reads the notice</a>&nbsp;from Haier Europe Security and Governance Department.</p>
<p>"Specifically, the plug-ins are using our services in an unauthorized manner, which is causing significant economic harm to our Company."</p>
<p>"We take the protection of our intellectual property very seriously and demand that you immediately cease and desist all illegal activities related to the development and distribution of these plug-ins."</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Full notice" height="535" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Software/01/notice.png" width="903"><figcaption><strong>Takedown notice</strong> <em>(GitHub)</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The letter eventually delivers a legal threat to the developer, saying that if he fails to comply with the removal request immediately, the firm will take necessary legal action to seek compensation for the damage done to its business.</p>
<p>The plugins themselves are open-source, but it is unclear if they incorporate Haier's intellectual property, such as software code or proprietary protocols, which would give the firm a legal basis for the request.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the plugins do not infringe on Haier's intellectual property or fall under fair use provisions, the creator could opt to defend his work and keep the plugins available to the community.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Haier's legal threats have intimidated the developer, who announced that the project will be taken down in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the situation has sparked support for the developer and&nbsp;backlash on Haier, with users calling consumers to boycott Haier, finding the firm's approach excessively aggressive.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/bennie_pie/status/1747252779712991527" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><img alt="Tweet" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Software/01/tweet.png" width="445"></a></p>
<p>Targeting open-source software developers tends to backfire for companies, as others fork or clone the code repositories to prevent the projects from disappearing.</p>
<p>At this time, the Haier home assistant plugins have been forked 228 times, many occurring since the news of the legal threats.</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Haier with questions on the case, but a comment wasn't immediately available.</p>

But while most YIMBY attention has been focused on changes to zoning, building code reform may offer an even bigger opportunity to unlock housing construction.

Fire and smoke spread up the building, home to at least 20 families, the fire fed in part by the buildingâs only exit: a wood staircase. Firefighters were able to rescue people up to the fourth floor, but their ladders could not reach any higher. âAs the firemen stood on the ladders,â </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/03/archives/calamitous-fire-tenement-house-on-elmstreet-destroyed-thirty.html" rel="">wrote the </a><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/03/archives/calamitous-fire-tenement-house-on-elmstreet-destroyed-thirty.html" rel="">New York Times</a></em><span> the next day, âthey could see many women and children lying prostrated on the floor, surrounded by the flames, which rendered all attempts to approach them ineffectual.â</span></p><p>For an American city in the 19th century, the fire was actually quite small. By then New York City had already had three great fires since 1776, and Chicago would burn 11 years later. Even into the 20th century, American cities would still not be safe from great fires, with San Francisco burning in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake.</p><p><span>Across the Atlantic Ocean, great urban fires were largely a solved problem by the 19th century. After the Great Fire of London of 1666, Parliament did what European governments had been doing since at least Ancient Rome: they </span><a href="http://www.tara.tcd.ie/bitstream/handle/2262/86169/Final%20Dissertation%20.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y" rel="">limited the use of wood in buildings</a><span>. Without fuel from the structure of buildings themselves, fires still broke out in Europe, but their damage was limited, and great urban fires by the 19th century were mostly confined to smaller or poorer cities on the continentâs edge that hadnât yet made the transition to brick, stone, metal, and concrete.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg" width="1456" height="804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:804,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1210864,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F33e610f0-2643-4ebe-a3f8-5580d2bd944e_2500x1381.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>19th century Manhattan tenements, with a primitive second exit installed in the form of a fire escape.

The continentâs thick woods, fast growth, and rural (and later suburban) character meant that the United States and Canada has to this day never fully moved away from wood-frame construction. Instead, just days after 142 Elm Street burned, the jury that convicted the building owner </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/07/archives/the-late-catastrophes-investigations-before-coroners-juries-verdict.html" rel="">issued a call</a><span> for âthe enactment of a law making it incumbent upon owners of tenement buildings to place iron stairways, or some other approved means of egress, on the outside of these structures.â Soon after the state legislature followed through on their request, and the requirement to provide a second means of egress in apartment buildings was born.</span></p><p><span>Today, the flimsy fire escapes that satisfied officials in the 1860s have morphed into something much more. Two stairs are required for new apartment buildings above three stories by Americaâs model International Building Code (whose claim to internationality comes largely from a handful of tiny island nations). They must sit on opposite ends of a building, and they must be fully enclosed. The standards are not unheard of in Europe and Asia, but they are typically </span><a href="https://secondegress.ca/Jurisdictions" rel="">only applied to true high-rises</a><span> â&nbsp;above around 20 stories in Singapore, or 25 stories in Italy (and even then, the required distance between the two stairs is not as large as in the US).</span></p><p><span>As a legacy code requirement, there has never been much modern analysis of Americaâs two-stair requirement and its impact on fire safety outcomes, but the United States in general does quite poorly on these measures. Almost every country in Western Europeâwhere single-stair apartment buildings can rise many times the IBCâs three-story height limitâhas </span><a href="https://www.ctif.org/sites/default/files/2022-08/CTIF_Report27_ESG_0.pdf" rel="">fewer fire deaths per capita than the US</a><span>. New York City, which allows single-stair buildings up to six stories (and has many apartment buildings where the second exit is a flimsy fire escape that does not meet modern code requirements), has slightly fewer deaths per capita than the rest of the US. Since the second exit code requirement was first introduced over 150 years ago, the field of fire safety has seen countless more sophisticated innovations, from passive measures like enclosed stairways and fire-resistance-rated materials, to more technologically advanced systems like smoke detectors and fire sprinklers.</span></p><p><span>Despite the questionable effect on fire safety outcomes, North Americaâs unusual second stair requirements have an outsized impact on the design of multifamily buildings. The rules make it almost impossible to efficiently recreate the traditional design of apartment buildings, </span><a href="https://larchlab.com/city-of-vancouver-report-on-point-access-blocks/" rel="">termed âpoint access blocksâ by Seattle architect Michael Eliason</a><span>âa few units around a single stair, with maybe an elevator. The common hallway that must connect the two stairs in a modern American code-compliant building cuts the structure in two, cutting off the possibility of floor-through apartments found in traditional American multifamily architecture like the New York City tenement or the Los Angeles dingbat.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png" width="1456" height="1092" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1092,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15163e4d-fbca-4140-8b55-2a74dea461fa_1600x1200.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>The typical American 5-over-1 fulfills the building code requirement for two exits, but requires a large lot and does not typically provide many units larger than a one-bedroom.

Drawing by Alfred Twu.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The double-loaded corridor that meets modern American building code requirements can provide studio and one-bedroom apartments just fine, since these have a low ratio of living and bedroom space (which must, at least traditionally, have access to natural light and fresh air) to kitchen and bathroom space (which can be placed up against the dark common corridors). But when architects try to design apartments with two or more bedrooms, the apartments balloon in size, since every 10-foot-wide bedroom ends up coming with 30 or more feet in unit depth. Try to add a single 120-square foot bedroom and youâll end up having to add another 180 square feet on top that you need to fill some other wayâprobably with walk-in closets and en-suite bathrooms, adding the expense of more plumbing, fixtures, and tiles. </p><p>Each square foot of space costs just as much to build whether it has access to light or not, so the rent that developers must achieve for these two-, three-, orâgod forbidâfour-bedroom apartments balloons far beyond the ability or willingness of families to pay. And if renters or condo buyers donât like it, they can just drive till they qualify for a single-family house in the suburbs.</p><p><span>Without the requirement for a second stair, buildings can be laid out in a fundamentally more efficient way. With less vertical circulation, the circulation core can simply be repeated a few different times, with apartments of different sizes arrayed off of each core, potentially stretching from the front of the building to the back. If planners redraw zoning envelopes to accommodate thinner buildings, more bedrooms can be packed in less square footage, offering more affordable and competitive family-sized designs. With units that appeal more to families (in New York City, condo buildings average 1,189 gross sq. ft., compared to 838 sq. ft. for rentals) and reform of defect liability laws that drive insurance costs up for condo developers, America might even be able to bring its condo construction numbers up from </span><a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/housing-market-needs-more-condos-why-are-so-few-being-built" rel="">historic lows</a><span>.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg" width="1456" height="818" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:818,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F195b4454-ec46-4af1-b4db-f4aec0be0295_1600x899.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Typical European floor plan. Drawing by Michael Eliason, Larch Lab.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The YIMBY movement and other housing reformers have made progress over the last decade or more in loosening zoning codes, but building codes in America are still largely a one-way ratchet, getting tighter and tighter with every fire, with no relief due to new technologies, provisions, and understanding of fire engineering. The model code writers are responsive to materials manufacturers and the fire service, but multifamily developers and housing affordability advocates do not exert much authority. Sometimes the manufacturers who donate to the International Code Council and can afford to pursue code changes make positive contributions (for example, the American Wood Councilâs </span><a href="https://awc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/tmt_toolkit.pdf" rel="">advocacy for mass timber</a><span>), but more often their interests have a questionable relationship to the public good. </span></p><p>States and localities have the power to adopt, reject, and amend model codes like the IBC, but lack the capacity to do much informed analysis and research. The better-resourced federal government used to play a larger role in code development, but has mostly retreated in recent decades.</p><p><span>Recognizing that building codes are the next frontier in housing reform, I founded the Center for Building in North America around a year ago, to do research on and advocate for changes to building codes that could bring down the cost of production of multifamily housing, and improve efficiency and quality. The opportunities for reform are as deep as a modern building is complex â&nbsp;from </span><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/22052022/climate-refrigerants-air-conditioning-heat-pumps/" rel="">more modern refrigerants</a><span> that would allow Americans to buy heat pumps on the global market to more efficient </span><a href="https://www.aspe.org/pipeline/an-optimized-sanitary-stack-configuration-for-mid-rise-multifamily-building-construction/" rel="">single-stack venting</a><span> in plumbing systems that could cut plumbing costs dramatically â&nbsp;but we decided to focus on stairs as our first issue, given the importance to building design and the existing movement among architects for reform. </span></p><p><span>Weâve worked with housing advocates in </span><a href="https://www.centerforbuilding.org/singlestair-tracker" rel="">states across the US</a><span> to advance legislation and administrative changes to building codes to allow single-stair buildings up to six stories, above the current three-story limit in most of America, drawing on language already adopted in Seattle, Honolulu, and New York City, and </span><a href="https://secondegress.ca/Jurisdictions" rel="">extensive experience abroad</a><span>.</span></p><p>While the current single-stair limits were arrived at through trial-and-error and fairly rudimentary logic, status quo bias means that proposed reforms will be held to a much higher standard. To change such a fundamental tenet of American building codes, though, will require more advanced analysis. Fire protection engineering and data collection has advanced greatly in the century and a half since the second means of egress emerged in 1860, and today there are more engineered and big data approaches to proving safety.</p><p>Since the benefits are diffuse and multifamily development interests in America are poorly organized on a national level, there is not much of a natural constituency for this sort of work. One of my goals when founding the Center for Building in North America in 2022 was to produce research and organize urbanists, architects, real estate developers, and others to advocate for more rational building codes in the United States and Canada. </p><p><strong>âStephen Smith</strong></p><p><span>For anyone who is interested in diving deeper into these topics, Iâd encourage you to reach out to Stephen at </span><a href="mailto:stephen@centerforbuilding.org" rel="">stephen@centerforbuilding.org</a><span>.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ello_(social_network)">Ello</a> launched on August 7, 2014 with big dreams and big promises, a new social network defined by what it <em>wouldnât</em> do.</p>
<p>They laid it all out in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140625082554/https://ello.co/manifesto">manifesto</a>, right on their homepage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your social network is owned by advertisers.</p>
<p>Every post you share, every friend you make and every link you follow is tracked, recorded and converted into data. Advertisers buy your data so they can show you more ads. You are the product thatâs bought and sold.</p>
<p>We believe there is a better way. We believe in audacity. We believe in beauty, simplicity and transparency. We believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership.</p>
<p>We believe a social network can be a tool for empowerment. Not a tool to deceive, coerce and manipulate â but a place to connect, create and celebrate life.</p>
<p>You are not a product.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="908" height="498" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-11.png" alt="Screenshot of Ello's invite-only homepage with the manifesto, and two buttons: I Agree and I Disagree." srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-11.png 908w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-11-300x165.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-11-768x421.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-11-800x439.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px"></figure>
<p>From its launch, Ello defined itself as an alternative to ad-driven social networks like Twitter and Facebook. âYou are not a product.â (The âI Disagreeâ button linked to Facebookâs privacy page.)</p>
<p>Iâd link to that manifesto on Elloâs site, but I canât, because Ello is dead.</p>
<p>In June 2023, the servers just started returning errors, making nine years of member contributions inaccessible, apparently forever â every post, artwork, song, portfolio, and the community built there was gone in an instant.</p>
<p>How did this happen? What happened between the idealistic manifesto above and the sudden shutdown?</p>
<p>Itâs a story so old and familiar, I predicted it shortly after Ello launched.</p>
<h2>Elloâs Funding and Launch</h2>
<p>Ello, for those who donât remember, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072943/https://ello.co/wtf/post/about-ello">described itself</a> as a âsimple, beautiful, and ad-free social network created by a small group of artists and designers.â It launched with a distinctly minimalist monochrome interface and an even more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfPNdSY7vUg">minimalist</a> set of features.</p>
<p>Like Diaspora and App.net before it, Ello partly defined itself by its opposition to the exploitive business models and content moderation practices of major social networks, so quickly found itself deluged by people fleeing Facebook and dubbed by media outlets as an â<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-26-ello.html">anti-Facebook</a>â or â<a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/ello-pbc/">Facebook killer</a>,â something the Ello team never intended it to be. It was an uncomfortable balancing act, but they <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/ello-embraces-facebook-users-irked-by-real-name-demands">leaned</a> into the publicity, at least for a while.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="659" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-1024x659.png" alt="" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-1024x659.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-300x193.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-768x495.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12-800x515.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-12.png 1267w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Elloâs invite-only beta</figcaption></figure>
<p>In September 2014, one month after it opened its invite-only beta, I wrote <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140926023248/https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/oy73kFfDdhOPh8Jv9z9pFA">a post about Ello on Ello</a>. </p>
<p>Digging through <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598000/000159800014000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filings</a>, I discovered that the newly-launched indie social network had taken nearly half a million in seed funding from a venture capital firm, which seemed counter to its indie manifesto. Since nobody else mentioned the funding, including Ello themselves, I wrote about it.</p>
<p>Hereâs what I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building something like Ello costs money. They have a team of at least seven people, and have worked on it for months. That doesnât come cheap.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072943/https://ello.co/wtf/post/about">About</a> section makes it seem like Ello was built independently, a group of artists making something for themselves, presumably funded by volunteer effort and maybe a seed investment from Ello president and CEO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921074259/https://paulbudnitz.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Budnitz</a>, who also founded Kidrobot and Budnitz Bicycles.</p>
<p>But a little digging shows a much more predictable source: they took a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598000/000159800014000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$435,000 round</a> of seed funding in January from FreshTracks Capital, a Vermont-based VC firm that <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/usm-studio/freshtracks/documents/the_freshtracks_flurry_march_2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the deal</a> in March.</p>
<p>Why is this a problem?</p>
<p>The Ello founders are positioning it as an alternative to other social networks â they wonât sell your data or show you ads. âYou are not the product.â</p>
<p>If they were independently-funded and run as some sort of co-op, bootstrapped until profitable, maybe thatâs plausible. Hard, but possible.</p>
<p>But VCs donât give money out of goodwill, and taking VC funding â even seed funding â creates outside pressures that shape the inevitable direction of a company.</p>
<p>Before they opened their doors, Ello became hooked on an unsustainable funding model â taking cash from VCs â and will almost certainly take a much larger Series A round once that $435,000 dries up. (Which, at their current burn rate, should be in a couple months.)</p>
<p>And theyâll have no trouble getting it. Thereâs a lot of money out there right now, and it will be extremely tempting to take it, especially if refusing it would mean closure or layoffs.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that VCs arenât like Kickstarter backers, or even like angel investors. Kickstarter or Patreon backers just want the thing being made. Angel investors may have other reasons to invest beyond equity: fame, insider access, or maybe just the joy of helping something exist.</p>
<p>VCs may invest in things they think are interesting or want to exist, but they primarily invest money in startups to get a return on their investment, on behalf of their limited partners. That return usually takes the form of an exit: an acquisition or an IPO.</p>
<p>Unless they have a <strong>very</strong> unique relationship with their investors, Ello will inevitably be pushed towards profitability and an exit, even if it compromises their current values. Sometimes, this push comes subtly in the form of advice and questions in emails, phone calls, and chats over coffee. Sometimes, as more direct pressure from the board. (FreshTracksâ Managing Director <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140929184723/https://www.freshtrackscap.com/lee-e-bouyea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sits</a> on their board.) Or, if things go bad, by replacing the founders.</p>
<p>The Ello team knows that how a startup is funded shapes how it behaves. They spend a good chunk of their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921072943/https://ello.co/wtf/post/about">About</a> pages talking about how theyâre not going to make money (not ads or selling your data), and a little bit about how they hope to (paid premium features). I hope theyâre right â itâd be great to have more startups that arenât reliant on ads.</p>
<p>But they completely fail to disclose how Ello is being funded <strong>now</strong>, which matters just as much, if not more, as any future revenue plans.</p>
<p>I love seeing people build new stuff. More people trying to build crazy experimental communities on the Internet is a very good thing. And nothingâs more audacious than trying to build a new social network.</p>
<p>Social networks become the glue that connect people together â the foundation for friendships, relationships, and new works of creative expression.</p>
<p>Building a social network is like opening the doors to a huge party and inviting everyone in. Without a way to get your stuff out, shutting down a social network is like locking the door and burning the place down.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ello is a free, closed-source social network, with no export tools or an API, fueled by venture capital and a loose plan for paid premium features. I think itâs fair to be skeptical.</p>
<p>Like everyone else here, I hope Ello can stick to their principles, resist outside pressure, fight market forces, and find a unique and sustainable niche.</p>
<p>Letâs hope their investors feel the same way.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Founders Respond</h2>
<p>That post quickly blew up on Ello, and then went far beyond it, with coverage in articles from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/30/6874727/ello-is-the-doomed-utopia-we-cant-stop-building">The Verge</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/sep/26/ello-anti-facebook-privacy-lgbt-social-neetwork">The Guardian</a>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbn8m4/what-the-hell-is-ello">VICE</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/ello-says-youre-not-a-product-but-you-are/380809/">The Atlantic</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ello-needs-to-stick-to-its-principles-2014-9">Business Insider</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Elloâs CEO, co-founders, and investors dismissed the concerns I raised, starting with co-founder and CEO Paul Budnitz, who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927073322/http://betabeat.com/2014/09/ello-founder-says-vc-funding-is-no-big-secret-thats-silly/">told Betabeat</a> it was âsilly.â</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="680" height="555" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-6.png" alt="Screenshot of Betabeat article: &quot;Ello Founder Says VC Funding Is No Big Secret: âThatâs Sillyâ&quot; &quot;There's no pressure for us to do anything we don't want to do,&quot; Ello founder Paul Budnitz said." srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-6.png 680w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-6-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px"></figure>
<p>âIn fact, Ello is controlled executively by its 7 founders, who own a majority share in the company,â <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140927073322/http://betabeat.com/2014/09/ello-founder-says-vc-funding-is-no-big-secret-thats-silly/">wrote</a> Betabeatâs Jack Smith IV. âThey say that the cynical claim that theyâll sell out eventually, or that anyone can tell them what to do, is ridiculous.â</p>
<p>Co-founder Todd Berger <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141006081010/https://gigaom.com/2014/09/25/ello-investor-co-founder-funding-or-not-we-hate-ads-and-we-want-to-shift-values/">laughed at a GigaOm writer</a> who asked him about my post. âThereâs seven founders and we own 82 to 84 percent of the company, so we can do whatever the hell we want,â Berger said. </p>
<p>âWeâre not going to sell out our soul to grow our company,â continued Berger. âMaybe itâs hard to believe.â</p>
<p>I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140930025259/https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/Jp4o1TBtLrYytHpcEni0Kg">followed up</a> with a second Ello post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Iâve received a dozen emails in the last day and a half from journalists looking for quotes about Ello. I didnât reply to any of them. I have no interest in being the anti-Ello poster boy, for one main reason:</p>
<p><strong>I think Elloâs pretty neat, and I want them to succeed.</strong></p>
<p>Like I said in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140930025259/https://ello.co/waxpancake/post/oy73kFfDdhOPh8Jv9z9pFA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my post</a>, more experimentation with online communities is a very good thing. Weâll only break away from the dominant players by trying new crazy shit, and I think it should be applauded. (And, yes, I even like the design.)</p>
<p>But I think taking VC was a bad idea that works against their ethos, and will inevitably lead to a much larger Series A by yearâs end.</p>
<p>I think the intentions of the team are pure, and they genuinely believe in what theyâre building. But Iâm not sure intentions matter unless they can wean themselves off outside funding.</p>
<p>I really, really hope their revenue plan works out, and quickly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Series A and the PBC</h2>
<p>One month later, Ello <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ello-becomes-a-public-benefit-corporation-and-legally-vows-to-forever-remain-ad-free-founders-and-investors-sign-charter-376792333.html">announced</a> theyâd raised significantly more money: a <strong>$5.5 million</strong> Series A round co-led by TechStars and <a href="https://foundry.vc/blog/2014/10/our-investment-in-ello/">Foundry Group</a>, who took a board seat, with participation from FreshTracks Capital, who already sat on the board.</p>
<p>Coinciding with this funding, and perhaps anticipating the backlash, Ello also announced they had converted the company to a Public Benefit Corporation.</p>
<p>In a public letter signed by their founders and investors, they wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There has been some speculation in the press since our launch that Ello will someday be forced to allow paid ads on our social network.</p>
<p>With virtually everybody else relying on ads to make money, some members of the tech elite are finding it hard to imagine there is a better way.</p>
<p><strong>But 2014 is not 2004, and the world has changed.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Effectively, Ello would be a for-profit corporation required to pursue social good as part of its charter, instead of solely maximizing shareholder value. Unlike a B Corp certification, this would enshrine their values in their legal structure, which is a pretty big deal. They were the most notable technology company to form as a PBC until that point, preceding <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/blog/kickstarter-is-now-a-benefit-corporation">Kickstarterâs conversion</a> by nearly a year.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160319071816/https://ello.co/wtf/about/pbc/">dedicated page</a> on their site explained the significance of the PBC, and the charter they were now bound by:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To assure that Ello always remains ad-free, Ello converted to a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC). A Benefit Corporation is a new kind of for-profit company in the USA that exists to produce a benefit for society as a whole â not just to make money for its investors.</p>
<p>The Ello PBC charter states in the strongest legal terms possible that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ello shall never make money from selling ads;</li>
<li>Ello shall never make money from selling user data; and</li>
<li>In the event that Ello is ever sold, the new owners will have to comply by these terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ello exists for the benefit of the creative community, and we will never serve ads or sell personal data.</p>

<p>This was a commendable change, though somewhere along the way, all the public debate about raising professional money and profit maximization became solely about switching to a paid advertising model and selling user data. This was a straw man argument that was easier to knock down.</p>
<p>But there are many, many ways for a social network to become worse for their users than running ads.</p>
<p>My concern wasnât that Ello would start running paid ads. I donât even mind ads, as long as theyâre done thoughtfully and with privacy in mind. (I ran ads from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228233009/https://decknetwork.net/">The Deck</a> here for years.)</p>
<p>I was worried that, by taking outside funding, Elloâs values were no longer fully-aligned with the community: they were aligned with their investors. In time, given more money and more pressure, they would be inclined to do something the community, or even the original founders, didnât want to do.</p>
<h2>Series B and CEO Changes</h2>
<p>In April 2015, six months after their Series A, Ello took another $5 million in a Series B round from <a href="https://www.builtincolorado.com/2015/04/03/ello-raises-another-5m-launches-new-beta-version">their previous investors</a>, giving a board seat to TechStars, and bringing their total raised to $11M.</p>
<p>Later that year, in December, Budnitz wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170622034939/https://ello.co/budnitz/post/qcg9cemgu69qfdawwwuubw">new post on Ello</a> looking back on their first year and looking ahead to 2016:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This past week I gave a few interviews to online news organizations.</p>
<p>One of the journalists scoffed when I told him that Ello is built on principles we believe in, and that in 2015 we did everything we could to grow slowly. Rather than sell out and make another giant network the world doesnât need, we decided to take our time to build the beautiful and inspiring place we have today.</p>
<p>I felt sad for the guy. Itâs awful going through life never believing in anything.</p>
<p>So in the spirit of the New Year, and because it was clear that this journalist wasnât going to believe anything I told him anyway, I figured Iâd publish a short list of things Ello will <em>never</em> do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Diverge from our mission to empower and support creators to inspire one another, and move the world forward.</li>
<li>Tolerate hate. Ello has many tools, some visible and others not, that help keep this network positive.</li>
<li>Sell ads or user data to third parties.</li>
<li>Sell out.</li>
<li>Suck.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Three months later, in March 2016, Paul Budnitz <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160328082226/ello.co/budnitz">stepped down</a> as CEO, citing the distance between his home in Vermont and the rest of the team in Boulder. He was replaced by Todd Berger, one of Elloâs co-founders and lead designers.</p>
<p>Under Berger, Ello <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/ello-artists/">refocused</a> its efforts on artists and creators. From a May 2016 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-creators-network-tomorrows-trends-in-leading-edge-creativity-today-300273173.html">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent months Ello has doubled down on its mission to support creators everywhere, becoming the premiere community for the worldâs leading edge and contemporary artists, photographers, designers, illustrators, architects and GIF makers to share their work and ideas, connect with others, and build organic reach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a September 2016 <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/09/the-bizarre-second-life-of-the-utopian-facebook-killer/">interview with Wired</a>, he said that was what Ello was always meant to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Berger had originally intended Ello to cater to artists, but the founding team was split on the idea. âTo Paul [Budnitz] it sounded limiting. To our investors it sounded very limiting,â says Berger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As its new CEO, Berger continued fundraising, but the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1598000/000159800017000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC filing</a> from March 2017 indicates a struggle, raising only $2.5M of the available $4M. In an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/19/ello-again/">interview with TechCrunch</a> in November 2017, Berger said he was looking to raise more cash. âWe have a lot of investment opportunities coming in from actually some fairly heavy-hitting firms that I hope to close.â</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="770" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-1024x770.png" alt="Screenshot of Ello homepage. &quot;The Creators Network: Built by artists, for artists. Ello is a global community of artists dedicated to creative excellence.&quot;" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-1024x770.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-300x225.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-768x577.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7-800x601.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-7.png 1191w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Ello in 2017</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the same interview, Berger said Ello now had 400,000 monthly active users, with 625,000 artists on the site. </p>
<p>It seemed like Ello finally found its niche as âThe Creators Network,â a community of artists and designers using its visual-heavy design to show off their portfolios and promote their work. Their original freemium model never worked out, but sponsored content was handled thoughtfully, with like-minded brands offering giveaways. It was paid advertising, but it didnât violate privacy or sell user data.</p>
<p>âA lot of people thought we died and went away and the whole time weâve been cultivating a really niche and creative community thatâs gotten more focused as Iâve been able to enact my vision,â Berger said.</p>
<p>The future of Ello seemed bright.</p>
<h2>The Acquisition</h2>
<p>Five months later, in March 2018, Ello was quietly sold to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180927195200/https://www.talenthouse.com/about">Talenthouse</a>, a Los Angeles-based company whose primary business was running <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161117224953/https://www.talenthouse.com/collaborate/all">design contests</a> for brands, in which independent artists competed against each other for a cash prize.</p>
<p>I only know the sale date because it was mentioned in the <a href="https://vcet.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/VSCF-FY18-Annual-Public-Report-w_cover.pdf">annual report</a> of a venture capital firm who invested in their Series A. The acquisition was never announced publicly, as far as I can tell, mentioned only in <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/10/17/creativity-re-wired-good-fast-or-cheap">this October 2018 interview</a> with Talenthouse co-founder Maya Bogle, where she said that âearlier this year we acquired Ello.co.â</p>
<p>As an Ello user, I was never notified about the ownership change, even though they sold all my data to an entirely new company. As far as I can find, none of the original founders mentioned the sale publicly when it happened.</p>
<p>There were telltale signs, though: Elloâs social media started regularly <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Aellohype%20talenthouse">promoting design contests</a> from âour friends at Talenthouse,â while never disclosing the sale. The Ello homepage prominently featured Talenthouse âartist invitesâ to compete in their design contests from brands like Absolut Vodka, Amazon Prime, Pabst Blue Ribbon, Adidas, and Miller Lite.</p>

And theyâre just friends, really.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Founders Leave</h2>
<p>The following month, in September 2018, the remaining two of Elloâs original remaining co-founders announced they had left the company.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bnox1cAhOSa/">cryptic post</a> on Ello and Instagram, Elloâs then-CEO Todd Berger and fellow co-founder Lucian FÃ¶hr wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of the past years we did our best to steer Ello per our vision, always with the intent of putting artists first. At times we succeeded, often we failed. Which brings us to today. Weâre no longer at Ello, we canât elaborate as to why, but itâs time for us to move on and return to studio life.â¦</p>
<p>If we let you down along the way, weâre sorry. If we didnât, all the better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a <a href="https://www.printdesignacademy.com/podcasts/the-quickie-interviews-for-graphic-designers/episodes/2147546418">July 2019 podcast</a>, Berger and FÃ¶hr spoke candidly about their time at Ello, when Berger took over CEO duties and FÃ¶hr became the Chief Product Officer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Todd Berger:</strong> The beginning of it was super exciting, super pure, 100% authentic. We built a lot of digital products, worked with lots of startups. We felt like we knew how to do this. We got a lot of momentum. People were stoked. </p>
<p>And then investors got interested and there was pressure to do all these other things. The CEO at the time [Paul Budnitz] got maybe a little overzealous about making lots and lots of money and turning it into a crazier thing than we ever imagined. And it kind of got out of control real fast. </p>
<p>And then we were just kind of holding on, trying to steer it as best possible back to its original kind of the real place we wanted it to live in. And it was tricky, that fast-paced real startup ecosystemâ once thereâs VC money in there and thereâs a lot of press and thereâs a lot of attention and youâre not necessarily meeting expectations per the media, per your investors, etc etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the acquisition, it doesnât sound like it was a big payday for the original founders. (As preferred shareholders, VCs are typically paid from an acquisition before founders, employees, or other common stockholders.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Do you feel that the sale of the company justified the time and effort and blood and sweat?</p>
<p><strong>Berger:</strong> No, no. Frankly, it wasnât a lucrative exit. It was more of a, letâs carry this thing on, someone wants it. And it wasnât about that for us. </p>
<p>Like, had it been something different, who knows what weâd be doing now? But the experience, by and large, was justified. It just, by the nature of taking money in and building a company and a lot of pressure and responsibility, it went on longer and turned into a bumpier grindier thing I think than we wish it would have.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On August 22, 2018, then-CTO Colin Gray <a href="https://github.com/ello/wtf/commit/a8be236ba25d9c07feeafaa0e0590b39b5bd9ba4#diff-0eb547304658805aad788d320f10bf1f292797b5e6d745a3bf617584da017051">deleted the Manifesto</a>, the foundational statement that was part of Ello since before it launched, along with <a href="https://github.com/ello/wtf/commit/e454e75357f8e5ec5cf02c1c25fe44459baaec77">all references</a> to the Public Benefit Corporation and its charter. </p>
<p>Ello PBC was officially dead.</p>

<h2>The End</h2>
<p>In December 2019, Ello, Talenthouse, and Zooppa <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191203005403/en/Ello-Talenthouse-and-Zooppa-Join-Forces-to-Form-TLNT-Holdings-%E2%80%94-the-Worlds-Most-Diverse-and-Engaged-Creative-Network">merged</a> into TLNT Holdings, a new holding company backed by UK private equity firm AEDC Capital. TLNT was then sold to Swiss investment firm New Value AG, which renamed itself, confusingly, to Talenthouse AG.</p>
<p>In December 2021, Ello <a href="https://twitter.com/ellohype/status/1470706318814195719">changed</a> their logo to finally acknowledge what everyone on the site had figured out long ago.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="292" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1.png" alt="&quot;Ello by Talenthouse&quot; logo" srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1.png 750w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-1-300x117.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></figure>
<p>âOur new logo represents our parent company, Talenthouse, who yâall are already familiar with as we cross promote creative briefs on the Talenthouse platform all the time,â they wrote on the official blog. âYouâre creative, you understand the way businesses develop.â</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, Talenthouse was struggling financially.</p>
<p>A February 2023 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/feb/04/ive-given-up-getting-paid-design-agency-accused-of-exploiting-artists">report in The Observer</a> exposed that Talenthouse was withholding funds from artists who won their creative briefs. A month later, The Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/apr/09/creative-tech-firm-talenthouse-is-close-to-failure-as-debts-mount">reported</a> their parent company was âclose to failure as debts mount,â with most of their subsidiaries closed and staff laid off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Talenthouse, whose clients have included Netflix, Coca-Cola, Nike and the UN, is facing legal action by creditors in the UK and is understood to have laid off most of its workforce, with top executives also departing its parent company in recent days.</p>
<p>Its parent company, Talenthouse AG, has also announced the closure of four other subsidiaries saying they cannot afford to pay outstanding bills, including staff wages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In May 2023, the company <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/having-raised-80m-to-date-creator-agency-talenthouse-alerts-investors-to-critical-financial-situation/">released a statement</a> that it was facing a âcritical financial situation,â restructuring the company while finding outside investors.</p>
<p>As a result of the upheaval, Elloâs website started seeing significant downtime starting in June 2023, delivering 500 errors on every page for <a href="https://ferdifz.tumblr.com/post/720556050114379776/ello-being-ello-again?is_related_post=1">days at a time</a>. It came back online for a few days in July, and then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230719114615/https://ello.co/">more errors</a>. </p>
<p>On July 18, 2023, it shut down for good and never recovered. On August 9, the web app was apparently deleted, leaving nothing but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230809081328/http://ello.co/">Heroku error</a>.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="285" src="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4-1024x285.png" alt="Three screenshots of errors from the Ello homepage." srcset="https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4-1024x285.png 1024w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4-300x84.png 300w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4-768x214.png 768w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4-1536x428.png 1536w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4-800x223.png 800w, https://waxy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-4.png 1607w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>The Ello homepage in July, August, and September 2023</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://business.talenthouse.com/">Talenthouse</a> corporate site is still online, but the platform is offline, and they havenât posted anything on social media since January 2023. Elloâs social media team stopped posting in October 2022.</p>
<hr>
<p>After leaving Ello in 2016, Budnitz returned to his Kidrobot roots with the launch of <a href="https://superplastic.co/">Superplastic</a> in 2017, a vinyl figure company that expanded into <a href="https://jankyheist.com/">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90687982/superplastic-disney-metaverse-nft-janky-guggimon-paul-budnitz">the metaverse</a> in 2022, raising a total of $68M in seven rounds of funding, led by Amazon. Superplastic appears to have abandoned its NFT projects last year as the market cratered, and Budnitz stepped down from his CEO role in September, replaced by the former president of blockchain gaming company Dapper Labs. They are now focused on â<a href="https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/how-amazon-backed-superplastic-is-trying-to-transform-its-toys-into-synthetic-celebrities/">synthetic celebrities</a>â and AI influencers. </p>
<p>Todd Berger and Lucian FÃ¶hr reopened their <a href="https://bergerfohr.com/">Boulder design studio</a>, which had shuttered for five years while they worked on Ello. Berger described running Ello as the âlow point of my creative career,â so I hope theyâre doing better.</p>
<p>As for Elloâs users, theyâre out of luck. The shutdown spawned a confused exodus of sorts, former community members trying to figure out what happened on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ello/">the Ello subreddit</a>, on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ello.co%20OR%20ellohype%20since%3A2023-06-15&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">X/Twitter</a>, and the <a href="https://danthornton.net/2023/06/is-it-goodbye-to-ello-another-niche-network-gone/#comments">comment section</a> of the only other blog post about it. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>âyears of my writing down the drainâ<br>âHeartbreaking. I upload my artwork in there and I love the site because it really focused on art.â<br>âItâs really messed up that there was NO warning to allow us to download our content. That was a very personal space for me and now itâs gone forever? It was my online diary ffs!â<br>âI had two groups. One had over 18k followers and the other 17k+. No warning at all. Just gone, along with 8 years of content updated a couple of times a week.â<br>âDid you find a way? It has basically my entire diary :(â<br>â18k followers and a few years worth of educational posts on fiction writing craft essentials gone.â</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some people tried to contact Ello or Talenthouse directly, but the emails <a href="https://twitter.com/Nerdwiththehat/status/1685830952675655680">bounced</a>.</p>
<p>Some former members set up <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/ferdifz/718400540806103040/ello-on-tumblr-group">a Tumblr group</a> to try to find each other again, âan attempt to maybe preserve and/or recapture what little magic Ello still had for us.â</p>
<h2>You Were The Product</h2>
<p>From the moment it launched, I liked Ello and wanted it to succeed. Experimentation in social networks is critically important, and thereâs enormous value in making new online communities for creative people. I even loved Elloâs minimalist monochrome design, which some people bounced off of.</p>
<p>But from the moment I read about their seed funding, I worried that they wouldnât be able to build a long-term sustainable business if they were hooked on professional funding and busy chasing growth.</p>
<p>The day after I wrote my first Ello post that blew up, Rose Eveleth published an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/09/ello-says-youre-not-a-product-but-you-are/380809/">article</a> in The Atlantic with the blunt headline, âEllo Says Youâre Not a Product, But You Are.â</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that you, the user, even exist and use their site makes you a product. Ello already has some amount of seed funding from VCs, which means it will need to return to them with something in hand if it wants more. And when it does, or when it is eventually bought by a larger company, you are part of that transactionâa key line in the sales pitch. Your existence on that site is a unit of currency, and itâs a unit that Ello is selling to whoever will give them money for it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Elloâs founders wrote in their manifesto that, with other social networks, âYou are the product thatâs bought and sold.â They believed, Iâm sure sincerely, that Ello would be different. âWe believe that the people who make things and the people who use them should be in partnership. You are not a product.â</p>
<p>Despite their idealist manifesto and their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150701202201/https://bill-of-rights.ello.co/">Bill of Rights</a>, I donât believe they could ever truly be in partnership with their community once they were taking large amounts of venture funding. All of their ideals and big dreams were easily undone, even the legal restrictions they defined in their Public Benefit Corporation charter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ello made money from selling ads to third parties;</li>
<li>Ello made money selling their user data to a third party;</li>
<li>Ello was sold, and the new owners didnât comply with those terms.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, Ello was sold to a third party without notifying its users or giving them the opportunity to opt out of handing over all their content and data, then resold to a new company, and finally shut down and deleted with no notice or recourse.</p>
<p>Would things have been different if they hadnât taken funding? Itâs impossible to say. In all likelihood, it never would have been built in the first place.</p>
<p>But if it had, I doubt it would have ended like this. ð</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-2q5oecfc=""> <p>Our relationship with computers and phones has changed. We used to rely on software installed locally on our computers, and are now shifting towards a model based on services and companion apps, sometimes with free tiers and subscriptions.</p>
<p>Most services are provided by organisations, who collect and sometimes resell usersâ information to third parties. This massive, indiscriminate, and corporate collection of personal data is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a>. While organisations can argue this data collection is necessary to provide their services, this comes with significant privacy implications.</p>
<p>Self-hosting and paid subscriptions are common strategies to escape surveillance capitalism. But what guarantees do they really offer? What alternatives exist for the general public who wants to escape surveillance capitalism, and at what cost?</p>
<h2 id="paid-subscriptions-are-not-enough">Paid subscriptions are not enough</h2>
<p>When services have a free and a paid tier, it can be tempting to think that the provider is going to sell your data on the free tier but theyâre going to be mindful of it on the paid tier. Paying a subscription to your provider can sound like a good idea to keep your data safe, and it sometimes is. But itâs not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>As reported by The Verge, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/2/23622227/betterhelp-customer-data-advertising-privacy-facebook-snapchat">mental health service provider BetterHelp shared customerâs email addresses, IP addresses, and health questionnaire information with third parties</a> including Facebook and Snapchat, while promising it was private. Mental health is precisely the type of information that should remain private, making this move particularly appalling from BetterHelp.</p>
<h2 id="self-hosting-but-as-a-service">Self-hosting, but as a service</h2>
<p>One of the major enablers of surveillance capitalism is centralisation. In that sense, paid subscriptions donât offer any guarantee that the provider will play fair game and keep your data private.</p>
<p>Self-hosting is rather efficient at preventing surveillance capitalism, mostly because the data doesnât live in a central repository but on the self-hosterâs infrastructure. In that sense, it doesnât directly enable surveillance capitalism. Itâs important here to make a distinction between private and public information though. Posts on federated social media platforms are not centralised, but they are public and can be scraped to be exploited. The threat weâre discussing in this article is a provider growing so big it can collect and exploit data that is not public, at a large scale.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the vendor of the self-hosted solution could theoretically still gather information about the users by making its software send data to the mothership regardless of where itâs installed. To an extent, this can be acceptable as long as the user explicitly knows what data is sent, can opt-out, and that the minimum amount of anonymised data is sent for clearly defined purposes. This practice is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telemetry#Software">telemetry</a>. Open-source software allows any tech-savvy person to look up the code and check what is actually sent to the mothership. Proprietary software makes it much more difficult.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://ergaster.org/posts/2023/08/09-i-dont-want-to-host-services-but-i-do">as we discussed earlier on this blog</a>, self-hosting doesnât scale well because it requires time and knowledge. Thereâs a workaround: using software that can be self-hosted, but buying it as a service. A real life example would be the Google Drive ethical alternative <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>: several providers like Ionos offer hosted Nextcloud instances. This makes solutions like these accessible (and safe!) to a broader public.</p>
<p>Using open-source licences means that the software can be audited, but it also allows anyone to take the code and offer it as service. This can lead to a race to the bottom in terms of cost and quality when the service providers are not playing fair game: they benefit from development work they didnât invest resources in, all while not contributing financially or technically to the upstream project either.</p>
<p>If the customers of such providers encounter problems, support is often minimal: in very budget-tight environments, losing a customer can be more profitable than investigating a significant problem. Such predatory methods harm the ecosystems in which theyâre deployed: customers get bad experiences, and the upstream project gets little to no benefit. Similar behaviours have been observed in the Matrix ecosystem where integrators deployed open source products without contributing anything back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website's page listing the partners working with Nextcloud." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-partners.DuAZqLpZ_1XMc1K.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>Ultimately, support contracts are an insurance for the service provider <em>and</em> for their customers. When the service provider pays for upstreamâs support and reports an issue, the engineers who developed the product investigate the case, fix the problem, and make the fix permanent for everyone. This also allows the upstream to generate a bit of revenue, contributing to the projectâs health, sustainability, and to the emergence of new exciting features.</p>
<p>Nextcloud also allows users to sign up on third party providers directly from <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">nextcloud.com</a>. The sign-up feature makes it extremely easy for the user to choose a provider. Nextcloudâs <a href="https://jospoortvliet.com/">Jos Poortvliet</a> confirmed to me that itâs not a formal certification programme, but more of a group of companies Nextcloud trusts. Nextcloud doesnât generate revenue from this programme, intentionally, since theyâre not in the business of monetising private users. Certification programmes are usually very expensive to run and not necessarily profitable for vendors.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the Nextcloud website prompting the user for their email address, and offering them to get started with a provider near them." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/nextcloud-signup.Do-jCSrM_Z1Cnz2L.webp" width="2880" height="1580" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<h2 id="not-trusting-anyone">Not trusting anyone</h2>
<p>When buying a hosted service from a provider, we enable a form of partial re-centralisationâ¦ which technically allows the provider to start selling the usersâ data for profit.</p>
<p>Thereâs a third option: making sure the data can only be read by its intended recipients, turning the servers into rather dumb pipes. This is End-to-End Encryption (E2EE). It certainly sounds like a silver bullet! So why doesnât every service provider implement it, to show their good faith? Because it has drawbacks.</p>
<p>When using E2EE, the files are encrypted. Nobody apart from their owner and people who have been explicitly authorised by the owner can read them. This means neither the server software nor the technical administrator of the server can read them either. This is often what users expect, but this has consequences!</p>
<h3 id="the-server-becomes-dumb">The server becomes dumb</h3>
<p>Since the server canât read the data, there are some legitimate operations it cannot perform anymore. A typical example is âdeepâ search, which is functionality where the server spends computing time to read and index all the files so itâs easy for the user to query them. When files are encrypted, indexing and search can only happen on the client. Those operations are quite expensive, and the clients donât necessarily have the computing power, connectivity or storage required to do so.</p>
<p>There are some new techniques such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> that could eventually enable users to offload this computation to the server&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;the server learning anything about what it is actually doing but they are not yet ready for large-scale use.</p>
<p>Having a dumb server also severely limits its ability to send automated reports or alerts based on specific workflows. In a sense, the server canât âworkâ for the user anymore and becomes nothing more than a backup service.</p>
<h3 id="data-can-become-irrecoverable">Data can become irrecoverable</h3>
<p>With E2EE, encryption and decryption keys are stored on the device only, which is a significant risk. Letâs assume you host your important documents exclusively on an E2EE service and your keys only exist on your phone. If your phone is broken or lost, your decryption keys are lost with it.</p>
<p>There are three workarounds to avoid losing the keys entirely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating a âpaper keyâ (also called ârecovery keyâ, âseed passphraseâ, or even âpaper walletâ in the context of cryptocurrencies) directly on the client, and giving the user the 12 to 15 words to write down or print somewhere.</li>
<li>Derive the encryption key from the userâs password. This is <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/">the approach Firefox Sync is taking</a> for example.</li>
<li>Storing the encryption keys on the server-side, in a vault encrypted by a key derived from a passphrase. The passphrase must of course be long enough to make it difficult to break by the server administrator.</li>
</ol>
<p>The major inconvenient of these workarounds is that they require the user to either print/write a generated key and store them somewhere safe where they can recover it later, or remember a passphrase to access their en/decryption keys. If the user loses the generated key or canât remember the passphrase, their data is lost and irrecoverable. The service provider cannot do anything about it because they canât access the data. In other words: thereâs no âforgot my passwordâ link anymore.</p>
<p>The reputational risk of not being able to help users who forgot their password is often unacceptable for service providers. Even Apple who positions itself as a company respectful of their usersâ privacy doesnât turn on E2EE by default, and understandably takes a lot of precautions before <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/108756">allowing users to turn on actual E2EE</a> on their iCloud account.</p>
<h3 id="the-e-in-e2ee-doesnt-stand-for-everything">The âEâ in E2EE doesnât stand for âEverythingâ</h3>
<p>While E2EE is particularly good at preventing nosy folks from looking at files and messages themselves, it doesnât mean <em>everything</em> is encrypted. In particular, metadata can be sent in clear text either because itâs necessary for the server to provide the service, <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/module/why-metadata-matters">or because the service providers can profit from it</a>.</p>
<p>Typically, WhatsApp is an E2EE messenger, but the provider still has access to metadata. WhatsApp also has a moderation feature that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-messages-arent-that-private-after-all/">allows users to decrypt an E2EE message they were sent, and send it to Meta for moderation purposes</a>. While moderation is a valid use case which doesnât break encryption itself, it shows that the client could in theory decrypt the message and send it to the service provider behind the userâs back.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of the iOS App Store displaying the &quot;App Privacy&quot; section of WhatsApp. A lot of items are mentioned in the &quot;Data Linked to You&quot; section." src="https://ergaster.org/_astro/whatsapp-data-collected.D2jizaJk_wsrgM.webp" width="1179" height="2556" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>This highlights that E2EE alone is also not enough: even if users donât need to trust the service provider they need to be able to trust both the protocol and the client they rely on. This means the client necessarily needs to be open source and audited regularly by an independent third party.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-tech">Beyond tech</h2>
<p>As we have seen, there are several strategies to help the general public trying to escape surveillance capitalism. Self-hosting is efficient but doesnât scale well, paid instances of self-hostable software work generally well but are not a silver bullet, and E2EE is very useful to protect privacy but donât provide a full guarantee either.</p>
<p>Ultimately E2EE is a very libertarian approach to a societal issue, taking a âmyself against the worldâ stance. It can be a valid stance, especially for minorities and in hostile contexts. But surveillance capitalism is not a technological problem. It is enabled by technology, but at the very core it is a societal problem.</p>
<p>As Molly White said, âthere are never purely technological solutions to societal problemsâ. To fight surveillance capitalism, we need E2EE, regulation, justice, and education.</p>
<p>We need E2EE to prevent the collection from happening in the first place. We need proper regulation to define what is acceptable or not, which will ultimately define what is a viable business model and what is not. This means that the fines must make it prohibitively unprofitable to sell usersâ data. We need justice and executive bodies to actually enforce the regulation. And we need education for the general public to understand the risks of surveillance capitalism.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> IBM has canceled a program that rewarded inventors at Big Blue for patents or publications, leaving some angry that they are missing out on potential bonuses.</p>
<p>By cancelling the scheme, a source told <em>The Register</em>, IBM has eliminated a financial liability by voiding the accrued, unredeemed credits issued to program participants which could have been converted into potential cash awards.</p>
<p>For years, IBM has sponsored an "Invention Achievement Award Plan" to incentivize employee innovation. In exchange for filing patents, or for publishing articles that served as defense against rival patents, IBM staff were awarded points that led to recognition and potentially cash bonuses.</p>

    

<p>According to documentation seen by <em>The Register</em>, "Invention points are awarded to all inventors listed on a successful disclosure submission."</p>

        


        

<p>One point was awarded for publishing. Three points were awarded for filing a patent or four if the filing was deemed high value. For accruing 12 points, program participants would get a payout.</p>
<p>ï»¿ï»¿"Inventors reach an invention plateau for every 12 points they achieve â which must include at least one file decision," the rules state. And for each plateau achieved, IBM would pay its inventors $1,200 in recognition of their efforts.</p>

        

<p>No longer, it seems. IBM canceled the program at the end of 2023 and replaced it with a new one that uses a different, incompatible point system called BluePoints.</p>
<p>"The previous Invention Achievement Award Plan will be sunset at midnight (eastern time) on December 31st, 2023," company FAQs explain. "Since Plateau awards are one of the items being sunset, plateau levels must be obtained on or before December 31, 2023 to be eligible for the award. Any existing plateau points that have not been applied will not be converted to BluePoints."</p>

</ul>
<p>We're told that IBM's invention review process could take months, meaning that employees just didn't have time between the announcement and the program sunset to pursue the next plateau and cash out.</p>
<p>Those involved in the program evidently were none too pleased by the points grab. And they sought answers from corporate brass through an internal Slack channel.</p>
<p>Citing the revised award scheme, one question read, "Do we allow customers to unilaterally cancel the payment schedule after work has been delivered?"</p>

        

<p>Another read, "Is it reasonable to do this to employees, many of whom worked outside of their regular job to develop IP?"</p>
<p>We're told these represented the most upvoted questions submitted to the CEO's recent monthly Office Hours meeting, but the response was evasive.</p>
<p>IBM did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>A former IBMer reports that a colleague still with Big Blue said, "My opinion...the invention award program was buggered a long time [ago]. It rewarded words on a page instead of true innovation. [Former CEO] Ginni [Rometty] made it worse by advocating the program to fluff up young egos." Â®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Flying Kites Deliver Container-Sized Power Generation" data-elid="2666900303" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/micro-wind-power-kitepower" data-authors="Rahul Rao" data-page-title="Flying Kites Deliver Container-Sized Power Generation - IEEE Spectrum"><p>On average, a humble wind turbine <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-per-energy-source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">uses</a> less land area per megawatt-hour than almost any other power source. Even so, a wind turbine and its tower can sometimes be too cumbersome. </p><p>The still-nascent field of airborne wind energy (AWE) has a solution: Swap out the turbine for a kite on a string. Not only is a kite nimbler than a turbine, it can deliver a more constant energy supply.</p><p>The steady, intense winds some 500 meters above sea level are capable of generating 1800 terawatts: enough to power the entire planet multiple times over. Even an entire flock of Hawks will only tap the lightest touch of that potential power.</p><p>One entrant trying to put AWE to market is the appropriately named <a href="https://thekitepower.com/" target="_blank">Kitepower</a>. This year, the Netherlands-based company will begin shipping its first system: the 40-kilowatt <a href="https://thekitepower.com/kitepower-introduces-self-charging-battery-system-with-new-hawk/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Hawk</a>. Far from replacing traditional turbines, Kitepower hopes the Hawk can power sites that might turn to polluting diesel generators: temporary microgrids, for instance, or remote locations removed from the main grid.</p><p>The Hawkâs kite isnât the kind you ordinarily fly for leisure. Rather, it is a fiberglass skeleton undergirding an inflatable wing, up to 60 square meters surface area. It flies in â<a href="https://thekitepower.com/the-hawk/" target="_blank">pumpingâ cycles</a>: the kite reels out, then the winch reels the kite back in. While the Hawk unfurls, the kite weaves to and fro in a figure-eight pattern, optimal to catch crosswinds. As the winds pull at the kite, they also pull at its tetherâgenerating electricity on the ground. </p><p>After the tether reaches its maximum length, the ground station winches the kite back in. Though the Hawk must expend energy for reel-in, it only expends a fraction of the energy, resulting in a net energy gain that varies by wind speed. An entire cycle takes about 100 seconds: 80 for reel-out and 20 for reel-in. </p><p>Additionally, the Hawk comes attached to a 400 kWh battery: crucial for energy storage, especially in the isolated areas that Kitepower is targeting.</p><p><img alt="A diagram showing the Kitepower system, a diesel generator, solar pv array, solar inverters and a community." data-rm-shortcode-id="ec951a5a498c02191f9fce67fba64cc5" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-the-kitepower-system-a-diesel-generator-solar-pv-array-solar-inverters-and-a-community.jpg?id=51060404&amp;width=980" height="1658" id="bfbea" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-diagram-showing-the-kitepower-system-a-diesel-generator-solar-pv-array-solar-inverters-and-a-community.jpg?id=51060404&amp;width=980" width="2971"><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-774449" placeholder="Add Photo Caption..." spellcheck="false">Kitepower says their airborne wind energy system neatly complements solar and even emergency conventional generators for a full-spectrum approach to off-grid electricity. </small><small data-gramm="false" data-lt-tmp-id="lt-123188" placeholder="Add Photo Credit..." spellcheck="false">Kitepower</small></p><p>âThe power of airborne wind is that you have a much lower material footprint than a wind turbine or solar PV,â says <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/r.schmehl/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Roland Schmehl</a>, Kitepowerâs co-founder and a mechanical engineer at <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/" target="_blank">Technical University Delft</a> in the Netherlands. âThis means a lower environmental footprint, which also means that you could go to areas which are more sensitive.â</p><p>AWE has been slow to take flight.

Makaniâs 600-kilowatt demonstrator, tethered to a floating buoy at sea, attracted significant attention from the public and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c39cdb50-2e91-11e9-8744-e7016697f225" target="_blank">investment from Royal Dutch Shell</a>.

Kitepower is putting a trial version through its final tests at a site on the north coast of Ireland. Getting the Hawk into the air was not easy: Schmehl compares building the Hawk to building an aircraft. âIt was relatively straightforward to make technical demonstrators and to show, for example, how to automatically harvest wind energy,â he says. âBut to do this in a failure-proof way, that nothing breaks and no software bugs occurâ¦that took us a long time.â</p><p>AWEâs potential rewards are immense. Although traditional wind turbines <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/wind-turbines-bigger-better" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">have steadily grown in size</a> over the course of this century, the average turbineâs tower is still only about 100 meters tall. The Hawk can fly as high as 350 meters off the ground. The higher you go in Earthâs lower atmosphere, the stronger and steadier the winds become.</p><p>As of late 2022, the world <a href="https://gwec.net/globalwindreport2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">contained</a> about 900 megawatts of wind power capacity. A 2013 study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate1683.epdf?sharing_token=yKH-kzQKZ1GsYmKLoFgw0tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0P4DlGwJ_WSeU2FSQSapDPd3lSXvKX7Kx2M74_UJq3iEym9lxqtbGj8-EWCduBOgyCMqeNSGZH3xuFKDCmAdRdY7p8yxgGe-7stL3rtB32q7PXBs3Ibm3dJ-w8jauMj142k6U-RxZz4LGfJge4HH7a7DLLZ03d-zps6uKRGJSGGKuPgf0GpCg2bH4HlbzE9JSAMqnVoR7wWYfbwUChVgzb9xJnZ7C0UfIGcaAHK6it6kwQAJLjHm8eINjxhAgi_AMxVszlVC81BfoGpeK6lVh6wt7V7MX9KQVpfdyCaA0KKM4RFJmfYq6ROUgYRGVbKHx8%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=spectrum.ieee.org" target="_self">suggested</a> that the steady, intense winds some 500 meters above sea level are capable of generating 1800 terawatts: enough to power the entire planet multiple times over. Even an entire flock of Hawks will only tap the lightest touch of that potential power. </p><p>But the Hawk is not a substitute for existing wind turbines. Kitepower believes that the Hawk is ideal for temporary events or users removed from the main grid: farms, construction sites, music festivals, humanitarian efforts, island communities. The entire system fits into a standard shipping container, and Kitepower says assembly at a new site takes less than 24 hours.</p><p>Today, these locations might rely on a diesel generatorâwhose logistical demands make the Hawk cost-competitive, according to Schmehl. âYou need to bring the fuelâthat drives the electricity generation prices to very high numbers, depending on the location,â he says. </p><p>The Hawk serves as a proof of concept for Kitepowerâs next goal: a 100-kilowatt AWE system called <a href="https://thekitepower.com/the-falcon/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Falcon</a>. Kitepower plans to put the Falcon on the market in 2025 or 2026. </p><p>Beyond that, Schmehl envisions 500-kilowatt containerized kites, comparable to the output of a modest wind farm with as much as 90 percent less material.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>
<p>This page is aimed at learning from the wisdom of the PostgreSQL community.
</p><p>People involved in the PostgreSQL community, as organizations or individuals, are posting vast amounts of useful information on blogs, wikis, and websites. However, they are scattered, and it will not be easy to find the information you are looking for.
</p><p>Therefore, this page has compiled a collection of links to articles that the editor(s) informative, from hundreds of blog sites registered on Planet PostgreSQL, plus the PostgreSQL wiki and websites. Some notable topics from these articles are picked up here, trying to organize and summarize them for introduction purposes. Please feel free to add links to the articles you find helpful to others. Adding the summaries of them is also appreciated in addition to the links.
</p><p><b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul><li>do not expect everything to be extracted from those articles! Diving directly into the original articles is strongly recommended.</li>
<li>Some configuration parameters, functions, statistics views, and system tables/views may only be available after some major versions. Consult PostgreSQL documentation for availability.</li></ul>

<h2><span id="Architecture">Architecture</span></h2>
<h3><span id="Client-Server_architecture">Client-Server architecture</span></h3>
<ul><li>Server
<ul><li>Database server: postgres</li>
<li>Server application: ex. initdb, pg_ctl, pg_upgrade</li></ul></li>
<li>Client
<ul><li>Client interface: ex. libpq, ECPG, pgJDBC, psqlODBC, Npgsql</li>
<li>Client application: ex. psql, pgbench, pg_dump, pg_restore</li></ul></li>
<li>Frontend/Backend protocol
<ul><li>Frontend=client, Backend=server</li>
<li>message-based protocol for communication between frontends and backends over TCP/IP and Unix-domain sockets</li>
<li>Current version has been 3.0 since PostgreSQL 7.4 in 2003</li></ul></li>
<li>Compatibility between client and server
<ul><li>psql works best with servers of the same or an older major version. It also works with servers of a newer major version, although backslash commands are likely to fail.</li>
<li>pg_dump can dump from servers older than itself (servers back to 9.2. are supported). It cannot dump from servers newer major versions.</li>
<li>Driver is server-version agnostic: Always use the latest driver version</li>
<li>ex. pgJDBC supports 8.2+ server, Npgsql is tested with supported 5 server major versions.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span id="Logical_database_structures">Logical database structures</span></h3>
<ul><li>Database cluster is a collection of databases, roles, and tablespaces</li>
<li>The database cluster initially contains some databases after initdb:
<ul><li>template1: a new database is cloned from this, unless another template database is specified</li>
<li>template0: a pristine copy of the original contents of template1</li>
<li>postgres: default database used by utilities and users</li></ul></li>
<li>Each database contains its own system catalogs that store the metadata of its local database objects</li>
<li>The database cluster contains some shared system catalogs that store the metadata of the cluster-wide global objects
<ul><li>Shared system catalogs can be accessed from inside each database</li>
<li>Query to get shared system catalogs: <code>SELECT relname FROM pg_class WHERE relisshared AND relkind = 'r';</code></li>
<li>ex. pg_authid, pg_database, pg_tablespace</li></ul></li>
<li>Tablespace
<ul><li>pg_global ($PGDATA/global/): store shared system catalogs</li>
<li>pg_default ($PGDATA/base/): store template0, template1, postgres. The default tablespace for other databases.</li>
<li>User tablespaces: created with <code>CREATE TABLESPACE name LOCATION 'dir_path';</code></li></ul></li></ul>

<h3><span id="Object_identifier_(OID)"></span><span id="Object_identifier_.28OID.29">Object identifier (OID)</span></h3>
<ul><li>OIDs are used internally by PostgreSQL as primary keys for various system tables.
<ul><li>ex. <code>SELECT oid, relname FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'mytable';</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Type oid represents an OID.</li>
<li>oid is an unsigned four-byte integer.</li>
<li>An OID is allocated from a single cluster-wide counter, so it is not large enough to provide database-wide uniqueness.
<ul><li>A specific object is identified by two OIDs (classid and objid) in pg_depend and pg_shdepend.</li></ul></li></ul>
<h3><span id="Physical_database_structures">Physical database structures</span></h3>
<p>Directories
</p>
<ul><li>Data directory ($PGDATA)
<ul><li>base/: Subdirectory containing per-database subdirectories</li>
<li>global/: Subdirectory containing cluster-wide tables, such as pg_database</li>
<li>pg_multixact/: Subdirectory containing multitransaction status data (used for shared row locks)</li>
<li>pg_subtrans/: Subdirectory containing subtransaction status data</li>
<li>pg_tblspc/: Subdirectory containing symbolic links to tablespaces</li>
<li>pg_wal/: Subdirectory containing WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files</li>
<li>pg_xact/: Subdirectory containing transaction commit status data</li></ul></li>
<li>Configuration file directories (optional)</li>
<li>Tablespace directories (optional)</li>
<li>WAL directory (optional)</li></ul>
<p>Files in data directory
</p>
<ul><li>Configuration files (postgresql.conf, pg_hba.conf, pg_ident.conf): Can be stored in other directories</li>
<li>Control file (global/pg_control): Stores control info such as the cluster state, checkpoint log location, next OID, next XID</li>
<li>Regular relation data file
<ul><li>A relation is a set of tuples: table, index, sequence, materialized view, etc.</li>
<li>Each relation has its own set of files.</li>
<li>Each file consists of 8 KB blocks.</li>
<li>Lazy allocation: A new heap table file contains 0 blocks, while a new B-tree index file contains 1 block.</li>
<li>There are some types of data files (forks): main, FSM, VM, initialization</li>
<li>Main fork (<code>base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/&lt;relation_filenode_no&gt;</code>)
<ul><li>ex. <code>"SELECT pg_relation_filepath('mytable');"<code> returns </code>base/17354/32185<code>, where 17354 is the database's OID and 32185 is the mytable's filenode number</code></code></li><code><code>
<li>Stores tuple data.</li></code></code></ul></li><code><code>
<li>FSM (free space map) fork (<code>base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/&lt;relation_filenode_no&gt;_fsm</code>)
<ul><li>Keeps track of free space in the relation.</li>
<li>Entries are organized as a tree, where each leaf node entry stores free space in one relation block.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgfreespacemap.html">pg_freespacemap</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pageinspect.html">pageinspect</a> can be used to examine its contents.</li></ul></li>
<li>VM (visibility map) fork (<code>base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/&lt;relation_filenode_no&gt;_vm</code>)
<ul><li>Keeps track of:
<ul><li>which pages contain only tuples that are known to be visible to all active transactions</li>
<li>which pages contain only frozen tuples</li></ul></li>
<li>Each heap relation has a Visibility Map; an index does not have one.</li>
<li>Stores two bits per heap page:
<ul><li>All-visible bit: if set, the page does not contain any tuples that need to be vacuumed. Also used by index-only scans  to answer queries using only the index tuple.</li>
<li>All-frozen bit: if set, all tuples on the page have been frozen, therefore vacuum can skip the page.</li></ul></li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgvisibility.html">pg_visibility</a> can be used to examine its contents.</li></ul></li>
<li>Initialization fork (base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/&lt;relation_filenode_no&gt;_init)
<ul><li>Each unlogged table and index has an initialization fork.</li>
<li>The content is empty: table is 0 block, index is 1 block.</li>
<li>Unlogged relations are reset during recovery: the initialization fork is copied over the main fork, and other forks are erased.</li></ul></li></code></code></ul></li><code><code>
<li>Temporary relation data file
<ul><li><code>base/&lt;database_OID&gt;/tBBB_FFF</code>
<ul><li>BBB is the backend ID of the backend which created the file, and FFF is the filenode number</li>
<li>ex. <code>base/5/t3_16450</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Has main, FSM, and VM forks, but not the initialization fork.</li></ul></li>
<li>A large relation is divided into 1 GB segment files.
<ul><li>e.g., <code>12345, 12345.1, 12345.2, ...</code></li></ul></li></code></code></ul><p><code><code><p>Page (= block)
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Each page is 8 KB. Configurable when building PostgreSQL.</li>
<li>Relations have the same format.</li>
<li>The content is the same in memory and on storage.</li>
<li>Each page stores multiple data values called items. In a table, an item is a row; in an index, an item is an index entry.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pageinspect.html">pageinspect</a> can be used to examine the content.</li>
<li>Layout of a page:
<ol><li>Page header: 24 bytes</li>
<li>An array of item identifiers pointing to the actual items: Each entry is an (offset,length) pair. 4 bytes per item.</li>
<li>Free space</li>
<li>Items</li>
<li>Special space: 0 byte for tables, different bytes for index types (btree, GIN, GiST, etc.)</li></ol></li></ul></code></code><code><code><p>Table row
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pageinspect.html">[1]</a> pageinspect] can be used to examine the content.</li>
<li>Layout of a row

<li>Null bitmap (optional): 1 bit for each column</li>
<li>User data: columns of the row</li></ol></li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="Instance">Instance</span></h3></code></code><code><code><p>The instance is a group of server-side processes, their local memory, and the shared memory.
</p><p>Processes
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Single-threaded: postmaster launches a single backend process for each client connection. Thus, each SQL execution only uses a single CPU core. Parallel query, index build, VACUUM etc. can utilize multiple CPU cores by running multiple server processes.</li>
<li>postmaster: The parent of all server processes. Controls the server startup and shutdown. Create shared memory and semaphores. Launches other server processes and reaps dead ones. Opens and listens on TCP ports and/or Unix domain sockets, accepts connection requests, and spawns client backends to pass the connection requests to.</li>
<li>(Client) backend: Acts on behalf of a client session and handles its requests, i.e., executes SQL commands.</li>
<li>Background processes
<ul><li>logger: Catches all stderr output from other processes through pipes, and writes them to log files.</li>
<li>checkpointer: Handles all checkpoints.</li>
<li>background writer: Periodically wakes up and writes out dirty shared buffers so that other processes don't have to write them when they need to free a shared buffer to read in another page.</li>
<li>startup: Performs crash and point-in-time recovery. Ends as soon as the recovery is complete.</li>
<li>stats collector: Receives messages from other processes through UDP sockets, accumulates statistics about server activity, and writes them to files. The statistics can be viewed with pg_stat... views. This process is gone as of PostgreSQL 15.</li>
<li>walwriter: Periodically wakes up and writes out WAL buffers to reduce the amount of WAL that other processes have to write. Also ensures the writes of commit WAL records from asynchronously committed transactions.</li>
<li>archiver: Archives WAL files.</li>
<li>autovacuum launcher: Always running when autovacuum is enabled. Schedules autovacuum workers to run.</li>
<li>autovacuum worker: Connect to a database as determined in the launcher, examine system catalogs to select the tables, and vacuum them.</li>
<li>parallel worker: Executes part of a parallel query plan.</li>
<li>walreceiver: Runs on the standby server. Receives WAL from the walsender, stores it on disk, and tells the startup process to continue recovery based on it.</li>
<li>walsender: Runs on the primary server. Sends WAL to a single walreceiver.</li>
<li>logical replication launcher: Run on the subscriber. Coordinates  logical replication workers to run.</li>
<li>logical replication worker: Runs on the subscriber. An apply worker per subscription receives logical changes from walsender on the publisher and applies them. One or more tablesync workers perform initial table copy for each table.</li></ul></li>
<li>Background worker: Runs system-supplied or user-supplied code. e.g., used for parallel query and logical replication.</li></ul></code></code><code><code><p>Memory
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Shared memory
<ul><li>Shared buffers: Stores the cached copy of data files (main, FSM, and VM forks).</li>
<li>WAL buffers: Transactions put WAL records here before writing them out to disk.</li>
<li>Other various areas: One large shared memory segment is divided into areas for specific uses.</li>
<li>The allocations of areas can be examined with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-shmem-allocations.html">pg_shmem_allocations</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>Local memory
<ul><li>Work memory: Allocated for a query operation such as sort and hash. Configured with work_mem and hash_mem_multiplier parameters.</li>
<li>Maintenance work memory: Allocated for maintenance operations, such as VACUUM, CREATE INDEX, and ALTER TABLE. Configured with maintenance_work_mem parameter.</li>
<li>Temporary buffers: Allocated for caching temporary table blocks. Configured with temp_buffers parameter.</li>
<li>Other various areas: A memory context is allocated for a specific usage (e.g., a message from client, transaction, query plan, execution state). Hundreds of memory contexts per session are possible.</li>
<li>The allocation and usage of memory contexts can be examined with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-backend-memory-contexts.html">pg_backend_memory_contexts</a> view for the current session, and with the function <code>pg_log_backend_memory_contexts(backend_pid)</code> for other sessions.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="Reading_and_writing_database_data">Reading and writing database data</span></h3></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Read:
<ul><li>First, search the shared buffers for a buffer containing the target block. If found, it's returned to the requester.</li>
<li>Otherwise, allocate a buffer from a free buffer list, and read the target block from the data file into the buffer.</li>
<li>If there's no free buffer, evict and use a used buffer. If it's dirty, writes out the buffer to disk.</li></ul></li>
<li>Write
<ul><li>Find the target shared buffer, modify its contents, and write the changes to the WAL buffers.</li>
<li>The modifying transaction writes out its WAL records from the WAL buffers to disk, including the commit WAL record.</li>
<li>The modified dirty shared buffers are flushed to disk by background writer, checkpointer, or any other process. This is asynchronous with the transaction completion.</li></ul></li>
<li>Any backend can read and write shared buffers, WAL buffers, data and WAL files. Unlike some other DBMSs, writes are not exclusively performed by a particular background process.</li>
<li>The database data file is read and written one block at a time. There's no multiblock I/O.</li>
<li>Some operations bypass shared buffers: the write of an index during index creation, CREATE DATABASE, ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE</li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="Query_processing">Query processing</span></h3></code></code><code><code><ol><li>A client connects to a database, sends a query (SQL command) to the server, and receives the result.</li>
<li>The parser first checks the query for correct syntax. Then, it interprets the semantics of the query to understand which tables, views, functions, data types, etc. are referenced.</li>
<li>The rewrite system (rewriter) transforms the query based on the rules stored in the system catalog pg_rewrite. One example is the view: a query that accesses a view is rewritten to use the base table.</li>
<li>The planner/optimizer creates a query plan.</li>
<li>The executor executes the query plan and returns the result set to the client.</li></ol></code></code><code><code><p>Notes
</p></code></code><code><code><ul><li>Each session runs on a connection to a single database. Therefore, it cannot access tables on a different database. However, one session can connect to another database and create another session via a foreign data wrapper like postgres_fdw, and access tables there. For example, an SQL command can join one table on the local database and another table on a remote database.</li>
<li>Each SQL command basically uses only one CPU core. A parallel query and some utility commands such as CREATE INDEX and VACUUM can use multiple CPU cores by running background workers.</li></ul></code></code><code><code><h3><span id="References">References</span></h3></code></code><code><code><p>PostgreSQL Documentation

<li>Terminating a connection (<code>pg_terminate_backend()</code>) and canceling a query (<code>pg_cancel_backend()</code>) does not always work.

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Crash recovery, archive recovery (Point-In-Time-Recovery: PITR), and replication</li>
<li>Updates are redone regardless of whether the transaction was committed.</li>
<li>There is no undo log (before image) or operation, unlike other popular DBMSs.
<ul><li>Therefore, transaction rollback and crash recovery is fast.</li>
<li>Changes by an aborted transaction are left in memory and on disk, but they are invisible to other transactions thanks to MVCC.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>WAL structure
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A sequence of 8 KB blocks.</li>
<li>Each block can contain multiple WAL records. Also, each WAL record can span multiple blocks.</li>
<li>The content is the same both in memory and on storage.</li>
<li>The WAL buffer is a contiguous array of blocks in memory. It's used in a circular fashion.</li>
<li>The WAL on storage is divided into WAL segment files. Each WAL segment file is 16 MB by default, which is configurable with <code>initdb</code>'s <code>--wal-segsize=size</code>.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Writing WAL
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>In memory, modify the data pages in shared buffers, and then write the change into the WAL buffer.</li>
<li>WAL buffer is always written to WAL files sequentially (no random write).</li>
<li>Before writing a dirty data page in a shared buffer out to disk, first all WAL records up to the latest one that affected the data page. This rule is the WAL (Write Ahead Log).
<ul><li>Each data page has, in its page header, the location (LSN) of the WAL record that represents the latest update to it. This is the page LSN.</li>
<li>LSN (Log Sequence Number): an unsigned 8-byte integer. It represents the WAL segment, block, and an offset in that block.</li></ul></li>
<li>If writing to the WAL file fails, the instance will crash with a PANIC message.</li>
<li>WAL volume can grow beyond max_wal_size due to the reasons such as:
<ul><li>Heavy writes like loading data with COPY</li>
<li>failure to archive WAL files</li>
<li>the large value of wal_keep_size</li>
<li>an unused replication slot</li></ul></li>
<li>SELECT can modify data pages and write WAL when:
<ul><li>acquiring row locks, e.g., SELECT FOR UPDATE. They set xmax in the tuple header, and could possibly update MultiXact data structures.</li>
<li>pruning line pointers and defragmenting the page.</li>
<li>setting hint bits to tuple headers. WAL is emitted when page checksums are enabled.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Transaction">Transaction</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>ACID: what they are attributed to
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Atomicity: transaction rollback and database recovery</li>
<li>Consistency: integrity constraints and triggers, such as non-NULL, check, primary key/unique/foreign key constraints</li>
<li>Isolation: MVCC and locks</li>
<li>Durability: WAL</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Transaction ID (XID)
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A transaction is assigned an XID when it first modifies data, such as in INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELET FOR SHARE/UPDATE.
<ul><li>XID assignments are serialized with XidGen LWLock.</li>
<li>XID assignment is usually very fast, but it might sometimes experience hiccups. It allocates and zeros a new commit log (clog) page through SLRU cache every 32K transactions. That clog page allocation could possibly flush a dirty page for page replacement.</li>
<li>This could cause an unpredictable spike of response time.</li></ul></li>
<li>Read-only transactions do not assign an XID. They are free from the LWLock contention for assigning a new XID.</li>
<li>XIDs are stored in tuple headers and visible as xmin and xmax system columns (<code>SELECT xmin, xmax, * FROM mytable</code>).
<ul><li>xmin is the XID of a transaction that created the tuple (INSERT, UPDATE, COPY).</li>
<li>xmax is the XID of a transaction that either:
<ul><li>deleted the tuple (DELETE, UPDATE).</li>
<li>locked the tuple (e.g., SELECT FOR SHARE/UPDATE)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Special XID values
<ul><li>0: invalid XID</li>
<li>1: bootstrap XID. Used by bootstrap processing during initdb.</li>
<li>2: Frozen XID: Recent versions of PostgreSQL only use this for sequence tuples, not for tables.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>MVCC: Multi-Version Concurrency Control
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>The major advantage of MVCC is "reading never blocks writing and writing never blocks reading." i.e., UPDATE/DELETE and SELECT on the same row do not block each other.
<ul><li>Writes to the same row block each other.</li>
<li>In the traditional lock-based concurrency control, read and write on the same row conflict.</li></ul></li>
<li>How it works overall:
<ul><li>Insert and update to a row create a new version of the row. Update leaves the old row version for other running transactions. (Multi-version)</li>
<li>XID of the creating transaction is set to xmin field in the new row version.</li>
<li>The new row version is only visible to its creating transaction until it commits.</li>
<li>Once the creating transaction commits, all new subsequent transactions will be able to see the new row version. Other existing transactions continue to see the old row version. The old row version is a "dead tuple" now.</li>
<li>Delete to a row does not remove the row version. It sets the XID of the deleting transaction to xmax field in the row version.</li>
<li>The deleted row version is only invisible to its deleting transaction until it commits.</li>
<li>Once the deleting transaction commits, all new subsequent transactions won't be able to see the row version. Other existing transactions continue to see the row version. The row version is a "dead tuple" now.</li>
<li>Finally, when there are no transactions remaining that can see the dead tuple, vacuum removes it.</li></ul></li>
<li>How tuple visibility works:
<ul><li>Each transaction uses its own snapshot, commit log (clog), and the xmin and/or xmax in the target tuple header, to determine whether it can see a given row version.</li>
<li>What snapshot is:
<ul><li>A picture of what transactions are running at a certain point of time.</li>
<li>You can run "<code>SELECT pg_current_snapshot();</code>" to see the snapshot of the current transaction.</li>
<li>The snapshot's textual representation is xmin:xmax:xip_list. e.g., 10:20:10,14,15.</li>
<li>xmin: Lowest transaction ID that was still active. All transaction IDs less than xmin are either committed and visible, or rolled back and dead.</li>
<li>xmax: One past the highest completed transaction ID. All transaction IDs greater than or equal to xmax had not yet completed as of the time of the snapshot, and thus are invisible.</li>
<li>xip_list: Transactions in progress at the time of the snapshot. A transaction ID that is xmin &lt;= X &lt; xmax and not in this list was already completed at the time of the snapshot, and thus is either visible or dead according to its commit status.</li>
<li>In a READ COMMITTED transaction, a snapshot is taken at the beginning of every SQL statement.</li>
<li>In a REPEATABLE READ or SERIALIZABLE transaction, a snapshot is obtained at the start of the first SQL statement and used throughout the transaction.</li></ul></li>
<li>What commit log (clog) is:
<ul><li>An array of bits representing the transaction status.</li>
<li>Two bits are used to indicate a transaction's outcome: IN PROGRESS, COMMITTED, ABORTED, SUBCOMMITTED.</li>
<li>Stored in a set of files in $PGDATA/pg_xact/.</li>
<li>Cached in memory buffers of 128 8 KB pages.</li></ul></li>
<li>Clog is consulted when the snapshot shows that the target transaction has been completed.</li>
<li>Based on the snapshot and clog, the change by a committed transaction is visible, and that by an aborted or running transaction is invisible.</li>
<li>The actual tuple visibility is much more complex...</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Hint bit
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Hint bits are the bits in the tuple header's infomask field that help determine tuple visibility.</li>
<li>They are for performance optimization. Not essential to data correctness.</li>
<li>They represent whether the transaction indicated by xmin or xmax was committed or aborted. There are four flag bits:
<ol><li><code>HEAP_XMIN_COMMITTED</code>: xmin transaction was committed</li>
<li><code>HEAP_XMIN_INVALID</code>: xmin transaction was aborted</li>
<li><code>HEAP_XMAX_COMMITTED</code>: xmax transaction was committed</li>
<li><code>HEAP_XMAX_INVALID</code>: xmax transaction was aborted</li></ol></li>
<li>How hint bits are used:
<ol><li>A transaction checks the hint bits to see if the xmin and/or xmax transaction was committed or aborted.</li>
<li>If the hint bits are set, done.</li>
<li>Otherwise, examine the commit log ($PGDATA/pg_xact/), and possibly the subtransaction hierarchy ($PGDATA/pg_subtrans/) to determine the transaction outcome. This is an expensive operation.</li>
<li>Set the hint bits. They will be persisted to disk later.</li></ol></li>
<li>Setting hint bits writes a data page, and can also write WAL if page checksums are enabled.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Lock">Lock</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>A lock request can wait, even when the requested mode is compatible with held locks.
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Q: Do you think Transaction 3 goes on to run the query?
<ol><li>Transaction 1: A long-running <code>SELECT</code> is still running against mytable.</li>
<li>Transaction 2: Run "<code>ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN new_col int;</code>". Get blocked because ALTER TABLE's Access Exclusive lock request conflicts with the Access Share lock held by Transaction 1's <code>SELECT</code>.</li>
<li>Transaction 3: Run a short <code>SELECT</code> query against mytable.</li></ol></li>
<li>A: Transaction 3 waits until Transaction 2 completes, because Transaction 2 came earlier and is waiting.</li>
<li>Later requestors respect earlier waiters in the wait queue and do not overtake them. Otherwise, earlier requestors might wait for an unduly long time.</li>
<li>Therefore, execute even the DDL that is expected to run fast:
<ul><li>during off-peak hours, and/or</li>
<li>with a lock timeout. e.g., run "<code>SET lock_timeout = '5s';</code>" before the DDL. Retry the DDL if it times out.</li></ul></li>

<li>Not designed to detect memory errors.</li>
<li>Enabled at the full cluster level, either with <code>initdb</code>'s -k/--data-checksums or with <code>pg_checksums</code> while the database server is shut down. Disabled by default due to its performance overhead.</li>
<li>Run <code>"SHOW data_checksums"</code> to know if data checksums are enabled. It returns on or off.</li></ul></li>
<li>How it works
<ul><li>The checksum is calculated from the page content and set when the data page is about to be written out to disk.</li>
<li>Just after reading the page from disk, the checksum is verified by comparing the value set in the page header and the newly calculated value.</li>
<li>If the verification fails, a WARNING and ERROR messages are emitted, resulting in a query failure.</li>

<li>SQL Dump with pg_dump/pg_dumpall (text format)</li>
<li>Continuous archiving (binary format)</li></ol></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Characteristics of backup and recovery methods
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>SQL dump and continuous archiving can be performed online. The file system level backup requires the database server to be shut down.</li>
<li>SQL dump can selectively back up and restore individual tables. The other methods cannot back up or restore only certain individual tables or tablespaces.</li>
<li>The SQL dump will typically be smaller, because the SQL script needs to contain just the index creation command, not the index data.</li>
<li>The SQL dump can be loaded into a database of a newer major version.</li>
<li>The SQL dump can transfer a database to a different machine architecture, such as going from a 32-bit to a 64-bit server.</li>
<li>Continuous archiving can perform PITR. The database cluster can be recovered up-to-date or to a certain point of time.</li>
<li>Dumps created by pg_dump are consistent; the dump of each database is a snapshot of the database when pg_dump started. pg_dumpall calls pg_dump for each database in turn, so the database cluster-wide consistency is not guaranteed.</li>
<li>pg_dump dumps all data in a database within a single transaction, issuing many SELECT commands. That long-running transaction could:
<ul><li>block other operations that require strong lock modes, such as ALTER TABLE, TRUNCATE, CLUSTER, REINDEX.</li>
<li>cause table and index bloat, because vacuum cannot remove dead tuples.</li></ul></li>
<li><code>pg_backup_start()</code> and <code>pg_basebackup</code> of continuous archiving performs a checkpoint at the beginning. The user can choose the checkpoint speed between "fast" and "spread".</li>
<li>Archive recovery, as well as crash recovery, empties the content of unlogged relations. SQL dump outputs the contents of unlogged tables.</li>
<li>pg_dumpall's --no-role-passwords option uses pg_roles instead of pg_authid to dump database roles. This allows the use of pg_dumpall in restricted environments like DBaaS where users are not permitted to read pg_authid to protect passwords. The restored roles will have NULL passwords.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Streaming_replication">Streaming replication</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Architecture
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Topology
<ul><li>Only the entire database cluster is replicated. Partial replication is not possible.</li>
<li>One primary server replicates to one or more standby servers.</li>
<li>Each standby replicates from one primary.</li>
<li>The standby can cascade changes to other standbys.</li>
<li>The primary is unaware of the locations of standbys. The standby connects to the primary specified by primary_conninfo parameter.
<ul><li>ex. <code>primary_conninfo = 'host=192.168.1.50 port=5432 user=foo password=foopass'</code></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Primary and standby versions
<ul><li>Different major versions don't work.</li>
<li>Different minor versions will work because the disk format is the same, but no formal support is offered. It's advised to keep primary and standby servers at the same minor version.</li>
<li>It's safest to update the standby servers first during minor version upgrade.</li></ul></li>
<li>Processes and data flow
<ul><li>At server startup, the standby first reads and applies WAL from archive, next from $PGDATA/pg_wal/, and then launches one walreceiver, which connects to the primary and streams WAL from there. If the replication connection is terminated, it repeats this cycle at 5 second intervals, which can be configured by wal_retrieve_retry_interval.</li>
<li>The primary spawns the walsender when it accepts the connection request from walreceiver.</li>
<li>walsender reads and sends WAL to the walreceiver.</li>
<li>walreceiver writes and flushes the streamed WAL to $PGDATA/pg_wal/, and notifies the startup process.</li>
<li>A single startup process reads and applies the WAL.</li>
<li>walreceiver periodically notifies the walsender of replication progress -- how far it has written, flushed, and applied the WAL.</li>
<li>A cascading standby has walsenders as well as a walreceiver running.</li></ul></li>
<li>Replication user
<ul><li>The replication user needs REPLICATION role attribute.</li>
<li>REPLICATION enables the user to read all data for replication, but not for consumption by SELECT queries.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>General administration
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>The standby is read-only. Any object, including roles, cannot be created only on the standby.</li>
<li>max_wal_senders should be slightly higher than the number of standby servers, so that the standby can accept connections after a temporary unexpected disconnection while the disconnected walsender still remains.</li>
<li>Backups can be taken on the standby.</li>
<li>archive_timeout is not required to reduce the data loss window.</li>
<li>Cascading replication reduces the load on the primary.</li>
<li>WAL on the primary
<ul><li>Without any measure, the primary does not care about the standby and remove/recycle old WAL files that the standby still need.</li>
<li>If the standby requests WAL that has already been removed, the primary emits a message like <code>"ERROR: requested WAL segment 000000020000000300000041 has already been removed"</code>.</li>
<li>To make the primary preserve WAL files, either use a replication slot (preferred) or set keep_wal_size (old method).</li>
<li>max_slot_wal_keep_size caps the WAL volume preserved by the replication slot.</li></ul></li>
<li>Synchronous replication
<ul><li>The transaction hangs during its commit if no synchronous standby is available.</li>
<li>To resume the hanging transaction, remove synchronous_standby_names setting and reload the configuration. That makes the replication asynchronous.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Causes of replication lag

<ul><li>Set wal_compression = on to reduce the amount of WAL.</li></ul></li>
<li>Retrieving WAL from slow archive: The standby could not get WAL from the primary, so it has to fetch it from the WAL archive.</li>
<li>Recovery conflicts: The replay of some operations can be blocked by queries running on the standby.

</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>When running SELECT, psql retrieves the entire result set and stores all rows in the client memory.</li>
<li>With the FETCH_COUNT variable like <code>"psql -v FETCH_COUNT=100 ..."</code>, psql uses a cursor and issues DECLARE, FETCH, and CLOSE to retrieve the result set piecemeal.</li>
<li>Client drivers have similar facility, such as psqlODBC's UseDeclareFetch and PgJDBC's defaultRowFetchSize connection parameter.</li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Common causes of server-side out of memory (OOM) issues
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A high number of connections
<ul><li>Even idle connections could continue to hold much memory. PostgreSQL keeps database object metadata in memory during the session. This is for performance. You can notice this by bloated CacheMemoryContext.</li>
<li>If connection pooling is used, many connections may consume large amounts of memory over time. This is because connections are picked up randomly from the pool, used to access some relations, and released back to the pool, which results in many sessions accumulating the meta data of many relations.</li></ul></li>
<li>A high value of work_mem
<ul><li>It's advised not to set a high value to work_mem at an instance level (postgresql.conf) or a database level (ALTER DATABASE). Many sessions could allocate that amount of memory simultaneously. What's worse, each SQL statement could run such sort and/or hash operations in parallel, each of which can allocate as much memory as work_mem.</li>
<li>For a hash-based operation, work_mem * hash_mem_multiplier bytes of work memory will be allocated at maximum.</li></ul></li>
<li>Low max_locks_per_transaction
<ul><li>Each lockable object (e.g., table, index, sequence, XID, but not row) is allocated an entry in the lock table when it's locked. The entry represents the lockable object, grantees, waiters, and granted/requested lock modes.</li>
<li>The lock table is allocated in shared memory. Its size is fixed at server startup.</li>
<li>The default value of max_locks_per_transaction is 64. This means that each transaction is expected to lock 64 or fewer objects.</li>
<li>The number of entries in the lock table is (max_connections + max_prepared_transactions + alpha) * max_locks_per_transaction.</li>
<li>One transaction can use more than max_locks_per_transaction entries, if those are available.</li>
<li>If each of many concurrent transactions may access more objects, say, touch hundreds or thousands of partitions, increase max_locks_per_transaction.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Cannot retrieve a large bytea value
</p></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>For example, after successfully inserting 550 MB of bytea column value, fetching it fails with  an error message like <code>"invalid memory aloc request size 1277232195"</code>.</li>
<li>Why?
<ul><li>When the PostgreSQL server sends query results to the client, it either converts the data to text format or returns it in binary format.</li>
<li>psql and client drivers instruct the server to use text format.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-binary.html">PostgreSQL uses either hex or escape format</a> when it converts bytea data to text format. The default format is hex. hex and escape formats use 2 and 4 bytes respectively to represent each original byte in text format.
<ul><li>ex. <code>SELECT 'abc'::bytea;</code> returns <code>\x616263</code></li></ul></li>
<li>The PostgreSQL server allocates one contiguous memory area to convert each column value to text format. This allocation size is limited to 1 GB - 1. That restriction has something to do with the handling of variable-length data types in TOAST.</li>
<li>Due to this limitation, PostgreSQL cannot return bytea data over 500 MB in text format.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Storage">Storage</span></h3></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><p>Common causes of full storage

<ul><li>The tablespace of a database/table can be specified explicitly by <code>CREATE/ALTER DATABASE/TABLE ... TABLESPACE, or implicitly by the default_tablespace parameter.</code></li><code>
<li>temp_tablespaces can be used to specify where temporary files are created for temporary tables/indexes and sort/hash operations.</li>

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ol><li>Starts a transaction.
<ul><li>When there are multiple target relations, vacuum starts and commits a transaction for each relation to release locks as soon as possible.</li></ul></li>
<li>Gets an Share Update Exclusive lock for a heap and opens it. Non-wrap-around-prevention vacuum gives up vacuuming the relation if the relation cannot get the lock, emitting the following message.
<ul><li><code>LOG:  skipping of vacuum "rel_name" --- lock not available</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Gets Row Exclusive locks for the indexes and opens them.</li>
<li>Allocates the work memory to accumulate the TIDs of dead tuples.</li>
<li>Repeats the following steps until the entire heap has been processed:
<ul><li>Scans the heap: Accumulates dead tuple TIDs in the work memory until it gets full or the end of the heap is reached. The item IDs for the dead tuples are retained. Also, prunes and defragments each page if required, and possibly freezes live tuples.</li>
<li>Vacuums the indexes: Delete index entries that contain dead tuple TIDs.</li>
<li>Vacuums the heap: Reclaims the item IDs for the dead tuples. This is done here, not while scanning the heap, because the item ID cannot be freed until the index entries pointing to it have been deleted.</li>
<li>Updates the FSM and VM during the above processing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Cleans up the indexes.
<ul><li>Updates every index's stats in pg_class's relpages and reltuples.</li>
<li>Closes the indexes but retains their locks until transaction end.</li></ul></li>
<li>Truncate the heap so as to return empty pages at the end of the relation to the operating system.
<ul><li>The data file is truncated if the heap has at least the lesser of 1,000 blocks and (relation_size / 16) contiguous empty blocks at its end.</li>
<li>Takes an Access Exclusive lock on the heap. If another transaction holds a conflicting lock, wait for at most 5 seconds. If the lock cannot be obtained, gives up truncating.</li>
<li>Scans backwards the heap to verify that the end pages are still empty. Periodically checks if another transaction is waiting for a conflicting lock. If someone else is waiting, releases the Access Exclusive lock and gives up truncating.</li></ul></li>
<li>Updates relation stats.
<ul><li>Updates pg_class's relpages, reltuples, relallvisible, relhasindex, relhasrules, relhastriggers, relfrozenxid, and relminmxid.</li></ul></li>
<li>Close the relation.</li>
<li>Commits a transaction.</li>
<li>Vacuums the relation's TOAST table.</li>
<li>Repeats the above processing for each relation.</li>
<li>Updates database stats.
<ul><li>Updates pg_database.datfrozenxid to be the minimum of pg_class.relfrozenxid values, and truncates commit log in pg_xact/.</li>
<li>Updates pg_database.datminmxid to be the minimum of pg_class.relminmxid values, and truncates MultiXact data in pg_multixact/.</li></ul></li></ol></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Autovacuum is designed to be non-intrusive
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Autovacuum takes a rest (sleep) every time it has done a certain amount of work. Therefore, it does not continuously consume resources.
<ul><li>"A certain amount of work" and the sleep time can be configured by autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit and autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay respectively. autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay is 2 ms by default.</li></ul></li>
<li>Autovacuum skips the relation if it cannot get a lock on it due to some conflicting lock. Wrap-around-prevention autovacuum does not do this.</li>
<li>A concurrent transaction cancels non-aggressive autovacuum, if it has waited on a conflicting relation lock for deadlock_timeout seconds and found out that the lock is held by autovacuum. These messages can be seen:
<ul><li><code>ERROR:  canceling autovacuum task</code></li>
<li><code>DETAIL:  automatic vacuum of table "mytable"</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Vacuum skips reading data pages if VM shows that they have only tuples visible to all transactions (all-visible bit is set in VM). Aggressive vacuum reads even such pages to freeze tuples.</li>
<li>Vacuum skips reading data pages if VM shows that they have only frozen tuples (all-frozen bit is set in VM).</li>
<li>Autovacuum performs reduced work on a data page when it cannot get an exclusive LWLock on it. Autovacuum for wrap-around does not do this.</li>
<li>Vacuum gives up truncating the relation if another transaction holds or is waiting for a lock on the target relation.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Autovacuum is not run against a relation
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Check the following to see if that is the case.
<ul><li>last_autovacuum and autovacuum_count columns of pg_stat_all_tables</li>
<li>Server logs after setting log_autovacuum_min_duration to 0</li></ul></li>
<li>Common reasons
<ul><li>The relation has to be eligible for autovacuum.
<ul><li>UPDATE/DELETE-mostly relations: updated/deleted tuples &gt;= autovacuum_vacuum_threshold + autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor * pg_class.reltuples</li>
<li>INSERT-mostly relations: inserted tuples &gt;= autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold + autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor * pg_class.reltuples</li></ul></li>
<li>Autovacuum workers are busy with other many and/or large relations.</li>
<li>Some transactions continuously request or hold a conflicting relation lock for long. Non-wrap-around-prevention vacuum gives up such a relation.</li>
<li>Autovacuum cannot vacuum temporary tables. Manual vacuum needs to be run. This might lead to XID wrap-around and database shutdown.</li>
<li>Statistics stored in pg_stat/ were lost due to crash or archive recovery, including failover. Those statistics are always reset during recovery. Autovacuum depends on the statistics, which can be seen via pg_stat_all_tables, to determine if vacuuming is needed.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Why vacuum does not remove dead tuples

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Reduce XID consumption.
<ul><li>Each subtransaction allocates its own XID. A subtransaction is started by SAVEPOINT and PL/pgSQL's exception block (BEGIN ... EXCEPTION).</li>
<li>Some client drivers offer statement-level rollback. It encloses each SQL statement with SAVEPOINT and RELEASE SAVEPOINT.</li></ul></li>
<li>Make autovacuum run smoothly (see above).</li>
<li>Lower autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor (PostgreSQL 13+) or autovacuum_freeze_max_age so that autovacuum processes the table more frequently.</li>
<li>Schedule regular VACUUM FREEZE runs.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Configuration to speed up autovacuum

<li>Decrease autovacuum_naptime
<ul><li>Even 1s is practical if the write workload is heavy and the host has many CPU cores.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase autovacuum_max_workers
<ul><li>Effective when there are many relations. Each relation is handled by only one autovacuum worker.</li>
<li>Increase autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit as well. Otherwise, each autovacuum worker would sleep more frequently, because cost limits are shared among all active autovacuum workers.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase maintenance_work_mem/autovacuum_work_mem
<ul><li>The work memory stores an array of dead tuple TIDs. A TID is (block no, item no), which is 6 bytes.</li>
<li>Setting a large value reduces the number of index scans.</li>
<li>The maximum allocated size is 1 GB - 1 no matter how large the parameter values are.</li>
<li>Does not always allocate the specified size. The actual size is large enough to accommodate all possible TIDs, so it will be small for small tables.</li>
<li>For a table with no index, only less than 2 KB is allocated. Vacuum only accumulates TIDs for one table block because it does not need to scan indexes.</li></ul></li>
<li>Increase vacuum_buffer_usage_limit
<ul><li>Vacuum uses 256 KB of ring buffers by default to cache data pages, so that it does not evict pages that are likely to be used by applications.</li>
<li>Vacuum also benefits from caching pages: heap pages are read twice, and index pages may possibly be read more than once.</li>
<li>Setting this to 0 allows vacuum to use shared buffers without limit.</li></ul></li>
<li>Decrease autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay, increase autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit
<ul><li>Setting autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay to 0, which keeps autovacuum running like the manual vacuum.</li></ul></li>
<li>Partition a large table so that multiple autovacuum workers can work on its partitions concurrently.</li>

<li>Running the latest minor version is always recommended. The community considers not upgrading to be riskier than upgrading.</li>
<li>Released at least once every three months, the second Thursday of February, May, August, November. Additional minor versions may be released to address urgent issues.</li>
<li>The upgrade can skip intervening minor versions.</li>
<li>Does not normally require a dump and restore; you can stop the database server, install the updated binaries, and restart the server.</li>
<li>Additional manual steps may be required for some minor versions to remedy the bad effects of fixed bugs, such as rebuilding affected indexes.

<li>Not an in-place upgrade: migrates data from an old database cluster to a new database cluster freshly created with initdb.</li>
<li>The basic idea is that because the relation data storage format rarely changes and only the layout of system catalogs change, pg_upgrade just dumps and restores the database schema and uses relation data files as-is.</li>
<li>Upgrade from 9.2 and later is supported.</li>
<li>Downgrade is not possible.</li>
<li>Does not migrate database statistics in pg_statistic. The user needs to run ANALYZE in every database after pg_upgrade completes.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Main steps of pg_upgrade

<li>Gets the list of library names that contain C-language functions.</li>
<li>Performs various checks to find blockers of upgrade, such as the inability to connect to databases and the presence of prepared transactions.</li>
<li>Creates a dump of global objects by running <code>pg_dumpall --globals-only</code>.</li>
<li>Creates dumps of each database by running <code>pg_dump --schema-only</code>. This is parallelized by spawning one process or thread for each database when --jobs is specified.</li>
<li>Checks the previously extracted loadable libraries with C-language functions exist in the new cluster by running <code>LOAD</code>.</li>
<li>Copies commit log files in pg_xact/ and MultiXact files in pg_multixact/ from the old cluster to the new cluster.</li>
<li>Sets next XID and MultiXact ID for the new cluster to take over the old cluster.</li>
<li>Restores global objects in the new cluster by running <code>psql</code>.</li>

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li><b>Do not use large objects.</b> They can be problematic. Use bytea columns or external file storage such as an OS file system and object storage.</li>
<li>Removing lots of LOBs
<ul><li>Trying to remove many large objects within a single transaction, e.g., <code>"SELECT lo_unlink(lo_oid) FROM mytable;"</code> can fail with the following message:
<ul><li><code>ERROR:  out of shared memory</code></li>
<li><code>HINT:  You might need to increase max_locks_per_transaction.</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Cause: When a large object is deleted, it is locked with Access Exclusive mode. Therefore, as many entries as the deleted LOBs are required in the lock table.</li>
<li>Solutions: Do either or both of:
<ul><li>Increase max_locks_per_transaction. The database server has to be restarted.</li>
<li>Delete LOBs in chunks, e.g., 100 LOBs per transaction.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Dealing with orphaned LOBs
<ul><li>An orphaned LOB is a large object whose OID does not appear in any oid or lo data column of the database.</li>
<li>Such an orphaned LOB would result if the application fails to delete it by calling lo_unlink() when it deletes the associated table row.
<ul><li>Solutions: Do both of:</li>
<li>Use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/vacuumlo.html">vacuumlo</a> to delete orphaned LOBs.</li>
<li>Use <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/lo.htmllo">extension</a> and set a trigger on the LOB column. It automatically calls lo_unlink() when the table row containing the LOB OID is updated or deleted.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Sequence">Sequence</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>There is no gapless sequence
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A sequence produces gaps when:
<ul><li>The transaction rolls back: Because nextval() and setval() calls are never rolled back, allocated sequence values are not reclaimed.</li>
<li>Cached values are unused: If the caching is enabled for a sequence, nextval() preallocates the specified number of values and caches them in the session's local memory. Subsequent nextval() calls fetch values from the cache until the cache is empty, and then preallocate some values again. So, if the session ends without using all the cached values, those will be gaps.</li>
<li>The server crashes: Even with a NO CACHE sequence, you can see a gap in these steps: nextval() -&gt; crash recovery -&gt; nextval(). For performance, PostgreSQL does not WAL-log every fetching of a value from a sequence. nextval() WAL-logs a value 32 numbers ahead of the current value, and the next 32 calls to nextval() donât WAL-log anything. As a result, some numbers appear to be skipped.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="References_5">References</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>PostgreSQL Documentation

Later, when the pending-list area becomes full, those pending-list entries are moved to the main index structure.</li>
<li>This is for good performance, because inserting one document involves many insertions into the main index, depending on the number of words in the document.</li>

<li><code>HINT:  This error usually means that PostgreSQL's request for a shared memory segment exceeded available memory, swap space, or huge pages. To reduce the request size (currently 1234567890 bytes), reduce PostgreSQL's shared memory usage, perhaps by reducing shared_buffers or max_connections.</code></li></ul></li>
<li>In this case, reboot the OS or perform failover.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Tips for shared buffers
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Avoid disk writes by client backends.
<ul><li>If there is no free shared buffer when the server process wants a new page, it has to evict a used buffer. If the evicted page is dirty, the server process needs to write the page to disk. This adds to the response time.</li>
<li>This undesirable situation can be detected by checking that the buffers_backend in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-BGWRITER-VIEW">pg_stat_bgwriter</a> is high. If buffers_backend_fsync is also high, the situation is worse.</li>
<li>To alleviate this:
<ul><li>Make more free buffers: increase shared_buffers.</li>
<li>Make more clean buffers: increase bgwriter_lru_multiplier so that the background writer writes dirty buffers more aggressively. If the maxwritten_clean of pg_stat_bgwriter rises frequently, try increasing bgwriter_lru_maxpages.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Large shared buffers may be counterproductive.
<ul><li>The benefits of shared buffers is diminished on a host with high-performance storage.</li>
<li>That's because PostgreSQL uses the OS's filesystem cache: the data is cached in the filesystem cache as well as in shared buffers (double buffering).</li>
<li>Therefore, start with 25% of RAM for shared buffers, and then increase it up to around 40% as long as you can see some improvement.</li>
<li>However, some benchmark demonstrated that 64 GB or more can do harm.</li></ul></li>
<li>Leverage <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgprewarm.html">pg_prewarm</a> to quickly regain performance after failover.
<ul><li>After the database server restart or failover, the contents of shared buffers is empty or can be quite different from what was before the failover. Thus, application response times get worse until the shared buffers are warmed up.</li>
<li>Add pg_prewarm in shared_preload_libraries, and set pg_prewarm.autoprewarm to on.</li>
<li>This launches the autoprewarm worker, which periodically saves in a file the list of relation and block numbers cached in shared buffers. At server startup, pg_prewarm worker reads the file to refill shared buffers.</li></ul></li>
<li><code>"SELECT * FROM some_table;"</code> does not necessarily cache the entire table.
<ul><li>You may want to do this for performance test or application warmup, but it doesn't work. Also, it does not cache indexes at all.</li>
<li>If the size of a relation is larger than a quarter of shared buffers, its sequential scan only uses 256 KB of shared buffers.</li>
<li>The idea behind this is that a page that has been touched only by such a scan is unlikely to be needed again soon, so PostgreSQL tries to prevent such large sequential scans from evicting many useful pages out of the shared buffers.</li>
<li>Likewise, bulk writes, e.g., COPY FROM and CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, use only 16 MB of shared buffers.</li>
<li>To cache the entire relation, run <code>SELECT pg_prewarm('relation_name')</code>. This works for indexes as well.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Tips for local memory

<ul><li>Unfortunately, there is no easy way to estimate a work_mem setting to avoid disk spilling.</li>
<li>The temporary file that log_temp_files shows is not sufficient. Additional overhead for buffering temporary data in memory must be included.</li>
<li>One way to estimate work_mem is to multiply the width and number of plan rows that are sorted or hashed, found in the query plan. Add some extra for overhead, say, further multiply it by 1.1 or so.</li>
<li>If parallel query is used, divide the result by (number of parallel workers used + 1). "+1" is for the parallel leader process.</li>
<li>Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see if external file is used. Try increasing work_mem until the use of external file disappears.</li></ul></li>
<li>effective_cache_size does not allocate any memory.
<ul><li>This is only used to estimate the costs of index scans. The planner assumes this amount of memory is available for caching query data.</li>

<li>Large column values of TOAST-able data types are compressed and/or broken up into chunks. Each chunk is stored as a separate row in the table's associated TOAST table. The chunk size is chosen so that four chunk rows will fit on a page. That is about 2,000 bytes for 8 KB page size.</li>
<li>A TOAST-able data type is the one which has a variable-length (varlena) representation. That is, a 1 or 4 byte varlena header followed by the column value. char(n) seems like fixed-length, but it has a varlena format.</li>
<li>TOAST table
<ul><li>Each table has 0 or 1 TOAST table and TOAST index.</li>
<li>The TOAST table and its index are created in CREATE/ALTER TABLE if needed.</li>
<li>The TOAST table is pg_toast.pg_toast_&lt;main_table_OID&gt;.</li>
<li>The TOAST index is pg_toast.pg_toast_&lt;main_table_OID&gt;_index.</li>
<li>The TOAST table's OID is stored in the table's pg_class.reltoastrelid.</li>
<li>The TOAST index's OID is stored in the TOAST table's pg_class.reltoastidxid.</li>
<li>Every TOAST table has these columns:
<ul><li>chunk_id OID: an OID identifying the particular TOASTed value</li>
<li>chunk_seq int: a sequence number for the chunk within its value</li>
<li>chunk_data bytea: the actual data of the chunk</li>
<li>Primary key (chunk_id, chunk_seq)</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>How TOAST works
<ul><li>It's triggered only when a row value to be stored in a table is wider than 2 KB (when the page size is 8 KB).</li>
<li>Compresses and/or moves column values to the TOAST table, until the row value is shorter than 2 KB (when the page size is 8 KB) or no more gains can be had. This 2 KB threshold can be adjusted for each table using the storage parameter toast_tuple_target in CREATE/ALTER TABLE.</li>
<li>Stores the TOASTed value's chunk_id in the main table's column. This is called a TOAST pointer.</li></ul></li>
<li>The value storage strategy - whether it should be compressed or moved to the TOAST table - can be chosen from four options using <code>ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN column_name SET STORAGE { PLAIN | EXTERNAL | EXTENDED | MAIN }</code></li>
<li>The compression method can be chosen between pglz and lz4. It can be set for each column by using the COMPRESSION column option in CREATE/ALTER TABLE or otherwise the default_toast_compression parameter.</li>
<li>Insertion of a TOASTed value could become unsurprisingly slow.
<ul><li>This tends to be seen when the target table already has millions of TOASTed values, particularly after inserting lots of rows in succession.</li>
<li>Why?
<ul><li>Each TOASTed value is identified by an OID.</li>
<li>OID is an unsigned 4-byte value, which is generated from a cluster-wide counter that wraps around every 4 billion values. Therefore, a single table cannot have more than 2^32 (4 billion) TOASTed values.</li>
<li>When inserting a TOASTed value, PostgreSQL generates a new OID for it, checks if an existing TOASTed value in the target table already uses the same OID. If it's used, PostgreSQL generates the next OID and perform the check again. This is repeated until a free OID is found.</li>
<li>If successive OIDs are used in the target table, this retry takes a long time.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>The remedy is to partition the table. Each partition has its own TOAST table. Thus, the likelihood of duplicate OID in each partition is reduced.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Transaction_2">Transaction</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Killed (dead) index tuples can give mysterious query speedup
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>If you encounter varying execution times for the same execution plan of the same query, that may be thanks to killed index tuples.</li>
<li>Whenever an index scan fetches a heap tuple only to find that it is dead, it marks the index tuple as killed (dead). Then future index scans will ignore it. This avoids its index key comparison as well as its heap tuple fetch.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Subtransactions can be harmful
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A subtransaction is a part of a transaction that can be rolled back without rolling back the main (top-level) transaction.</li>
<li>A subtransaction is started explicitly by a SAVEPOINT command, or implicitly when you enter a block with an EXCEPTION clause in PL/pgSQL.</li>
<li>Some client drivers provide an option to start and end a subtransaction for every SQL statement, such as PgJDBC's connection parameter "autosave". Watch out for their default values.</li>
<li>Each subtransaction allocates its own XID when it performs an operation that needs an XID, such as modifying data or locking a row.</li>
<li>The tuple header's xmin and xmax fields record the XID of the subtransaction that updated it. For checking tuple visibility, a transaction that sees the xmin/xmax needs to know whether the main transaction, not the subtransaction, has ended.</li>
<li>How to know the main transaction of a subtransaction:
<ul><li>When a subtransaction assigns its XID, it records its direct parent's XID in $PGDATA/pg_subtrans/.</li>
<li>The structure of pg_subtrans is an array of XIDS. For example, the parent XID of XID 100 is stored in the 101st element of the array. The array is divided into 8 KB pages.</li>
<li>The pg_subtrans data is cached in a memory area of 32 pages. The area is managed by SLRU (simple least-recently used) buffers. So, The cache can contain 32 pages * 8 KB / 4 = 65,536 transactions.</li>
<li>Therefore, to get the main transaction's XID, as many entries as the subtransaction nesting depth need to be traversed.</li></ul></li>
<li>Is pg_subtrans always examined for tuple visibility?
<ul><li>No. A snapshot stores not only main transactions' XIDs but also subtransactions' XIDs. If the checker's snapshot contains all subtransactions, it can get the job done without consulting pg_subtrans.</li>
<li>However, that's not always the case. Each backend can have at most 64 subtransaction XIDs in its ProcArray entry in shared memory. If the main transaction has more than 64 subtransactions, its ProcArray entry is marked overflowed.</li>
<li>When creating a snapshot, the ProcArray entries of all running transactions are scanned to collect the XIDs of main and sub transactions. If any entry is marked overflowed, the snapshot is marked suboverflowed.</li>
<li>A suboverflowed snapshot does not contain all data required to determine visibility, so the tuple's xmin/xmax must be traced back to their top-level transaction XID using pg_subtrans.</li></ul></li>
<li>So, what's the problem?
<ul><li>The readers of pg_subtrans contend for lwlocks to protect the SLRU buffers with the writers, who register their parents' XID. The reader and writer takes Share and Exclusive mode locks respectively.</li>
<li>The pg_subtrans cache is not so big. Under many concurrent subtransactions, disk I/O arise.</li></ul></li>
<li>How can I know the possibility of this happening?
<ul><li>The wait events LWLock:SubtransBuffer, LWLock:SubtransSLRU, IO:SLRURead, and IO:SLRUWrite keep growing.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-SLRU-VIEW">pg_stat_slru</a> shows increasing blks_read and blks_hit in its row for Subtrans. (PostgreSQL 13+)</li>
<li>pg_stat_get_backend_subxact(backend_id) returns subxact_count and subxact_overflow. (PostgreSQL 16+)</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>MultiXact can harm performance under the hood
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>What is MultiXact?
<ul><li>A mechanism to record the XIDs of multiple lockers on a tuple. (Multi-transaction)</li>
<li>The xmax field in the tuple header records the XID that locks the tuple.</li>
<li>Then, what happens when multiple transactions acquire locks on the same tuple?
<ul><li>For example, the first transaction with XID 100 runs <code>SELECT ... FOR SHARE</code>. The xmax becomes 100.</li>
<li>Next, the second transaction with XID 101 runs the same <code>SELECT ... FOR SHARE</code> on the same tuple. Then, a new MultiXact ID, say 1, is allocated and set to the xmax field.</li>
<li>The mapping from MultiXact ID 1 to the actual lockers' XIDS (100, 101) is added in $PGDATA/pg_multixact/.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>The foreign key constraint is implemented as a constraint trigger that executes <code>"SELECT ... FOR KEY SHARE"</code>. Therefore, MultiXact may be used without your knowledge.</li>
<li>What could be the problem?
<ul><li>Like pg_subtrans, pg_multixact is cached through the SLRU. So, it can suffer from the lwlock contention and disk I/O.</li>
<li>When an XID is added as a new member of an existing MultiXact ID, a new MultiXact ID is allocated and existing member XIDs are copied to a new location. In the above example, when XID 102 joins MultiXact ID 1 with members (100, 101), MultiXact 2 is newly allocated, (100, 101) are copied there, and 102 is added. If many transactions lock the same row concurrently, this copy gets heavier.</li></ul></li>
<li>How can I know the possibility of this happening?
<ul><li>The wait events LWLock:MultiXact*, IO:SLRURead, and IO:SLRUWrite keep growing.</li>
<li><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-SLRU-VIEW">pg_stat_slru</a> shows increasing blks_read and blks_hit in its rows for MultiXactOffset and MultiXactMember. (PostgreSQL 13+)</li>

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>A processing to synchronize data both in memory and on storage by flushing unwritten (=dirty) cached data.</li>
<li>When is it performed?
<ul><li>The time specified by checkpoint_timeout has passed since the last checkpoint.</li>
<li>A certain amount of WAL has accumulateed, which is based on max_wal_size.</li>
<li>At the start of a base backup (pg_basebackup, pg_backup_start()).</li>
<li>Shutting down the database instance.</li>
<li>Completing any form of recovery.</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous required timings such as CREATE DATABASE, so that data files can be copied/moved without going through shared buffers.</li></ul></li>
<li>The checkpoint caused by checkpoint_timeout is called a scheduled checkpoint, while others are called a requested checkpoint.</li>
<li>When finishing a checkpoint, old WAL segment files are removed or recycled as new WAL segment files for future reuse, based on min_wal_size.
<ul><li>Here, "old" means "no longer necessary for crash recovery because all the changes in those WAL segments have been persisted to data files."</li>
<li>However, old WAL segment files are kept until they are archived and no longer needed by wal_keep_size or any replication slots.</li></ul></li>
<li>Checkpoint is intrusive because:
<ul><li>Storage I/O contention, for both data and WAL.</li>
<li>Buffer content lock lwlock contention: While the checkpointer is flushing a shared buffer with its buffer content lock held in Share mode, a transaction that modifies the same buffer, which requires an Exclusive lock, needs to wait for the lwlock to be released.</li>
<li>WAL volume increase due to full page writes.</li></ul></li>
<li>What is full page writes?
<ul><li>During the first modification to each data page after a checkpoint, the entire page content is WAL-logged instead of just the change. This is necessary to recover a torn page during recovery.</li>
<li>A torn page can result if the host crashes while PostgreSQL is writing a page. Because the atomic unit of I/O is usually smaller (say, 512 byte disk sector) than the PostgreSQL page size (commonly 8 KB), it could be possible that part of a page is new and the other is old.</li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Reducing the impact of checkpoints
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Monitor the frequency of checkpoints
<ul><li>The number of scheduled and requested checkpoints can be seen by checkpoints_timed and checkpoints_req respectively in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-BGWRITER-VIEW">pg_stat_bgwriter</a>.
<ul><li>The vast majority of checkpoints should be scheduled rather than requested. Scheduled checkpoints allow the load to be evenly spread throughout the normal operation of the system. Frequent requested checkpoints are likely to cause variations in performance.</li></ul></li>
<li>The server log shows the following messages, if the elapsed time between two successive checkpoints is shorter than checkpoint_warning and the newer one is requested by WAL accumulation.
<ul><li><code>LOG:  checkpoints are occurring too frequently (8 seconds apart)</code></li>
<li><code>HINT:  Consider increasing the configuration parameter "max_wal_size".</code></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Lower the frequency of checkpoints by increasing max_wal_size and/or checkpoint_timeout.
<ul><li>Note that this can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery.</li></ul></li>
<li>Set wal_compression to on. This reduces the WAL for full page writes.</li>

</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Indexes consume disk space.</li>
<li>Larger disk space increases the size and duration of physical backups.</li>
<li>Indexes slow down INSERT/DELETE/COPY statements because they always have to modify all indexes.</li>
<li>Indexes prevent HOT updates. HOT works only for modifications to non-indexed columns.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Benefits of indexes you might not notice
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>B-tree indexes can speed up the max() and min() aggregates. They can just read the index entries at the end of the index.</li>
<li>Indexes on expressions also gather statistics on the calculated values of the expression.
<ul><li>ex. <code>CREATE INDEX myindex1 ON mytable ((col1 + col2 * 3));</code></li>
<li>You can see the statistics of indexed expressions. For example, in the above case, the statistics appear in pg_stats as tablename=myindex1 and attname=expr.</li>
<li>The statistics target can be set for indexed expressions. e.g., <code>ALTER INDEX index_name ALTER COLUMN expr SET STATISTICS 1000;</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Indexes on foreign keys speed up constraint processing.
<ul><li>ex. <code>CREATE TABLE orders (..., product_id int REFERENCES products ON CASCADE DELETE);</code></li>
<li>You can see the time taken for the constraint cascade processing with EXPLAIN ANALYZE and auto_explain. Foreign key constraints are implemented using triggers internally.
<ul><li>ex. <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE DELETE FROM products WHERE product_id = 2;</code></li>
<li>... <code>Trigger for constraint orders_product_id_fkey: time=0.322 calls=1</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Making an index-only scan work
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to see how many times the index-only scan had to read the heap. For example, it shows something like "Heap Fetches: 0". 0 is the best.</li>
<li>Make autovacuum more aggressive or run VACUUM to update the visibility map. That would reduce the heap fetches.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="Query_planning">Query planning</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Pitfalls of ANALYZE
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>Autovacuum does not run ANALYZE on temporary tables or foreign tables. Manually ANALYZE them.</li>
<li>The query plan can change after ANALYZE even when the table content hasn't changed.
<ul><li>ANALYZE takes a random sample of the table contents (300 x default_statistics_target rows). Hence, the collected statistics can vary depending on which rows are read.</li>
<li>To avoid or reduce this query plan variance, do either of:
<ul><li>Fix the query plan using third-party software like pg_hint_plan.</li>
<li>Raise the amount of statistics collected by ANALYZE, i.e., <code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS</code>. The more rows are used, the less the statistics fluctuation would be. However, this will make the ANALYZE and query planning slower because more statistics are written or read.</li>
<li>Set the table's storage parameters autovacuum_analyze_threshold and autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor to large values, so that autovacuum won't practically ANALYZE it. Then, do manual ANALYZE if needed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Use of a set-returning function could lead to a poor query plan
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>This is likely to be observed when the function is used to filter rows in WHERE clause or join.</li>
<li>That's because the planner does not have reasonably accurate information about selectivity. Thus, its cost estimate would be inaccurate.</li>
<li>CREATE/ALTER FUNCTION can set a fixed cost and the number of rows it returns. The planner support function given by the SUPPORT clause, which needs to be written in C, can change the cost and rows dynamically.
<ul><li><code>CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS {SETOF ... | TABLE(...)} COST execution_cost ROWS result_rows SUPPORT support_function</code></li></ul></li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>Custom plan and generic plan
</p></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><ul><li>PREPARE performs parse, analysis, and rewrite to generate a prepared statement.
<ul><li>ex. <code>PREPARE stmt(int) AS SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE col = $1;</code></li></ul></li>
<li>EXECUTE makes a query plan and execute it.
<ul><li>ex. <code>EXECUTE stmt(123);</code></li></ul></li>
<li>A query plan that takes specific parameter values into account is the best. Such plans are called a custom plan. On the other hand, a query plan that doesn't consider parameter values is called a generic plan.</li>
<li>You can tell a custom plan from a generic plan by the presence of a placeholder. For instance,
<ul><li>Custom  plan: <code>Filter: (col = 123)</code></li>
<li>Generic plan: <code>Filter: (col = $1)</code></li></ul></li>
<li>But planning is costly. If the generic plan is good enough, PostgreSQL uses it to avoid making custom plans.
<ul><li>PostgreSQL uses a custom plan for the first five executions of a prepared statement.</li>
<li>On the sixth execution, a generic plan is generated, and its cost is compared with the average cost of the past five executions.</li>
<li>If the cost of the generic plan is cheaper, it continues to adopt it. Custom plans won't be considered.</li>
<li>Otherwise, a new custom plan is created and used. On subsequent executions, the cost of the generic plan is compared with the average cost of all past executions of custom plans, and whichever is cheaper is chosen.</li></ul></li>
<li>You can force a generic or custom plan by setting plan_cache_mode to force_generic_plan or force_custom_plan respectively. This might be necessary to force custom plans, if the cost estimate of the generic plan is underestimated.</li></ul></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><h3><span id="References_6">References</span></h3></code></code></code></code></code><code><code><code><code><code><p>PostgreSQL Documentation

<p>Google News is boosting sites that rip-off other outlets by using AI to rapidly churn out content, 404 Media has found. Google told 404 Media that although it tries to address spam on Google News, the company ultimately does not focus on whether a news article was written by an AI or a human, opening the way for more AI-generated content making its way onto Google News.</p><p>The presence of AI-generated content on Google News signals two things: first, the black box nature of Google News, with entry into Google Newsâ rankings in the first place an opaque, but apparently gameable, system. Second, is how Google may not be ready for moderating its News service in the age of consumer-access AI, where essentially anyone is able to churn out a mass of content with little to no regard for its quality or originality.</p><p>âI want to read the original stories written by journalists who actually researched them and spoke to primary sources. Any news junkie would,â Brian Penny, a ghostwriter who first flagged some of the seemingly AI-generated articles to 404 Media, said.</p><div><p>ð¡</p><p><b><strong>Do you know about any other AI-generated content farms?

compensated.</p></td></tr><tr><td>CI &amp; Website</td><td>$14,661.35</td><td>Zig has great cross-compiling abilities in part
due to investing in testing infrastructure for different systems. Some of these costs were
one-time costs to purchase machines that sit in our homes and offices while others

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content">
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the weekend, I was working on a personal Rust project when I ran into an excessive memory usage problem. After an evening of trial and error, I found a workaround to fix the memory usage, but I still didnât understand how the issue was even possible, so I then spent another evening digging through the source code of the Rust standard library to understand the root cause.</p>

<p>This is the story of how I identified the bug. (TLDR: <code>collect::&lt;Vec&lt;_&gt;&gt;()</code> will sometimes reuse allocations, resulting in <code>Vec</code>s with large excess capacity, even when the length is exactly known in advance, so you need to call <code>shrink_to_fit</code> if you want to free the extra memory.)</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The project Iâm working on involves building a sparse weighted graph and then doing various calculations on the graph. I finally finished the initial version of the code Monday afternoon and tried running it, only for it to exhaust my computerâs 32gb of RAM before getting anywhere. Specifically, the final graph was supposed to have around three million nodes, but during graph construction, the process memory already shot up to over 18gb by the time it reached 300k nodes, and it would use up the entire RAM soon afterwards, slowing everything to a crawl and forcing me to kill the process.</p>

<p>At first, I assumed that the computations I was trying to do were just too big and my project was impossible, but I didnât give up just yet, and spent the rest of the evening trying to figure out which parts were using so much memory and whether there was any way to optimize them.</p>

<h2 id="narrowing-down-the-memory-leak">Narrowing down the memory leak</h2>

<p>There were several places in the code where I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization">memoization</a>, so I initially suspected those of being the cause of the exploding memory usage. I modified the graph construction function to stop after 300k nodes (when memory usage reached 18gb as seen via <code>top</code>, large but not quite enough to kill the computer), and added <code>println!</code>s to log the estimated total sizes of the memoized results. However, they were only in the 100mb range, nowhere near enough to explain the observed memory usage.</p>

<p>Next I tried running graph construction <em>twice</em> (but with it set to stop early at 300k nodes each time) to try to narrow down the cause. My main function looked like this (with <code>denom</code> and <code>optimistic</code> being parameters for the algorithm).</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>denom</span> <span>=</span> <span>257</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>optimistic</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>graph</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_graph</span><span>(</span><span>denom</span><span>,</span> <span>optimistic</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>graph</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_graph</span><span>(</span><span>denom</span><span>,</span> <span>optimistic</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>I carefully watched the process memory usage while this ran, to see if it would stop at 18gb or not. I thought that perhaps the memoization was using a lot more memory than expected due to memory fragmentation exploding the heap.</p>

<p>Since the code is deterministic, calling <code>build_graph</code> twice wonât result in any new results being memoized, and thus memory usage should stop at 18gb, even when it is run twice. Instead, memory usage continued to rapidly increase during the second <code>build_graph</code> call, which made no sense.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I then tried dropping <code>graph</code> in between:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>graph</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_graph</span><span>(</span><span>denom</span><span>,</span> <span>optimistic</span><span>);</span>
<span>std</span><span>::</span><span>mem</span><span>::</span><span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>graph</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>graph</span> <span>=</span> <span>build_graph</span><span>(</span><span>denom</span><span>,</span> <span>optimistic</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Suddenly, this time process memory usage dropped from 18gb to ~500mb after the first <code>build_graph</code> call, before going back up to 18gb. Clearly, the memory was somehow being wasted by <code>graph</code> itself. As before, I tried printing out the size of the graph, but it was nowhere near enough to explain the memory usage.</p>

<p>However, my <code>graph</code> data structure consists of <code>Vec</code>s, and Vec can use more memory than the size would indicate since they preallocate a buffer with up to 2x capacity in order to make insertion amortized O(1) time. I changed it to log the total <em>capacity</em> rather than <em>length</em> and suddenly the estimated size of the graph was 18gb. Bingo! I added <code>shrink_to_fit()</code> calls (which remove the excess capacity) into the graph construction code and suddenly the memory problems disappeared.</p>

<h2 id="wait-but-why">Wait, but why?</h2>

<p>Iâd finally identified the <code>shrink_to_fit</code> workaround late Monday night and planned to continue work on the project the following weekend. I mentioned my experience to my coworkers at work the following morning, as a PSA about the importance of <code>shrink_to_fit</code>, but they didnât believe me, and when I thought about it more, I couldnât believe it myself either.</p>

<p>First off, <code>Vec</code> only grows the buffer by 2x at a time, which means that (ignoring the initial allocation for small vecs), the capacity will always be at most double the length (assuming you donât remove elements), so the memory waste from excess capacity should always be at most 2x, but I was seeing over 200x.</p>

<p>Second, the memory leak was coming from the edge lists of the graph, which I was storing as <code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;(u32, u32)&gt;&gt;</code> (a table with one <code>Vec</code> storing the edge list for each node). When I called <code>shrink_to_fit</code> on the edge lists before inserting them, the memory problem disappeared. However, the final step for producing the edge lists was a <code>vec.into_iter().map(..).collect()</code> call to convert them to the appropriate format. Since <code>collect</code> allocates a fresh vector and the length is exactly known, it only allocates exactly enough space for the elements and there should never be <em>any</em> excess capacity at all, let alone 200x excess capacity.</p>

<h2 id="the-vec-source-code">The Vec source code</h2>

<p>Clearly, my assumptions about the implementation of <code>Vec</code> were incorrect somehow, and so out of curiosity, after work Tuesday evening, I dug into the <code>Vec</code> source code to try to figure out what was going on. There are several layers of indirection and specialization, but it didnât take long to trace through all the relevant code (or so I thought).</p>

<p>When you call <code>collect()</code>, it calls <code>FromIterator::from_iter</code>. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c58a5da7d48ff3887afe4c618dc04defdee3dab5/library/alloc/src/vec/mod.rs#L2791"><code>Vec</code>âs <code>FromIterator</code> impl</a> in turn calls <code>SpecFromIter</code>, an internal trait.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c58a5da7d48ff3887afe4c618dc04defdee3dab5/library/alloc/src/vec/spec_from_iter.rs"><code>SpecFromIter</code></a> has a specialization for <code>IntoIter</code> (i.e. if you call <code>vec.into_iter().collect()</code> with no intervening iterator adapters, it will just return the original vec instead of creating a new one). Otherwise, it calls a second internal trait, <code>SpecFromIterNested</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c58a5da7d48ff3887afe4c618dc04defdee3dab5/library/alloc/src/vec/spec_from_iter_nested.rs"><code>SpecFromIterNested</code></a> in turn has two implementations, one for general iterators and one for <code>TrustedLen</code> iterators (the relevant case here). However, the implementations are pretty much what you would expect. It just reserves a capacity equal to the iteratorâs <code>size_hint</code>, with no sign of anything that could result in excess capacity.</p>

<p>I also checked the Vec allocation code and confirmed that it only grows the buffer by 2x each time.</p>

<h2 id="logging-before-and-after">Logging before and after</h2>

<p>Having reached a dead end in the source code, I tried adding logging to my code (and commenting out the <code>shrink_to_fit</code> again) to see how bad the problem was. I logged the length and capacity of the edge lists before and after the final <code>into_iter().map().collect()</code> step, as well as a cumulative total of the length and capacity. (<code>get_cull_all</code> here is the function that calculates the edge lists, while <code>main_edges</code> is the final list of edge lists.)</p>

<div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>get_cull_all</span><span>(</span><span>ds</span><span>,</span> <span>max_denom</span> <span>as</span> <span>u128</span><span>,</span> <span>optimistic</span><span>);</span>
<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"precol {} {}"</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>.len</span><span>(),</span> <span>res</span><span>.capacity</span><span>());</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>res</span><span>:</span> <span>Vec</span><span>&lt;</span><span>_</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>=</span> <span>res</span>

    <span>.collect</span><span>();</span>

<span>main_len_tot</span> <span>+=</span> <span>res</span><span>.len</span><span>();</span>

<span>// res.shrink_to_fit();</span>
<span>assert</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>main_edges</span><span>.len</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>id</span><span>);</span>
<span>main_edges</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>res</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This produced output like</p>

<div><pre><code>precol 46 11400
46 34200 tot 10410429 2330729253
precol 54 11340
54 34020 tot 10410483 2330763273
precol 2 5520
2 16560 tot 10410485 2330779833
</code></pre></div>

<p>The cumulative wasted space up to 300k nodes was 2330779833/10410485 or over <strong>223x</strong> wasted space. This also confirmed that the edge lists had significant excess capacity following the <code>collect()</code> calls. In fact, the capacity of the new vec produced by <code>collect()</code> was always exactly three times the capacity of the original vec, regardless of length.</p>

<h2 id="playground">Playground</h2>

<p>Having confirmed that <code>collect()</code> was somehow producing vecs with excess capacity despite this seemingly being impossible per the source code, I next tried to reproduce the issue on the Rust playground. I wasnât able to reproduce the 3x increases that I experienced in my code, but I did notice something interesting.</p>

<p>So the vecs do have excess capacity here, even on the playground, although only a little bit. Furthermore, the excess capacity goes away if you use <code>iter().copied()</code> instead of <code>into_iter()</code>. Unfortunately, that part sidetracked me for a while, because I thought the <code>IntoIter</code> specialization of <code>SpecFromIter</code> might be related. It <em>shouldnât</em> be, because the iterator here is <code>Map&lt;IntoIter&gt;</code> rather than <code>IntoIter</code> itself, but I couldnât see anything else related and spent a long time staring at the source code, willing an answer to materialize.</p>

<p>Since the original issue didnât show up on the playground, I thought it might be version-specific. In my own code, I was using the nightly compiler so I could use <code>Vec::is_sorted</code>, but fortunately, I was just using that for a couple asserts, so after commenting those out, I was able to switch to the beta compiler (1.76), where the exact same behavior occurred. As for stable, I was unable to try stable (1.74) because of compiler errors due to an unrelated issue with <code>impl Trait</code>. (As it turned out, the issue is only present in beta and not stable, so this was an unfortunate miss.) I also confirmed that the issue reproduced in non-release builds, so it wasnât optimization related.</p>

<h2 id="vec-type-changes">Vec type changes</h2>

<p>I continued attempting to narrow down and reproduce my issue on the playground. After some more trial and error, I discovered that mapping a vec to a <em>smaller</em> type resulted in excess capacity, even on the playground, but <em>only</em> on beta and nightly, not stable.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<div><pre><code>len 5 cap 8 v=[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
len 5 cap 16 v=[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
len 5 cap 32 v=[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
len 5 cap 128 v=[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
len 5 cap 5 v=[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]
</code></pre></div>

<p>Furthermore, the capacity increased proportionately to the type size reduction. In this example, going from <code>u128</code> to <code>u64</code> to <code>u32</code>, etc. doubles the capacity each time. On the other hand, <em>increasing</em> the type size as in the last example (<code>u8</code> -&gt; <code>u16</code>) immediately removes the excess capacity.</p>

<h2 id="allocation-reuse">Allocation reuse</h2>

<p>Since the capacity was increasing in proportion to the decrease in element size, that implied that the size of the backing array for the new vec was suspiciously the same as that of the old vec. I hypothesized that it was somehow reusing the memory from the old vec as an optimization. This also explains why it only happens with <code>into_iter()</code> and why using <code>iter().copied()</code> eliminates the excess capacity. When using <code>iter()</code>, the old vec isnât dropped, and so its memory canât be reused. In my code, the last step prior to insertion maps the edge lists from <code>(u64, u128)</code> to <code>(u32, u32)</code>, which is a third the size, hence why the capacity always increased by 3x after the conversion.</p>

<p>The other thing this implied is that while <code>collect()</code> was tripling the capacity of the vec, the actual memory use was unchanged, which meant that <code>collect()</code> alone wasnât the cause of the memory leak. Rather, it was merely <em>failing to decrease</em> the existing memory usage. In order to understand how this could have exploded the process memory usage, a bit of explanation of my code is in order.</p>

<p>My edge list calculation logic internally uses <code>u128</code> for increased precision before truncating the weights to <code>u32</code> at the end. Furthermore, in some cases, it generates a list of potential edges and then filters out most of them prior to returning, which leads to a large amount of excess capacity. As an extreme example, the last iteration in the log output shown above had a length of 2 but a capacity of 5520.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, that wouldnât have been a problem, since the <code>into_iter().map().collect()</code> line used to pack them into <code>(u32, u32)</code>s would allocate a new vector with only the exact amount of space required. However, thanks to the allocation reuse optimization added in Rust 1.76*, the new vec shared the backing store of the input vec, and hence had a capacity of 16560, meaning it was using 132480 bytes of memory to store only 16 bytes of data.</p>

<p>Since the edge list calculation logic is run for one node at a time in sequence, the fact that it temporarily uses 132kb of memory would normally not be a problem at all. However, the new <code>collect()</code> optimization meant that that internal storage was being preserved in the final vec which got inserted into the list of edge lists, thus keeping around that 132kb of obsolete memory forever. Multiply that by 300k nodes and suddenly youâve leaked the computerâs entire RAM.</p>

<p>* <em>Technically, Rust will sometimes reuse the allocation even on stable, as shown by the initial len=4,cap=6 example on the playground. Rust 1.76 merely made the optimization smarter so it triggers in more cases.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-source-code">The source code</h2>

<p>Now that I knew I was looking specifically for a commit added in Rust 1.76, it wasnât hard to look through the recent changes to the <code>Vec</code> source code on Github and find <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/13a843ebcbe536257a8442bf5c26b227d1c2f7c9">the likely culprit</a>. It turns out that thereâs <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c58a5da7d48ff3887afe4c618dc04defdee3dab5/library/alloc/src/vec/in_place_collect.rs">an entire 412 line file dedicated to implementing this optimization</a> that I overlooked previously.</p>

<p>How was this possible? One of the more annoying features of Rust is that Trait impls can be added <em>anywhere in the same crate</em>, not just in the files where you would logically expect them to be, and thereâs no way to find hidden impls other than doing a full code search.</p>

<p>In this case, the <code>SpecFromIter</code> trait was defined in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/c58a5da7d48ff3887afe4c618dc04defdee3dab5/library/alloc/src/vec/spec_from_iter.rs">spec_from_iter.rs</a>, along with two implementations of that trait, so I naturally assumed that that was all the implementations there were. I had no way to guess that there was actually a <em>third</em> implementation that was hidden in a completely different file (in_place_collect.rs).</p>

<p>Technically speaking, there was one slight hint. <code>spec_from_iter.rs</code> contains the following comment:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>/// Specialization trait used for Vec::from_iter</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// ## The delegation graph:</span>
<span>///</span>
<span>/// ```text</span>

<span>/// |FromIterator |</span>

<span>///   v</span>
<span>/// +-+-------------------------------+  +---------------------+</span>
<span>/// |SpecFromIter                  +----&gt;+SpecFromIterNested   |</span>
<span>/// |where I:                      |  |  |where I:             |</span>
<span>/// |  Iterator (default)----------+  |  |  Iterator (default) |</span>
<span>/// |  vec::IntoIter               |  |  |  TrustedLen         |</span>
<span>/// |  SourceIterMarker---fallback-+  |  +---------------------+</span>
<span>/// +---------------------------------+</span>
<span>/// ```</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This comment lists the two impls found in the file as well as a seemingly missing third impl for âSourceIterMarkerâ. I actually did try googling âSourceIterMarkerâ at one point, but the only thing that came up was <em>that same comment in spec_from_iter.rs</em>, and since there was no sign of a third impl in the file, I assumed that it was just a mistake or outdated comment. In retrospect, I should have done a full code search for âSourceIterMarkerâ on Github, just in case it had sneakily been hidden in a separate file.</p>

<h2 id="boxt">Box&lt;[T]&gt;</h2>

<p>As mentioned previously, adding a call to <code>shrink_to_fit()</code> prior to storing the edge lists in the final graph eliminated the memory leak issue. This is fine as a quick hack, but it is not the proper solution. The <em>real</em> fix is to call <code>into_boxed_slice()</code> instead.</p>

<p>The basic problem is that <code>Vec</code>s are optimized for the case of a <em>mutable</em> list where youâre planning to <em>add and remove</em> elements in the future. However, people also commonly use them for <em>fixed-length</em> list data, even though this is not what Vecs are designed for, simply because Vec is the easiest and most <em>intuitive</em> way to store list data in Rust. The <em>proper</em> data structure for fixed-length lists is <code>Box&lt;[T]&gt;</code> rather than <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>, but it takes a lot of Rust experience to even <em>know</em> about that as an option, and the syntax looks weirder.</p>

<p>In Java, immutable strings are called <code>String</code> while mutable strings (the equivalent of Rustâs <code>String</code>) are called <code>StringBuilder</code> instead. This nudges people towards the appropriate behavior because you would look really foolish if you stored something named âStringBuilderâ in long-term immutable data structures. Meanwhile in Rust, almost nobody uses <code>Box&lt;str&gt;</code> over <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, Iâm not saying that Rust should have called <code>Vec</code> âListBuilderâ or anything. Mutable array lists are an <strong>extremely</strong> commonly needed component of algorithms and data structures, so itâs important to keep the name short and memorable. Itâs just a little unfortunate that a side effect of Rustâs design nudges people towards <em>also</em> using <code>Vec</code> even for fixed-length data.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I actually was already using <code>Box&lt;[T]&gt;</code> for the saved results in one of the functions where I used memoization. My main motivation was to avoid wasting an extra word to store capacity on the <em>value</em> side, but as a side effect, this conveniently also made it immune to any potential excess capacity bugs. (The other place where I used memoization did just use <code>Vec</code>s out of laziness, but fortunately it didnât end up mattering much there.)</p>

<h2 id="packed-arrays">Packed arrays</h2>

<p>Another possible optimization which I plan to try out later is to avoid storing separate lists in the first place. Instead, have a single âarenaâ Vec and store the data for <em>all</em> the lists <em>continguously</em> in that Vec and just pass around an (index, length) pair into that vec instead of real <code>Vec</code>/<code>Box&lt;[]&gt;</code>, etc.</p>

<p>This design is only sometimes usable (you canât free or pass around individual lists independently of the arena vec this way) and is much more intrusive in terms of code design (you have to somehow pass a reference to the arena vec through all your code). However, in addition to making you automatically immune to excess capacity bugs, it also avoids the potential memory fragmentation issue that having lots of little individually allocated lists could cause. Additionally, it lets you represent your lists as only <code>(u32, u32)</code> assuming the total length is less than 2Â³Â², a 2x saving on the value side as well, albeit at the cost of increased bounds checks.</p>

<p>This trick has limited applicability, but it is perfect for cases like memoization (where the results live forever and are stored in a single place) or the edge list of a graph data structure (where you can store the backing vec as part of the graph) assuming you donât need to add or remove edges after creation.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This was a surprising and annoying bug to investigate, but at least I learned a lot about Rust in the process. I had no idea that the standard library was doing this kind of optimization under the hood (and since this is code-based, it happens even in debug builds). Itâs also an illustration of how an optimization in one place can lead to bugs downstream by violating programmersâ expectations.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that writing about my experience can help other people avoid this footgun in the future, or at least teach people something interesting about Rust.</p>

<p>OK, queues.</p>

<p>People misuse queues all the time. The most egregious case being to fix issues with slow apps, and consequently, with overload. But to say why, I'll need to take bits of talks and texts I have around the place, and content that I have written in more details about in <a href="http://www.erlang-in-anger.com/">Erlang in Anger</a>.</p>

<p>To oversimplify things, most of the projects I end up working on can be visualized as a very large bathroom sink. User and data input are flowing from the faucet, down 'till the output of the system:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink1.png" width="534" height="309">
<p>So under normal operations, your system can handle all the data that comes in, and carry it out fine:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink2.png" width="479" height="307">
<p>Water goes in, water goes out, everyone's happy. However, from time to time, you'll see temporary overload on your system. If you do messaging, this is going to be around sporting events or events like New Year's Eve. If you're a news site, it's gonna be when a big thing happens (Elections in the US, Royal baby in the UK, someone says they dislike French as a language in Quebec).</p>

<p>During that time, you may experience that temporary overload:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink3.png" width="452" height="315">
<p>The data that comes out of the system is still limited, and input comes in faster and faster. Web people will use stuff like caches at that point to make it so the input and output required gets to be reduced. Other systems will use a huge buffer (a queue, or in this case, a sink) to hold the temporary data.</p>

<p>The problem comes when you inevitably encounter prolonged overload. It's when you look at your system load and go "oh crap", and it's not coming down ever. Turns out Obama doesn't want to turn in his birth certificate, the royal baby doesn't look like the father, and someone says Quebec should be better off with Parisian French, and the rumor mill is going for days and weeks at a time:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink4.png" width="449" height="303">
<p>All of a sudden, the buffers, queues, whatever, can't deal with it anymore. You're in a critical state where you can see smoke rising from your servers, or if in the cloud, things are as bad as usual, but more!</p>

<p>The system inevitably crashes:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink5.png" width="453" height="314">
<p>Woops, everyone is dead, you're in the office at 3am (who knew so many people in the US, disgusted with their "Kenyan" president, now want news on the royal baby, while Quebec people look up 'royale with cheese baby' for some reason) trying to keep things up.</p>

<p>You look at your stack traces, at your queue, at your DB slow queries, at the APIs you call. You spend weeks at a time optimizing every component, making sure it's always going to be good and solid. Things keeps crashing, but you hit the point where every time, it takes 2-3 days more.</p>

<p>At the end of it, you see a crapload of problems still happening, but they're a week apart between each failure, which slows down your optimizing in immense ways because it's incredibly hard to measure things when they take weeks to go bad.</p>

<p>You go "okay I'm all out of ideas, let's buy a bigger server." The system in the end looks like this, and it's still failing:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink6.png" width="476" height="315">
<p>Except now it's an unmaintainable piece of garbage full of dirty hacks to make it work that cost 5 times what it used to, and you've been paid for months optimizing it for no god damn reason because it still dies when overloaded.</p>

<p>The problem? That red arrow there. You're hitting some hard limit that even through all of your profiling, you didn't consider properly. This can be a database, an API to an external service, disk speed, bandwidth or general I/O limits, paging speed, CPU limits, whatever.</p>

<p>You've spent months optimizing your super service only to find out at some point in time, you went past its optimal speed without larger changes, and the day your system got to have an operational speed greater than this hard limit, you've doomed yourself to an everlasting series of system failures.</p>

<p>The disheartening part about it is that you discover that once your system is popular, has people using it and its APIs, and changing it to be better is very expensive and hard. Especially since you'll probably have to revisit assumptions you've made in its core design. Woops.</p>

<p>So what do you need? You'll need to pick <em>what has to give</em> whenever stuff goes bad. You'll have to pick between blocking on input (back-pressure), or dropping data on the floor (load-shedding). And that happens all the time in the real world, we just don't want to do it as developers, as if it were an admission of failure.</p>

<p>Bouncers in front of a club, water spillways to go around dams, the pressure mechanism that keeps you from putting more gas in a full tank, and so on. They're all there to impose a system-wide flow control to keep operations safe.</p>

<p>In [non-critical] software? Who cares! We never shed load because that makes stakeholders angry, and we never think about back-pressure. Usually the back-pressure in the system is implicit: 'tis slow.</p>

<p>A function/method call to something ends up taking longer? It's slow. Not enough people think of it as back-pressure making its way through your system. In fact, slow distributed systems are often the canary in the overload coal mine. The problem is that everyone just stands around and goes "durr why is everything so slow??" and devs go "I don't know! It just is! It's hard, okay!"</p>

<p>That's usually because somewhere in the system (possibly the network, or something that is nearly impossible to observe without proper tooling, such as <a href="http://www.snookles.com/slf-blog/2012/01/05/tcp-incast-what-is-it/">TCP incast</a>), something is clogged and everything else is pushing it back to the edge of your system, to the user.</p>

<p>And that back-pressure making the system slower? It slows down the rate at which users can input data. It's what is likely keeping your whole stack alive. And you know when people start using queues? Right there. When operations take too long and block stuff up, people introduce a freaking queue in the system.</p>

<p>And the effects are instant. The application that was sluggish is now fast again. Of course you need to redesign the whole interface and interactions and reporting mechanisms to become asynchronous, but man is it fast!</p>

<p>Except at some point the queue spills over, and you lose all of the data. There's a serious meeting that then takes place where everyone discusses how this could possibly have happened. Dev #3 suggests more workers are added, Dev #6 recommends the queue gets persistency so that when it crashes, no requests are lost.</p>

<p>"Cool," says everyone. Off to work. Except at some point, the system dies again. And the queue comes back up, but it's already full and uuugh. Dev #5 goes in and thinks "oh yeah, we could add more queues" (I swear I've seen this unfold back when I didn't know better). People say "oh yeah, that increases capacity" and off they go.</p>

<p>And then it dies again. And nobody ever thought of that sneaky red arrow there:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink6.png" width="476" height="315">
<p>Maybe they do it without knowing, and decide to go with MongoDB because it's "faster than Postgres" (heh). Who knows.</p>

<p>The real problem is that everyone involved used queues as an optimization mechanism. With them, new problems are now part of the system, which is a nightmare to maintain. Usually, these problems will come in the form of ruining the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle">end-to-end principle</a> by using a persistent queue as a fire-and-forget mechanisms or assuming tasks can't be replayed or lost. You have more places that can time out, require new ways to detect failures and communicate them back to users, and so on.</p>

<p>Those can be worked around, don't get me wrong. The issue is that they're being introduced as part of a solution that's not appropriate for the problem it's built to solve. All of this was just premature optimization. Even when everyone involved took measures, reacted to real failures in real pain points, etc. The issue is that nobody considered what the true, central business end of things is, and what its limits are. People considered these limits locally in each sub-component, more or less, and not always.</p>

<p>But someone should have picked what had to give: do you stop people from inputting stuff in the system, or do you shed load. Those are inescapable choices, where inaction leads to system failure.</p>

<p>And you know what's cool? If you identify these bottlenecks you have for real in your system, and you put them behind proper back-pressure mechanisms, your system won't even have the right to become slow.</p>

<p>Step 1. Identify the bottleneck. Step 2: ask the bottleneck for permission to pile more data in:</p>
<img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink7.png" width="387" height="259"> <img src="https://ferd.ca/static/img/sink8.png" width="383" height="259">
<p>Depending on where you put your probe, you can optimize for different levels of latency and throughput, but what you're going to do is define proper operational limits of your system.</p>

<p>When people blindly apply a queue as a buffer, all they're doing is creating a bigger buffer to accumulate data that is in-flight, only to lose it sooner or later. You're making failures more rare, but you're making their magnitude worse.</p>

<p>When you shed load and define proper operational limits to your system, you don't have these. What you may have is customers that are as unhappy (because in either case, they can't do what your system promises right), but with proper back-pressure or load-shedding, you gain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Proper metrics of your quality of service</li>
<li>An API that will be designed with either in mind (back-pressure lets you know when you're in an overload situation, and when to retry or whatever, and load-shedding lets the user know that some data was lost so they can work around that)</li>
<li>Fewer night pages</li>
<li>Fewer critical rushes to get everything fixed because it's dying all the time</li>
<li>A way to monetize your services through varying account limits and priority lanes</li>
<li>You act as a more reliable endpoint for everyone who depends on you</li>
</ul>
<p>To make stuff usable, a proper idempotent API with end-to-end principles in mind will make it so these instances of back-pressure and load shedding should rarely be a problem for your callers, because they can safely retry requests and know if they worked.</p>

<p>So when I rant about/against queues, it's because queues will often be (but not always) applied in ways that totally mess up end-to-end principles for no good reason. It's because of bad system engineering, where people are trying to make an 18-wheeler go through a straw and wondering why the hell things go bad. In the end the queue just makes things worse. And when it goes bad, it goes really bad, because everyone tried to close their eyes shut and ignore the fact they built a dam to solve flooding problems upstream of the dam.</p>

<p>And then of course, there's the use case where you use the queue as a messaging mechanism between front-end threads/processes (think PHP, Ruby, CGI apps in general, and so on) because your language doesn't support inter-process communications. It's marginally better than using a MySQL table (which I've seen done a few times and even took part in), but infinitely worse than picking a tool that supports the messaging mechanisms you need to implement your solution right.</p>

<p>Nearly 71 million unique credentials stolen for logging into websites such as Facebook, Roblox, eBay, and Yahoo have been circulating on the Internet for at least four months, a researcher said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Troy Hunt, operator of the <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?</a> breach notification service, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-massive-naz-api-credential-stuffing-list/">said</a> the massive amount of data was posted to a well-known underground market that brokers sales of compromised credentials. Hunt said he often pays little attention to dumps like these because they simply compile and repackage previously published passwords taken in earlier campaigns.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/naz-apo-data-post.png" data-height="1184" data-width="2150" alt="Post appearing on breach site advertising the availability of naz.api password data."><img alt="Post appearing on breach site advertising the availability of naz.api password data." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/naz-apo-data-post-640x352.png" width="640" height="352" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/naz-apo-data-post-1280x705.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/naz-apo-data-post.png" data-height="1184" data-width="2150">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Post appearing on breach site advertising the availability of naz.api password data.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Not your typical password dump</h2>
<p>Some glaring things prevented Hunt from dismissing this one, specifically the contents indicating that nearly 25 million of the passwords had never been leaked before:</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">319 files totaling 104GB</li>
<li aria-level="1">70,840,771 unique email addresses</li>
<li aria-level="1">427,308 individual HIBP subscribers impacted</li>
<li aria-level="1">65.03 percent of addresses already in HIBP (based on a 1,000 random sample set)</li>
</ol>
<p>âThat last number was the real kicker,â Hunt wrote. âWhen a third of the email addresses have never been seen before, that's statistically significant. This isn't just the usual collection of repurposed lists wrapped up with a brand-new bow on it and passed off as the next big thing; it's a significant volume of new data. When you look at the above forum post the data accompanied, the reason why becomes clear: it's from âstealer logsâ or in other words, malware that has grabbed credentials from compromised machines.â</p>
<p>A redacted image that Hunt posted showing a small sample of the exposed credentials indicated that account credentials for a variety of sites were swept up. Sites included Facebook, Roblox, Coinbase, Yammer, and Yahoo. In keeping with the claim that the credentials were collected by a âstealerââmalware that runs on a victimâs device and uploads all user names and passwords entered into a login pageâthe passwords appear in plaintext. Account credentials taken in website breaches are almost always cryptographically hashed. (A sad aside: Most of the exposed credentials are weak and would easily fall to a simple <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/thereisnofatebutwhatwemake-turbo-charged-cracking-comes-to-long-passwords/">password dictionary attack</a>.)
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nas-api-credential-sample.png" data-height="1258" data-width="2262" alt="Screenshot showing a sample of 20 credential pairs, with usernames redacted."><img alt="Screenshot showing a sample of 20 credential pairs, with usernames redacted." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nas-api-credential-sample-640x356.png" width="640" height="356" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nas-api-credential-sample-1280x712.png 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/nas-api-credential-sample.png" data-height="1258" data-width="2262">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Screenshot showing a sample of 20 credential pairs, with usernames redacted.</p><p>Have I Been Pwned?</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Data collected by Have I Been Pwned indicates this password weakness runs rampant. Of the 100 million unique passwords amassed, they have appeared 1.3 billion times.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>âTo be fair, there are instances of duplicated rows, but there's also a massive prevalence of people using the same password across multiple different services and completely different people using the same password (there are a finite set of dog names and years of birth out there...),â Hunt wrote. âAnd now more than ever, the impact of this service is absolutely huge!â</p>
<p>Hunt confirmed the authenticity of the dataset by contacting people at some of the listed emails. They confirmed that the credentials listed there wereâor at least once wereâaccurate. For added assurance, Hunt also checked a sample of the credentials to see if the email addresses were associated with accounts on the affected websites. All of them did. Some of Huntâs users reported that the passwords appeared to be valid as of 2020 or 2021. Whatever the date of the passwords, it stands to reason that unless theyâve been updated, they remain valid. The underground market <a href="https://breachforums.is/Thread-FREE-Full-naz-api-Dataset-Leaked-Download">post</a> advertising the dataset said it came from a breach dubbed naz.api that had been donated to a different site earlier.</p>
<p>Hunt said that a large percentage of the credentials came not from stealer malware as claimed, but from credential stuffing, a form of account-hijacking attack that collects large numbers of stolen account credentials from previous breaches. Hunt said credential stuffing sources explained how a password he used "pre-2011" landed in the dump.</p>
<p>"Some of this data does not come from malware and has been around for a significant period of time," he wrote. "My own email address, for example, accompanied a password not used for well over a decade and did not accompany a website indicating it was sourced from malware."</p>
<h2>Making passwords safe</h2>
<p>There are dozens of useful primers online explaining how to properly secure accounts. The two main ingredients to account security are: (1) choosing strong passwords and (2) keeping them out of the sight of prying eyes. This means:
</p><ul>
<li>Creating a long, randomly generated password or passphrase. These passcodes should be at least 11 characters for passwords and for passphrases at least four words randomly chosen from a dictionary of no fewer than 50,000 entries. <a href="https://bitwarden.com/go/password-management-business-sales/?msclkid=a591fe1c4a9915342db69bb41a862deb">Bitwarden</a>, a free, open source password manager, is a good choice and a great way for less experienced people to get started. Once a password is created, it should be stored in the password-manager vault.</li>
<li>Preventing strong passwords from being compromised. This entails not entering passwords into phishing sites and keeping devices free of malware.</li>
<li>Use two-factor authentication, preferably with a security key or authenticator app, whenever possible. This doubly applies to protecting the password manager with 2FA.</li>
<li>Better yet, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/passkeys-may-not-be-for-you-but-they-are-safe-and-easy-heres-why/">use passkeys</a>, a new, industry-wide authentication standard that's immune to theft through stealer apps and credential phishing.</li>
</ul>                                            
                                                        
<p>Itâs also a good idea to either create an account with Have I Been Pwned? or periodically enter email addresses into the site search box to check if they appear in any breaches. To prevent abuse of the search, the site doesnât log entered email addresses and no corresponding passwords are loaded with password data stored on the site. Have I Been Pwned also accepts a single email address at a time, except in certain cases. You can find more on the service and the security of using it <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/FAQs">here</a>.</p>
<p>Have I Been Pwned also allows users to search its database for <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3?ref=troyhunt.com#PwnedPasswords">specific passwords</a>. More about k-anonymity and other measures Hunt uses to prevent password exposure and abuse of his service is <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v3?ref=troyhunt.com#PwnedPasswords">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>This post has been updated to correct inferences about how Hunt's password ended up in the dataset.</em></p>

<h3>from the <i>too-big-to-fail,-too-cheap-to-care</i> dept</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160712/15543134951/field-drug-tests-2-tool-that-can-destroy-lives.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160712/15543134951/field-drug-tests-2-tool-that-can-destroy-lives.shtml">Field drug tests</a> often seem to be more a triumph of imagination than a triumph of science. Theyâre cheap. Some popular tests run <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/04/las-vegas-pd-continues-to-use-faulty-2-drug-field-tests-because-convictions-matter-more-than-justice/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/04/las-vegas-pd-continues-to-use-faulty-2-drug-field-tests-because-convictions-matter-more-than-justice/">less than $3/per</a>. Thatâs the literal selling point. When in doubt, a cop can get probable cause by grabbing a substance, dumping it into a field test, and deciding whatever results are generated are evidence of guilt.</p>
<p>It rarely is. Sure, if you run enough tests, youâre bound to have some of these field tests confirmed by lab tests that are far more precise and less likely to be interpreted subjectively by the person performing the test. (Theoretically. Thereâs plenty of evidence out there showing lab drug tests can be just as faulty as field drug tests, although <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/04/10/more-drug-lab-misconduct-results-massachusetts-court-tossing-nearly-12000-convictions/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/04/10/more-drug-lab-misconduct-results-massachusetts-court-tossing-nearly-12000-convictions/">in these cases</a>, the problem is <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/26/prosecutors-overturn-more-than-21000-drug-convictions-wake-massive-drug-lab-misconduct/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/04/26/prosecutors-overturn-more-than-21000-drug-convictions-wake-massive-drug-lab-misconduct/">usually the person performing</a> the testing [or not!] than the test itself.)</p>
<p>Cheap, fast, and easy. And wrong. So very very often wrong. Field drug tests have labeled everything from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/16/prosecutor-tosses-charges-against-driver-after-field-drug-test-claims-bird-poop-cars-hood-is-cocaine/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/16/prosecutor-tosses-charges-against-driver-after-field-drug-test-claims-bird-poop-cars-hood-is-cocaine/">bird poop</a> (on a carâs hood!) to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/31/man-gets-37500-payout-after-field-drug-test-says-donut-crumbs-are-methamphetamines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/10/31/man-gets-37500-payout-after-field-drug-test-says-donut-crumbs-are-methamphetamines/">donut crumbs</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/29/man-spends-three-months-jail-because-drug-dog-field-test-said-his-honey-was-methamphetamines/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/08/29/man-spends-three-months-jail-because-drug-dog-field-test-said-his-honey-was-methamphetamines/">honey</a> to the <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/03/man-sues-after-field-drug-test-says-his-daughters-ashes-are-meth-ecstasy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/06/03/man-sues-after-field-drug-test-says-his-daughters-ashes-are-meth-ecstasy/">ashes of a deceased loved one</a> as contraband, resulting in the immediate arrest of people not actually in possession of anything illegal. </p>
<p>This is just whatâs been observed by those challenging these results in court during criminal trials or filing civil rights lawsuits following wrongful arrests. Itâs happened often enough that even a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/28/cheap-field-drug-tests-are-finally-getting-called-out-by-courts-as-the-bullshit-they-are/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/28/cheap-field-drug-tests-are-finally-getting-called-out-by-courts-as-the-bullshit-they-are/">few courts are taking notice</a>, in some cases refusing to accept plea deals predicated on nothing more than field drug tests results.</p>
<p>Data on field drug tests is difficult to obtain. Cops are in no hurry to turn this information over and the patchwork of public records laws across the nation often allows law enforcement to refuse disclosure simply by stating the results are relevant to a criminal investigation (even if the investigation has long since been closed). </p>
<p>What data can be obtained has been collected and parsed by the Quattrone Center for Fair Administration of Justice at the University of Pennsylvania. Whatâs long been assumed based on mainly anecdotal evidence now has at least some scientific backing: field drug tests arenât worth what weâre paying for them, even if it is only $3/per. According to the Centerâs <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24360980/fdt-study.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24360980/fdt-study.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> [PDF], nearly one third of the money spent on field drug tests is misspent. (h/t <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/09/study-estimates-roadside-drug-tests-result-in-30000-wrongful-arrests-every-year/" data-type="link" data-id="https://reason.com/2024/01/09/study-estimates-roadside-drug-tests-result-in-30000-wrongful-arrests-every-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">C.J. Ciaramella at Reason</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Utilizing a nationwide survey of agencies, the report offers national estimates on the frequency of test usage, finding that each year approximately 773,000 drug-related arrests involve the use of presumptive tests. Using the survey data and national estimates of drug arrests, this report examines the impact of the tests on wrongful arrests, racial disparities in their use, and their subsequent impact on drug possession prosecutions and dispositions.</em></p>
<p><em>Although the true error rate of these tests remains unknown, estimates based on the imperfect data that are available suggest that <strong><span>around 30,000 arrests</span> each year involve people who do not possess illegal substances but who are nonetheless falsely implicated by color-based presumptive tests</strong></em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not great. Not even good. Not even close to good. I donât know where itâs acceptable to rack up a false arrest rate of nearly 4%, but America shouldnât be one of those places. I realize itâs only probable cause at the point of arrest rather than the courtroom standard of âbeyond a reasonable doubt.â But 30,000 bogus arrests a year from a single cause â field drug tests â is unacceptable. </p>
<p>Hereâs how that works out in the greater scheme of things, in terms of criminal justice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>The use of presumptive field tests in drug arrests is one of the largest, if not the<br>largest, known contributing factor to wrongful arrests and convictions in the United States.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Itâs not just arrests. Itâs also convictions. And those convictions arenât happening in bench trials or jury trials. Theyâre plea agreements where people weigh their options and decide that the <em>best</em> option is to âadmitâ to a crime they havenât committed rather than subject themselves to indefinite detention and the <a href="https://interrogatingjustice.org/uncategorized/fairness-in-sentencing/the-trial-tax-in-america/" data-type="link" data-id="https://interrogatingjustice.org/uncategorized/fairness-in-sentencing/the-trial-tax-in-america/">full weight of prosecutorial forces that love to punish people</a> for insisting on their innocence and/or seek to have their rights respected.</p>
<p>The whole system is stacked against defendants, beginning with the tests that cops treat as actual probable cause when they realistically should be considered nothing more than a hunch. This is the depressing reality of criminal justice in the United States when it comes to field drug tests and people falsely accused by faulty tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In our survey, <strong>89% of prosecutors reported that guilty pleas are permitted without confirmatory testing</strong> (i.e., follow-up testing by a lab to verify that a field test âpositiveâ result accurately detected an illegal drug).</em></p>
<p><em><strong>67% of drug labs in the U.S. report that they are not asked to review samples when there are plea agreements, and 24% do not receive samples for confirmatory testing</strong> when there are field test results available.</em></p>
<p><em>Even when labs receive samples, <strong>46% report that they will not conduct a confirmatory test if there has been a guilty plea, and 8% report that they will not retest</strong> if there has been a presumptive identification</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isnât justice. This isnât even a polite hat tip in the direction of justice. This is railroading, aided and abetted by drug labs beholden to cops and almost as disinterested in what happens to people facing criminal charges possibly predicated on incorrect test results. On the law enforcement side, the fact is no one cares and no one cares that no one cares. Courts are the last hope, and even most of those are more than willing to clear dockets quickly and easily by signing off on any plea deal placed in front of them.</p>
<p>As the report notes, itâs not as though cops and prosecutors arenât aware of the limitations of field drug tests. Itâs that they donât care. All tests come packaged with plenty of verbiage stating how any field test should be verified with a lab test, how dozens of legal substances can trigger false positives, and how tests can be rendered useless by exposure to UV light or elevated temperatures.</p>
<p>But none of that is legally binding. Itâs not like improper use results in a voided warranty. Itâs not like field drug test makers are going to stop selling to cops just because cops ignore every single instruction printed on the package. Again, this is up to the courts. And low level courts that handle a large percentage of possession cases arenât going to increase their own workload by forcing prosecutors to verify tests or refuse plea deals based on nothing more than what a cop claimed to have observed while misusing a cheap test prone to false positives.</p>
<p>Itâs not that better field drug test tech doesnât exist. It does. Portable Raman spectrometers, which are capable of producing results comparable to lab equipment (at least according to the Scientific Working Group for the Analysis of Seized Drugs), very few law enforcement agencies are going to trade in cheap drug tests they can buy in bulk with actually accurate testing equipment than can cost up to $20,000 per device.</p>
<p>As the report states, the 30,000 wrongful arrests is an extreme undercount. Its survey managed to only find 93 law enforcement agencies willing to discuss field drug test use and only 82 of those actually provided enough information to warrant being included in this report. </p>
<p>Of the few that did respond, thereâs even more bad news. This is quite the pair of sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Twelve agencies recently stopped using the tests due to concerns about fentanyl exposure (i.e., a belief that physical contact with fentanyl is, by itself, dangerous for the officer), and two agencies reported that the tests were an unnecessary expense as <strong>suspects were arrested and charged regardless of the test outcome</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you get all of that? Twelve agencies have gone <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/20/omnipresent-fentanyl-copaganda-is-turning-normal-citizens-into-fainting-goats/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2022/07/20/omnipresent-fentanyl-copaganda-is-turning-normal-citizens-into-fainting-goats/">full fainting goat</a> and two agencies flat out admitted they arrested people whether or not the tests indicated illegal substances. And if arrest is the inevitable outcome, why blow money on field drug tests? </p>
<p>Thereâs nothing positive in this report, other than the recommendations it suggests, like refusing plea deals backed by nothing but field tests and ensuring all field tests are verified by lab testing. But if <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/15130336213/more-prosecutors-refuse-to-accept-guilty-pleas-based-faulty-2-field-drug-tests.shtml" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/15130336213/more-prosecutors-refuse-to-accept-guilty-pleas-based-faulty-2-field-drug-tests.shtml">very little of this</a> is happening yet, itâs hard to believe there will be widespread adoption in the future. So, weâll just get what weâve been getting for years: tens of thousands of bogus arrests every year â arrests that will be touted by those performing them as indicative of their tireless service to the War on Drugs. The reality, however, will be tens of thousands of destroyed lives and violated rights by tests so questionable they should never have been considered evidence of anything.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Mixing new technology and new laws is always a fraught business, especially if the tech in question relates to communication. Lawmakers routinely propose bills that would sweep up all sorts of First Amendment-protected speech. We've seen a lot of this with social media, and we're starting to see it with artificial intelligence. Case in point: the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas And Unauthorized Duplications (No AI FRAUD) Act. Under the auspices of protecting "<a href="https://salazar.house.gov/media/press-releases/salazar-introduces-no-ai-fraud-act">Americans' individual right to their likeness and voice</a>," the bill would restrict a range of content wide enough to ensnare parody videos, comedic impressions, political cartoons, and much more.</p> <p>The bill's sponsors, Reps. MarÃ­a Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.) and Madeleine Dean (D-Pa.), say they're concerned about "AI-generated fakes and forgeries," per a <a href="https://salazar.house.gov/media/press-releases/salazar-introduces-no-ai-fraud-act">press release</a>. They aim to protect people from unauthorized use of their own images and voices by defining these things as the intellectual property of each individual.</p> <p>The No AI Fraud Act cites several instances of AI being used to make it appear that celebrities created ads or art that they did not actually create. For instance, "AI technology was used to create the song titled 'Heart on My Sleeve,' emulating the voices of recording artists Drake and The Weeknd," states the bill's text. AI technology was also used "to create a false endorsement featuring Tom Hanks' face in an advertisement for a dental plan."</p> <p>But while the examples in the bill are directly related to AI, the bill's actual reach is much more expansive, targeting a wide swath of "digital depictions" or "digital voice replicas."</p> <p>Salazar and Dean say the bill balances people's "right to control the use of their identifying characteristics" with "First Amendment protections to safeguard speech and innovation." But while the measure does nod to free speech rights, it also expands the types of speech deemed legally acceptable to restrict. It could mean way more legal hassles for creators and platforms interested in exercising their First Amendment rights, and result in a chilling effect on certain sorts of comedy, commentary, and artistic expression.</p> <h2><b>An Insanely Broad Bill&nbsp;</b></h2> <p>At its core, <a href="https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/090C34FC92DED2E83456EB85C8E64E44.no-ai-fraud-act.pdf">the No AI Fraud Act</a> is about creating a right to sue someone who uses your likeness or voice without your permission. It states that "every individual has a property right in their own likeness and voice," and people can only use someone's "digital depiction or digital voice replica" in a "manner affecting interstate or foreign commerce" if the individual agrees (in writing) to said use. This agreement must involve a lawyer, and its terms must be governed by a collective bargaining agreement. If any of these three elements are missing, the person whose voice or likeness was used can sue for damages.</p> <p>The bit about <i>interstate or foreign commerce</i> might appear to significantly limit this bill's provisions. But basically, anything involving the internet can be deemed a matter of interstate or foreign commerce.</p> <p>So just how broad is this bill? For starters, it applies to the voices and depictions of all human beings "living or dead." And it defines <i>digital depiction</i> as any "replica, imitation, or approximation of the likeness of an individual that is created or altered in whole or part using digital technology." <em>Likeness</em> means any "actual or simulated imageâ¦ regardless of the means of creation, that is readily identifiable as the individual." <i>Digital voice replica</i> is defined as any "audio rendering that is created or altered in whole or part using digital technology and is fixed in a sound recording or audiovisual work which includes replications, imitations, or approximations of an individual that the individual did not actually perform." This includes "the actual voice or a simulation of the voice of an individual, whether recorded or generated by computer, artificial intelligence, algorithm, or other digital means, technology, service, or device."</p> <p>These definitions go way beyond using AI to create a fraudulent ad endorsement or musical recording.</p> <p>They're broad enough to include reenactments in a true-crime show, a parody TikTok account, or depictions of a historical figure in a movie.</p> <p>They're broad enough to include sketch-comedy skits, political cartoons, or those Dark Brandon memes.</p> <p>They're broad enough to encompass you using your phone to record an impression of President Joe Biden and posting this online, or a cartoon like<em> South Park</em> or <em>Family Guy</em> including a depiction of a celebrity.</p> <p>And it doesn't matter if the intent is not to trick anyone. The bill says that it's no defense to inform audiences that a depiction "was unauthorized or that the individual rights owner did not participate in the creation, development, distribution, or dissemination of the unauthorized digital depiction, digital voice replica, or personalized closing service."</p> <p>What's more, it's not just the creators of off-limits content that could be sued. Potentially liable parties include anyone who "distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public a personalized closing service"; anyone who "publishes, performs, distributes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to the public a digital voice replica or digital depiction"; and anyone who "materially contributes to, directs, or otherwise facilitates any of the above" with knowledge that the individual depicted had not consented.&nbsp;This is broad enough to ensnare social media platforms, video platforms, newsletter services, web hosting services, and any entity that enables the sharing of art, entertainment, and commentary. It also applies to the makers of tools that merely allow others to create audio replicas or visual depictions, including tools like ChatGPT that allow for the creation of AI-generated images.</p> <h2><b>Butâ¦the First Amendment</b></h2> <p>Apparently aware of obvious First Amendment issues with this proposal, the lawmakers inserted a section saying that "First Amendment protections shall constitute a defense to an alleged violation." But this isn't terribly reassuring, considering that lawmakers are simultaneously trying to expand the categories of speech unprotected by the First Amendment.</p> <p>At present, intellectual propertyâ<a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/law/academics-clinics/what-can-i-study/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-law-basics-certificate/explore-the-four-areas-of-ip-law#:~:text=Intellectual%20Property%20Law%20includes%20patents,ways%20they%20are%20very%20different.">such as copyrighted works and trade secrets</a>âfalls under free speech exceptions, meaning restrictions are permitted. By defining one's voice and likeness as intellectual property, the lawmakers are trying to shoehorn depictions of someone else's voice or likeness into the category of unprotected speech.</p> <p>Even as intellectual property, voice replicas and digital depictions of others wouldn't <em>always</em> be prohibited. Just as the doctrine of <a href="https://reason.com/tag/fair-use/">fair use</a> provides some leeway with copyright protections, this bill defines circumstances under which replicas and depictions would be OK, such as when "the public interest in access to the use" outweighs "the intellectual property interest in the voice or likeness."</p> <p>But even if people being sued ultimately prevail on First Amendment grounds, it still means they have to go to court, with all the time and expense that entails. Even for those with the resources to do this, it would be a big headache. And many people do not have the resources to do this, which means that even when the First Amendment is on their side, they're still likely to lose, to cave (by taking down whatever content is being challenged), or to avoid making said content in the first place.</p> <p>You can see how this might seriously chill speech that is protected. People may be afraid to even create art, comedy, or commentary that could get challenged.&nbsp;And tech companies could be afraid to allow such content on their platforms.</p> <p>If this measure becomes law, I would expect to see a lot more takedowns of anything that might come close to being a violation, be it a clip of a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> skit lampooning Trump, a comedic impression of Taylor Swift, or a weird ChatGPT-generated image of Ayn Rand. I would also expect to see more platforms institute blanket bans on parody accounts and the like.</p> <p>The bill stipulates that imitators aren't liable "if the harm caused by such conduct is negligible." But emotional distress counts as harm, which makes this a pretty subjective designation.</p> <p>And some categories of contentâsuch as "sexually explicit" content and "intimate images"âare declared per se harmful (which means there could be no arguing that they did not actually harm the party being depicted and therefore were not actually violations). Supporters will likely argue that this targets things like deepfake porn (where AI is used to make it appear someone appeared in a porn video when they did not). But the language of the law is broad enough to potentially ensnare a wide range of content, including erotic art, commentary that conjures two political figures intimately involved (like thoseâyes, often silly and sophomoricâimages of Trump and Putin in bed together), and comedic/parodic depictions of sexual encounters.</p> <p>There's no doubt that AI is opening up new parameters for creative expression <em>and</em> for deception, raising new questions and presenting new issues that society will have to deal with. But we shouldn't let lawmakers use these hiccups to justify a broad new incursion on free speech rights.</p>						</div></div>]]></description>

</p><p>Situation: Company A creates a service or buys out Company B and integrates them with their website. Years and years go by, with updates to the service slowing to a complete stop as employees quit or are reassigned. One day, Company A decides managing it is too expensive and not worth the effort, so they shut it down.

</p><p>Situation: Company A runs a service, maybe with a limited market (country, age group etc.) One day multinational Company B appears, covering Company A's services, and soon more and more users think "why not use <i>that</i> service if so many others do?", and a bit later "why use <i>any other</i> service, if everyone uses <i>that</i>?" Unless company A is lucky enough or finds a way to keep users, it can soon end its business, left by the users.
</p><p>Company A may end with symptoms of <a href="#Abandoned">Abandoned</a>, but also may try a redesign to keep users (this can also cause data loss, see <a href="#teh_futurez.211.21">below</a>).
</p><p><b>Exercise</b>: Think of some services you used happily back then, but now even mentioning their name is embarassing. If these services are still active (used by a group of "hardcore" users), it's not too late (but definitely time) to archive them!

</p><p>Situation: Company A does <a rel="nofollow" href="http://itsthisforthat.com/">"Facebook for cats"</a>. Company A grows a small community of loyal <strike>cat soldiers</strike> users, but doesn't gain enough traction to keep things profitable. Company A can't find anyone who's interested in acquiring them, so they shut down.
</p><p>Variation: Company B starts a service that becomes very popular in a short time, showing an exponential growth. CEO of Company B (in fact, just Joey in the garage) has no idea of a good business policy, or never even wanted to make it a big business, so as soon as the HDD gets full, he pulls the plug.

</p><p>Situation: Either Company A releases the new Singing and Dancing Version 2.0 website, which is supposed to succeed nasty old version 1.0, or Company A "pivots" and becomes The All New Shiny Company A. In either case, Company A removes their old website and deletes all of the user data.

<h2>New EU project NGI TALER will bring private and secure online payments to the Eurozone</h2>
<p>
We are excited to announce the creation of a European project December 1st 2023, which 
will run for the next 36 months. This Next Generation Internet pilot named "NGI TALER" is 
operated by a consortium of 11 partners from 8 European countries with the mandate to roll 
out an innovative electronic payment system for the greater benefit of European citizens, 
merchants, and banks. This payment system is different from current online payment 
methods, like credit cards or bank transfers, in that it offers privacy for the buyer: 
neither merchants nor banks can trace or link the payments. It is also a no-risk payment 
option for the merchant as there is no equivalent of fake or stolen credit cards, as 
payments are cleared and confirmed instantly. The payment system is socially, ecologically 
and fiscally responsible: it is not a new currency, there is no energy-consuming 
proof-of-work or proof-of-stake method and clearing is processed much faster than payments 
by credit cards. NGI TALER enforces transparency on the merchants so that states ensure 
that businesses can be held accountable for their income and pay their taxes.
</p>
<p>
NGI TALER is funded as a pilot under the Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative within 
the European Commission's Horizon Europe research funding program. This project is based 
on the free software GNU Taler which has been developed by the GNU community and Taler 
Systems S.A., and which has received wide praise from financial experts including experts 
from several central banks - including the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The goal is to make 
GNU Taler available as payment system via two European banks - GLS Bank (Germany) and 
MagNet Bank (Hungary). NGI TALER's ambition is to reach the European market during the 
project period and have the payment mechanism accepted and widely adopted by the end of 
the project.
</p>
<p>
Under the hood, GNU Taler deploys state-of-the-art cryptography to achieve these features. 
The initial investment into the required infrastructure is low and the payment mechanism 
operates more cost efficiently than existing payment solutions, with lower transaction 
fees - a benefit that will be shared by consumers and merchants. This makes even 
micro-payments possible, creating an interesting and privacy preserving alternative to 
subscription- or advertisement-based revenue for newspapers and other publishers.
</p>
<p>
NGI TALER is coordinated by the Coding Theory and Cryptology group at Eindhoven University 
of Technology and has 10 more partners:
</p><ul>
 <li>Bern University of Applied Sciences (BFH),</li>
 <li>small for-profit (Code Blau GmbH, Taler Systems S.A., VisualVest),</li>
 <li>non-profit structures (petites singularitÃ©s, E-Seniors Association),</li>
 <li>cooperative banks (GLS Bank, MagNet Bank),</li>
 <li>a philanthropic organization (Stichting NLnet) and</li>
 <li>a grassroots movement (Homo Digitalis).</li>
</ul>

        <p>On October 20th, my seven year old son Nikolas suffered cardiac arrest while undergoing a procedure at the hospital to treat an underlying congenital condition. The doctors performed CPR and succeeded in reviving him but ultimately he suffered catastrophic brain damage. My wife and I were in the hospital for nearly a month at his bedside as we awaited his ultimate prognosis.</p><p>What is there to say?</p><div><p><strong>First</strong>, I'm devastated. </p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I'm not going to be giving more details beyond what I write here for now.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, I'll address those the most common questions, and concerns.</p></div><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I'm making major changes to my life.</p><p><strong>Fifth</strong>, I will describe a bit about what this situation feels like from the inside. If you have not experienced this kind of tragedy, it will likely surprise you, as it did me.</p><h2 id="devastation">Devastation</h2><div><p>There's three things everybody says to me now:</p><p>"I can't imagine what you're going through."<br>"I don't know how you're handling it."<br>"That must be so hard."</p><p>These statements are true. If you haven't been through this, you don't get it. So let me tell you all about it. It'll be okay. Well, actually it's <em>not </em>okay, but it's okay that it's not okay.</p></div><p>My son is alive, but all of his higher mental functions have been wiped out. He still sleeps and wakes, breathes under his own power, and responds to certain stimuli, but he makes no intentional movements. He moves reflexively, and occasionally smiles and even laughs, but he can't speak and it's not clear what degree of awareness he still has of his situation, if any. The MRI results were conclusive that the damage was widespread and severe, and to such a degree that short of an outright miracle, there is no hope for regeneration through brain "plasticity" or any other known path towards recovery. People don't come back from this kind of injury.</p><p>That's important to say. I believe in miracles, but part and parcel of that belief is the acknowledgement that miracles are by definition rare, and the faith that God is able to grant them must be paired with a complete lack of presumption of receiving one (Daniel 3:17-18, emphases mine):</p><blockquote><sup>17</sup><strong> If it be so</strong>, our God whom we serve <strong>is able to deliver us </strong>from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.<br><sup>18</sup><strong> But if not,</strong> be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</blockquote><p>I would be delighted to hear Nikolas' voice calling out to me tomorrow morning, but I hold no lingering hope that this will happen. That's what it takes to get me through my day. </p><p>I'm reminded of one the little flavor quotes in Act VII in my game <em>Defender's Quest: Valley of the Forgotten</em>:</p><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png" alt="Act VII: It is said that men fear death. In my experience, what men truly fear is the uncertainty of death. In all that ordeal, when death was certain, I was possessed by an unassailable calm I have never felt before or since. It was only when the hope of survival appeared that I felt the true grip of terror. - from the Memoirs of Gedemon Dalavbar, Master of Archers, being a History of his Adventures and Exploits in Service to the Ash King" loading="lazy" width="1704" height="960" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/image-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/image-1.png 1704w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My friend James Cavin, the game's writer, wrote those words over a decade ago, and I couldn't think of a better way to describe the strangeness of my current situation.</p><p>While hope yet remained, I suffered the most. The most devastating moment in the hospital was opening the MRI report. Up until then we were clinging to hope, and afterwards there was nothing left to do but to live with the loss. Our crushed hopes allow us to get on with the long road ahead.</p><p>As for "I can't imagine how hard that must be"â</p><p>Turns out, unfathomable tragic loss isn't very <em>hard</em>. It's <em>easy</em>, in fact. Easy in the same way that falling off a cliff is "easy"âgravity does all the work for you. It's not like climbing mount Everest, desperately putting one foot in front of the other. It's not like struggling to answer questions in a final exam. Tragic loss is just something that happens to you.</p><h2 id="its-not-hard-just-terrible">It's not hard, just terrible. </h2><p>The grief is different than people expect, too. I cried a lot, but after a certain point you only have so many tears left to cry. I can't cry all day, every day, for months on end.</p><p>And honestly, at this point crying feels <em>good</em>. Crying isn't really when I feel like I'm suffering the most, although I think people on the outside sort of had that expectation. There's this implicit assumption from other people that you will have a very legible grief, to "put on sad-face," so to speak.</p><p>But!</p><p>This isn't one of those essays where the author describes their personal suffering in great detail and then passively aggressively berates all the readers who haven't suffered to the exact same level for being somehow morally deficient, as has become vogue in the popular press over the last ten years.</p><p>Because guess what â two months ago I would have been <em>just like </em>most of you! Two months ago, if I were talking to someone who was in the position I find myself in now, I'd ask all the same "insensitive" and "inappropriate" questions, all the while being desperately afraid I was being insensitive and inappropriate. So everyone should just relax. I lost my son, it's terrible. No, you're not a bad person for asking me how I'm doing. Yes, everything's weird. I know you don't know what to say. I don't know what to say either. Nobody does. It's fine. </p><h2 id="what-were-in-for">What We're In For</h2><p>My son is alive, severely brain damaged, bedridden, and unable to care for himself. We took him off of all medical supports and moved him into home hospice care. This means that we stopped the artificial ventilator and IV's, as well as all medicines and treatments other than those aimed at comfort and pain relief, and moved him into a hospital bed we have installed at home. </p><p>The doctors initially thought he would quickly die after being taken off the ventilator, but he has persisted for about a month now. He receives food and water through a feeding tube, medicine for pain relief and comfort, and daily care from my wife and I as well as from hospice nurses who visit during the week. </p><p>The fact is, Nikolas could very well live for years or even decades to come, and my wife and I will take care of him up until that moment. We do not stand for euthanasia, but neither will we prolong his life through heroic and artificial life support measures. Food, water, comfort, and daily careâthese he will receive from us, indefinitely.</p><p>This is not the sort of thing that can be easily outsourced unless I were to commit my son to a facility, which we will not do as it would drastically reduce our ability to see him on a daily basis. This puts a large daily burden of work, material expense, and restriction on personal freedom. We take this burden gladly.</p><p>Fortunately, we have been able to qualify for public medical assistance in this regard and it looks like we are going to be financially okay for the time being. I am grateful that I also have a strong private support network should I have to lean on it. <strong>To be 100% clear, I am not asking for money and I neither need nor want anyone to offer me any.</strong></p><h2 id="changes">Changes</h2><p>My nearly complete game, <em>Defender's Quest 2: Mists of Ruin</em> was originally supposed to ship at the end of 2023, but that's now been obviously delayed. I'm very grateful to our publisher, Armor Games, for being understanding in the midst of this tragedy.</p><p>A couple things are changing from the original plan before this all happened.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, this is the end of my professional game career. There will be a lot I have to say about this in the future, but the short version is with all the obligations I now have (particularly ongoing medical expenses) I am suddenly in the need of a much more stable, predictable, and boring career. I was successful early on, but as the years went by I found myself having to juggle development with any number of day jobs and side gigs due to the inherent instability of indie game development. I've loved my time in games, but I have to move on. I will write a post-mortem of my 10+ years in games sometime, as I have had some real accomplishments above and beyond the two Defender's Quest games that I am quite proud of to this day.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, I am no longer a daily member of the DQ2 development team. This is particularly painful for me given that I was nearly at the end of a ten year journey for a game that's been in development since before any of my three children were born, but losing one of those children has upended my priorities.</p><p>But DQ2 is neither cancelled nor abandoned. </p><p>It was always Level Up Labs, LLC, not Lars Doucet, who bore the ultimate responsibility for the game's development, and I am but a part of that company. My co-founder, Anthony Pecorella, has heroically stepped up to the plate and coordinated the final stages of development in my absence. I am still in an advisory role and will make sure the final game is a good one, but I simply no longer have the capacity to do this with the new daily burdens in my life. I will try, if possible, to make sure we fulfill all of the pre-order campaign obligations (I've kept all the records), but I will ask for people's understandings if we fall short in certain regards or some of the goodies wind up being delayed. </p><p>As always, if you are unhappy with your preorder for any reason, email leveluplabs@gmail.com and we will cheerfully refund your money.</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, GameDataCrunch.com is officially defunct for good, at least under my direction. I still have all the source code, scripts, databases and other stuff for it, so anyone with decent web development skills (it's mostly just a pile of php, javascript, cron jobs, and MySQL) could easily resurrect it and keep it going. I have some people in mind for this already, but if you want to make your own pitch for why I should turn it over to you I'd be more than happy to hear it: email me at lars dot doucet at gmail dot com.</p><p><strong>Fourth</strong>, I now have one and only one job, which is working on real estate mass appraisal valuation technology for the purposes of accurately and credibly measuring the value of land separately from buildings and improvements. This is the kind of straightforward, steady, stable, boring work that I need to support my family right now. It also conveniently lines up with <a href="https://www.landisabigdeal.com/?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">my niche interests</a>.</p><p>And with that, I'm left with the new normal.</p><h2 id="its-strange">It's Strange</h2><p>I'm shocked at how quickly our family adapted to the situation. Our two girls (ages five and ten) have proved remarkably resilient, and help with Nikolas' daily care with eagerness and calm. We still read to him at bed time, pray with him, and sing his favorite songs. I know that he almost certainly can't hear us in his current physical form, and though I don't know how eternity relates to the physical world that's welded to the arrow of time, I like to think that Nikolas watches us from Heaven and hears us in that way (and perhaps I am watching there alongside him from the other side).</p><p>The best metaphor I can give for the daily home hospice care of your own seven year old son is a monastic vocation. It's menial work, tied to the hours of the day, an obligation and an obedience, for the rest of my life, or his, whichever comes first. Nikolas has becomes a living altar to his own memory.</p><p>I do not want to paint an overly rosy picture. I re-experience the trauma of losing him every time I see him, and it is deeply painful to see him in his reduced state. But all I have left to give him is my love, expressed in his daily care.</p><p>There are many costs, and not just in terms of time and money. My wife and I can no longer leave the house at the same time without finding someone with adequate training to watch over Nikolas while we are gone. I'm grateful that we were fairly boring homebound personalities, as this means we have been forced to give up much less than other couples would experience in this situation.</p><p>I won't be traveling much in the future, for obvious reasons, but we will find a way to make the most essential trips should the need arise.</p><p>The other thing I want to convey to people is that although I'm sad and experiencing a great loss, I cling relentlessly to joy. Since I was a small child I always hated a particular kind of tragic story, and I still feel that way today. I did not hate tragedies in general, or any story with a sad ending, but specifically the kind of story where not only does something terrible happen to beloved characters, but the kind of story where it's very obvious that the author is making some kind of nihilistic statement in doing so, sort of turning to face the reader, saying, <em>Now do you see, you naÃ¯ve moron? Life is naught but pain, and you're a fool and a worm for not being as miserable as me!</em></p><p>Enough.</p><p>Look, the news media inundates us every day with endless tales of genuine horror and suffering, because in a world with billions of people <em>that will always be happening somewhere</em>. Life is and will always be fundamentally unfair, and the vale of tears filled with a never-ending parade of horrors. And yet, it's also true that for the median person on Earth, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better?ref=fortressofdoors.com" rel="noreferrer">life is much better today than ever before in human history</a>. </p><p>My own story is exactly one such example â the fact that I'm devastated to lose my son to a crippling injury highlights another factâthat this very thing has become so rare in my country as to be "unimaginable." We should rejoice at this! Losing a child used to be so unremarkably commonplace that <em>everyone</em>, even emperors and kings, routinely suffered it until approximately yesterday.</p><p>The correct adjective for the tragedy I'm experiencing is not "unimaginable" but <em>unfathomable</em>. I can imagine it just fine because it's happening to me, and you can imagine it too now because I'm describing it to you. And because we can imagine it, we can turn and face it, and, with God's grace, we can lift up our cross and bear it, somehow. </p><p>But what none of us can do is to measureâto <em>fathomâ</em>the depth of it.</p><blockquote>Stand at the brink of the abyss of despair, and when you see that you cannot bear it anymore, draw back a little and have a cup of tea.<p>â Elder Sophrony of Essex</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 600w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1000w, https://www.fortressofdoors.com/content/images/2023/12/DALL-E-2023-12-02-15.50.18---A-serene--contemplative-scene-inspired-by-Elder-Sophrony-of-Essex-s-quote.-The-image-depicts-a-peaceful-landscape-with-a-deep--dark-abyss-in-the-backg-1.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html">https://getpolarized.io/2019/05/11/portable-web-documents.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39036774">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><img src="https://getpolarized.io/assets/images/portable-web-documents-scaled.png">

<p>Portable Web Documents are a technology similar to PDFs (Portable Document
Format) implemented in Polar which support offline caching of full HTML
documents, and with (in the future) improved support for video, charts, and
other compelling features.</p>
<p>Polar uses PWDs and PDFs to manage the users reading and allows the user to keep
all documents in a central repository and allows for suspend/resume of reading,
tagging, and annotation.</p>
<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkEo5YmNukY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Why a New Document Format?</h2>
<p>PDFs are great and have gotten us pretty far to date but I think their future
is limited.</p>
<p>They're perfect for laying out text and charts in a static format plus
preserving the document long term and of course sending them via email or
storing them in the cloud.</p>
<p>But they also have a few major limitations.</p>
<p>They only support static layouts - not fluid/dynamic layouts that change when
you resize the page.</p>
<p>Don't have support for features like video, animated images, interactive charts.</p>
<p>They also have limited form support.</p>
<p>Printing HTML pages as PDFs is also difficult as HTML wasn't designed to be
paginated and without explicit support for CSS form-feed on certain items
(large images) the resulting PDF becomes mangled and hard to read. </p>
<h2>HTML in a Portable Document Format?</h2>
<p>What if we could combine the benefits of PDFs with the benefits of HTML content?</p>
<p>HTML is amazing and supports a lot of compelling features that are not possible
in PDF but they're also limited in a few key areas.</p>
<p>If any of the resources in your document vanishes it's effectively broken.</p>
<p>It would also be nice to have the ability to cache a page offline in perpetuity.  </p>
<p>HTML pages can (for the most part) be censored.  If your ISP or government orders
a website offline you might be out of luck.</p>
<h2>Portable Web Documents to the Rescue</h2>
<p>Polar supports a file format called Portable Web Documents (PWDs) (note
internally we still refer to these as PHZs since we're still in development of a
finalize document format) which supports the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>PWDs are essentially a full HTML document including all dependent resources
bundled in a zip file archive.</p>
<p>There are some associated file formats like WARC and MHTML that attempt to solve
this problem but only really get you about 30-50% of a complete solution.</p>
<p>WARCs or example can't actually be loaded properly in Chrome due to chrome's
inability to handle service workers elegantly in chrome extensions or to serve
resources directly via request handlers. </p>
<p>Request handlers can only redirect you to a new URL.  They can't really replace
content.   </p>
<p>Due to cross origin issues and other web complexities it's better to take the
entire document, rewrite the URLs and properly handle dependent resources,
and re-bundle into a new layout which bypasses all these technical challenges.</p>
<h2>Capture and Storage.</h2>
<p>Capture is by far the biggest challenge in making PWDs as representing the
original form an intent of the web designer (and the reader) as a document can
sometimes be very challenging.</p>
<p>To create a PWD we first have to capture it and this requires support from the
browser.</p>
<p>Right now Polar implements capture via Electron.  We allow the user to preview
the URL then store the data directly into a rewritten PWD image.</p>
<p>However, the web isn't really static anymore.</p>
<p>You can't just take the CSS stylesheets and  references and store them.</p>
<p>You also have to look at the <em>live</em> DOM.</p>
<p>Many toolkits like React actually modify the DOM directly and manipulate and
redefine CSS styles.  These have to be written correctly or you will break
page load.</p>
<p>Now you have to deactivate all scripts and event handlers so that when the
PWD loads it's in a neutralized document. You wouldn't want scripts running due
to potential security issues.</p>
<p>Now you have to think about web fonts, iframes, and potentially extract metadata
from the page including title, description and possibly microdata so that the
PWD has the same metadata exposed in its internal metadata manifest.</p>
<p>This is just an abbreviated list of course of some of the challenges.  There are
another 10-20 issues that we have to be careful when creating PWDs.</p>
<p>We still have some challenges now that we're unsure how to handle.</p>
<p>For example, some iframes only load when they're visible so we enabled a cheat
to expand the preview window to trigger them to load.</p>
<p>However, this caused another ugly bug where some websites like to 'auto-paginate'
so that when you're at the bottom of a page you're given a full related article
in the hope that you stay with the site longer.</p>
<p>These issues are mutually exclusive though.  A solution for one breaks the
solution for the other so we're stuck in a catch 22 until we have a workaround.</p>
<h2>Current Limitations</h2>
<p>We do have some limitations currently which I'd like to lift in the future.</p>
<p>Technically we only support static layouts. PWDs could also support fully fluid
layouts as well which would be really exciting.</p>
<p>It would be nice to support caching of video, audio, images, and interactive
charts.  </p>
<p>This would make PWDs sort of like a 'young lady's illustrated primer' (if you've
ever read Diamond Age) where a book is now fully interactive.</p>
<p>This would also mean that this interactivity would work offline and be fully
interactive!  </p>
<p>Right now Polar is limited to capturing within Electron which means we can't
access the user's cookies and prevents some URLs from loading properly.</p>
<p>We're porting our capture code to our chrome extension to mitigate this and
this should be fixed shortly.</p>
<h2>The Future</h2>
<p>Polar wanted something like PWDs so that we can enable some cool features in the
future.</p>
<p>The first (which we have now actually) is just full offline archival of web
pages to prevent them from being deleted.  If the content is important you don't
want it to vanish.</p>
<p>We also want a way for users to collaborate around web content.  Add
annotations, comments, etc.</p>
<p>We ideally don't want the content to vanish so PWDs allow us to keep it
associated with the users document store.</p>
<p>We'd also like to enable features where users can exchange documents directly
without relying on the original site.</p>
<p>This allows us to bypass censorship for documents that might be sensitive
outside of their host country.  </p>
<p>We also want to support video, audio, and interactive charting formats. Video
is a bit difficult as we need to determine how to stream and store the video
within the compressed archive and stream it efficiently.  </p>
<p>Our plan is to use web workers and service workers to decompress it in a
background thread.</p>
<p>Interactive charts and spreadsheets are also compelling but I don't want to just
enable raw Javascript support.  It might be possible that something like WASM
could solve this by putting the controls in a sandbox.</p>
<p>We also need a strategy to preserve teh fonts long term.  Right now we don't
store the fonts along with the PWD because they can increase the size by about
2x.  </p>
<p>It might be nice for a system like Polar to have sort of a shared CDN so that
fonts are only stored once but this creates problems with dependencies which
aren't ideal.</p>
<h2>Working with Portable Web Documents</h2>
<p>If you'd like to play with the current version of PWDs download Polar and take
it for a spin.</p>
<p>Right now you can view them in the webapp but can't create them so you need to
download the desktop version of Polar.</p>
<p>We're planning on fixing this issue in the next big refactor to embed the
capture process in our chrome extension.</p>
<p>Once created the captured document is stored within Polar as a normal document
just like any PDF doc.</p>
<p>You get all the normal Polar features including tagging, annotation, flashcard
creation, cloud sync, etc.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback please jump on our Discord or create a github issue.</p></section></div>]]></description>

                  Web Components
                </h2><p>Web Components are a set of browser APIs that allow us to create custom HTML elements. <strong>They are one of the major things that SPA (Single Page Application) frameworks have been giving us for a long time.</strong> Frameworks like Vue, React, Angular or Svelte have their own approach and APIs for creating and using reusable, isolated UI components. This framework-specific philosophy has been widely used for quite a long time right now. It has a few unfortunate consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>It depends on a specific framework </li>
<li>Complexity - to be used productively, most SPA frameworks require complex tooling and host of dependencies</li>
<li>Components can be reused only in the context of a specific framework</li>
<li>Framework updates often render components not usable anymore (anyone has changed, or tried to, major versions of Vue or React recently?)</li>
<li>If we decide to change the framework, we have to throw away our own components or a library we were using, and migrate to another one. This new library might not have everything that we need or may have a completely different API</li>
<li>We need to learn the specifics of each framework in order to use and create components. This knowledge is framework-specific and not universal at all</li>
</ul>
<p><br>Luckily, for quite a long time right now, we have <em>Web Components</em>, native to the browser way of creating reusable, custom HTML elements. In a nutshell, <strong>we can encapsulate any behavior we want in the specific JavaScript class. We can then use it in the HTML, in the same way as we use <em>div</em>, <em>p</em>, <em>input</em>, <em>button</em> or any other, browser-native element</strong>.</p>
<p>Creating <em>Web Components</em> is extremely straightforward. To illustrate, let's say that we would like to have something like this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;custom-message 
  category="Curiosities" 
  message="Some interesting message"&gt;
&lt;/custom-message&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>All we need is a few lines of JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code>class CustomMessage extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    const category = this.getAttribute("category");
    const message = this.getAttribute("message");
    this.innerHTML = `
      &lt;div&gt;You've got an interesting message, from ${category} category:&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;${message}&lt;/div&gt;`;
  }
}

customElements.define('custom-message', CustomMessage);
</code></pre>
<p><strong>That is all! No extra tooling and zero dependencies required.</strong> If we add to this the ability to observe attribute values changes and lifecycle callbacks:</p>
<pre><code>...

static observedAttributes = ["category", "message"];

attributeChangedCallback(name, oldValue, newValue) {
  console.log(`${name} attribute was changed from ${oldValue} to ${newValue}!`);
}

connectedCallback() {
  console.log("Element was added to the DOM!");
}

disconnectedCallback() {
  console.log("Element was removed from the DOM!");    
}

...
</code></pre>
<p>...there is virtually no limit to what we can do with <em>Web Components</em>! Moreover, <strong>there is also a possibility of creating Shadow (hidden) DOM with scoped CSS, but it is quite complex, has its drawbacks and is frankly not needed in the majority of cases</strong>. Because of that, we will stick with the basics here:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating custom elements in JavaScript by extending <em>HTMLElement</em> class and registering them in the <em>customElements</em> registry</li>
<li>consuming custom elements in the HTML</li>
<li>using plain old DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS</li>
<li>using lifecycle callbacks and attributes change observers</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we shall ask the question: how and why can we utilize <em>Web Components</em> in the context of <em>HTMX</em>?</p>

                <h2 id="htmx">
                  HTMX
                </h2><p>I wrote quite an extensive article about <a href="https://htmx.org/" target="_blank"><em>HTMX</em></a> which you can find <a href="https://binaryigor.com/htmx-simpler-web-based-app-or-system.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
For the sake of completeness, let's give a short definition: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows making arbitrary http requests from any HTML element, not only from forms, links or videos. It expects HTML in response, and renders whole HTML pages or fragments directly in the page section we have specified. We do not need to exchange JSON or any other data format with the server only to then translate it to HTML on the client side, so that it can be rendered. It is done automatically by HTMX, we just need to use its own, custom HTML attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>It is highly interesting, useful and a promising technology. It simplifies many things and allows us to build <em>SPA</em> or <em>SPA-like</em> applications without complex tooling, dependencies, frameworks and mostly without writing application-specific JavaScript code. In a way, it is a JavaScript library thanks to which we do not need to write our own JavaScript. We can just have one application, no frontend/backend distinction, and that is it (simplifying a little of course, but <a href="https://www.ufried.com/blog/simplify_1/" target="_blank">it simplifies soo many things</a>). There is one thing that I find missing though. There is no straightforward way to create isolated and reusable components where we can encapsulate HTML templates and JavaScript (if needed) related to a given component. <strong>Wouldn't it be amazing, if we can create a library of reusable, framework-agnostic components that can be then used in all HTMX-based applications?</strong> All of that is perfectly doable with Web Components, so let's dive in!</p>

                <h2 id="assumptions">
                  Assumptions
                </h2><p>In our solution, we make the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>We will not use <em>Shadow DOM</em>. HTMX does not work with it and I would argue that it complicates things and is mostly not needed to create useful, isolated and reusable Web Components</li>
<li>We will make our components fully configurable from the outside. This generic approach will allow us to arbitrarily, externally style these components, make using them together with HTMX extremely simple, and at the same time components do not need to know anything about HTMX</li>
<li>For styling, we will use <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>. We could also use custom, scoped CSS, but it is significantly easier to do with Tailwind, and it is an amazing and astoundingly simple tool on its own, so why not use it? </li>
<li>This is about <em>Web Components</em> in the context of <em>HTMX</em> afterall, so they need to be easy to use together. Luckily, point <em>2.</em> covers us here</li>
</ol>

                <h2 id="solution-walkthrough">
                  Solution walkthrough
                </h2><p>Repo with referenced code, all and more examples can be found <a href="https://github.com/BinaryIgor/code-examples/tree/master/flexible-web-components" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I wanted to be as generic as possible, but at the same time to have as simple API as possible, so to make configuring our components simple (by HTML attributes) I have come up with the following convention:</p>
<pre><code>{component-element}:{attribute}="{value}"
</code></pre>
<p>To illustrate how it works, here is the <em>InfoModal</em> example (classes are from Tailwind CSS):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="info-modal" 
  container:class="bg-black/80"
  content:class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5"
  message:class="text-lg italic"
  close:class="text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"
  close-icon="&amp;#10006;"&gt;
&lt;/info-modal&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, <em>container:*</em> attributes will be copied without <em>container:</em> prefix to the <em>container element</em> of the <em>info-modal</em> component. <em>Content:*</em> attributes will be copied without <em>content:</em> prefix to the <em>content element</em> and so on, for all supported and exposed elements of the <em>info-modal</em> component. Resulting HTML is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="info-modal" 
  container:class="bg-black/80" 
  content:class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5" 
  message:class="text-lg italic" 
  close:class="text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"
  close-icon="&amp;#10006;"&gt;

  &lt;!-- style attributes are set internally by the component --&gt;
  &lt;div 
    style="display: none;" 
    &lt;!-- container has its own non-overridable class, ours is appended --&gt;
    class="fixed z-10 left-0 top-0 w-full h-full overflow-auto bg-black/80"&gt;
    &lt;div 
      style="position: relative;" 
      class="bg-amber-300 border-solid border-4 border-black rounded-md m-auto mt-32 px-8 pt-8 pb-32 w-3/5"&gt;
      &lt;span 
        &lt;!-- close has its own non-overridable class, ours is appended --&gt;
        class="absolute top-0 right-0 text-2xl p-4 cursor-pointer"&gt;
          &amp;#10006;
      &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;!-- title has its own default class --&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2"&gt;Default title&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;!-- message does not have a default class, ours is set --&gt;
      &lt;div class="text-lg italic"&gt;Default message&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/info-modal&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><br>To make it possible, I created a <em>Components object</em>, which has the following, main method:</p>
<pre><code>export const Components = {
  // element is a custom element reference,
  // elementId is a name of atrributes element,
  // like "container", "content", "input" and so on
  mappedAttributes(element, elementId,
    { defaultAttributes = {},
      defaultClass = "",
      // add (concatenate) attributes/class to the current ones
      toAddAttributes = {},
      toAddClass = "",
      // skip some attributes while copying/transforming
      toSkipAttributes = [],
      // change content:class to class, 
      // while copying attributes, or keep it as it is
      keepId = false } = {}) {

    let baseAttributes = baseAtrributesFromDefaults(defaultAttributes, defaultClass);

    let mappedAttributes = mappedAttributesWithDefaults(element, elementId, baseAttributes, toSkipAttributes, keepId);

    mappedAttributes = mappedAttributesWithToAddValues(mappedAttributes, toAddAttributes, toAddClass);

    // turn this map of element attributes into a string like:
    // id="custom-element-id"
    // class="custom-element-class"
    // hx-post="/validate"
    return Object.entries(mappedAttributes)
      .map(e =&gt; `${e[0]}="${e[1]}"`)
      .join("\n");
},

...
</code></pre>
<p>Default attributes will be overridden by anything that a client supplies and additional attributes will be added to the current ones, using simple string concatenation. <em>DefaultClass</em> and <em>toAddClass</em> are treated in the same way as <em>defaultAttributes</em> and <em>toAddAttributes</em> - they are separate parameters for the sake of API simplicity.</p>
<p>We then make use of the <em>Components object</em> in our custom components (<em>InfoModal</em> again):</p>
<pre><code>...

const containerAttributes = Components.mappedAttributes(this, "container", {
  toAddClass: containerClass,
  defaultClass: containerClassDefault
});
const contentAttributes = Components.mappedAttributes(this, "content", {
  defaultClass: contentClassDefault
});

...

this.innerHTML = `
&lt;div style="display: none;" ${containerAttributes}&gt;
  &lt;div style="position: relative;" ${contentAttributes}&gt;
    &lt;span ${closeAttributes}&gt;${closeIcon}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;div ${titleAttributes}&gt;${titleToRender}&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div ${messageAttributes}&gt;${messageToRender}&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;`;

...
</code></pre>
<p>As we can see, <strong>this is extremely generic and has nothing to do with HTMX: we just allow to inject arbitrary, external attributes into all elements exposed by a component</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Using HTMX is mostly about setting its attributes on HTML elements.</strong> Our generic approach has thus interesting consequences: we can take components created in that way (without any knowledge about HTMX) and use them together with HTMX in the following manner (<em>InputWithError</em>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-with-error 
  input:type="text"
  input:name="message"
  input:placeholder="Input something..."
  &lt;!-- HTMX starts here --&gt;
  input:hx-post="/validate"
  input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
  input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
  input:hx-target="next input-error"&gt;
&lt;/input-with-error&gt;
</code></pre>

                <h2 id="htmx-examples">
                  HTMX examples
                </h2><p>Let's walk through a few concrete examples of <em>Web Components</em> used together with <em>HTMX</em>.</p>

                <h3 id="confirmable-modal">
                  Confirmable Modal
                </h3><p>We quite often face a need for certain requests to be confirmed by the user, before actually issuing them. There is a special HTMX attribute that we can use for that purpose: <a href="https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-confirm/" target="_blank">hx-confirm</a>. Having <em>confirmable-modal</em> similar to <em>info-modal</em> from one of the previous examples, we can write the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;confirmable-modal 
  title="Delete confirmation"
  ok-text="Delete"&gt;
&lt;/confirmable-modal&gt;

&lt;button 
  hx-delete="/test"
  hx-confirm="Are you sure to delete this test entity?"
  hx-target="#delete-result"&gt;
  Try to confirm
&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To capture requests, sent by HTMX, and show <em>confirmable-modal</em> beforehand, we need to add the following JavaScript to our page:</p>
<pre><code>const confirmableModal = document.querySelector("confirmable-modal");

document.addEventListener("htmx:confirm", e =&gt; {
  // do not issue http request
  e.preventDefault();

  confirmableModal.onOk = () =&gt; {
    // ok clicked, issue stopped previously http request
    e.detail.issueRequest(e);
    // hide modal after sending the request
    confirmableModal.hide();
  };

  // show confirmable modal with question configured through htmx attribute
  confirmableModal.show({ message: e.detail.question });
});
</code></pre>
<p>This will show our modal before issuing a http request which looks like:</p>

</figure>



                <h3 id="order-form-and-list">
                  Order Form and List
                </h3><p>Building on previously shown <em>input-with-error</em> and <em>info-modal</em>, we can have a <em>form-container</em> that provides common form functionalities. As the name suggests, it is just a container, so it accepts and can work with any number of inputs, specification of which is left completely to a client. Common form functionalities include features like enabling/disabling form submission, clearing all inputs after successful submission, or showing generic error after failed submission. In the context of HTMX, having a form element allows us to send all form inputs data in a straightforward way. To make the example more relevant to HTMX, in the form we will be able to specify a new <em>order</em> entity. After failed submission, an error will be shown, using <em>info-modal</em>. After successful submission, a new <em>order</em> will be added to the orders list. Here is the simplified HTML:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;info-modal 
  id="error-modal" 
  &lt;!-- Add value to default title class attribute --&gt;
  title:add:class="text-red-500" 
  title="Something went wrong..."&gt;
&lt;/info-modal&gt;

&lt;form-container
  form:id="order-form"
  form:class="rounded bg-slate-200 p-2 max-w-screen-md"
  form:hx-post="/orders"
  form:hx-target="#orders"
  submit:class="py-2 rounded bg-slate-100 mt-4 w-full"
  submit:value="Add Order"&gt;

  &lt;input-with-error 
    container:class="mb-2"
    &lt;!-- Add value to default input class attribute --&gt;
    input:add:class="w-full"
    input:name="id"
    input:placeholder="Order id"
    input:hx-post="/orders/validate-id"
    input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
    input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
    input:hx-target="next-input-error"
    &lt;!-- Send also secret input from below (secret-input is its id),
     id and secret validations are related --&gt;
    input:hx-include="#secret-input"&gt;
  &lt;/input-with-error&gt;
    
  &lt;!-- Similar to above, definitions of other inputs:
   name, description, secret --&gt;

&lt;/form-container&gt;

&lt;ul id="orders" class="space-y-2 max-w-screen-md"&gt;
  ${ordersHtml()}
&lt;/ul&gt;

...

function ordersHtml() {
  return orders.map(o =&gt;
  `&lt;div class="rounded bg-slate-100 p-2"&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Id: ${o.id}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Name: ${o.name}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Description: ${o.description}&lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;div&gt;Secret: ${o.secret}&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;`)
  .join("\n");
}
</code></pre>
<p><br>Additionally, we need to add some JavaScript, so that <em>info-modal</em> and a few of the <em>form-container</em> features can work:</p>
<pre><code>const errorModal = document.getElementById("error-modal");

const formContainer = document.querySelector("form-container");

formContainer.addEventListener("htmx:afterRequest", e =&gt; {
  const form = document.getElementById("order-form");
  // we only care about requests sent by the form,
  // not other of its many elements (inputs mainly)
  if (e.srcElement == form) {
    // error text response from the server
    const error = e.detail.failed ? e.detail.xhr.response : "";
    // this will enable form submission again,
    // and clear inputs only if error is empty/undefined
    formContainer.afterSubmit({ error: error });
    // show error only if there is one
    if (error) {
      errorModal.show({ message: error });
    }
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p><br>This how it looks with input errors:</p>

                <h2 id="flexible-and-copyable-web-components-collection">
                  Flexible and Copyable Web Components collection
                </h2><p>With the described approach, it is possible to create a collection of generic, reusable, flexible and framework-agnostic Web Components. <strong>When it comes to UI components, I think white box philosophy is superior: we should have access to the simple source code of components, they should be designed to be copied and possibly tinker with, and not used as a black box dependency.</strong> This is because, it is often the case that a given component <em>almost</em> matches our needs, but not exactly - in that situation it is a true lifesaver to have control and ability to change them. <a href="https://tailwindui.com/" target="_blank">Tailwind UI</a> takes a similar approach, but is not open-sourced; it is a paid tool and it focuses on framework-specific components.</p>
<p>There are a few libraries and collections of Web Components out there, most notably <a href="https://shoelace.style/" target="_blank">Shoelace</a>. This is a step in the right direction, but unfortunately, they also use other tools, dependencies and additional abstractions and take a rather black box approach - they are meant to be used as a closed dependency, not something to copy, understand and tinker with. Additionally, they mostly use <em>Shadow DOM</em> and because of that, they can not be used with <em>HTMX</em>. I would love to see a collection of components created with a similar approach to the one described here: without unnecessary abstractions and with different, white box philosophy in mind. It means that these components would have a simple to understand source code with zero or minimal dependencies. Furthermore, they would be completely configurable from the outside, designed to be rather copied and possibly modified - not used as a black box dependency.</p>

                  Closing thoughts
                </h2><p>As we saw, Web Components are extremely easy to create and use with HTMX. <strong>They solve an important problem when working with HTMX: how and where should we define reusable components that also might need to use JavaScript to enhance their behavior, not only HTML?</strong> Additionally, if created with described here, generic approach to configuration through attributes, they can be extremely flexible and reusable:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;input-with-error 
  container:class="mb-2"
  input:add:class="w-full"
  input:type="password"
  input:name="secret"
  input:id="secret-input"
  input:placeholder="Order secret, compatibility with id is required"     
  input:hx-post="/orders/validate-secret"
  input:hx-trigger="input changed delay:500ms"
  input:hx-swap="outerHTML"
  input:hx-target="next input-error"
  input-error:id="secret-error"&gt;
&lt;/input-with-error&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Even though they do not know anything about HTMX, it turns out that it is a breeze to connect these two technologies!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>PANAMA CITY (AP) â A severe drought that began last year has forced authorities to slash ship crossings by 36% in the Panama Canal, one of the world's most important trade routes.</p><div id="details-body" data-words="350" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>PANAMA CITY (AP) â A severe drought that began last year has forced authorities to slash ship crossings by 36% in the Panama Canal, one of the world's most important trade routes.</p>
              <p>The new cuts announced Wednesday by authorities in Panama are set to deal an even greater economic blow than previously expected. </p>
              <p>Canal administrators now estimate that dipping water levels could cost them between $500 million and $700 million in 2024, compared to previous estimates of $200 million. </p>
              <p>One of the most severe droughts to ever hit the Central American nation has stirred chaos in the 50-mile maritime route, causing a traffic jam of boats, casting doubts on the canal's reliability for international shipping and raising concerns about its affect on global trade.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday, Panama Canal Administrator Ricaurte VÃ¡squez said they would cut daily ship crossings to 24, after already gradually slashing crossings last year from 38 a day in normal times.</p>
              <p>"It's vital that the country sends a message that we're going to take this on and find a solution to this water problem," VÃ¡squez said.</p>
              <p>VÃ¡squez added that in the first quarter of the fiscal year the passageway saw 20% less cargo and 791 fewer ships than the same period the year before.</p>
              <p>It was a âsignificant reductionâ for the country, VÃ¡squez said. But the official said that more âefficientâ water management and a jump in rainfall in November has at least enabled them to ensure that water levels are high enough for 24 ships to pass daily until the end of April, the start of the next rainy season.</p>
              <p>Canal authorities attributed the drought to the El NiÃ±o weather phenomenon and climate change, and warned it was urgent for Panama to seek new water sources for both the canal's operations and human consumption. The same lakes that fill the canal also provide water for more than 50% of the country of more than 4 million people.</p>
              <p>âThe water problem is a national problem, not just of the Canal,â VÃ¡squez said. âWe have to address this issue across the entire country.â</p>

<p>Private equity firms are increasingly buying hospitals across the US, and when they do, patients suffer, according to two separate reports. Specifically, the equity firms cut corners, slash services, lay off staff, lower quality of care, take on substantial debt, and reduce charity care, leading to lower ratings and more medical errors, the reports collectively find.</p>
<p>Last week, the financial watchdog organization Private Equity Stakeholder Project (PESP) released <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/news/new-report-details-harm-caused-to-healthcare-industry-by-apollo/">a repor</a>t delving into the state of two of the nation's largest hospital systems, Lifepoint and ScionHealthâboth owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Through those two systems, Apollo runs 220 hospitals in 36 states, employing around 75,000 people.</p>
<p>The report found that some of Apollo's hospitals were among the worst in their respective states, based on a ranking by The Lown Institute Hospital Index. The index ranks hospitals and health systems based on health equity, value, and outcomes, PESP notes. The hospitals also have dismal readmission rates and government rankings. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) ranks hospitals on a one-to-five star system, with the national average of 3.2 stars overall and about 30 percent of hospitals at two stars or below. Apollo's overall average is 2.8 stars, with nearly 40 percent of hospitals at two stars or below.</p>
<h2>Patterns</h2>
<p><a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2813379">The other report</a>, a study published in JAMA late last month, found that the rate of serious medical errors and health complications increases among patients in the first few years after private equity firms take over. The study examined Medicare claims from 51 private equity-run hospitals and 259 matched control hospitals.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Specifically, the study, led by researchers at Harvard University, found that patients admitted to private equity-owned hospitals had a 25 percent increase in developing hospital-acquired conditions compared with patients in the control hospitals. In private equity hospitals, patients experienced a 27 percent increase in falls, a 38 percent increase in central-line bloodstream infections (despite placing 16 percent fewer central lines than control hospitals), and surgical site infections doubled.</p>
<p>"These findings heighten concerns about the implications of private equity on health care delivery," the authors concluded.</p>
<p>It also squares with PESP's investigation, which collected various data and media reports that could help explain how those medical errors could happen. The report found a pattern of cost-cutting and staff layoffs after private equity acquisition. In 2020, for instance, Lifepoint cut its annual salary and benefit costs by $166 million over the previous year and cut its supply costs by $54 million. Staff that remained at Apollo's hospitals were, in some cases, underpaid, and some hospitals cut services, including obstetric, pediatric, and psychiatric care.</p>
<p>Another pattern was that Apollo's hospitals were highly indebted. According to Moody's Investor Services, Apollo's ScionHealth has 5.8 times more debt than income to pay that debt off. Lifepoint's debt was 7.9 times its income. Private equity firms often take on excessive debt for leveraged buyouts, but this can lead cash to be diverted to interest payments instead of operational needs, PESP reported.</p>
<p>Apollo also made money off the hospitals in sale-leaseback transactions, in which it sold the land under the hospitals and then leased it back. In these cases, hospitals are left paying rent on land they used to own.</p>

Wardâs reaction to the scandal was all too familiar: first, attempting to <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743713154721554849" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">downplay</a> the <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/01/07/carta-henry-ward-investigating-allegations-confidential-information/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">concerns</a>; then, publicly <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743794996732735679" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">attacking</a> the person reporting them; then, rushing out a âthought leadershipâ <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/how-we-handle-captable-information-c98d85d79277" rel="noopener">puff piece</a> that raised <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/01/09/carta-unanswered-questions" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">more questions</a> than it answered; before finally pulling a 180 and <a href="https://henrysward.medium.com/should-carta-facilitate-secondary-trading-c319e0c9f080" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that the company would exit the liquidity business entirely<a href="#51d0" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Â²</a>â¦without ever explaining what had <em>actually</em> gone wrong, or how Carta would change its operating procedures moving forward.</p><p id="5f46">For customers, it was a confusing whirlwind of a week that broke trust and left many <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/carta-a-key-silicon-valley-player-for-startups-stumbles-prompting-customers-to-consider-competitors-89800bb8" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">considering</a> alternative vendors.

After witnessing behavior that veered from bad-for-business to ethically questionable to potentially illegal, I met privately with several other executives and board members. When these meetings only increased my unease, I sent a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UwfZfvcyfXKNR43FNbYefwI7vVg-rqn/view" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">signed letter</a> to the entire Carta board and the companyâs general counsel, so that they, from their higher vantage, could assess the merits of my concerns and decide what to do. I â not Ward nor anyone else I reported in my letter â was immediately suspended. A major law firm <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-discrimination-lawsuit-carta-vcs-2023-1" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">investigated</a>, and I was questioned for eight hours by a team that included former United States Attorney General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Lynch" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Loretta Lynch</a>.<a href="#6a9d" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">Â³</a> Days after my interview â on the Friday before Christmas â I was fired âfor cause.â A week later, Carta sued me.</p><p id="22a6">And their lawsuit was a real whopper.</p></div><div><figure><figcaption>Cartaâs October 2021 engineering leadership offsite in Chicago</figcaption></figure><p id="da6e">I joined Carta in September of 2018.

Making employees <a href="https://mr-p.medium.com/think-like-an-owner-70ebf70644f7" rel="noopener">owners</a> â giving them an economic stake in the value they create â isnât a panacea for capitalismâs uninternalized externalities, but itâs a damn good start.

Seeing my private life deliberately twisted and thrust into the public sphere without the consent of <em>any</em> of the people involved is hard enough to swallow. But for a corporation to do it? Because I tried to blow the whistle? <strong>Yuck</strong>.</p></div><div><p id="a11d">At various times in my life, I have been an expert in different things: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlTJrNJ5lA" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">discography</a> of Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, organizational management principles, reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo. But nobody becomes an expert whistleblower. This turns out to be a major point of contention: âwe want people to speak up!â says the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a-4bywFOPLcOnHuRfYJpQ5Ga5KpVh3UA/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">company handbook</a>, drafted by expensive lawyers. But as soon as someone does, those same lawyers swoop in: âbut not like <em>that</em>!â</p><p id="6620">So I have to ask: what form of objection would have been acceptable? Who should it have come from? How should it have been delivered? In May of 2019, Henry messaged the company asking employees to come directly to him with problems, instead of using the newly launched whistleblower platform. At a leadership offsite in August 2022, he described his philosophy of management: âFriction is failure,â Henry proclaimed. âIf youâre arguing, youâre not doing your job.â In another lawsuit filed against Carta by a former executive, Henry <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuits-employees-ceo-retaliation-2023-2" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> âI didnât fire him because of his performance. I fired him because he was complaining to people he shouldnât be complaining to.â Just a week ago, in the latest Carta scandal, Henry <a href="https://twitter.com/henrysward/status/1743794996732735679" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">accused</a> a prominent startup CEO of âfirebombingâ him âfor exposureâ after the founder posted evidence that Carta had misused customer data. As far as I can tell, the companyâs position is that <em>nobody</em> ever speaks up in the right way, or has a legitimate concern. Wrongdoing isnât the gravest sin: <a href="https://twitter.com/pmarca/status/1502432636865691648" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">talking</a> about it is.</p><p id="5022">When I finally decided that â as a fiduciary â I had no choice but to write to Cartaâs board, I hoped that my record of accomplishment and my commitment to the company would ensure I was taken seriously. I had joined as a Director with a single direct report, been promoted three times in two years to Chief Technology Officer, and then led engineering through a period of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2021/08/13/carta-valuation-fundraising" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">unprecedented growth</a> to a team more than 400 strong. True to the companyâs mission, I was an <a href="https://carta.com/about/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">owner</a>: I had invested nearly my entire lifeâs savings exercising the companyâs stock options, and Cartaâs success was now my success. I had <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danfike" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">hired</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliaking3" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">so</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kineticrick" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyenbaochau" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">amazing</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cupto" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">senior</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ternasky" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">leaders</a> who were smarter and more experienced than I, and we consistently garnered glowing performance reviews and stellar Employee Voice Survey results. I was being paid a $623,000 a year base salary and had a $3.9M annual equity target. What <em>conceivable</em> motivation could I have to put all of that at risk, unless something was seriously wrong? And if I, a 40-year-old 6â2â cis white guy in the C-suite with a Stanford PhD, couldnât speak up, who could? Plus, I was writing a private letter to the board, not calling reporters or threatening a lawsuit. What was the company going to do, pretend it was a mistake to have hired me in the first place? Say I was bad at my job? Nobody could stomach <em>that</em> much hypocrisy, right?<a href="#42bc" rel="noopener ugc nofollow">â¶</a></p><p id="0932">Turns out some can. And when powerful people attack your reputation, the mud sticks, no matter how mendacious. Those who know me well or have worked closely with me over the years laughed when they heard the names Henry was calling me. But for the many thousands whose first exposure to me has been Cartaâs lawsuit or Henryâs blog post, his calumnies have scored. And itâs tough, too, to blame folks for not tripping over themselves running to my defense, as the company continues its ânuke them from orbitâ <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-lawsuit-former-employee-recordings-of-its-ceo-2023-9" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">legal strategy</a> against anyone who dares raise their head.</p><p id="8c86">Itâs hard not to cheer when powerful hypocrites are finally called to account: the evangelical preacher caught embezzling funds; the crypto billionaireâs Ponzi scheme revealed. But donât forget that shame is also one of the most pernicious weapons of the shameless. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7007297-Emily-Kramer-v-Carta#document/p16" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Telling</a> a female executive that âshe was like an alcoholic who needed to admit her problem and have a full-scale recovery from being an assholeâ isnât the worst thing ever done in corporate America, but the effect is still undeniable: to <a href="https://emilykramer.medium.com/equity-for-all-1ae9ac42679e" rel="noopener">break</a> something, just a little, inside. During a long âcoachingâ session with Henry, another seasoned executive wrote in her notes: âown it; [the problem is] me; what could I have done better?â Months later, I listened to her read back what she had written and start to cry. Nobody as lucky or as privileged as I has any business looking for sympathy, but attempting to shame someone publicly for their (safe, legal, <em>consensual</em>) private life is some dark shit.</p><p id="20db"><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_of_Tyler_Clementi" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">People</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goo_Hara" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">kill</a> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Copeland" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">themselves</a>, after all.</p></div><div><p id="6cfa">Herodotus, in his<em> Histories</em>, tells how Solon advised Croesus to âcount no man happy until the end is known,â so itâs still too early for me to say for sure what Iâll take away from this experience. But there is one thing Iâm certain of: the only way any of this is going to stop is if we all <em>collectively</em> decide that we are mad as hell and not going to take it anymore. I have always liked Madeline Albrightâs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRimyfmz0MA&amp;t=13s" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">quote</a> about the special place in hell reserved for women who donât help other women, but I think the proper focus should be on <em>power</em>, not gender. What is the point of accruing influence and money and prestige if you wonât use them to help people? Stop saying âthis isnât my job; thereâs nothing I can do; I donât want to know; it didnât happen to <em>me</em>; itâs none of <strong>my</strong> business.â Mankind is your business. The common welfare is your business. The dealings of your trade are but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of your business.</p><p id="d472">Late in the summer of 2022, I asked a prominent Silicon Valley founder and investor â who had been close to the company and knew something of its rampant dysfunction â for advice. âIf you pop up one-by-one,â they said, âHenry can knock you down. You have to stand together.â Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops? It has to start with you, with one person deciding that enough is enough. When you see something, <em>say something</em>. Spend some â not all, but some â of the social and professional capital that you have been working so hard for so long to collect, and stand up for someone who canât do it on their own. Because let me tell you: <em>nobody</em> can do it alone. When you shrug and move on because you donât want to make waves, some of the people you leave behind are drowning.</p><p id="c015">Before I sent my letter to the full board at Carta, I met with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Barbara Byrne</a>, the companyâs only independent director, and the boardâs only woman. We spoke for almost two hours, and the last thing Barbara did was tell me a story about a dispute sheâd had at work years before, where her employer sent expensive lawyers to intimidate her. âThe only power they have,â she said, âis the power to make you afraid. Donât let them make you afraid.â</p><p id="a26a">I am tired, disgusted, outraged, disappointed, and incredulousâ¦but I refuse to be afraid. Seeing my good name smeared across the internet is painful and awful â after all, it is my <strong>name</strong>: I cannot have another in my life. But I have accepted that, if the last five years is going to mean anything, it will have to cost something.</p><p id="5229">Donât let them make you afraid.</p></div><div><p id="5d5f">Â¹ We are challenging most of these redactions in court.</p><p id="51d0">Â² This abrupt reversal came forty-eight hours after one Carta board member <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/07/carta-the-cap-table-management-outfit-is-accused-of-unethical-tactics-by-a-customer-after-it-tries-broker-a-deal-for-a-startups-shares-without-consent/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">offered TechCrunch</a> an impassioned defense of the âlegitimacyâ Carta was bringing to a âmessy marketâ; five days after <a href="https://linear.app/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Linear</a> CEO and Carta customer <a href="https://karrisaarinen.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Karri Saarinen</a> first rang the alarm on social media; and three years after Carta <a href="https://twitter.com/cartainc/status/1334184362120769537?lang=en" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://carta.com/blog/liquid-rsus/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Carta Liquidity</a>, âa new equity paradigm for private companies.â</p><p id="6a9d">Â³ The company has refused to release the report of their investigation.</p><p id="abf8">â´ After this response was published, the article was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231030124219/https:/www.businessinsider.com/carta-startup-discrimination-harassment-boys-club-allegations-henry-ward-lawsuit-2023-10" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">updated</a> to âclarifyâ the board memberâs comment, which is reassuring since âasking management questionsâ sounds a bit like the boardâs basic function.</p><p id="0159">âµ These claims were so brazen and outrageous that Cartaâs counsel was <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W0ROWCkAZ_WU7-RoFgDb5mi9fjqbtRV2/view?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">forced</a> to <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cw4VWUX7tNZU2DZiUd8L6DI1lria71Gk/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">ask the court</a> for leave to withdraw them, and subsequently amended their complaint to do so. But this didnât stop Henry from circulating the original, unaltered filing in the blog post that he sent to 40,000 Carta corporate customers four months later.</p><p id="42bc">â¶ I also failed to include âaccuse me of being âhopped up on drugsâ and âhighâ at workâ on my Carta Bingo card, after I notified the exec team and my direct reports that it would take several weeks to recover from the painful surgeries I had on both feet in September 2022. But I think we are meant to believe that implying my planned convalescence was a drug addiction â as Carta did in their public lawsuit â is appropriate corporate behavior, since â<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/10/16/women-claims-mistreatment-carta-unicorn-startup/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Henry does play hardball</a>.â</p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

I've never used it myself, but it's a self contained IDE that has everything to make decent 2D games.</p><p>I'd advise against the pitfall that 3D games lure you into. That includes engines that are 3D with a 2D "mode". There is so much leaky abstraction, and the doco will be intermingled with 3D all over the place, leading to frustration and unnecessary complexity.</p><p>If a game is fun in 3D, chances are you could write a game in the same vein in 2D and carry the idea and execution across. 3D games are beyond ridiculously hard to execute on by oneself (well), and require exponentially more work to complete.</p><p>There is no gain, in terms of discovering the joy of making games, in diving in 3D first.</p><p>If you prefer a more programming centric approach, with no IDE, I recommend Love2D. It's a joy to use, well documented.</p><p>If you want a full blown low level approach, I recommend Raylib. It's fantastic and fun to use as well. But at this point, you're swimming in the deep end.</p><p>Also worthy of note is PICO-8. It's a fantasy console that can be easily ported on 'open' console (such as the ambernic), making your game feel alive, being played on a hand-held console. But as for the learning experience, I found it to be more of an expert's getaway retreat, rather than a good first choice for an engine. That said there is enough material out there and small enough API, to pick it up  rather quickly, all batteries included.

                  <p><span>What a great response. To follow, this doesn't preclude anyone's child from jumping head first into programming, just that "producing" a game isn't really the goal but "making" it is. My 9 year old son makes mini RPGs on paper. Like he draws hit points and a monster and does attacks and marks damage as he plays. It's awesome.

My parents sat me down and taught me the very basics of how to code. I didn't learn very well from them, but they also bought me a textbook and I learned great from that. By age 12, I had recreated a lot of the games I was fond of, pacman, snake, space invaders, etc.<p>Maybe the bar was lower for my interests at the time (flash mini games vs AAA 3D games as described here), but just offering a different take: Maybe your son _would_ very much be interested in learning to code. Though starting with 2d retro games might be easier.

Could you just "build" it with cardboard, a board drawn on a computer and printed out and various physical pieces? Or at least, do that for a prototype of the core part of the game and gameplay? I think it would be useful to learn the concept of a "minimum viable product" in this context (or rather, "minimum quantum of utility" to get away from preconceived ideas about what a "product" is..). Being able to get it to a point where people can first actually try to play it is really useful, and lets you get feedback early without all the overhead of the actual computer programming (if needed)</span></p></div></td></tr>

Love2D is great if you're okay with Lua.  Browser based engines have a great iteration loop.

Love2d is a simple library/framework, and Lua is much simpler than python, and you will (are forced to) learn the basics, for example there's no built-in object-orientation, you make it yourself, so you learn how such systems actually work.

You can use his drawings as a background and sculpt something desireable from that blue print. Then get to animations, then the blender game engine, then python.</p><p>Blender looks frightening at first, so you might to learn some before to overcome the first hurdles but there are also alot of kid friendly tutorials out there.</p><p>Good luck :)</p><p>Edit: Working with blender is actual fun and this graphical approach has also the advantage for nudging him very slowly into this monumental task :)

This is a serious tool for any kind of creative project.<p>The way to use Venn diagrams is to distill "the game" (which, for any pre-teen, and for most first-time adults too, is going to be a jumble of features and assets) into its absolute core: the big picture, philosophy, principles, themes, "design pillars". The core is the overlap of all the specific stuff: when you implement something, it has code, it has visuals, it has audio, and it should all relate to the core. So, Tetris, Sokoban, and Minecraft are all about "playing with blocks" at some level, but they differ in that the core also contains some other aspect of play. Every piece of media that works for its audience - they find it believable and engaging - is representable in the diagram.</p><p>So when your son asks for this or that feature, have him work through it on a diagram, filling in "what sound does it make" and similar kinds of details while you address the big picture parts that are hardest. Make lots of little diagrams. You'll eventually hit on one where you can reasonably hope to prototype it with your chosen tool. That's good enough, when you are 9 years old.

I always had some dinky project going and it was almost never a game.

I wonder if Iâll ever get around to it? Itâs ambitious, but I think doable solo (minus the art). Itâd probably be a 5-10 year project. A big part of the reason I havenât started it is I know how much not fun parts there are involved, like tuning algorithms.

You can help him of course and try to steer him towards incremental improvement.<p>With Roblox he will definitely be able to just use pre-made (of not super awesome looking) cars and zombies. In fact the Roblox tutorials come with a pretty good looking Zombie actually. With animations and all. They also have some official item collections which included high and low poly stuff.</p><p>You can help him put together a simple version in a couple days tops probably. Like something that's literally just car that won't drive, some zombies that walk towards the player location if in range, he has to long press to "repair" the car and escape. First version done.</p><p>Then expand from there, like have an actual "broken car" model vs "working car". Start adding houses and streets and an "escape zone" you gotta reach etc.</p><p>That said, don't underestimate his curiosity. I thought my kids wouldn't get past that either and now I sometimes glimpse or they show me what they've been working on. I just showed them some 3D software like Blender, they got a tablet and a cheap graphics tablet for the PC. And I do see them doodling around with it, trying things. Just like we did. But with cooler tech. Just today actually I told one of them when they were on the tablet how I watched Star Trek as a kid and always wanted to "live long enough that I'd have something like the P.A.D.D.". And look here we've had iPads for "forever" now and the kids think it's normal to have.

(yes I've done some developing coz the kids wanted me to build a game for them. "daddy, daddy, I found this pink cow! You gotta put it in!" - I never finished coz it got boring but it was a lot of fun).<p>He can blow up (just super size) the models and maybe find some "motor" asset someone made and published to actually put under the hood or just next to the car, which he needs to repair too. A blown out tire? Go find rubber or a new tire? Lug it back to the car first. A jerry can asset someone made that he needs to find at a gas station (maybe someone already made that asset) to fill up the car. Like "if Jerry can is in inventory - inventory is already pre built in roblox just use it - then long pressing the action key will fill up the car". Find a "lead pipe" asset to use as a weapon. To begin with use one of the premade with animations and everything swords. The learn how to make your own.</p><p>Since it's all for learning nobody has to care about asset licensing or money. When he does, it's a teachable moment.

I also found several other examples on the Scratch website which show how to build 3D graphics on a 2D canvas. After many years of teaching kids to code, I would say the best introduction for a 9 year old is to start with block-based environments to build structural thinking fundamentals, before introducing him to typed programming languages.<p>The issue I see in starting in Unity or an equivalent high-level abstraction (e.g. threejs.org), is that it doesn't build strong fundamentals in how you <i>think</i> about solving problems. Many kids these days think they are "coding" when they are really just modifying a collection of examples and starting points (which has fueled the burgeoning industry of summer camps teaching "Minecraft modding"). As is the case for many other skills, great amateurs make great professionals.

You can add multiplayer over websocket/webrtc, you can write your own shader, you can write your game logic however you want etc. All of that without the overhead/limitation of a modding environment.</p><p>Also, out in the wild the job opportunity for Garry's Mod developers is very scarce, if any. Just something to think about if op wants to do some carrier development for the kid while having fun.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <div id="intro">
                <p><em>This article was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2024/01/17/each-facebook-user-is-monitored-by-thousands-of-companies-study-indicates" target="_blank">copublished</a> with The Markup, a nonprofit, investigative newsroom that challenges technology to serve the public good. Sign up for its newsletters <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/newsletter" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>By now most internet users know their online activity is constantly tracked. No one should be shocked to see ads for items they previously searched for, or to be asked if their data can be shared with an unknown number of âpartners.â</p>
<p>But what is the scale of this surveillance? Judging from data collected by Facebook and newly described in a <a href="http://innovation.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/CR_Who-Shares-Your-Information-With-Facebook.pdf">unique study by Consumer Reports</a> (PDF), itâs massive, and examining the data may leave you with more questions than answers.</p>
            </div>

    <!-- related-links -->
<div id="more-on-online-privacy-related-articles">
        <p>Using a panel of 709 volunteers who shared archives of their Facebook data, Consumer Reports found that a total of 186,892 companies sent data about them to the social network. On average, each participant in the study had their data sent to Facebook by 2,230 companies. That number varied significantly, with some panelistsâ data listing over 7,000 companies providing their data.&nbsp; The Markup helped Consumer Reports recruit participants for the study. Participants downloaded an archive of the previous three years of their data from their Facebook settings, then provided it to Consumer Reports. </p>
<p>By collecting data this way, the study was able to examine a form of tracking that is normally hidden: so-called server-to-server tracking, in which personal data goes from a companyâs servers to Metaâs servers. Another form of tracking, in which Meta tracking pixels are placed on company websites, is visible to usersâ browsers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the data came from a self-selected group of users, and because the results were not demographically adjusted, the study does not âmake any claims about how representative this sample is of the U.S. population as a whole,â Consumer Reports says. Participants were also likely more privacy-conscious and technically inclined than typical users and more likely to be members of Consumers Reports.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
                 <p>Despite its limitations, the study offers a rare look, using data directly from Meta, on how personal information is collected and aggregated online.</p>
<p>Meta spokesperson Emil Vazquez defended the companyâs practices. âWe offer a number of transparency tools to help people understand the information that businesses choose to share with us, and manage how itâs used,â Vazquez wrote in an emailed statement to The Markup.</p>
<p>While Meta does provide transparency tools like the one that enabled the study, Consumer Reports identified problems with them, including that the identity of many data providers is unclear from the names disclosed to users and that companies that provide services to advertisers are often allowed to ignore opt-out requests.</p>
<p>One company appeared in 96 percent of participantsâ data: LiveRamp, a data broker based in San Francisco. But the companies sharing your online activity to Facebook arenât just little-known data brokers. Retailers like Home Depot, Macyâs, and Walmart, all were in the top 100 most frequently seen companies in the study. Credit reporting and consumer data companies such as Experian and TransUnionâs Neustar also made the list, as did Amazon, Etsy, and PayPal.</p>
<p>LiveRamp did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
            </div>

    
    <div id="what-exactly-does-this-data-contain">
                <p>The data examined by Consumer Reports in this study comes from two types of collection: events and custom audiences. Both categories include information about what people do outside of Metaâs platforms.</p>
<p>Custom audiences allow advertisers to upload customer lists to Meta, often including identifiers like email addresses and mobile advertising IDs. These customers, and so-called look-alike audiences made up of similar people, can then be targeted with ads on Metaâs platforms.</p>
<p>The other category of data collection, âevents,â describes interactions that the user had with a brand, which can occur outside of Metaâs apps and in the real world. Events can include going to a page on a companyâs website, leveling up in a game, going to a physical store, or purchasing a product. These signals originate from Meta software code included in many mobile apps, their tracking pixel, which is included on many websites, and from server-to-server tracking, where a companyâs server passes data to a Meta server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Markup has written extensively about the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/series/pixel-hunt" target="_blank">Meta Pixel</a> and how it has been used to surveil people as they <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/06/13/suicide-hotlines-promise-anonymity-dozens-of-their-websites-send-sensitive-data-to-facebook" target="_blank">dial suicide hotlines</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/privacy/2023/02/16/forget-milk-and-eggs-supermarkets-are-having-a-fire-sale-on-data-about-you" target="_blank">buy their groceries</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2023/11/22/facebook-watches-teens-online-as-they-prep-for-college" target="_blank">take the SAT</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook" target="_blank">file their taxes</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/06/16/facebook-is-receiving-sensitive-medical-information-from-hospital-websites" target="_blank">book appointments with their doctors</a>. Website owners can configure the pixel to track user website interactions such as searches or filling out a form, sending each action to Meta, even if the user doesnât have an account on Facebook. Although research tools like The Markupâs Pixel Hunt can detect the Meta pixel or SDK tracking, there is no way for a consumer to monitor the traffic between a companyâs server and Metaâs. This Consumer Reports study looks at server-to-server data along with the rest.</p>
            </div>
    <div>

            </div>
    <div id="how-can-you-see-your-data">
                <p>Facebook users can browse through the list of companies that have sent their data to Facebook by going to the Accounts Center and clicking on â<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions" target="_blank">Your information and permissions</a>.â </p>
<p>From this menu, users can either download or access their information. To see the companies outside of Meta that have been sharing your information, select âYour activity off Meta technologies,â then âRecent activity.â You might be prompted to reenter your password at this point. This view will show you the number of recent connections between various third-party businesses you visited and Meta, and examples of the activity that was shared. You can choose to prevent future sharing by the company by selecting âDisconnect.â To see detailed information about these interactions, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://facebook.com/dyi" target="_blank">request a copy of your data</a>.</p>
<p>But after jumping through the many hoops required to get your hands on this data, you may still be left with lingering questions. For example, in addition to easily recognizable company names more than 7,000 companies in Consumer Reportsâ study were named using unreadable gibberish, or just numbers that donât mean anything to most users. Even those companies with readable names often did not include links to the company website. Some company names were ambiguous, such as Viking, which could be a number of different businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>âThis type of tracking which occurs entirely outside of the userâs view is just so far outside of what people expect when they use the internet,â Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Markup in an interview. Fitzgerald said that while users are likely aware that Meta knows what they are doing while they are on Facebook and Instagram, âthey donât expect Meta to know what stores they walk into or what news articles theyâre reading or every site they visit online.â&nbsp;</p>
            </div>
    
    <div>
                 <p>In the report, Consumer Reports calls for a number of policy proposals covering data collection practices, some of which could be part of a national digital privacy law, something that the organization has long advocated for. The recommendations specifically aimed at Metaâs technology and the advertisers who use it include:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>â¢ Requiring companies to adopt âdata minimizationâ strategies</strong>, which call for the collection of the absolute minimum amount of data needed to provide the service being offered.</p>
<p><strong><strong>â¢</strong> Expanding the powers of âauthorized agentsâ to act on behalf of consumers to act on their rights. </strong><a href="https://www.permissionslipcr.com/">Permission Slip</a> is a mobile app by Consumer Reports that allows users to quickly opt out of and delete data from a long list of companies and data brokers on behalf of users; the app takes advantage of state privacy lawsâ authorized agent provisions.</p>
<p><strong><strong>â¢</strong> Increasing ad transparency </strong>by creating ad archives that allow the public to see all ads that have been served to users on a platform, following the lead of the European Unionâs <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://husovec.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Official-Version-OJ_L_2022_277_FULL_EN_TXT.pdf" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>â¢ Improving the quality and readability of the data </strong>that Meta makes available in its existing transparency tools, so that consumers can actually act on the information they review.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald echoed these recommendations, saying the problem lies with the fact that the burden is on the consumer to take action to prevent this data collection. Even a âglobal opt-outâ mechanism allowing users to avoid having their data shared is not enough because âthat still requires the user to take an action to protect their privacy. A lot of people are not going to have the time or knowledge to do that,â Fitzgerald said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vazquez, Metaâs spokesperson, said the company would âcontinue to invest in data minimization technologies to keep up with evolving expectations. As we cover in our terms, businesses are responsible for getting permission to share peopleâs information with companies like ours.â</p>
<p>For now, the lack of a federal privacy law leaves consumers in most states with few options. âI think people should be encouraging their elected officials to pass privacy laws that require businesses to change some of these business practices to stop this ubiquitous tracking of our every click and every movement,â Fitzgerald said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Box">



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747280541362102287/">Tim Sweeney, on Twitter/X, yesterday at 10:30am</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their 
court-established right to tell US customers about better prices 
on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over 
and done forever. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That take didnât last long.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390">Sweeney, yesterday at 7:00pm</a>, after Apple released <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-guidelines-external-purchase-links">the details of its intended compliance</a> with the anti-steering (<em>anti-anti-steering</em>?) mandate from the Epic v. Apple case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick summary of glaring problems weâve found so far: </p>

<ol>
<li>Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web 
purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price 
competition. Developers canât offer digital items more cheaply 
on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% 
and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Sweeneyâs points 2â4, complaining about Appleâs stringent design, 
presentation, and privacy demands regarding external links, 
omitted.] </p>

<p>Epic will contest Appleâs bad-faith compliance plan in 
District Court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweeneyâs description makes it sound as though Apple is demanding its commission from all web sales for apps and services that have an iOS app. Theyâre not. Theyâre only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">the new External Purchase Links entitlement</a> in an app. Any app or service that already sells over the web, without paying a cent to Apple, can continue to do so in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Also, Apple <em>has</em> done this before: what they announced yesterday is almost exactly in line <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with their compliance with Netherlands regulations pertaining to dating apps in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Before yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS app developers could sell digital content and subscriptions over the web, without paying Apple any commission.</li>
<li>iOS apps outside <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">the âreaderâ category</a> could not link to, nor even tell users about, those web purchases from within their apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>After yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps that wish to link toâââor, I think, even inform users aboutâââweb purchasing options from within their iOS apps must (a) still offer Appleâs IAP for those items; (b) pay Apple its adjusted 27/12 percent commissions on web sales that come from inside iOS apps; (c) send Apple sales data monthly and submit to audits of their sales; and (d) follow Appleâs stringent design edicts for these in-app links to the web.</li>
<li>Apps that do not link out to their web stores from within their iOS apps using Appleâs new External Purchase Links entitlement can continue whatever they were doing before yesterday. For apps that do nothing new, Apple is collecting nothing new.</li>
</ul>

<p>Iâm only surprised that Sweeney was seemingly surprised by any of this. He genuinely seemed to think that Apple not only would, but <em>had to</em> allow links from within apps to the web for purchases without collecting any commission on those sales, and that developers could present those links however they chose.</p>

<p>Iâm glad that Sweeney and Epic plan to contest this, because Iâm genuinely curious whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sees Appleâs solution as complying with her injunction against their prior anti-steering rules. But I think it <em>does</em> comply.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be clear, I think Apple should allow apps <em>other than games</em> to just tell users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission. That the rules which have applied only to âreaderâ apps since early 2022 should be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which doesnât apply to âreaderâ apps) that apps taking advantage of this <em>also</em> offer in-app purchasing.</p>

<p>Iâd draw an exception for gamesâââan exception that surely Sweeney would disagree with completely, given that heâs in the games businessâââbecause games are different, and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly standard for the video game industry. The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; theyâre consoles for games and apps.</p>

<p>But Iâm not sure at all that Apple is doing anything contrary to the law. Sweeney (and other critics of Appleâs stewardship of iOS as a tightly controlled console) believe Apple both shouldnât and <em>legally canât</em> comply with the anti-steering injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldnât, not that they legally canât.</p>

<p>Most critics of Appleâs control over all iOS software are seemingly of the view that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of âexpertâ or âdeveloperâ mode</a>âââchock full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enableâââthat would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on iOS as there are on the Mac. Thatâs me, personally, an expert user. But even setting aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store,<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-17">1</a></sup> I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldnât want to do this. There are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software. Iâm not talking about viruses or malware, evenâââbut apps that just abuse the largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.</p>

<p>Basically, thereâs an argument that iOS devices should be more like traditional PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The â<em>itâs my device, I should decide and control what software runs on it</em>â argument. I get it. But I also get that most consumersâ Windows PCs, and many Macs,<sup id="fnr2-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-17">2</a></sup> are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/">anti-user shenanigans</a> youâd never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far from perfectâââI mean come on, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection">that should go without saying</a>âââbut it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for <em>any</em> typical users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall if you donât like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch, PlayStation, and Xboxâââand to a lesser degree (because Googleâs Play Store review seems comparatively lax) for Android.</p>

<p>But the cynical take is that itâs all about the money for Apple. Maybe the cynics are right! Letâs just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple <em>should not</em> be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are taking to the companyâs brand and reputationâââthis move reeks of greed and avariceââânor the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the âanti-Big-Techâ hunt.</p>

<p>Apple should have been looking for ways to <em>lessen</em> regulatory and legislative pressure over the past few years, and in todayâs climate thatâs more true than ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been â<em>Bring it on.</em>â Confrontational, not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with <em>most</em> of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep <em>everything</em>. To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponentâs king. Apple seemingly wants to capture every last piece on the boardâââeven while playing in a tournament where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship (greed).</p>

<p>Appleâs calculus should be to balance its natural desire to book large amounts of revenue from the App Store with policies that to some degree <em>placate</em>, rather than antagonize, regulators and legislators. No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, itâs never a good idea to piss off the refs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main">
      <article role="main">
        <p>Hi, welcome to the brand new website, HN Reads.  I enjoy reading <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> and I love buying books (and reading), and I also love data, so what better than doing some processing of data about books to find some interesting results?!  It also gives me the opportunity to write about books that I find interesting.</p>
<p>Here are the top 40 books recommended by HN readers in 2023.</p>
<p>How I generated this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>get stories that contain the word âbookâ, but not âmacbookâ, âchromebookâ, etc. That were posted in 2023, and also try to only get âask HNâ stories, by excluding stories that have a url in them.</li>
<li>get the comments for the stories</li>
<li>for each comment, use the OpenAI gpt3.5 chat API to extract a list of book details in json format:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback"> 	 [
 	 	{"match":"xxx","title":"xxx", "author":"xxx", "link":"xxx"},
 	 	...
 	 ]
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>standardise titles, e.g. âGÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braidâ is converted
to âGÃ¶del, Escher, Bachâ. Any leading âtheâ is also removed.  I end up with a title
column and an orig_title column in my data. If there are that have the same title, but different subtitles, for example âJavascript: the good partsâ and âJavascript: the Definitive Guideâ, this isnât too much of a problem, as the authors are different.</li>
<li>aggregate the resulting information.  There was some manual adjustment to standardise
the book titles and authors names, for example GÃ¶del was sometimes spelled âGodelâ
and Douglas Hofstadter was sometimes returned as âDouglas R. Hofstadterâ.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also shared some details about this process at <a href="https://blog.reyem.dev/post/extracting_hn_book_recommendations_with_chatgpt_vol_ii/">my blog</a>.</p>
<p>Itâs nice to see one of my favourite series appearing on this list, the Hyperion Cantos. I donât usually go for books with horror elements, but the story is so good, and the science
fiction elements are cool too.</p>
<p>A couple of controversial figures donât rank in the top 40 of 2023:  Elon Muskâs new biography
wasnât recommended once in an âAsk HNâ about books, although there were plenty of stories
on Hacker News about him and Isaacsonâs book.  Also Ayn Randâs books werenât mentioned often
enough in 2023 to make the list.</p>
<p>Without further delay, hereâs the list:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><em>Context: When I was laid off from Google, I knew I'd be deluged with
questions.  I wrote this FAQ to share with friends and family, to
prevent repeated explanation.  But my other goal was to help so many
of my co-workers process and understand the repeated waves of mass
layoffs.</em></p>
<p><strong>What happened?</strong></p>
<p>Google just did another big round of layoffs.  I was part of them,
along with hundreds of others.  Many of us had long tenure or
seniority; my run was 18 years!</p>
<p><strong>Oh no!  But why were <em>you</em> targeted?</strong></p>
<p>I wasnât personally targeted, I didnât mess up.  In fact these layoffs
were extremely impersonal.  Google seems to be carrying out generic
initiatives to save operational cost.  I was an Engineering Director
with âonlyâ 35 reports (rather than a typical 80+ people), and so itâs
likely that some heuristic decided that the business could do fine
without me.</p>
<p><strong>This is unfair!  After all youâve done, how could Google do this to
you?</strong></p>
<p>Please understand: <em>Google is not a person.</em> Itâs many groups of
people following locally-varying processes, rules, and culture.  To
that end, it makes no sense to either love or be angry at âGoogleâ;
itâs not a consciousness, and it has no sense of duty nor debt.</p>
<p><strong>Are you OK?  Iâm so sorry!  How are you coping?</strong></p>
<p>Iâm fine.  :-) Google culture changed dramatically last year with its
first major round of layoffs, and I saw the writing on the wall.  Iâve
been preparing myself for this (increasingly inevitable) event for
months now â which included plenty of time for all the stages of
grief.  If anything, I have a mixed set of emotions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enormous pride in building a Chicago Engineering office over
decades, and achieving really cool things in the Developer, Ads, and
Search divisions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>deep gratitude in getting to work with some of the most intelligent,
creative people in the world;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a sense of relief.  The conflict between âuncomfortable cultureâ and
âgolden handcuffsâ was becoming intolerable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>
<p>Iâve seen long-tenured leaders exit Google and go into an identity
crisis; thatâs not me.  :-)</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://www.red-bean.com/sussman/">zillion hobbies and shadow
careers</a> â plenty of things to do
and paths to follow.  The <em>first</em> order of business, however, is
probably a long-overdue sabbatical.  After 25+ years in tech, I need a
few months to rest and recover!</p>
<p>Iâll soon publish a couple of âpost-mortemâ stories.  The first will
be about my own career at Google, and the second will be about how
Iâve seen Google culture change over time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<h2>A suspect</h2>

<p>I think the manufacturer of your son's ball mixed in a Swedish word:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2><em>Yxa</em></h2>
  
  <h3>Swedish, n.: <em>an axe</em></h3>
  
  <p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/LNTu2.jpg" alt="See caption"></a><br>
  <sub>The photograph above is <a href="https://www.bukowskis.com/sv/auctions/562/48-elsa-beskow-j-julgran-och-y-yxa" rel="noreferrer">page 22</a> of the Swedish children's book <em>Vill du lÃ¤sa I</em> ("Would you like to read [vol I]") by painter Elsa Beskow. The <code>J</code> above it is for <em>julgran</em>, the Swedish word for <em>Christmas tree</em>.</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Forensics</h2>

<p>I say this on the basis that:</p>

<ol>
<li>I checked several thesauruses, like you, as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Axes" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's category for axes</a>, and while I found <em>adze</em>, <em>chopper</em>, <em>cleaver</em>, <em>hatchet</em>, <em>mattock</em>, <em>tomahawk</em>, <em>twibill</em> and so on, I found nothing approaching a word with an initial <code>y</code>.</li>
<li>I used <a href="http://onelook.com/" rel="noreferrer">OneLook.com</a>'s reverse-dictionary functionality to search for "words starting with a <code>y</code> and having a meaning relating to <em>axe</em>"Â¹ and the only thing suggested was <a href="http://www.onelook.com/thesaurus/?s=axe&amp;f_sw=y&amp;loc=wildcard3" rel="noreferrer"><em>yataghan</em></a>: "a long Turkish knife with a curved blade having a single edge". An <a href="http://www.oriental-arms.com/photos/items/77/001477/ph-0.jpg" rel="noreferrer">image search</a> tells us that no ball-maker would confuse this sword-like blade for an axe.</li>
<li>Going one step further, I checked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Blade_weapons" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's comprehensive list of bladed weapons</a>, and from all countries, throughout all history, only 3 start with an initial <code>y</code>: <em>yanmaodao</em> (Chinese), <em>yari</em> (Japanese), and <em>yatagan</em> (Turkish). These are all sword-like weapons, not axe-like, and as mentioned in the previous bullet, of the three, only <em>yatagan</em> has made it into English dictionaries.</li>
<li>I used an online tool named <em>Translatr</em> to translate both <em>axe</em> and <a href="http://translatr.varunmalhotra.xyz/?ref=producthunt" rel="noreferrer"><em>hatchet</em> into 90+ languages</a>, and cross-checked these with the manual translations on Wiktionary, and literally the only word of those ~200 options which started with a <code>y</code> was Swedish <em>yxa</em>. </li>
</ol>

<p>Cross-checking the translation from Swedish back into English confirmed that Swedish <em>yxa</em> is English <em>axe</em>. And indeed it is used in Swedish children's primers to illustrate the letter <code>y</code>, as you can see from the children's book excerpt above.</p>

<h2>The crime scene</h2>

<p>As for the other symbols on the ball, we can analyze which letter-symbol pairings make sense in each language. Here I've tagged each pairing with â to indicate "the name a toddler would shout out for the depicted object starts with the corresponding letter", â for "no, it doesn't", and â for "this pairing merits further discussion".</p>

<p>In English, the pairings are <strong>A</strong>ppleâ, <strong>B</strong>earâ, <strong>C</strong>atâ, <strong>D</strong>ogâ, <strong>E</strong>lephantâ, <strong>F</strong>rogâ, <strong>G</strong>iraffeâ, <strong>H</strong>ouseâ, <strong>I</strong>ceâ, <strong>J</strong>etâ, <strong>K</strong>angarooâ, <strong>L</strong>ionâ, <strong>M</strong>ouseâ, <strong>N</strong>ailâ, <strong>O</strong>wlâ, <strong>P</strong>igâ, <strong>Q</strong>ueenâ, <strong>R</strong>ainbowâ, <strong>S</strong>nailâ, <strong>T</strong>igerâ, <strong>U</strong>boatâ, <strong>V</strong>olcanoâ, <strong>W</strong>ormâ, <strong>X</strong>ylophoneâ, <strong>Y</strong> / axeâ, <strong>Z</strong>ebraâ.</p>

<p>In Swedish, these correspond to <strong>Ã</strong>ppleâ, <strong>B</strong>jÃ¶rnâ, <strong>K</strong>attâ, <strong>H</strong>undâ, <strong>E</strong>lefantâ, <strong>G</strong>rodaâ, <strong>G</strong>iraffâ, <strong>H</strong>usâ, <strong>I</strong>sâ, <strong>J</strong>etâ, <strong>K</strong>Ã¤nguruâ, <strong>L</strong>ejonâ, <strong>M</strong>usâ, <strong>S</strong>pikâÂ², <strong>U</strong>gglaâ, <strong>G</strong>risâ, <strong>D</strong>rottningâ, <strong>R</strong>egnbÃ¥geâ, <strong>S</strong>nigelâ, <strong>T</strong>igerâ, <strong>U</strong>bÃ¥tâ, <strong>V</strong>ulkanâ, <strong>M</strong>askâÂ³, <strong>X</strong>ylofonâ, <strong>Y</strong>xaâ, <strong>Z</strong>ebraâ.</p>

<p>As you can see, because most of these words</p>

<ul>
<li>are loanwords to both languages (like <em>kangaroo</em> or <em>giraffe</em>), or</li>
<li>are loanwords from English to Swedish (like <em>jet[plane]</em>), or</li>
<li>have [proto-]Germanic roots shared by both English and Swedish (like <em>house</em> and <em>mouse</em>), or</li>
<li>are completely artificial coinages (like <em>xylophone</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>most pairings are sensible in both languages. </p>

<p>All told, in Swedish there are 8 words which simply do not fit, not to mention that, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment938521_395385">as @jkej points out</a>, a Swedish ball would also have to present the letters <code>Ã</code>, <code>Ã</code> and <code>Ã</code>, and would possibly choose to omit <code>W</code>. This rules out the possibility that this is a ball made for the Swedish market.</p>

<p>For English, on the other hand, outside the mysterious <code>Y</code>, all the pairings use straightforward, non-suspicious common nouns an English-speaking toddler would be familiar with<sup>4</sup>. </p>

<p>Except for one. That <em>U-boat</em> is Swedish-fishy.</p>

<h2>A new clue</h2>

<p>Almost no one refers to submarines as U-boats in contemporary English. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937798_395382">@tchrist's response</a> to that information:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... especially how a submarine or âU-boatâ picture that got used for the U, <strong>given how uncommon a word for a sub that U-boat is in English these days</strong> â and to a toddler rather than to a great-grandfather who might actually remember them. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which is evidence against the maker of the ball being completely familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_As_She_Is_Spoke" rel="noreferrer">English as she is spoke</a>. </p>

<p>There's also positive evidence for "U" is for "U-boat" in Swedish children's primers. Quoting <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937595_395385">@jkej in the comments</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The submarine could be seen as circumstantial evidence (although not very strong) for some kind of Swedish mix-up explanation. Although U-boat is an English word, it seems a little strange to use it in this context. But <strong>in Swedish ubÃ¥t is the only word for submarine</strong>.  </p>
  
  <p>I used Google Image to examine some English alphabet posters and it seemed like almost all of them used umbrella or unicorn for U, but none of them used a U-Boat. Similarly, <strong>I found several Swedish alphabet posters with ubÃ¥t for U</strong>, although uggla (owl) was more common. <strong>I can also confirm that yxa was very common for Y</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And indeed it's easy to turn up Swedish pedagogical material having both <code>Y</code> = <em>yxa</em> and <code>U</code> = <em>ubÃ¥t</em>, like this one from the Swedish site <a href="http://www.imgrum.net/tag/barnteckning" rel="noreferrer">imgrum.com</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/xzaQ9.jpg" alt="2x3 grid of letter-image pairs showing <code>T</code>-<code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>But it doesn't stop there.</p>

<h2>Following the footprints</h2>

<p>Following @jkej's lead on Fishpond.com, I found the manufacturer is <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/" rel="noreferrer">Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</a><sup>5</sup></p>

<p>This is page 32 of <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/catalog/flash/Default.html" rel="noreferrer">their online catalog</a> (you need to install Adobe Flash; their PDF catalog is broken<sup>6</sup>):</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/QSulU.png" alt="page 32 of Hedstrom toy catalog"></a></p>

<p><sub>Item G: 54-4155; #10 <strong>A-Z Phonics</strong>; 0-33149 04155-9</sub></p>

<p>However, though Fishpond.com listed "Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc." as the ball's manufacturer, upon visiting BB&amp;S' site, one immediately notices the headers and copy all immediately point to another name:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ERe05.png" alt="Hedstrom logo"></a></p>

<p>Structurally, Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc. was once a subsidiary of <a href="http://hedstrom.com/" rel="noreferrer">Hedstrom</a>, and through a series of fits and starts in the last century, eventually <a href="http://www.sbnonline.com/article/how-jim-braeunig-took-ball-bounce-and-sport-from-bankruptcy-to-booming-business/" rel="noreferrer">took ownership of the Hedstrom brand</a>, and now is  <a href="http://www.ballbouncesport.com/olditems.php" rel="noreferrer">doing business as</a> Hedstrom.</p>

<p>That is, <em>Hedstrom</em> is the ball manufacturer's preferred name for branding purposes. Which is interesting, because the name "Hedstrom" is Scandinavian; per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedstrom" rel="noreferrer">Wikipedia's article on the surname</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hedstrom</strong>, HedstrÃ¶m and HedstrÃ¸m are surnames of <strong>Swedish</strong> and Norwegian origin</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tailing the suspect</h2>

<p>So is the name <em>Hedstrom</em> indicative of Swedish influences on the ball's manufactoring process?</p>

<p>The <em>Smart Business</em> article linked above on BBS taking ownership of the the Hedstrom brand notes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BBS owns 98 percent of U.S. and Canadian rubber ball markets and a growing percentage of the rotational molding market.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No mention of international markets. However, one influence I can find of nonâNorth American interests in Hedstrom is that these sources confirm that manufacturing is done in Asia, as other answers and comments suggest:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BB&amp;Sâs Hedstrom Entertainment Division makes play balls and other toys in Asia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what about Sweden? I've read <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:pxa2mVcNRgMJ:www.hedstromplastics.com/our-company/history/%20&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us" rel="noreferrer">several</a> <a href="http://hedstrom.com/about-us/" rel="noreferrer">different</a> <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20041012/news05/200014205/toy-maker-hedstrom-folds" rel="noreferrer">histories</a> of Hedstrom. The accounts are confusing and at points seemingly contradictory, involving many name changes. </p>

<p>But <a href="http://times-gazette.com/local%20news/2011/02/25/-big-three-carry-on" rel="noreferrer">the salient event</a> was in 1981:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Eagle Rubber started making balloons out of a garage in 1916. The company grew and spawned an industry that led to Ashland becoming the balloon capital of the world. The company eventually added lines of plastic play balls. It was <strong>bought out by Hedstrom Inc. in 1981</strong>, which went bankrupt in 2004.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But if Eagle was the company who built up the play ball business, whence the the acquiring company, Hedstrom? According to <a href="http://www.harryrinker.com/col-1163.html" rel="noreferrer">this column of Harry Rinker</a>, who is an antiques appraiser and thereby somewhat of an historian:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Carl H. Hedstrom, E. Gustaf Hedstrom, Knute W. Hedstrom</strong>, Wilfred P. Shuffleton, and Walter Beaman founded the Hedstrom Company, Gardner, Massachusets in 1915.<br>
  ...
  The Hedstrom Corporation still exists. Its Bedford plant produces outdoor gym sets, <strong>play balls</strong>, toys, etc.  The Dotham operation is toy focused.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the name <em>Hedstrom</em> originates from three Swedes in 1915. The catalog above is dated ~2012, and page 32 lists several of the playballs as <em>new</em>, but not the phonics one, so it's not clear when the ball was first produced. But certainly a century passed between the reason for naming the company <em>Hedstrom</em> and producing the ball. </p>

<p>So, with a century and countless mergers, bankruptcies, and restructurings intervening, the Swedish name <em>Hedstrom</em>, while intriguing, cannot be adduced as evidence that the <code>Y</code> stands for <em>yxa</em>.</p>

<h2>The interrogation</h2>

<p>I reached out to Hedstrom via their online contact form, Twitter, and Facebook. They replied to me this morning via Facebook:</p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/2YQeQ.png" alt="Facebook reply from Hedstrom with photo of A-Z Phonics ball pairing a *yoyo* with <code>Y</code>"></a></p>

<p>They confirm your ball is not an official Hedstrom A-Z Phonics ball. The <strong>official ball has a yo-yo for the letter <code>Y</code></strong>. The Hedstrom ball also has a UPC and producer's mark.</p>

<p>Further, Hedstrom confirms they do no business internationally (outside Canada, one assumes), and they're not aware of any specific producers who have a known history of copying their designs. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoK23.png" alt="Follow-up FB message from Hedstrom confirming they do no business internationally"></a></p>

<p>A second customer service representative actually responded separately to my contact via their website, instead of Facebook. She did her own forensics, and corroborated that Hedstrom's opinion is that this is a knock-off ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thank you for visiting our website and for your online inquiry about an ABC Playball.  Unfortunately, I do not believe this ball was manufactured by Hedstrom.  I've <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziA9p.jpg" rel="noreferrer">attached an image from our QA files of our ball</a> for your reference.  <strong>Some of the things that tip me</strong> off that this is not our ball are the elephant and kangaroo colors.  Also, there is considerably more white space on you ball whereas ours has more designs.  So, just for fun, I visited our samples department hoping to find this ball and I was able to find and inflate a sample of our ball.  <strong>Our playball has a Yo-Yo for the letter "Y"</strong>.  Another way you can tell is whether or not there is an official Hedstrom legal patch.  This patch would contain our name, Hedstrom Corporation, our address, our website, made in China in three different languages, a UPC barcode with the number 0-33149-04155-9 and a four-digit date code.  Our inflation valve should be concealed in the Robot "R" picture, too.  I'm not sure if your ball has our legal patch or not or where your inflation valve is located, but these are just a few of the way we identify our products.  It's probably not impossible for another manufacturer to find and use our designs as these are rather old for us and are not licensed or trademarked.  </p>
  
  <p>Hope that helps solve the mystery for you.  <strong>But we are of the opinion that this is a knock off and not an official Hedstrom produced playball</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One last follow-up, and she shared the history of the ball, to the extent she was able to dig up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The records that I can still access tell me w<strong>e created this ball in 2004 and first sold it in 2005</strong>.  The last one was sold in 2008.  <strong>Our records donât indicate âwhoâ might have been the designer at the time.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Going under cover</h2>

<p>So that trail runs cold. The ball is a knock-off.  Let's examine it in more detail for clues.</p>

<p>Indeed, additional analysis reveals that your ball and the Hedstrom ball are very similar, but not identical. There are some differences which have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>In particular, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">@H Walters points out</a> that the layout â that is, the positions of the symbols relative to one another â are different in your photograph than in the catalog thumbnail for the Hedstrom ball:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are shared designs between the two images. The neighborhood around <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are very different, however; in the OP image <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are adjacent and at each others' "9 o'clock" (<code>E</code> being oriented differently); <code>Q</code> is at <code>K</code>'s 6, and <code>Y</code> at K's 7. In the catalog <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> aren't even adjacent; we can see <code>E</code>'s entire neighborhood (from 1 to 12: <code>BMDGHL</code>), and <code>K</code>'s neighborhood that can be seen is <code>JIDA</code>. So at the very least, if they're the same ball, <code>K</code> and <code>E</code> are repeated, which makes little sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937988_395385">as @m69 further points out</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's not just that the lay-out is different; look at which part of the letter E is covered by the elephant's ear; that's different too.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/i5dwK.png" alt="side-by-side comparison of Hedstrom and OP ball pictures"></a></p>

<p>Note also that in the photo of the ball that Hedstrom sent me, <code>V</code> is used for <em>vase</em>, not <em>volcano</em>, <code>R</code> is for <em>robot</em>, not <em>rainbow</em>, and the drawing of the nail for <code>N</code> is a slightly different style than on your ball.</p>

<h2>The stake-out</h2>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment941010_395385">at @jkej's prompting</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It would add to the "circumstantial" evidence if we could find out the full set of pictures/words used on the original Hedstrom ball. Particularly, it would be very interesting if we could confirm that:   </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>All words that are not sensible in English (i.e. Yxa and U-boat) were absent from the original.   </li>
  <li>All words not sensible in Swedish were present on the original.   </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>If (2) holds it is possible that all words added to the knock-off were taken from a Swedish source. Given the pictures of the original that we already have, we only need to confirm that <strong>O</strong>wl, <strong>Q</strong>ueen and <strong>W</strong>orm were on the original to prove (2).  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I asked my contact at Hedstrom, and she replied:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The âUâ has a red and white UMBRELLA.</strong>  The âOâ has a brown and yellow OWL.  The âQâ has a QUEEN with white hair and a yellow crown with red &amp; blue jewels.  And âWâ is an orange and red WORM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Based on this, @jkej's analysis is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'd like to underscore that I think the answer from Hedstrom was a BIG step forward. It may seem like a dead end, but i<strong>t conclusively tells us that A) the pictures on the ball came from two distinctly separate sources, B) the general impression of an English ball can be fully explained by one of the sources, C) the pictures from the second source are better explained in Swedish.</strong> These were things we could only speculate about before. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>DNE evidence</h2>

<p>So a third-party made a knock-off version of the ball, not unusual in Asian manufacture, and introduced these differences, and perhaps picked up some Swedish contagion in the process.</p>

<p>To confirm that, we'll have to pick up the scent of this mysterious DNE you found near the valve of your ball.</p>

<p>But to do that, we have to start at the other end of the trail. I've reached out to Lojas FranÃ§a via email and Facebook. The email bounced, but there's still hope they'll reply on Facebook.</p>

<h2>A hot lead!</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, an informant, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment941032_395385">@Brad Koch</a>, has it from some good sources in shady corners of the internet that <strong>the ball has been found</strong>. From <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14672359" rel="noreferrer">@thedrake on HackerNews</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I found the BALL manufacturer!!!!<br>
  <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html" rel="noreferrer">https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Alphabets-print-ball_573748097.html</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/YIkLK.jpg" alt="ball pictures from Alibaba.com"></a></p>

<p>And what do we spy in the SW and SE corners of the right image (zoom in):</p>



<p>Our suspects! Hiding in China, right where our intelligence said they'd be.  And all the other images match as well.</p>

<p>Now to track down the manufacturer of these knock-off balls.</p>

<h2>The chase afoot</h2>

<p>From the Alibaba link, we find (one) producer of these balls is  Shanghai Jianhuiling Sporting Goods Co., Ltd. Tracking down <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/manufacturers-suppliers/Shanghai-Jianhuiling-Sporting-Goods-Company-Limited/en/1X03W4G8/" rel="noreferrer">the markets they operate in leads us to</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nature of Business: Exporterâ Manufacturer<br>
  Industry: Toys &amp; Games<br>
  Product/Service Range: Toys and Games<br>
  Major Market(s):<br>
  â¢ Eastern Europe<br>
  â¢ <strong>Western Europe</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A final fingerprint</h2>

<p>So while Hedstrom is not responsible for the axe on your ball, there is one last piece of evidence that <code>Y</code>=<em>yxa</em>.</p>

<p>We find the ball again on <a href="https://www.pinterest.se/pin/431219733041038600/" rel="noreferrer">a Swedish user's Pinterest page</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/CnJV3.jpg" alt="A-Z Phonetics ball found on Swedish Pinterest page"></a></p>

<p>In fact, this one of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=Alphabet&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=simg:CAQSlQEJBOaJ0JJxtOkaiQELEKjU2AQaAggKDAsQsIynCBpiCmAIAxIoshS3FKcKsxSmCqgKpxS4FJAK3h2bNZY1sSn2PfM9nTWeNfg9tiecKRowHvzPjflZDiTjoHy0QXGMFiZBvRMAdAuMrhEfdOmr0G6tIG58poQI734deofnHXWnIAQMCxCOrv4IGgoKCAgBEgT5_1KYbDA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin-rzPsNnUAhXMOiYKHdFPCh4Q2A4IJigB&amp;biw=1131&amp;bih=645" rel="noreferrer">only 3 sites</a> I could find anywhere on the Internet with an image of your ball<sup>7</sup>.</p>

<h2>Case <s>closed</s> open</h2>

<p>After all this, one thing is certain. Since the original designer of the ball, an American company whose employees are native speakers of English, used <em>yo-yo</em> to illustrate <code>y</code>, we know <strong>the intended word is not English</strong>.</p>

<p>Overall, adulteration of the ball with Swedish words seems indicated, though far from definitive.</p>

<p>But it's the best theory I've got. Except of course for <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment937271_395382">@Vincent Fourmond's conclusion</a> that we're dealing here with a <strong><em><a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/markknopfler/yaketyaxe.html" rel="noreferrer">yakety axe</a></em></strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Â¹ <sub> I also tried "and related to": <em>hatchet</em>, <em>chop</em>, and <em>cut</em>, even though the latter two words are verbs and all the other symbols on the child's ball represent concrete nouns. Nothing material emerged.</sub></p>

<p>Â² <sub>We could make a case for <em>N</em> also fitting for Swedish, as <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395711#comment938232_395382">@konaya points out</a>, by observing the depicted object could as easily be a tack, which is <strong><em>n</em></strong><em>ubb</em> in Swedish.</sub></p>

<p>Â³ <sub>Note that the <code>E</code> and <code>K</code> which are on the northermost latitude in the photograph have different orientations, and the symbol always has the same orientation as its letter (i.e., the top of the symbol shows you where the top of the letter is) so there is no concern that the <code>W</code> for <em>worm</em> might be <code>M</code> for <em>maggot</em> or anything.<p>I say this because I wondered for a moment whether the illustrator mistook <code>Y</code> for an upside-down <code>h</code> in <em>hatchet</em>.</p></sub></p>

<p><sup>4</sup> <sub>Which, taken as a holistic pattern, makes the <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/a/395388/55623"><em>yellow</em></a> theory very <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385?noredirect=1#comment937132_395388">dubious</a>.</sub></p>

<p><sup>5</sup> <sub>Since this question was asked, the Fishpond.com product page has been removed, with no redirect. Likely that's due to the the popularity of this question causing many people to hit that page (which listed an out-of-stock item), causing needless load from their perspective. But <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939108_395385">through shrewd parameter hacking, @biolauri</a> got Google <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:tOAl0SvloBsJ:www.fishpond.com/Toys/Playground-Ball-Alphabet-Ball-Bounce-Sport/" rel="noreferrer">to serve up a cached version</a>. A <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EKz3d.png" rel="noreferrer">screenshot is available here</a>, for when the cache inevitably gets flushed and also disappears.</sub></p>

<p><sub>With the cached Fishpond.com page in hand, <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture/395385#comment939363_395385">@H Walters did some source snooping</a> and noticed a number of references to the same number as in the Fishpond.com URL: 0033149041559. Many of these references were meta tags and hidden input fields, variously labelled <em>barcode</em> as in <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="barcode" value="0033149041559" id="barcode" /&gt;</code> or <em>gtin13</em> as in <code>&lt;meta itemprop='gtin13' content='0033149041559' /&gt;</code>. It also exactly matches the code in the catalog (see caption under catalog screenshot; there it is listed in component form <a href="http://www.pacificbarcode.com/all-about-barcodes/" rel="noreferrer">Indicator-Company PrefixâItem Reference-Check Digit</a>), and <a href="http://gepir.gs1.org/index.php/search-by-gtin" rel="noreferrer">a barcode search</a> confirms the company prefix 0033149 is indeed owned by Ball, Bounce and Sport Inc.</sub></p>

<p><sub>An interesting discrepancy, however. While the Fishpond.com and BBS catalog barcode item reference match (04155), the associated "part numbers" do not. The catalog shows 54-4155: that is, group number 54 (likely "decorated play balls"), species 4155 (same as bar code item reference, less the leading 0). But Fishpond.com shows  <em>Other Information:   54-4246T</em>, which is the same group number (54, decorated play balls), but <strong>a different species</strong> 4246T.</sub></p>

<p><sup>6</sup> <sub>And we also know the wholesale price per dozen as of April 2013 was $1.77, thanks to <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/e48a2f_fa8bb3b5c6a97bd7baf7118b822eafee.xls?dn%3DHedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls" rel="noreferrer">this price sheet</a> (file name "HedstromSpecialtyPriceListApril2013.xls") tracked down by <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/395382/which-word-begins-with-y-and-looks-like-an-axe-in-this-picture#comment939485_395385">@Mari-Lou's UPC hunting skills</a>.</sub></p>

<p><sub>Note that the UPC / barcode is the same as in the catalog, 0-33149-04155-9, but the item number differs. The ~2012 catalog has 54-4155, but the 2013 price list has 54-4155<strong>4</strong>. This may be a typo, or it may be additional substantiation that one UPC may be used for different versions of the product.</sub></p>

<p><sup>7</sup> <sub>One potential risk here is that the Pinterest.se page was dynamically generated just for me, based on cookies set during the course of my research into "Swedish" and a young child's toy. Note the Swedish header translates to just a generic a "check out these fine products", and all the products offered are to toys for young children, related to reading, and all the descriptions are in English. But I think the risk here is low: I found the site through a reverse image search on Google, which suggests it pre-existed my research.</sub></p>
