          <h2>$185 billion (wealth of Jeff Bezos)</h2>
          
          <p><span>$80 million</span>
          </p>

          <div>
            <p>Jeff is so wealthy, that it is quite literally unimaginable.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>We rarely see wealth inequality represented to scale. This is part of the reason Americans <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162108" target="_blank">consistently under-estimate</a> the relative wealth of the super rich.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Every 10 pixels you scroll is $5 million.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>OK, we're coming up on the end now.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>Lol, just kidding, we're about a third of the way. Keep scrolling though, there's more to see.</p>
          </div>


          <div>
            <p>Let's put this wealth in perspective by comparing it to some familiar things.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
              <p>All the money you will ever earn in your entire life from the day you are born until the day you die (about $1.7 million)</p>

              </div>
            </div>

          <div>
            <p>Even the fortunes of very rich people are dwarfed by the incomprehensible wealth of the 0.0001%.</p>
          </div>

          </div>

          <div>
            <p>These people may see themselves as fabulously rich, and often oppose policies aimed at reducing inequality.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p>But many have not fully grasped the enormous gulf between themselves and the super rich.</p>

        <h2>400 richest Americans ($3.2 trillion)</h2>

        </p>

        <div>
          <p>
            Jeff Bezos may be insanely rich, but it is a drop in the ocean compared to the combined wealth of his peers. The 400 richest Americans own about $3.2 trillion, which is more than the bottom 60% of Americans.
          </p>
        </div>

        

        

        <div>
          <p>A trillion dollars is such a large figure, that you might as well say "eleventy gajillion zillion dollars."  So in this section, we will try to understand the scale of this figure by looking at what could be accomplished with various chunks of this wealth.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            Some will argue that using this wealth for public benefit is not possible, because it's "tied up" in stocks, and therefore inaccessible. <a href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/blob/master/THE_PAPER_BILLIONAIRE.md" target="_blank">This is just not true</a>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>As we proceed, try to keep in mind: all of this wealth is controlled by a group so small, that they could fit on a single 747 airplane‚Äîwith 260 seats left over.</p>
        </div>

              <h2>Vaccinate every human on earth against coronavirus</h2>
            </p>

        <div>
          <p>Based on the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/eu-coronavirus-vaccines-cheaper-than-united-states/2020/12/18/06677e34-4139-11eb-b58b-1623f6267960_story.html">cost of vaccines</a> and the <a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/covax/costs-of-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-in-92amc_08.02.21.pdf" target="_blank">cost of delivery</a>, it would take around <a href="https://github.com/MKorostoff/1-pixel-wealth/blob/master/docs/COST_OF_VACCINATION.md" target="_blank">$200 billion</a> to vaccinate every person on earth, which is about 6% of the wealth currently controlled by 400 Americans. After paying for this vaccination program, these individuals would still be $40 billion richer than they were before the pandemic.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>Even setting aside the desperate humanitarian need for a global vaccination, there is still a strong self-interested argument that wealthy countries should do it: the longer covid circulates in the world, the more chance of a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933201-800-vaccine-nationalism-will-leave-everyone-more-at-risk-of-coronavirus/" target="_blank">vaccine resistant variant</a> emerging, and undoing all the vaccine progress we've already made.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>The World Health Organization is currently organizing a global vaccine donation program which aims to vaccinate <a href="https://www.who.int/initiatives/act-accelerator/covax" target="_blank">about 20%</a> of residents in poor countries by the end of 2021, and even that approach has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/covax-healthcare-workers-funding/" target="_blank">substantial funding shortfalls</a>.</p>

              <h2>Permanently eradicate malaria</h2>
            </p>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p>Malaria is one of the worst infectious diseases ever visited on mankind, possibly killing more people than any other infectious disease in history. In the 20th century alone, malaria killed more people than the Black Death.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <div>
                <p>Annual Malaria deaths<br> (409,000)</p>
              </div>
            <div><p>Ebola deaths in <strong>all of human history</strong> combined (about 15,000)</p>
              
            </div>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            These figures are even more shocking when you learn that malaria overwhelmingly kills children; around two-thirds of malaria deaths each year are children under five. That's around 275,000 children.
          </p>
        </div>

        

        <div>
            <p><em>All</em> of these deaths are preventable. Treating and preventing malaria is a well understood science, universally practiced in the developed world.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25551454" target="_blank">It is estimated</a> that malaria could be globally eradicated by 2030 for a cost around $1.84 per at-risk person per year, or around $100 billion total. This would be around 3% of the wealth currently possessed by the 400 richest Americans.</p>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p>Around 800 children will die of malaria today. A small group of super rich people could stop it for a sum of money so small that they would likely never even notice its absence. But they choose not to.</p>

              <h2>Wipe out all the delinquent medical debt in America</h2>
            </p>
          </div>

        <div>
            <p>Americans have about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/millennials-rack-up-the-most-medical-debt-and-more-frequently" target="_blank">$81 billion</a> in medical debt that is sufficiently past due as to appear on their credit report. These are generally small debts, with a median value of <a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/201412_cfpb_reports_consumer-credit-medical-and-non-medical-collections.pdf" target="_blank">$207 dollars</a> per person.</p>
            <p> These debts hinder the credit of over 50 million Americans, and do long term damage to their housing, employment, and borrowing options. The cost of repaying this debt dollar-for-dollar would be around 2.5% of the wealth controlled by 400 Americans.</p>
          </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            This situation looks even better once you understand that delinquent debt is often purchased for as <a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/46455844/charity-buys-and-erases-past-due-medical-debt" target="_blank">little as 1%</a> of its face value. This would make the total cost of eliminating all delinquent medical debt around $810 million. In 2020, the richest 400 Americans accrued this amount roughly every 29 hours.

          <p>
            As of 2021, around 38 million Americans lived in poverty. If Americans in poverty were a state, they would be second largest by population. There are more Americans living in poverty than the entire population of Canada.
          </p>
        </div>

            <h3>Population of US States compared to poverty, 2021</h3>

          <p><a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2019/demo/p60-266.pdf" target="_blank">Every single person</a> in America could be lifted above the poverty line with a one-time cash subsidy of around $10,000 per impoverished family (and about $7,000 for impoverished individuals). The total cost would be $170 billion, a little over 5% of the wealth currently controlled by 400 individuals.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>It may seem counter intuitive that a one-time subsidy could have any lasting impact on chronic poverty. But one of the surprising truths about poverty is that it's fluid. Americans move in and out of poverty many times throughout their lives, and one good year can have a massive and long lasting effect.</p>

              <p>A wealth of data now supports the idea that <a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/research-on-cash-transfers/" target="_blank">one-time cash transfers can permanently transform a local economy.</a> Given a sudden windfall, people invest in their future. They go back to school, obtain transportation, pay for childcare, pay down debilitating debts, and do any number of things to improve their career prospects and financial future.</p>
          </div>

        

        <div>
          <p>This would not be a permanent fix for all Americans. Surely, some would quickly return to poverty, and others face debts so large that the subsidy would make little difference. But for tens of millions of Americans, this would be a life changing event. It would be a generation defining social program that reshapes our economy for decades to come.</p>

            These programs combined would completely transform our world. By redistributing this wealth, millions of lives would be saved. Billions would be rescued from poverty and disease.

And in breaking news situations, it‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/may/outrunning-the-worlds-fastest-flowing-lava-and-rebuilding-goma.html" rel="">moving </a><em><a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/news/2022/may/outrunning-the-worlds-fastest-flowing-lava-and-rebuilding-goma.html" rel="">fast</a></em><span>. In a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1714615279848726993" rel="">post</a><span> on Twitter, I estimated that dealing with situations where the news is evolving over the course of minutes or hours is about 10x harder than ones where it develops over days or weeks. I mean that literally. I hate to play the ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù card ‚Äî there are many journalists who have much more experience in breaking news situations than I do ‚Äî but handling these cases is a </span><em>very</em><span> difficult job, much more difficult than armchair quarterbacking like I‚Äôm doing now.</span></p><p><span>Shouldn‚Äôt newsrooms just be more careful in these situations? The short answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù. The Times‚Äôs </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/18/business/media/hospital-blast-gaza-reports.html" rel="">excuse</a><span> is basically that it was just passing along a newsworthy claim made by a Palestinian spokesperson. I don‚Äôt think that really works, however. </span></p><p><span>Sure, technically, the claim in the Times news alert was attributed. ‚ÄúIsraeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, </span><strong>Palestinian Officials Say</strong><span>‚Äù (emphasis added). But that‚Äôs not how most readers see it, particularly when the attribution comes at the end of the sentence. They‚Äôll see </span><strong>ISRAELI STRIKE KILLS HUNDREDS IN HOSPITAL</strong><span> (palestinian officials say). The Times is providing some degree of dignity and veracity to that claim by printing it, just as it would if it sent out a breaking news alert that said:</span></p><p><strong>‚ÄúU.F.O. Cited Over Manhattan, Nate Silver Says‚Äù</strong></p><p><span>If it later turned out that the ‚ÄúU.F.O.‚Äù had just been a 747 landing at LaGuardia, and I‚Äôd made the claim while tripping on psychedelic mushrooms, this wouldn‚Äôt really absolve the Times for printing it </span><em>without some independent verification or a second source</em><span>.</span></p><p><span>But, newsrooms do face conflicting pressures. They </span><em>will</em><span> get criticized if they‚Äôre too slow on reporting the news. Or they may fear ‚Äî I‚Äôm explaining their thought process, not endorsing it ‚Äî that failure to report on the story will create a news vacuum that will be filled with ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù, partisan sources, or random people speculating on Twitter.</span></p><p><span>And it is possible to screw up in both directions. Fearing a repeat of election night in 2000, when the state of Florida was </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/12/666812854/the-florida-recount-of-2000-a-nightmare-that-goes-on-haunting" rel="">prematurely called twice (!) by the networks</a><span> ‚Äî it‚Äôs still amazing that didn‚Äôt do even more damage to journalistic credibility ‚Äî most newsrooms are now very cautious about declaring winners in elections. I thought that they actually erred too much on the side of caution in 2020, for instance, when it had become </span><a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/11/decision-desk-hq-called-the-2020-election-for-biden-what-is-it.html" rel="">obvious at least 48 hours before</a><span> the networks called the race that Biden was eventually going to secure enough votes to win Pennsylvania and other key Electoral College states.</span></p><p><span>When a newsroom misreports a breaking story, does that reveal its editorial biases? Again, the obvious answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, but I‚Äôd qualify that by saying it reflects the thought processes of the particular people who were on hand to make decisions at that particular moment. News that breaks at night, on the weekend, or in the midst of </span><em>another</em><span> developing story probably needs to be treated with even more caution. Until the AI singularity takes place ‚Äî just kidding ‚Äî the Times and other newsrooms will be staffed by error-prone human beings.</span></p><p>In the light of day, however, the media has far fewer excuses for getting the story wrong. And although the Times eventually walked its initial reporting back, it was exceptionally stubborn about doing so. At 5:04 p.m. on Tuesday, it sent out another news alert: ‚ÄúIsrael and Palestinians blame each other for Gaza hospital blast‚Äù. At 6:01 p.m., yet another ‚Äî‚ÄúThe Evening: A blast killed hundreds at a Gaza hospital‚Äù ‚Äî that treated the causality figure and the location of the blast as a hard fact. </p><p><span>Even at </span><a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1714638264303313260" rel="">9:43 a.m. on Wednesday morning</a><span>, the Times was still running with this headline on its mobile edition:</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png" width="1456" height="1142" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1142,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1215634,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a13be3f-13d9-4642-9eaf-e8ed7e34fc89_2134x1674.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>By this point, other news outlets had begin to substantially change their framing of the story.

The headline, framed in the passive voice, tells you pretty much all you need to know: </span><strong>‚ÄúAfter Hospital Blast, Headlines Shift With Changing Claims.‚Äù</strong><span> There is no admission of error whatsoever:</span></p><blockquote><p>The news changed quickly over a couple of hours. Many Western news organizations, including The New York Times, reported the Gazan claims in prominent headlines and articles. They adjusted the coverage after the Israeli military issued a statement urging ‚Äúcaution‚Äù about the Gazan allegation. The news organizations then reported the Israeli military‚Äôs assertion that the blast was the result of a failed rocket launch by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an armed group aligned with Hamas.</p></blockquote><p><span>In this account, the Times frames itself as an innocent, passive actor, one that‚Äôs  merely reporting on the existence of the lava ‚Äî neglecting its role in trying to steer it. That‚Äôs complete bullshit, because the Times is </span><em>extremely </em><span>and often somewhat proudly self-conscious of this role. ‚ÄúWe set the agenda for the country‚Äù is </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2016/11/shocked-by-trump-new-york-times-finds-time-for-soul-searching-1201852490/" rel="">literally the prevailing attitude in the building</a><span>.</span></p><p>And yet, the reporter on the business section story couldn‚Äôt even get a comment from an editor in the Times newsroom. She had to rely on the PR department instead:</p><blockquote><p>The BBC and Al Jazeera did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Times spokesman said, ‚ÄúWe report what we know as we learn it.‚Äù</p></blockquote><p><span>This morning, Gallup </span><a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/512861/media-confidence-matches-2016-record-low.aspx" rel="">published</a><span> its annual poll on trust in the media.

He was denied medical treatment when ill, has been refused visits by his family for more than a year and is not allowed to make telephone calls. Yet Mr Navalny, ever stoical, has described his imprisonment not as martyrdom, but as a nuisance and a challenge that needs to be overcome.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The challenges continue to mount. In August Mr Navalny was sentenced to an additional 19 years in prison for ‚Äúextremism‚Äù on top of the eleven-and-a-half years he was already serving for ‚Äúfraud‚Äù. But even then he continued to communicate with his supporters and to haunt Vladimir Putin, whose thugs tried to poison him in 2020 and then subjected him to torturous conditions in jail when he returned to Russia the following year after being treated in Germany. Mr Navalny‚Äôs rare appearances in courts (mostly via video link) have turned into political speeches, and visits by his lawyers have kept him in touch with the outside world. ‚ÄúHis voice from behind bars sounded unbearably loud for Putin,‚Äù Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny‚Äôs chief of staff, wrote on X (formerly Twitter) from Vilnius, Lithuania‚Äôs capital.</p><p data-component="paragraph">So Mr Putin decided to turn down the volume, and to deprive Mr Navalny of his last channel of communication. On October 13th three of Mr Navalny‚Äôs lawyers‚ÄîVadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser (pictured) and Igor Sergunin‚Äîwere arrested and accused of ‚Äúparticipation in an extremist community‚Äù; that is, of passing Mr Navalny‚Äôs words to the outside world. Olga Mikhailova, another of his lawyers, had left the country by the time her offices were raided.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Mr Navalny learned the news from a journalist during one of his appeal hearings. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on. My lawyer is not here. All the other lawyers are not here. Nobody is allowed to visit me. I am isolated and cut off from any information,‚Äù he told the judge. Even the radio in his cell has been turned off, he said, to plunge him into complete silence. Shortly after that, news came that Mr Navalny‚Äôs fifth lawyer, who was supposed to attend the appeal hearing, had fled the country.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The practice of jailing not only dissidents but also their lawyers has been tried and tested in Belarus, but is relatively new in Russia. Some 200 Russian defence lawyers have signed a petition denouncing the climate of fear in which they operate, and calling for a strike. Two volunteers have now come forward to help Mr Navalny.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Having no legal representation and no contact with the outside world makes Mr Navalny especially vulnerable, as he has been awaiting a transfer to one of Russia‚Äôs toughest prisons for a year. (‚ÄúI feel like a tired rock star on the verge of depression. I‚Äôve reached the top of the charts and there‚Äôs nothing more to strive for,‚Äù he joked when he heard of his transfer order.)</p><p data-component="paragraph">All this is part of the Kremlin‚Äôs preparation for next March‚Äôs presidential election, which is sure to be farcical. Mr Putin will aim to demonstrate total political control and to keep his opponents demoralised. A few hours after losing his lawyers, Mr Navalny somehow managed to convey that by January 15th he will produce his strategy for how best to tackle Mr Putin‚Äôs election, though it is not clear how he will now be able to communicate it. ‚ÄúPrison exists only in your mind,‚Äù Mr Navalny wrote in one of his early posts. If so, he remains the freest man in Russia. <span>‚ñ†</span></p></div><p>This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline "Alexei Navalny loses his lawyers"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/">Europe</a> <span>October 21st 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/15/poland-gives-pro-european-liberals-a-big-win"><span>Poland gives pro-European liberals a big win</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/how-a-31-year-old-hopes-to-fix-ukraines-state-owned-defence-giant"><span>How a 31-year-old hopes to fix Ukraine‚Äôs state-owned defence giant</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/alexei-navalnys-lawyers-are-arrested"><span>Alexei Navalny‚Äôs lawyers are arrested</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/marine-le-pen-poses-a-greater-threat-than-giorgia-meloni"><span>Marine Le Pen poses a greater threat than Giorgia Meloni</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/paris-and-berlin-compromise-on-reform-of-the-electricity-market"><span>Paris and Berlin compromise on reform of the electricity market</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2023/10/19/the-eus-response-to-the-crisis-in-israel-exposes-its-limits"><span>The EU‚Äôs response to the crisis in Israel exposes its limits</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Where will this end?" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1684" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="300px" srcset="https://www.economist.com/img/b/16/21/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 16w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/32/42/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 32w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/48/63/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 48w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/64/84/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 64w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/96/126/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 96w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/128/168/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 128w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/256/336/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 256w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/360/473/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 360w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/384/505/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 384w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/480/631/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 480w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/600/789/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 600w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/834/1097/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 834w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/960/1263/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 960w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1096/1441/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 1096w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1684/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 1280w, https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg 1424w" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1424/1873/90/media-assets/image/20231021_DE_EU.jpg"></figure></div><div orientation="vertical"><h3 orientation="vertical">From the October 21st 2023 edition</h3><p orientation="vertical">Discover stories from this section and more in the list of contents </p><a href="https://www.economist.com/printedition/2023-10-21" data-analytics="sidebar:weekly_edition"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M12 1c6.075 0 11 4.925 11 11s-4.925 11-11 11S1 18.075 1 12 5.925 1 12 1zm.142 4.5l-1.008 1.062c3.33 3.276 4.194 4.14 4.608 4.5-1.602-.018-3.168-.018-10.242-.018v1.584c7.074 0 8.73 0 10.242-.018-.432.36-1.314 1.206-4.608 4.536l1.008 1.044 6.354-6.354L12.142 5.5z" fill="#2E45B8" fill-rule="nonzero"></path></g></svg><span>Explore the edition</span></a></div></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Using extra Firefox profiles to make my life better</h2>

	<p><small>October 19, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>At the moment I have two main browser instances, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ChromeWalkingAwayII">both using Firefox</a>. My primary browsing is in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/WhyCustomFirefoxII">my customized
Firefox</a>, with <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/Firefox104AddonsUnchanged">assorted strict settings and
extensions</a> that result in it mostly not
running JavaScript, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/NotLoggedIn">being logged in to places</a>, and
so on. Since <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/NoJavascriptIsNotEasy">browsing with JavaScript off can be annoying</a>, I have a second Firefox instance that's
my 'just make it work' browser; it runs JavaScript, accepts and
gives back all of those cookies, and so on, and then it throws
cookies and everything away when I close it.</p>

<p>(I implement this second stock Firefox environment not with a profile
but by changing the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable before I run this
Firefox. Firefox on Unix helpfully respects <code>$HOME</code> and having the
two environments be completely separate avoids various potential
problems.)</p>

<p>This second 'JavaScript' Firefox environment is what I normally use
when I need to log in to sites I don't like (especially if they
want to use JavaScript, which they usually do); I log in, do whatever,
and close the browser, flushing my login session along with all of
the other cookies. However, for my sins I use a number of websites
that require both JavaScript and logins, and that have annoying or
painful login procedures. These sites do things such as requiring
multi-factor authentication every time with a physical token, or
sending email every time I log in (or just a tediously long and
slow multi-step login process). As a result I want to log in to
them as infrequently as possible, which means keeping their login
cookies.</p>

<p>(For some of these sites, I also don't want to casually browse other
places while logged in to them, because they have some degree of
important privileges. Otherwise, for some sites I could start my
JavaScript Firefox environment at the start of the day and only
exit it at the end, letting cookies and so on accumulate (only)
over the course of the day. It's not perfect, but it is lazy.)</p>

<p>My solution to this is a set of additional profiles in the 'JavaScript'
Firefox setup, one per annoying website. Each profile gets a standard
set of Firefox addons, of which the critical ones are uBlock
Origin and Cookie AutoDelete. In each profile, I set Cookie AutoDelete
to keep the necessary cookies for the particular website (or related
set of them), and then clean up everything else. Those additional
cookies come from various things, including me browsing off that
site by following links on it. It generally takes a little bit of
initial work to figure out what sites need their cookies retained,
but once that's set up, all of these profiles have been stable and
trouble-free.</p>

<p>(In theory I could try to put limits of what websites can use
JavaScript in these profiles, but in practice it's too much of
a pain in the rear.)</p>

<p>In theory perhaps I could use something like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox Multi-Account
Containers</a>
for this, but I prefer separate profiles. They're probably more
work to set up in the beginning, but I feel more confident about
what they're doing and how various aspects interact with each other.
Profiles are definitely completely separate from each other, including
for extension settings and so on. Containers, well, it depends.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: my usual Firefox addons for these profiles</h3>

<p>In addition to uBlock Origin and Cookie AutoDelete, I also add Foxy
Gestures (which is a critical part of my Firefox experience), Cookie
Quick Manager, and generally Certainly Something (for TLS certificate
viewing). Some of these profiles have accumulated additional addons
over time, usually ones that mitigate tracking. These days I also
install <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxBookmarkletButtonsNotes">my bookmarklet buttons</a>
(for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxReadablePraise">readable</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxBookmarkletButtonsNotes">fixed</a>).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Slack is retiring its status account on X that previously shared updates about issues and outages on the platform, the company announced on Thursday. ‚ÄúWe made the decision to retire the&nbsp;@SlackStatus account in order to consolidate our communications around incidents and focus resources on those most widely used by our customers,‚Äù Kevin Albers, VP of customer experience at Slack, said in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SlackStatus/status/1715109509230968834">The account</a> was a useful way to be notified when Slack was investigating problems, especially for those of us at <em>The Verge</em> who end up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/17/23835971/slack-major-issues-outage-send-messages">writing</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/27/23809649/slack-down-july-2023">about</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/13/23402802/slack-problems-bugs-outage-threads-channels-loading">those</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22968785/slack-down-outage-messages-edit-chat-connection-problem">issues</a>.

If you want to keep tabs on Slack‚Äôs status moving forward, Albers pointed to <a href="https://status.slack.com/">Slack‚Äôs main status page</a> and said that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre also happy to answer any questions related to incidents from our main account,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/SlackHQ">@SlackHQ</a>.‚Äù You can also get alerts by subscribing to Slack‚Äôs RSS and Atom feeds.</p><p>X sent an autoreply to my request for comment: ‚ÄúBusy now, please check back later.‚Äù</p><p>Other companies have also reduced their investment in X.

  <span><strong>Nota</strong></span> is a language for writing documents, like academic papers and blog posts.
</span>
The goal of <a href="#def-nota"><span><strong>Nota</strong></span></a> is to <strong>bring documents into the 21st century.</strong></p><p>Documents contain a lot of structure ‚Äî for example, "<a href="#def-nota"><span><strong>Nota</strong></span></a>" is a reference to a term defined in the preceding paragraph. <a href="#def-nota"><span><strong>Nota</strong></span></a> enables authors to <em>represent</em> that structure, which allows the reading medium (the browser) to <em>understand</em> that structure, which in turn empowers readers to <em>use</em> that structure.

Tooling will have bugs and missing features. Documentation will be incomplete or incorrect. Right now, I am seeking early adopters that want to help make Nota the document language of the future.</p></section><section><h2><p><span>2</span> Why Nota?</p></h2><p>There are two main mediums for digital documents: PDFs and web pages. PDFs were designed to mirror physical documents, so they impose the real-world constraints of paper: page breaks, fixed width, and immutable styling. Web pages, by contrast, provides an essential dynamism. Web pages can be dynamically formatted: resized for phones, translated into other languages, colors changed for color-blindness. Web pages can be dynamically interactive: text prompted for more context, diagrams shifted for a new perspective, annotations added for posterity. Web pages are undeniably the future of digital documents.</p><p>But currently, that dynamism is only accessible to professional web developers. Existing document tools like <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, <a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, and <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/">Scribble</a> can (for the most part) only generate static web pages. Nota's goal is to bridge that gap by providing authors with a document language that has a low floor, a high ceiling, and a smooth ramp up.</p><p>Part of this design is identifying components that are easy to use for authors and have high impact for the reader. For instance, the <code>@Definition</code> and <code>@Ref</code> components in the example above require a small amount of document annotation on the author's part. Then the Nota runtime can provide features like presenting a reference's definition in context via tooltip. Future Nota versions could include more advanced features like <q>find all references to this definition</q>.</p><p>For more on this design philosophy, you can read my original paper <a href="https://willcrichton.net/nota/">"A New Medium for Communicating Research on Programming Languages"</a>.</p></section></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<i>Disclaimer: This is about community management and pricing. The tech, design &amp; prototyping are all great.</i>
<a href="https://twitter.com/coding398/status/1710604447641133478">retweet</a>
<hr>
<p id="desc"> Over the past few months, Replit.com has changed their pricing drastically to the point where it is
simply not
viable.
<br> We, along with many others, have used Replit for years, however, at its current point we are all looking for
alternatives.
<br> This website covers <b>what happened, a comparison, alternatives, and community quotes</b> to give perspective
on the current issues of the platform.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>What happened?</h3>
<section id="whatHappened">
<div>
<h3>Nerfing Hacker Plan</h3>
<p>
The cutback of "Always On" instances from five to one hit Hacker Plan users hard. This shift took many projects
offline, with users unable to pay the extra $292.20/year for 4 more always on repls.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, reducing the number of Boosts included in the Hacker Plan from five to one, and reducing base repl
specs to the same level as the free plan, unless you were actively inside the Replit workspace, left users
wondering how Replit Hacker plan could anymore be a justified expense.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Outrageous AI</h3>
<p>
Replit's enduring focus on AI and LLMs have put them in a state of throwing money at a losing battle.
Ghostwriter is $10/month, yet it uses the same technology one can get for extraordinarily less from OpenAI.
</p>
<p>
Trending Repls have been heavily focused on AI, as well as the company's social media accounts &amp; most heavily,
their CEO.
</p>
<p>
However, it must be said, integrating AI has always been one of the main goals of Replit, right from day 1. It
just feels overemphasised currently. AI is undoubtedly a very interesting space in computer science right now,
however it's not the only one. A balance should be made such that AI exists within the product and community,
but is not such an overwhelming majority of the focus as it is now.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>10x Hike in Power-ups</h3>
<p>
Replit's price hike for power-ups like Boosts and the Always On feature greatly affected its large student and
budding coder user base. The increased costs, from 2 to 70 cycles/day, for a Boost, and 2 to 20 cycles/day, for
the Always On feature, made these features less accessible, impacting the budget community.
</p>
<p>
Replit has previously been very focused on their platform being used for new coders, with their motto
"Bringing the next billion software creators online". However, this target audience has changed recently, with
low budget beginner, student, and hobby developers being pushed away by the increased pricing.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Reserved VM Pricing &amp; customisability</h3>
<p>
The first offender of their Deployments is Reserved VMs. For the lowest tier, <b>you get a CPU with 2.199GHz clock speed, 1GiB of RAM,
and 10GiB of outbound data transfer.</b></p>
<p>On platforms such as DigitalOcean and AWS, they can be way
cheaper.</p>
<p>Replit deployments also don't have live SSH, reserved IPs, choice of OS, UDP, firewall rules, and has an overall lack of customisation.</p>
<div>
<p><span>Replit.com - $6.40/month</span>
<br>
<span>2.199GHz/1GB RAM/10GB transfer</span>
</p>

<p><span>DigitalOcean.com - $6.00/month</span>
<br>
<span>2.494GHz/1GB RAM/1TB transfer</span>
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div>
<h3>Uncompetitive Static</h3>
<p>Replit's static deployments is just that - static site hosting. Just one small issue, and pay attention - all
of these sites below are free.</p>
<p><span>Replit.com</span>
<br>
<span>10GiB transfer</span>
</p>

<p><span>Github Pages</span>
<br>
<span>100GiB transfer</span>
</p>

<p><span>Cloudflare Pages</span>
<br>
<span>Unlimited* transfer</span>
</p>
<p><i>*Cloudflare's Pages obviously isn't unlimited, however will incur terabytes of transfer before you may get a
friendly email.</i>
</p></div>
<div>
<h3>Egress Limits</h3>
<p>
On April 7, 2023, Replit set egress limits across all plans. Aimed at controlling outbound data transfer, this
move faced backlash, especially from the Free tier users.
</p>
<p>
With limits set at 10 GiB for Free, 50 GiB for Hacker, and 100 GiB for Pro tiers, many found them restrictive.
Particularly those on the free plan, hosting popular projects.
</p>
<p><span>Replit.com</span>
<br>
<span>$0.1/GiB, 10GiB FREE</span>
</p>

<p><span>DigitalOcean.com</span>
<br>
<span>$0.01/GiB, 500GiB FREE</span>
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Replit.dev</h3>
<p>
The final blow came when Replit announced that your repls could only stay online when you are actively within
the workspace, now Replit Deployments stand as Replit's only hosting option.
</p>
<p>
This decision seemed to counter Replit's user-friendly ethos, sparking widespread confusion and shock within the
community. Especially as they promised to <a href="https://blog.replit.com/glitch#~text=But%20we%20will%20never%20ban%20pinging%20to%20force%20people%20to%20upgrade%20by%20taking%20away%20features.:~:text=But%20we%20will%20never%20ban%20pinging%20to%20force%20people%20to%20upgrade%20by%20taking%20away%20features.">
never force users to move away from pingers to a paid product</a>, which is exactly was just been done. Users
can no longer ping their hosted repl's repl.co url, and instead must move to the paid deployments product to
continue hosting on Replit.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Misleading Bounties</h3>
<p>
Replit proudly shows over $40,000 open in bounties, but when analysing further over 175 "open" bounties are over 4 months old, leaving an estimated $15k in bounties that aren't stale. 64.5% of open bounties are over 4 months old, last updated 11 Oct.
</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Terrible community management</h3>
<p>
The 16k+ member Replit Discord community fell to bits after the moderation team wasn't paid any more than their
Hacker plan, all nerfed and shiny at $7/month. Understandably, moderators striked, causing Replit to abandon
control of the community server altogether.
</p>
<p>
The Replit Reps program was abandoned too, with it disbanding after only 1 and a half cohort cycles.
</p><p>
Jams were reduced from events like <b>Kajam</b> and <b>#madewithreplit</b> to AI hackathons that a 14 year old
won with school &amp; no prior experience. Prize pools have dropped from over $10k to around $2k per event, lowering
the incentive.

<p>Measurements from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite show that this year‚Äôs ozone hole over Antarctica is one of the biggest on record. The hole, which is what scientists call an ‚Äòozone depleting area,‚Äô reached a size of 26 million sq km on 16 September 2023. This is roughly three times the size of Brazil.</p>


			
    
						
			<div>
				<h4><b>How we measure the ozone hole</b></h4><p>The size of the ozone hole fluctuates on a regular basis. From August to October, the ozone hole increases in size ‚Äì reaching a maximum between mid-September and mid-October. When temperatures high up in the stratosphere start to rise in the southern hemisphere, the ozone depletion slows, the polar vortex weakens and finally breaks down, and by the end of December ozone levels return to normal.</p><p>Launched in October 2017, <a href="https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Sentinel-5P" target="_blank">Copernicus Sentinel-5P</a> ‚Äì short for Sentinel-5 Precursor ‚Äì is the first Copernicus satellite dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere. It is part of the fleet of Copernicus Sentinel missions that ESA develops for the European Union‚Äôs environmental monitoring programme.</p><p>The satellite carries an advanced multispectral imaging spectrometer called Tropomi. It detects the unique fingerprints of atmospheric gases in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum to image a wide range of pollutants more accurately and at a higher spatial resolution than ever before.</p><p>The Tropomi total ozone measurements are processed within the Sentinel-5P ground segment at the German Aerospace Center (<a href="https://www.dlr.de/en/" target="_blank">DLR</a>) using algorithms that has been developed by DLR and the Royal Belgium Institute for Space Aeronomy (BIRA-IASB).</p>	</div>

		<p>Diego Loyola, DLR senior scientist, commented, ‚ÄúThe Sentinel-5P total ozone products have an accuracy at the percentage level compared with ground-based data and this allows us to closely monitor the ozone layer and its evolution. The Tropomi measurements are extending the global ozone data record of European satellite sensors covering almost three decades.‚Äù</p><p>The Sentinel-5P total ozone column product is provided within three hours after measurement time to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (<a href="https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/" target="_blank">CAMS</a>). CAMS, which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (<a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/" target="_blank">ECMWF</a>) on behalf of the European Union, includes these near-realtime Sentinel-5P ozone data in their data analysis and forecast system.</p><p>CAMS senior scientist Antje Inness, said, ‚ÄúOur operational ozone monitoring and forecasting service shows that the 2023 ozone hole got off to an early start and has grown rapidly since mid-August. It reached a size of over 26 million sq km on 16 September making it one of the biggest ozone holes on record. Tropomi ozone data are an important dataset for our ozone analysis.‚Äù</p><h4><b>Why is the ozone hole so big?</b></h4><p>The variability of the size of the ozone hole is largely determined by the strength of a strong wind band that flows around the Antarctic area. This strong wind band is a direct consequence of Earth's rotation and the strong temperature differences between polar and moderate latitudes.</p><p>If the band of wind is strong, it acts like a barrier: air masses between polar and temperate latitudes can no longer be exchanged. The air masses then remain isolated over the polar latitudes and cool down during the winter.</p><p>Although it may be too early to discuss the reasons behind the current ozone concentrations, some researchers speculate that this year‚Äôs unusual ozone patterns could be associated with the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai in January 2022.</p>	</div>

		<p>Antje explains, ‚ÄúThe eruption of the Hunga Tonga volcano in January 2022 injected a lot of water vapour into the stratosphere which only reached the south polar regions after the end of the 2022 ozone hole.</p><p>‚ÄúThe water vapour could have led to the heightened formation of polar stratospheric clouds, where chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) can react and accelerate ozone depletion. The presence of water vapour may also contribute to the cooling of the Antarctic stratosphere, further enhancing the formation of these polar stratospheric clouds and resulting in a more robust polar vortex.‚Äù</p><p>However, it's important to note that the exact impact of the Hunga Tonga eruption on the Southern Hemisphere ozone hole is still a subject of ongoing research. This is due to the absence of previous instances where such substantial amounts of water vapour were injected into the stratosphere in modern observations.</p><p>ESA‚Äôs mission manager for Copernicus Sentinel-5P, Claus Zehner, adds, ‚ÄúThe Sentinel-5P total ozone columns provide an accurate means to monitor ozone hole occurrences from space. Ozone hole phenomena cannot be used in straightforward manner for monitoring global ozone changes as they are determined by the strength of regional wind fields that flow around polar areas.‚Äù</p><h4><b>The lingering impact of ozone depleting substances</b></h4><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the widespread use of damaging chlorofluorocarbons in products such as refrigerators and aerosol tins damaged ozone high up in our atmosphere ‚Äì which led to a hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica.</p><p>In response to this, the Montreal Protocol was created in 1987 to protect the ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of these harmful substances, which is leading to a recovery of the ozone layer.</p><p>Claus concludes, ‚ÄúBased on the Montreal Protocol and the decrease of anthropogenic ozone-depleting substances, scientists currently predict that the global ozone layer will reach its normal state again by around 2050.‚Äù</p><p>ESA has been involved in monitoring ozone for many years. Launched in October 2017, Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite is the first Copernicus satellite dedicated to monitoring our atmosphere. With its state-of-the-art instrument, Tropomi, it is able to detect atmospheric gases to image air pollutants more accurately and at a higher spatial resolution than ever before from space.</p>	</div>

    <h2>LLM data</h2>

    <p>
      It is well understood that LLMs thrive on high-quality data. We have the largest collection of books, papers, magazines, etc in the world, which are some of the highest quality text sources.
    </p>

    <h3>Unique scale and range</h3>
    
    <p>
      Our collection contains over a hundred million files, including academic journals, textbooks, and magazines. We achieve this scale by combining large existing repositories.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some of our source collections are already available in bulk (Sci-Hub, and parts of Libgen). Other sources we liberated ourselves. <a href="https://annas-archive.org/datasets">Datasets</a> shows a full overview.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our collection includes millions of books, papers, and magazines from before the e-book era. Large parts of this collection have already been OCR‚Äôed, and already have little internal overlap.
    </p>

    <h3>How we can help</h3>

    <p>
      We would love to help you train or finetune your LLMs. We can help with:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>High-speed access to our collection</li>
      <li>OCR</li>
      <li>Removing overlap (deduplication)</li>
      <li>Text and metadata extraction</li>
      <li>Advice from domain experts</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span><p>This morning, two emails came in from Apple. The first was about the upcoming renewal of my yearly subscription to Disney+ and the second email was about the price increase of my Disney+ subscription from $79.99 to $109.99. It took me all of 10 seconds to think about it, but I canceled my subscription. It‚Äôs not really about the $30 price increase, which is outrageous, but mostly because there won‚Äôt 12 months of TV show and movies to watch, in no small part thanks to the actions of Disney‚Äôs CEO.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm affected by the ongoing strikes, where the studios have <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/message-your-negotiating-committee-0">once again walked away from the negotiating table</a>. Almost all entertainment production has ground to a halt. The recent resolution of the WGA strike was celebrated, but it was a long, and painful process. All of our hopes, as workers in this industry, were pinned on the SAG-AFTRA dispute coming to a close. Instead, the studios decided to do what they did months ago in the WGA strike and take their case to the Hollywood trade publications owned by Penske Media in the hopes that they could gin up dissent in the union to push the union negotiators. It didn‚Äôt work with the WGA membership, and I don‚Äôt think anyone other than studio brass expects it to work on SAG-AFTRA either. There can be no resolution external to negotiation, so this just delays everything.</p>
<p>Films and shows that were slated to come out this year have been spread out, some pushing to next year. You can only spread things out so far, and that is particularly true of all the studio streamers that got into this game late.</p>
<p>When Disney+ first premiered it was criticized for only having <em>The Mandalorian</em> and <em>WandaVision</em> which were both over in the blink of an eye. Marvel, for me, has had diminishing returns since then, and I would not subscribe to Disney+ to exclusively watch anything from Marvel at this point.</p>
<p>Star Wars, unfortunately, is also on the bubble with several disappointments, including the most recent <em>Star Wars: Ashoka</em> where I watched 50 minutes of space whales doing space whale stuff. Stretching <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Key</em> and <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em> out into next year, with both unlikely to be as inspired as <em>Star Wars: Andor</em> doesn‚Äôt convince me that $109.99 needs to leave my bank account right this very minute. If anything I can always dip in if it‚Äôs good, or wait until it‚Äôs over and binge. A year of, basically nothing, isn‚Äôt a year I need to pay for.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-we-get-here"><a href="#how-did-we-get-here">How Did We Get Here?</a></h2>
<p>Disney, and everyone else, sold streaming licensing rights to Netflix for many years. It was like selling the broadcast rights for a film to appear on an old-fashioned TV channel. Audiences were trained to expect streaming media. Bob Iger, infamously, compared this to arms dealing, in a metaphor that no one really thought he should be making. Then Disney‚Äôs contract with Netflix ended and they went direct to consumer with Disney+.</p>
<p>I still remember the live-streamed shareholder meeting where Disney+ was first announced and Christine McCarthy (former CFO) outlined how the company‚Äôs low introductory price, and small number of territories, meant that it would be unprofitable for many, many years. Disney expected the stock market to treat Disney like they treated Netflix, which at the time was operating on a growth model. Everything was upended by the pandemic halting production, starving new services of new entertainment, and then by the Netflix Correction, where interest rates were up and shareholders wanted to see revenue off those subscribers, not just growth. That was not something Disney was prepared for, at any level of the company.</p>
<p>Bob Iger‚Äôs plans for Disney+ had blown up spectacularly and his hand-picked successor was ousted, by himself, so he could fix his own plans. Unfortunately, he‚Äôs been one of the people chiefly responsible for the WGA and SAG-AFTRA issues this year. A lot of the assumptions based on the finances of streaming have to do with taking advantage of labor contracts that didn‚Äôt cover streaming well. The AI likeness issue is a huge deal for Disney, not just the money, and they would very much like to treat actors like ageless property that can be applied to their sprawling connected universes.</p>
<h2 id="not-a-boycott"><a href="#not-a-boycott">Not a Boycott</a></h2>
<p>Neither the writers, nor the actors, called for boycotts of the streaming services. They want to work, and they want to be paid, which means people need to pay the studios. That‚Äôs the how the system is <em>supposed to</em> work.</p>
<p>Hell, I have absolutely nothing to gain by people canceling their subscriptions. The only way I get paid is by the studios hiring VFX houses. Actors and writers don‚Äôt pay me.</p>
<p>Having said that, I absolutely do not need to pay studios a yearly subscription for 2024. They haven‚Äôt earned that from me on a personal level. Also none of these streaming price hikes translate into any benefit for me, the pressure is still on cutting costs in producing content.</p>
<p>What services every person choses to pay for are deeply personal, based on all kinds of factors, so there will be people for whom Disney+ is still essential, even without new content. Or they might be willing to step down to an ad-supported plan (I‚Äôm not). Disney+ does have an extensive library.</p>
<p>Same goes for Warner Brothers Discovery‚Äôs Max, which has been rightfully criticized along the way because of David Zaslav‚Äôs bumbling, and attempts to stuff the service with lower-cost unscripted fare from Discovery.</p>
<p>Smaller streamers are faced with these same problems, because they did what the big studios did, but they don‚Äôt have the libraries, IP, cash, or really anything to compete with the big studios. That‚Äôs <em>why</em> they‚Äôre small studios. It‚Äôs not that hard to understand, but it‚Äôs why Paramount+ following along has really hurt Paramount Global. While Comcast is huge, the part that‚Äôs a studio, isn‚Äôt.</p>
<h2 id="outside-money"><a href="#outside-money">Outside Money</a></h2>
<p>However, things get a little more interesting with Netflix and Prime Video. My opinion of these services is <a href="https://joe-steel.com/2023-05-24-Happy-Hour-vs-Wine-Lists.html">not especially high</a>. In the past month, Prime Video announced it was going to include ads in its previously ad-free entertainment, which was already intermingled with FreeVee ad-supported content. An extra recurring subscription can be paid to watch without ads. Amazon keeps tacking on all these fees onto a product that was supposed to be an all-inclusive affair. Like, that‚Äôs supposed to be their whole <em>thing,</em> you know? Their shows are generally expensive, and seemingly don‚Äôt do much to motivate any meaningful internal metrics for Amazon. It still pays to license some high quality TV shows and movies from others. That‚Äôs really its core value, that I‚Äôm not sure Amazon entirely understands.</p>
<p>Netflix‚Äôs mediocre filler piles up more and more every day. Like a machine that only knows how to spit out half-packaged products. It‚Äôs biggest asset is its size. I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs too big to fail, but it‚Äôs too ubiquitous to ever fail quickly. Which is why they can continue to generally fuck up a lot, and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-12/netflix-to-open-stores-where-fans-can-play-shop-and-eat-in-2025">do stupid shit</a>. Shareholders have calmed down since The Netflix Correction, and they‚Äôre generally content. There are no concerns about Netflix ever ratcheting up it‚Äôs fees too high, the concerns are about the slow growth of their ad-supported tier to bring in more price-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>The most recent stumble for Netflix has been in kid-focused animated entertainment. Their history was mostly with buying up stuff from outside companies (Mitchells vs the Machines is frequently cited as a Netflix film, but it‚Äôs a Sony Pictures Animation film that Sony sold off in the pandemic), until they started their own internal division. Then last week they <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/netflix-animation-shakeup-moives-shutdown-output-deals-1235752497/">announced they were killing projects and cutting staff</a>. Then this week they announced they were going to be <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/skydance-animation-leaves-apple-for-netflix-pact-1235621915/">taking over Apple‚Äôs end of their deal with Skydance Animation</a>. The animation company owned by nepo baby David Ellison, and headed up by the disgraced John Lasseter. David proved to the world that it was worth it to hire John by releasing <em>Luck,</em> a film that at best, was <em>fine</em> but not a critical or financial success for Apple.</p>
<p>Netflix‚Äôs flailing with making their own films and TV shows kind of doesn‚Äôt matter because they‚Äôre so big that they can turn licensed library material into a phenomenon. The most recent example being the craze over <em>Suits</em> which originally aired on USA Network, owned by Comcast Universal. Comcast Universal can‚Äôt turn <em>anything</em> into a success because it entered the market late with Peacock, and no one could think of a reason to subscribe to it if they weren‚Äôt already a Comcast customer.</p>
<p>This ability to turn something that could be a small success, and large financial loss, into a big hit by virtue of its ubiquity is what Netflix does best. To circle back to animation, this is also why the plug was pulled on the Paramount+ and Nickelodeon show <em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em> and it found a home on Netflix. Paramount Global will get money for something that wasn‚Äôt working for them, because Paramount+ isn‚Äôt ubiquitous.</p>
<p>Netlfix has also licensed a bunch of HBO shows, which is hugely damaging to Max, because it trains customers to expect HBO shows eventually coming to Netflix, but does help Netflix with their quality problem.</p>
<p>So Netflix increasing their prices to nearly cable-package prices? It‚Äôs not something I like at all, but it‚Äôs working for them because they‚Äôre basically a cable package of licensed stuff again, like they were before the studios panicked and tried to start their own streamers.</p>
<p>They can weather anything 2024 throws at them because there will always be studios desperate enough to sell shows to them, even if that excludes Disney. The SAG-AFTRA dispute could go on for another year and they‚Äôd buy their way through it. As repulsive as that thought is, it‚Äôs true.</p>
<h2 id="the-lost-year"><a href="#the-lost-year">The Lost Year</a></h2>
<p>There is, unfortunately, the very real possibility that nothing gets resolved before the winter holidays ‚Äî or even if it does, productions won‚Äôt start ramping up until next January or February. When it resumes, it‚Äôs not like turning on a light switch. The entertainment industry works with overlapping schedules. This production starts while this one wraps, this is shooting while this is in post. You just can‚Äôt do everything in parallel all at the same time. That means we‚Äôre also going to get a trickle of finished TV shows and films. Even lowering the standards, and ‚Äúputting a rush‚Äù on it doesn‚Äôt bypass everyone else doing exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>That means that even if people aren‚Äôt anticipating the drop in stuff to watch, they will eventually realize that there‚Äôs not much new. It‚Äôs going to be much harder to get those people to resubscribe, at high prices, than it was to get them to subscribe the first time.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going to get me to reactivate Disney+, maybe it‚Äôll be whenever the second season of <em>Andor</em> comes out towards the end of 2024 or early 2025, but it‚Äôll just be the two months the show runs, and then I‚Äôm out again like the Falcon leaving the Death Star. Disney has lost yearly subscription rights in this household. A brand is a promise and the only promise I‚Äôm interested in from Disney is a single TV show, on calendar far, far away.</p></span></p><p><date datetime="2023-10-19 14:25:00">2023-10-19 14:25:00</date></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The funding will allow the growing repository with more than 2 million articles to migrate to the cloud and modernize its code to ensure reliability, fault tolerance and accessibility for researchers.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>‚ÄúI am deeply grateful for this tremendous support from both the Simons Foundation and the NSF,‚Äù said </span><a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/greg-morrisett/"><span>Greg Morrisett</span></a><span>, the Jack and Rilla Neafsey Dean and Vice Provost of Cornell Tech. ‚ÄúThis investment ensures that the arXiv service will continue to scale, to serve an even broader constituency, and better serve the arXiv scientific community.‚Äù</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>‚ÄúThis generous funding from the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation will allow arXiv to expand its critical growth in the scientific community, where it allows thousands of researchers to freely disseminate, exchange and explore their findings,‚Äù said </span><a href="https://tech.cornell.edu/people/ramin-zabih/"><span>Ramin Zabih</span></a><span>, arXiv faculty director and professor of computer science at Cornell Tech.</span><span> ‚ÄúBy modernizing the code base and transitioning to the cloud, we are strengthening arXiv‚Äôs infrastructure and ensuring that it will continue to be a source of innovation in the sharing of scholarly publications.

<div id="" data-fullscreen-modal="false">
                    <p>Ketamine is hard to study because of its psychoactive effects. Researchers at Stanford Medicine got around that by administering it to patients as they were under anesthesia.&nbsp;<br>
<a href="https://stock.adobe.com/contributor/210740972/masum?load_type=author&amp;prev_url=detail"><i>Masum</i></a></p>
                </div></div>
<div id="main_content">
    <p>In study after study, the psychoactive drug ketamine has given profound and fast relief to many people suffering from severe depression. But these studies have a critical shortcoming: Participants usually can tell whether they have been given ketamine or a placebo. Even in blinded trials in which participants are not told which they received, ketamine‚Äôs oftentimes trippy effects are a dead giveaway.</p>
<p>In a new study, Stanford Medicine researchers devised a clever workaround to hide the psychedelic ‚Äî or dissociative ‚Äî properties of the anesthetic first developed in 1962. They recruited 40 participants with moderate to severe depression who were also scheduled for routine surgery, then administered a dose of ketamine or placebo when the participants were in surgery and under general anesthesia.</p>
<p>All researchers and clinicians involved in the trial also were blinded to which treatment patients received. The treatments were revealed two weeks later.</p>
<p>The researchers were amazed to find that both groups experienced the large improvement in depression symptoms usually seen with ketamine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was very surprised to see this result, especially having talked to some of those patients who said ‚ÄòMy life is changed, I‚Äôve never felt this way before,‚Äô but they were in the placebo group,‚Äù said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/boris-heifets">Boris Heifets</a>, MD, PhD, assistant professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine, and senior author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-023-00140-x">study</a> published Oct. 19 in <i>Nature Mental Health</i>.</p>
<p>Just one day after treatment, both the ketamine and placebo groups‚Äô scores on the Montgomery-AÃäsberg depression rating scale ‚Äî a standard measure of depression severity often referred to as the MADRS ‚Äî dropped, on average, by half. Their scores stayed roughly the same throughout the two-week follow-up.</p>

</div>

<div id="main_text">
    <p>‚ÄúTo put that into perspective, that brings them down to a category of mild depression from what had been debilitating levels of depression,‚Äù said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/theresa-lii">Theresa Lii</a>, MD, a postdoctoral scholar in the Heifets lab and lead author of the study.<br>
</p>
<h3>What does it all mean?</h3>
<p>The researchers concede that their study, having taken an unexpected turn, raises more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow all the interpretations happen,‚Äù said <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/alan-schatzberg">Alan Schatzberg</a>, MD, the Kenneth T. Norris, Jr. Professor in Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and a co-author of the study. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like looking at a Picasso painting.‚Äù</p>
<p>The researchers determined that it was unlikely the surgeries and general anesthesia account for the improvements because studies have found that depression generally does not change after surgery; sometimes, it worsens.</p>
<p>A more likely interpretation, the researchers said, is that participants‚Äô positive expectations may play a key role in ketamine‚Äôs effectiveness.</p>
<p>At their last follow-up visit, participants were asked to guess which intervention they had received. About a quarter said they didn‚Äôt know. Of those who ventured a guess, more than 60% guessed ketamine.</p>
<p>Their guesses did not correlate with their treatment ‚Äî confirmation of effective blinding ‚Äî but rather with how much better they felt.</p>

</div>

<div id="main_text_copy">
    <p>Those who had improved more in their depression scores were more likely to think they received ketamine, even when they didn‚Äôt, implying some preexisting positive expectations for ketamine.<br>
</p>
<h3>Positive expectations</h3>
<p>Call it expectancy bias, call it placebo effect or call it hope. Whatever the label, the psychological factors involved in treatment can be powerful.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn some ways none of this is new,‚Äù Heifets said. ‚ÄúPlacebo is probably the single most effective, consistent intervention in medicine, full stop. It‚Äôs seen in every trial, and we should probably be paying more attention to the factors that give rise to it.‚Äù</p>
<p>These factors might include how a study is described; interactions with health care professionals; and, in this case, the unavoidable media hype around ketamine.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need to devise more clever experiments to tease apart the direct pharmacological effects from the psychological effects of taking ketamine and other psychedelics,‚Äù Schatzberg said.</p>
<h3>Not just a placebo</h3>
<p>The take-away should not be that ketamine ‚Äúis just a placebo,‚Äù Heifets emphasized.</p>

</div>

<div id="main_text_0">
    <p>‚ÄúSaying ‚Äòit‚Äôs just a placebo‚Äô is really a disservice to what placebo is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt ‚ÄòI‚Äôll feel better if I say it enough times,‚Äô and it does not imply that there was nothing wrong with the patient.‚Äù</p>
<p>In fact, there may be physiological resonance between the placebo effect ‚Äî in other words, hope ‚Äî and how ketamine works. Studies suggest that both may be mediated in part by the brain‚Äôs Œº-opioid receptors, which process pain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is most definitely a physiological mechanism, something that happens between your ears, when you instill hope,‚Äù Heifets said.</p>
<p>The results also suggest that the psychedelic experience may not be crucial to ketamine‚Äôs benefits, though it likely encourages more positive expectations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaybe with a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analog you can get the same benefits without having to, you know, go to outer space,‚Äù Heifets said.</p>
<p>The study was supported by funding from the Society for Neuroscience in Anesthesiology and Critical Care, the National Institutes of Health (grants 3T32DA035165-02S1, UL1TR003142 and UL1TR001085), and the Stanford School of Medicine Research Office.</p>

    <p>Now that iOS 17 is available, let‚Äôs analyze its built-in apps to answer a few questions: How many binaries are in iOS 17? Which programming languages are used to develop these apps? How many apps are written with Swift? What is the percentage of apps using SwiftUI versus UIKit?</p>
<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The methodology and tools to create this article have been detailed in my previous posts. If you are interested, please refer to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.timac.org/2022/0818-state-of-appkit-catalyst-swiftui-mac/">Apple‚Äôs use of AppKit, Mac Catalyst and SwiftUI in macOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">Evolution of the programming languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 14</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">Apple‚Äôs use of Swift in iOS 10.1 and macOS 10.12</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before jumping into the details, let‚Äôs clarify a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I only analyzed what is commonly called ‚ÄòiOS‚Äô, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares are not included. Note that this year, I analyzed the Secure Enclave.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep in mind that a developer can mix different programming languages to create one binary. One example is a Mac app I developed, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/dependencies/id1538972026">Dependencies</a>, where I use Swift, Objective-C, C++, and C, the most appropriate programming language used to solve each specific problem. In this article, an app containing a single line of Swift code will be counted as using Swift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will see mentions of Objective-C and C++ but you might notice the absence of Objective-C++. The approach used here can‚Äôt really detect binaries built with Objective-C++. Such binaries are counted as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations because I don‚Äôt have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="number-of-binaries">Number of binaries</h2>
<p>Let‚Äôs first answer a simple question: How many binaries are in iOS 17? The number of binaries composing iOS continues to increase: iOS 17 contains 6030 binaries, up from 5403 in iOS 16. That‚Äôs 627 new binaries.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, there has been a significant increase in the number of apps adopting SwiftUI this year. Notable mentions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Preferences app with several of its bundles (StorageSettingsUI, WallpaperSettings, MultitaskingAndGesturesSettings, ThirdPartyApplicationSettings, ActionButtonSettings, ‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>Several binaries related to Health (Health.app, HealthUI, MentalHealthUI, WorkoutUI, ‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>The Home app, which appears to have undergone some major changes (Home.app, HomeEnergyUI, HomeUICommon, HomeDataModel, HomeAccessoryControlUI, ‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>The support for the new Action button (ActionButtonSettings, ActionButtonConfigurationUI, ‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>Additionally, several other important apps, such as Calendar and Reminders, are now using SwiftUI</li>
</ul>
<p>In iOS 16, only 4 apps used the SwiftUI-based app lifecycle. In iOS 17, this figure has grown to 14 apps:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/Batteries.app/Batteries
/Applications/ClarityCamera.app/ClarityCamera
/Applications/ClarityPhotos.app/ClarityPhotos
/Applications/FinanceUIService.app/FinanceUIService
/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/FTMInternal-4
/Applications/MusicRecognition.app/MusicRecognition
/Applications/PASViewService.app/PASViewService
/Applications/Preferences.app/Preferences
/Applications/SafetyMonitorApp.app/SafetyMonitorApp
/Applications/ShazamEventsApp.app/ShazamEventsApp
/Applications/WorkoutRemoteViewService.app/WorkoutRemoteViewService
/private/var/staged_system_apps/Weather.app/Weather
/System/Library/CoreServices/AegirProxyApp.app/AegirProxyApp
/System/Library/CoreServices/ShortcutsActions.app/ShortcutsActions
</code></pre>
<p>The Swift and SwiftUI adoption continues its climb: iOS 17 now contains 385 binaries using SwiftUI. Likewise the number of binaries containing at least one line of Swift code increased by 50% between iOS 16 and iOS 17:</p>


<h2 id="evolution-of-the-programming-languages">Evolution of the programming languages</h2>
<p>By analyzing all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS 17, we can see the evolution of the programming languages used by iOS. Again please note that a single binary can be counted multiple times, so the sum of the binaries in this graph is greater than the total number of binaries:</p>


<p>Some trends can be better visualized by displaying percentages:</p>


<p>What can we learn from these graphs?</p>
<ul>
<li>Objective-C is still at the core of iOS and is used directly or indirectly by most apps</li>
<li>The adoption of Swift and SwiftUI continues to grow rapidly</li>
<li>The share of Objective-C, C and C++ continues to decrease</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="uikit-versus-swiftui">UIKit versus SwiftUI</h2>
<p>Up until now, we compared SwiftUI to all binaries. SwiftUI being a UI framework, it would be fairer to compare it to other binaries displaying some UI. Native iOS apps can be built with 2 different UI frameworks: UIKit and SwiftUI (note that it is possible to mix both). My approach to count the number of binaries containing UI is not perfect but should give an approximate trend: I simply check if the binaries link against the UIKit or SwiftUI frameworks.</p>
<p>For the first time, the number of binaries exclusively using UIKit has decreased in comparison to the previous year:</p>


<p>By displaying percentages, we can confirm that SwiftUI is clearly increasing in Apple‚Äôs own apps:</p>


<h2 id="secure-enclave">Secure Enclave</h2>
<p>The Secure Enclave is a hardware-based security component, isolated from the main processor to provide an extra layer of security. It was initially introduced with the iPhone 5S to ensure the security of sensitive user data, playing a critical role for Touch ID, Face ID, and Apple Pay.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110354/"><code>What's new in Swift</code> session (5:35)</a> of the WWDC22, Apple stated that Swift is now suitable for restricted environments like the Secure Enclave Processor:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2023/1019-state-of-swift-and-swiftui-ios17/WWDC2022.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In iOS 17, the Secure Enclave contains 19 binaries, and to my surprise, none of them are using Swift:</p>


<p>So is Swift used in the Secure Enclave? Yes! It turns out that the <code>hibernation</code> binary in macOS Ventura is using Swift:</p>

<p>You can download below the raw data I generated for all major releases of iOS from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17.0.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though we don‚Äôt have access to the iOS source code, we can determine the programming languages used to create the built-in apps in iOS and we can measure the evolution of these languages from iPhone OS 1.0 to iOS 17.</p>
<p>Swift and SwiftUI adoptions continue their growth: the number of binaries using these frameworks increased by 50% between iOS 16 and iOS 17. Another good sign of dogfooding is the more widespread use of the SwiftUI-based app lifecycle. Also for the first time, the number of binaries exclusively using UIKit has decreased in comparison to the previous year.</p>
<p>In the upcoming years, it will be interesting to observe whether Swift begins to spread into low-level firmware, such as the Secure Enclave. Currently, Swift is absent from the Secure Enclave in iOS, although macOS does incorporate it.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, this approach has obviously some limits and while I believe the overall picture to be accurate, I can‚Äôt guarantee that the results are perfectly exact.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>One of the many problems with programming in go is there‚Äôs functions, and the functions are written by people, and the people make mistakes, and the functions return errors, and now you have to check for the errors. This is all very tedious and tiresome. We can‚Äôt fix the people who cherish their imperfections as a sign of humanity, but we can change go to pretend the errors aren‚Äôt there.</p><p>A short experiment to write a tool to bang away the errors. Mostly to poke around and manipulate the AST some more.<br></p><h3>error time</h3><p>We‚Äôve got a simple function, but it‚Äôs more than half errors. Why would anyone write such problematic code?</p><pre><code><span>func</span> decomp<span>(</span>filename <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>[]<span>byte</span><span>,</span> error<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        fd<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> os<span>.</span>Open<span>(</span>filename<span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> err
        <span>}</span>
        <span>defer</span> fd<span>.</span>Close<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        zd<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> gzip<span>.</span>NewReader<span>(</span>fd<span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> err
        <span>}</span>
        data<span>,</span> err <span>:=</span> io<span>.</span>ReadAll<span>(</span>zd<span>)</span>
        <span>if</span> err <span>!=</span> <span>nil</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>return</span> <span>nil</span><span>,</span> err
        <span>}</span>
        <span>return</span> data<span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>What does this function even do if there‚Äôs an error? I have to read so much code to find out. Wouldn‚Äôt it be cleaner if we could write lines like this?</p><pre><code>        data <span>:=</span> io<span>.</span>ReadAll<span>(</span>zd<span>)</span><span>!</span></code></pre><p>Now it‚Äôs obvious to everyone exactly what happens. All we need is a little tool to parse this code, rewrite it to add the err checks, and then send it to the real go compiler.<br></p><h3>banging</h3><p>Except that‚Äôs not valid go syntax and won‚Äôt parse, and we‚Äôre not changing the parser for a fun toy. But this will.</p><pre><code>        data <span>:=</span> <span>!</span>io<span>.</span>ReadAll<span>(</span>zd<span>)</span></code></pre><p>I actually prefer this. When reading code, I tend to focus on the left side, around the assignment. That feels like the important part, and then I stop scanning before I get all the way to the end.</p><p>The catch is that if we use this particular operator, we won‚Äôt be able to call a boolean function and reverse it and assign it. I never seem to do this? I call !fn() in conditionals, and I assign boolean functions to variables, but not both at the same time. Nevertheless, we can avoid the conflict by selecting another operator.</p><pre><code>        data := ^io.ReadAll(zd)</code></pre><p>I quite like this. I know that I‚Äôve <i>never</i> xored a function return in an assignment, although maybe there‚Äôs some field where that‚Äôs really common.</p><p>The caret also reminds me of a footnote, which seems appropriate. There‚Äôs a little extra happening here, but it‚Äôs not really important, no need to bore you with the details.</p><p>The final function looks like this.</p><pre><code><span>func</span> decomp<span>(</span>filename <span>string</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span>[]<span>byte</span><span>,</span> error<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        fd <span>:=</span> ^os<span>.</span>Open<span>(</span>filename<span>)</span>
        <span>defer</span> fd<span>.</span>Close<span>(</span><span>)</span>
        zd <span>:=</span> ^gzip<span>.</span>NewReader<span>(</span>fd<span>)</span>
        data <span>:=</span> ^io<span>.</span>ReadAll<span>(</span>zd<span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> data<span>,</span> <span>nil</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>All neat and tidy. Out of sight and out of mind.<br></p><h3>bango</h3><p>The internal operation of bango is straightforward. Scan through the AST looking for statements, then check that left and right sides have one expression, then check that right side is a unary xor operator applied to a call expression. Then we conjure up an if statement with an error check and return statement, and insert that into the block after the assignment.</p><p>The reverse operation is similar. Look for error checking statements after function calls, then remove them and add an xor to the function. Everything is so easy now that there‚Äôs functions to insert and remove from a slice.</p><p>Now that I have a little better understanding of the go AST structures, it was mostly just a matter of typing out what I wanted, then iterating until I was happy with the results.<br></p><h3>matching</h3><p>Straightforward, but still tedious. The <a href="https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/fungo/v/2/f/bango/main.go">old code</a> was not pretty.</p><details><summary>you may not like it, but this is ideal error checking</summary><pre><code>next <span>:=</span> block<span>.</span>List<span>[</span>i<span>+</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>

  <p>My family wasn't poor by any stretch of the imagination, but I was raised to
avoid spending money whenever possible.</p>
<p>I was also taught "it's a poor craftsman that blames their tools", which
apparently means "take responsibility for your fuckups", but, to young-me,
definitely sounded more like "you don't deserve nice things".</p>
<p>I was also taught from an early age that I was born a sinner, incapable of doing
good by myself, and that all the earthly things were temptations, sent by the
devil to corrupt me (further I guess?) but also temporary, and that I shouldn't
attach myself.</p>
<p>I'm better now ‚Äî thanks for asking.</p>
<p>But I'm sure you can see why "protestant ethics" primed me for head-first into
the pit of unpaid labor and burnout that is "F/OSS at large" (free and open
source software, for the kids in the back).</p>
<p>It's perfect: much like in the religious environment I grew up in, everyone is
<em>this close</em> to permanently losing it, and there's an infinite supply of
thankless work to be done, which means, and this is crucial: nothing you do
will ever be good enough.</p>
<p>In either place, there is no redeeming yourself.</p>
<p>And sure, okay, the <em>other</em> thing that attracted me to F/OSS was, of course, the
good parts: that you can look at how it's made, fix it up for yourself
and others, etc.</p>
<p>As someone most definitely somewhere on the spectrum, being able to stare at the
inner workings of complex systems unperturbed, was just... I liked it, You
know?</p>
<p>Things have changed since, to some extent.</p>
<p>The Early Unix Crowd lament having to think about languages other than C. We in
the DevOps mines would pay good money never to have to speak YAML again.</p>
<p>I get it: GCC 2.95 was an easier time.</p>
<p>But, like Andrew Morton famously said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's time to give up on it and just drink more coffee or play more tetris or
something, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>Source: LWN, <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/163881/">The end of gcc 2.95 support</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today still, if you try, if you <em>really</em> try, you <em>can</em> go in and try and
modify your favorite software.</p>
<p>But, and I wish 19-year-old me would've heeded that piece of advice, you always
need to keep in mind that you're either spending time or spending money.</p>
<p>Let me IMMEDIATELY add caveats there, because your gut reaction may be what mine
was back then: "Oh! you're one of <em>those</em>. The ones who put a number on everything,
and make decisions based on those numbers".</p>
<p>Of course not! There's no poetry in accounting. And little point in counting if
you're having a good time.</p>
<p>Besides, when you <em>are</em> 19 / still a student / unemployed, time is all you have
to spend, so the choice is made for you.</p>
<p>And of course, it's really hard to qualify all the second-order effects "spending
time performing unpaid labor for various F/OSS projects" has had on my career
(for the best), my health (for the worst), etc.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that to cause more anxiety over picking <em>which</em> thing to spend
your time on: I think of it more like a good reason to spend your time on a lot
of different things, and people, and ideas, because whether they go terribly
right or terribly wrong, there's a lesson to be learned.</p>
<p>And friend, do I have a lesson to share with you today.</p>

<p>I started writing sometime around 2019.</p>
<p>Well. I've been blogging for a decade, which makes me part of The Old People In
The Room at conferences now. The 60-year-olds and me, we have a good time.</p>
<p>But I started doing serious, <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/donate">please-give-me-money</a> technical writing
around 2019. On a Lenovo X200, for street creds (and affordability) reasons.</p>
<p>I needed to make diagrams, so I compared a few options and quickly settled on
"draw.io", which has been semi-rebranded to "diagrams.net" the way Twitter has
been semi-rebranded to X?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop">desktop app</a> still calls itself
draw.io, the file format is still <code>.drawio</code>, etc.</p>

            </picture>
            
<p>It's an Electron app, unmistakably:</p>

            <picture>
                <source type="image/avif" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/electron-app.d13f8f5961098403.avif">

            </picture>
            
<p>...but it's not in-your-face about it. It's rather consistent across Linux (GNU
or not), macOS, Windows, and, now the most important shell of all: "the
browser".</p>
<p>And it's really good at diagrams. Nowadays you'd probably use something
source-defined like <a href="https://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> or one of the cool kids
like <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a>, but draw.io is burnt into the memory
of The Old Ones.</p>
<p>Why? Because, like all good products, it started out with "solving a hard
problem" better than anyone else. The hard bit was "making a graph editor that
could render to SVG and display in non-SVG browsers", and if that sounds weird,
that's because this happened forever ago:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We created mxGraph in 2005 as a commercial project and it ran through to 2016
that way. Our USP was the support for non-SVG browsers, when that advantage
expired we moved onto commercial activity around draw.io.</p>
<p>Source: mxgraph README, <a href="https://github.com/jgraph/mxgraph#history">History</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I think this spirit, of "taking the problem seriously", permeated throughout
almost the entire product and is one of the reasons draw.io felt so nice to use
compared to, well, anything else at the time.</p>
<p>What else was I supposed to use? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dia_%28software%29">Dia</a>?</p>

<p>Heck, while we're hurting ourselves with nostalgia, here's the last release on
SourceForge:</p>

<p>That's not what SourceForge looked like when I got my start, but the smell is
the same.</p>
<p>Just look at those two lovingly hand-crafted .dmg files. No
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">CI/CD</a> there, just vibes.</p>
<p>Remember Pidgin? Adium? I can do this all day.</p>
<p>GitHub didn't just usher in a new era of collaboration, of new heroes and new
villains, it also sent to the grave SourceForge, and an entire aesthetic with
it.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't miss it.</p>

                        <h2>
                            <a id="draw-io-the-bad" href="#draw-io-the-bad">
                                draw.io - the bad
                            </a>
                        </h2>
                        
<p>But all good things must come to an end at some point, and for draw.io (and the
rest of the world, for slightly different reasons), that was 2016.</p>
<p>As the history section I quoted earlier covers: "when that advantage expired (in
2016), we (jgraph) moved onto commercial activity around draw.io".</p>
<p>Now, it's more subtle than that. draw.io is <em>still good</em>, and the dealbreaker
I'm about to cover pre-existed jgraph's shift to "commercial activity around
draw.io".</p>
<p>In fact, it's really important that there be a revenue source to fund continued
maintenance of draw.io, so, as long as it doesn't mess with the main product too
much, I'm happy!</p>
<p>But that's when, for me at least, draw.io stopped investing in "their own
engine" and fully committed to doing "whatever the browser does". The browser
being, need I say it,
<a href="https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio/blob/2d6f60db48561758d7749aa79357ccbbde789abd/image-export/Dockerfile#L9">Chrome</a>.</p>
<div>

<p>Of course, you could probably get Gecko to do it instead, but why go all the
trouble to end up with a result that looks different from what you get in the
Electron-based desktop app?</p>
</div>
<p>At least the docs, and I would expect no less from jgraph, whom I respect,
correctly describe draw.io's ability to do "rich text formatting" as simply
"being able to use HTML to style nodes":</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Style part of a text label</h3>
<p>Text labels in shapes and on connectors can be formatted with HTML, so you can
apply a style to part of a text label. For example, you can apply bold,
italicise, colour, or a link to just one word.</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.drawio.com/doc/faq/text-styles#style-part-of-a-text-label">draw.io FAQ</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why does this matter? Because once you let HTML into your product, a product
that, by nature, cares about the precise layout of things, you're fucked.</p>
<p>You're fucked because, although I don't believe it's <em>literally impossible</em> to
make your own browser (<a href="https://drewdevault.com/2020/03/18/Reckless-limitless-scope">CW: Drew
DeVault</a>), it is
several orders of magnitude harder than the hard problem mxGraph solves in the
first place.</p>
<p>Which is why I keep defending Electron as "not that bad, actually, when you
really think about it" in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnaGZHe8wws">very old video I'm quite embarrassed
about</a>, and which thesis is
essentially: there's more to it than you probably think (but you're very welcome
to try).</p>
<p>Of course, in another universe, draw.io didn't take the shortcut and didn't just
say "you can just put HTML int here". In another universe, they only allowed
bold, italic, underline, font-size and font-family... and line spacing, and
letter spacing, and text alignment, and superscript and subscript and...</p>
<p>...okay you see my point about there being more to it than it seems now, but
point is: they could've picked a limited feature set and just written their own
text rendering engine.</p>
<p>And then you wouldn't need Chrome's DOM, its layout engine and the <a href="https://skia.org/docs/user/sample/pdf/">PDF backend
of its renderer</a> to do a "proper export"
from draw.io.</p>
<p>But they didn't! And you do.</p>
<p>Worse: <em>I</em> do, and the thing I <em>actually</em> do for this blog, because I've stopped
"just grabbing rectangular screenshots and pasting them onto my blog" a long
time ago (I blame HiDPI displays), is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a handwritten Rust app that..</li>
<li>..launches headless chrome</li>
<li>..loads draw.io in it (from a <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/hyper">hyper HTTP server</a>)</li>
<li>..asks draw.io to load the .drawio file (also over HTTP)</li>
<li>..asks chrome to print to PDF (this uses Skia's PDF backend)</li>
<li>..opens that PDF using <a href="https://poppler.freedesktop.org/">poppler</a></li>
<li>..exports it using <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">cairo</a>'s SVG backend</li>
<li>..optimizes it using <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/svgcleaner">svgcleaner</a> (which is unmaintained and will soon stop compiling)</li>
</ul>
<p>And then you get one of these, which looks crisp at any resolution and can be
printed even if you don't have Iosevka installed on your computer:</p>

"slippery") to link statically on Windows, but I have since resigned myself to
only run it on macOS or Linux, where nix is available and solves just about as
many problems as it causes.</p>

<p>This works today, but I would sleep better if Chromium was no longer part of my
asset pipeline, because at some point I want to deploy this to servers instead
of running it locally (thus lowering the barrier to entry for other people to
collaborate with me).</p>
<p>The <em>other</em> reason I started looking into alternatives is because alternatives
started looking at me.</p>
<p>In 2023, I was contracted to do some very interested work related to Figma, none
of which I can talk about because I stupidly signed a very paranoidly-worded
contract, which I will never do again unless I am literally on the verge of
losing my home.</p>
<p>But! It forced me to, you know, actually learn Figma. And, it's a weird and
unfair comparison, of course, because draw.io is a diagramming tool and Figma is
an interface design tool, but this thing is just built different.</p>
<p>The first time I actually heard of Figma (this is how sheltered us software
engineers are) was when someone asked me how I felt about them compiling Rust
and C++ code to WebAssembly for a product that, fundamentally, feels like it
shouldn't really require more than a buttload of JavaScript (maybe even
TypeScript at that scale) and DOM crimes. Or perhaps canvas, if you <em>really</em>
do care about pixel perfection and you're hell-bent on re-inventing the wheel.</p>
<p>But care they did, and they didn't just reinvent the wheel: they changed the
game.</p>
<p><a href="https://madebyevan.com/">Evan Wallace</a> has fantastic write-ups about some of
the "casual genius" ideas he simply willed into existence during <a href="https://madebyevan.com/figma/">his tenure as
Figma co-founder</a>.</p>
<p>Things like <a href="https://madebyevan.com/figma/introducing-vector-networks/">vector
networks</a>, which
immediately impose themselves as clearly superior to the classical "vector path"
model <em>literally everyone else is using</em>.</p>
<p>Or like successfully <a href="https://madebyevan.com/figma/rust-in-production-at-figma/">migrating the server-side portion of their product from
TypeScript to Rust</a>,
resulting in 3.8x smaller memory usage, 6x smaller CPU usage, 10x faster file
serve time and 16.4x faster worst-case save time.</p>
<p>The Figma team didn't solve one hard problem, they solved dozens. All while
maintaining best-of-class UX and gaining the favor of designers everywhere.</p>
<p>It's <em>really</em> hard not to like them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figma_(software)#Proposed_acquisition_by_Adobe">Even Adobe agrees</a>.</p>

                        <h2>
                            <a id="the-worst-possible-business-strategy-protestant-ethics" href="#the-worst-possible-business-strategy-protestant-ethics">
                                The worst possible business strategy: protestant ethics
                            </a>
                        </h2>
                        
<p>But! It costs money. You get 3 files for free to fully explore the product: 
beyond that, you need to shell out for Figma Professional, which will cost you
$15/seat/month, unless you're comfortable with year-long commitments (I'm not),
at which point it falls to $12/seat/month.</p>
<p>And, I don't know if you remember from the intro but: I was raised on frugality.</p>
<p>You don't understand. I'm talking about an entire community for which couponing
qualifies as foreplay. I'm <em>barely</em> exaggerating.</p>
<p>And I had big plans!</p>
<p>In 2023 I announced I was building a team, so that I could "produce more
content": everyone hates this way of putting it, and the "content creator"
moniker, but "teacher" is a protected class and I haven't fully internalized the
"clown" label yet, so it's a happy middle ground.</p>
<p>And I did, for a bit! I paid two people for a few months, to help both with the
"content" part itself (helping with research, triage ideas, follow up on drafts
etc.) and on the "platform" part, because, part of the fun of "working here" is
that everything is custom-made and wonky (as evidenced by the draw.io asset
pipeline described above).</p>
<p>At any other company, this would be a nightmare (and whew, have I been there),
but here it's endearing and a feature: doing "as much as possible" yourself
means having a lot to write about: the machine feeds itself.</p>
<p>And I hate, <em>hate</em> per-seat per-month pricing, because everyone is trying to get
in on it, and for small business, it adds up. To a point where one might be
forgiven for asking themselves: "if I just bite the bullet and learn Kubernetes,
could I self-host all that and eventually save up money?".</p>
<p>This seems like hard work to get worse things. In other words: this is <em>exactly</em>
how I was raised.</p>
<p>Being a sinner from birth, I of course do not deserve nice things. Nor should I
desire them. I will use whatever's in front of me, and I will be glad about it.</p>
<p>If it's not suffering, it's not work.</p>
<p>And if it's not work, it's probably "of the devil".</p>
<p>Which brings us to Penpot.</p>

                        <h2>
                            <a id="penpot" href="#penpot">
                                Penpot
                            </a>
                        </h2>
                        
<p>Penpot is not just a product, it's an idea.</p>
<p>The headline, which takes up 10% of the viewport height on my browser, is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bring Design Freedom to your Product Team</p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://penpot.app/">https://penpot.app/</a> at the time of this writing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by "Sign up, it's free!" and "Self-host install" calls to action.</p>
<p>The next line is "Penpot is the Open-Source Design &amp; Prototyping Tool for
Product Teams".</p>
<p>And at this point, you've used the labels "free" twice, and "open-source" once,
to market your thing, and, uh, let's say charitably: "I've been warned".</p>
<p>This is not <em>just</em> me being an asshole, by the way. There's a rich history of a
vocal minority going "you can't excuse everything by saying it's free software"
and being met with "PRs welcome kthxbye".</p>
<p>This is <em>tradition</em> at this point. Perhaps even sport.</p>
<p>Anyway: I was told a lot of good about Penpot. "Of the free alternatives to
Figma", I was told (and this is key), "it is by far the best".</p>
<p>But after spending a few hours trying to get anything done with it, my
assessment is that, if this is true, then it's really not worth checking out any
of the other alternatives.</p>
<p>And I will describe my user story, but only after you and I agree that you could
fix each individual issue I'll talk about, one by one, and it still wouldn't
detract from my core argument.</p>
<p>Deal? Deal.</p>
<p>So! The Penpot homepage talks about its desktop app: makes sense, draw.io
(although in a slightly different category, as I've already said) has one, Figma
has one, the Penpot userbase certainly would like one, and so <a href="https://sudovanilla.com/code/Korbs/Penpot-Desktop">somebody made
one</a>.</p>
<p>I hope this link still loads by the time you read this, because it is a
<a href="https://forgejo.org/">forgejo</a> instance which I can only assume runs on a
Raspberry Pi on someone's desk.</p>
<div>

<p>Just kidding, it's running on a Raspberry Pi <em>behind Cloudflare</em>. I guess
only client-side software is evil or something.</p>
</div>
<p>Anyway, the desktop app isn't official or officially supported (although to
their credit, Penpot, or I guess Kaleidos, sponsors sudovanilla. I have no idea
for how much).</p>
<p>The way you should run Penpot is to... well you should just pay for a seat on
their cloud offering but that's what we're trying <em>not</em> to do, so you're
supposed to self-host it.</p>
<p>The self-host page first suggests <a href="https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started/#install-with-elestio">paying someone else to run it for
you</a>,
a completely valid answer to that question (many people do that with Mastodon),
but since I've never heard of Elestio and I'm already going the road less
traveled... might as well go all the way.</p>
<p>Again the self-host page hammers what is essentially their only selling point:
it no cost money:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For too long, a critical piece of the software development pipeline has been
available solely via pricey proprietary SaaS subscriptions or Mac-only desktop
apps.</p>
<p>Penpot brings <strong>total freedom</strong> for teams by encouraging self-hosted deployments
so you can <strong>take advantage of your security and backup policies</strong>, as well as
<strong>extending and customizing</strong> your Penpot server the way you need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis theirs, annoyingly).</p>
<p>I'm not copywriting professional, but even I can recognize a piece of art when I
see one.</p>
<p>Anyway, option 2 is "install with Docker", which gives you a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/penpot/penpot/main/docker/images/docker-compose.yaml">docker-compose
file</a>,
good enough to run it on your MacBookPro for sure, but, and let me emphasize
this: <strong>absolutely nobody should be running anything in production using a
docker-compose file</strong>.</p>
<p>What you're meant to do is, of course, run it on Kubernetes, which is largely
the same (it's containers all the way down) except it's configured differently,
you can now think about scaling out (on several nodes), you have actual
health/liveness checks and policies for rolling out new versions, restarting,
etc.</p>
<p>It's k8s! We all love to hate it, but at least the industry has sorta
standardized around it, so that makes commiserating easier.</p>
<p>And because penpot is made up of three services (backend, exporter, frontend ‚Äî
not counting postgres and redis), although you <em>could</em> technically deploy all
three of them separately, the idiomatic and era-appropriate thing to do at the
time of this writing is to use a helm chart, which lets you deploy several
resources at once.</p>
<p>Nobody told me, but there is one place generally accepted as "the helm chart
search engine", and it's <a href="https://artifacthub.io/">ArtifactHub</a>.</p>
<p>Searching for "penpot" will turn up two options: one by CodeChem (last updated 9
months ago), and one by TrueCharts (last updated 6 months ago).</p>
<p>I chose the former, not realizing it was pointing at the <code>1.16.0-beta</code> tag for
all three penpot images.</p>
<p>After much trial and error, I came up with the following <a href="">k3s manifest</a>:</p>

<p>So it's got that going for it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why the preview for the "wsl2-kernel" file is missing (the URL just
returns a 404): presumably one of the pieces is misconfigured in the helm chart,
because the cloud offering gets it right:</p>

<p>At first, exporting didn't work <em>at all</em> (it would just time out), but upgrading
to the non-beta 1.19.3 seems to have fixed some of it.</p>
<p>I can, for example, export to SVG now. It takes <em>several seconds</em>, and we end up
with this:</p>

            </picture>
            
<p>Looks fine! What's in there? For example, what SVG node type is it using for
"RAM stick #1"?</p>
<div translate="no"><p>XML</p><pre data-lang="xml"><i>&lt;</i><i>text</i> <i>xmlns</i>="<i>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</i>" <i>x</i>="<i>20.00000000000007</i>" <i>y</i>="<i>29.601562499999858</i>" <i>dominant-baseline</i>="<i>ideographic</i>" <i>textLength</i>="<i>72</i>" <i>lengthAdjust</i>="<i>spacingAndGlyphs</i>" <i>style</i>="<i>text-transform: none; font-family: Iosevka; letter-spacing: normal; font-style: normal; font-weight: 100; white-space: pre; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: none solid rgb(0, 0, 0); direction: ltr; fill: rgb(0, 0, 0); fill-opacity: 1;</i>"<i>&gt;</i>RAM stick #1<i>&lt;/</i><i>text</i><i>&gt;</i>
</pre></div>
<p>Right. Just a text node. This means you need to have the "Iosevka" font
installed, which doesn't work for me: I want my SVG diagrams to be displayed
exactly the same everywhere, so I want them to be paths.</p>
<p>What if we use the same trick as with draw.io, and export to PDF first, then
use cairo to convert that to SVG?</p>

<p>It doesn't fucking work! We get "generic serif font" instead of Iosevka.</p>
<p>You wanna know why?</p>
<p>Well, it takes several seconds because what the penpot exporter is doing is,
that's right, spawning a chromium
instance and <a href="https://github.com/penpot/penpot/blob/a49bc07259aa9def304a44e90b3d34f97508c413/exporter/src/app/browser.cljs#L73-L82">printing to PDF</a>.</p>
<p>(But hey, <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a>!)</p>
<p>And I guess the thing that's supposed to give chromium access to the document's
"custom fonts" is broken in some way. Because they didn't <em>completely</em> fumble
this one: Penpot does have a proper "Custom Fonts" feature:</p>

            <picture>
                <source type="image/avif" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/penpot-custom-fonts.bb0b89adfb09077a.avif">
                <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/penpot-custom-fonts.7d3a13c39a13dfd6.webp">

            </picture>
            
<p>It even detects mismatched vertical metrics and points you at <a href="https://vertical-metrics.netlify.app/">this
service</a> to see for yourself, and
<a href="https://transfonter.org/">Transfonter</a> to fix it.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not Figma's "just <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956894-Access-local-fonts-on-your-computer">install this native
app</a>
and you can use all your fonts, even from a browser", but: someone, somewhere, cared about this!</p>
<p>However, it's also terrible, terrible news.</p>
<p>Even if it <em>did</em> work properly, we're back to just "doing whatever the browser
does" (the browser being, at least for now, universally, chromium) in terms of
text layout and rendering.</p>
<p>Which means export is <em>always</em> going to be slow, and if, like me, you're using
the platform-appropriate browser in your operating system (Firefox everywhere if
your fetish is Google-funded antitrust mitigations, and Edge on Windows + Safari
on macOS otherwise), it's not going to match exactly what you see in the editor.</p>
<p>I've also recreated the diagram in Figma, which was a <em>much</em> nicer experience,
and not just because Figma is the original and Penpot is the copy, but also
because... it works? Snapping works, and when 80% of your interaction with the
software is "moving/resizing things", that matters a lot.</p>
<p>Figma lets you adjust advanced stroke settings, so I can <em>actually</em> match
the draw.io default:</p>

            <picture>
                <source type="image/avif" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/figma-editor.7ba4bc5ba83c9465.avif">
                <source type="image/webp" srcset="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/figma-editor.753657b1c2aa5474.webp">
                <img loading="lazy" src="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/figma-editor.734f23d472cde143.jpg" title="Figma opened in Microsoft Edge, showing the same diagram, again" alt="Figma opened in Microsoft Edge, showing the same diagram, again">
            </picture>
            
<p>Exporting the frame to SVG is instant (it's all happening client-side) and
should look the same for everyone:</p>
<p><img src="https://fasterthanli.me/content/articles/just-paying-figma-15-dollars/assets/adding-memory-figma.d4657ea8902cc3b5.svg" title="" alt="" loading="lazy"></p><p>Because it's not using the SVG text node anywhere: it's using paths.</p>
<p>The "RAM stick #1" string is just this (extremely long, cut for your
convenience) SVG path:</p>
<div translate="no"><p>XML</p><pre data-lang="xml"><i>&lt;</i><i>path</i> <i>d</i>="<i>M20.896 34V23.71H23.584C23.836 23.71 24.0833 (cut) 23.71H101.466V34H100.374Z</i>" <i>fill</i>="<i>black</i>"/&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>And that happens to be exactly what I want, because, much like Figma, I care
about <em>precise</em> design (them, because it pays. me, because I can). Even if my
diagrams and figures are bad, I want them to look the same everywhere.</p>
<p>Penpot didn't solve that hard problem. It's several <em>huge</em> engineering efforts
away from solving that problem. In fact, I know they're <em>never</em> going to solve
that problem, because they turned it into a selling point.</p>
<p>See, Penpot isn't only bashing no "pricey SaaS subscriptions and macOS-only
apps" (which is don't-sue-me speech for Figma and
<a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>), it's saying how it's great that their
flexbox model exactly matches the CSS one, saving valuable time when developers
have to implement the designers'.. designs, as HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>Well, no shit! It <em>is</em> the CSS model, since they don't have a layout engine.</p>
<p>Figma is just from a different time, I guess.</p>
<p>A time when you could afford to have "design" and "implementation" be separate
jobs with separate expertise.</p>
<p>When you could design for things other than the web.</p>
<p>And when you could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Field#Starting_Figma_(2012)">get paid $100K to quit
school</a> and
focus full-time on tools like Figma, instead of whatever AI/ML slop everyone is
being served now.</p>
<p>Now that, I miss.</p>

<p>A start-up has sampled a new device designed to augment servers with additional memory over a CXL 2.0 connection simply by plugging it into a laptop.</p><p>FADU, which is known to manufacture <a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/fastest-ssds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/fastest-ssds">SSDs</a> and other storage units, demonstrated its CXL 2.0 switch concept device at Flash Memory Summit (FMS) 2023, according to <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/fadu-cxl-2-0-switch-and-pcie-gen5-nvme-ssds-at-fms-2023/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.servethehome.com/fadu-cxl-2-0-switch-and-pcie-gen5-nvme-ssds-at-fms-2023/"><u>Serve the Home</u></a>.

It‚Äôs the latest standard in the CXL technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The previous edition, CXL 1.1, focused on augmenting systems with memory rather than relying on RAM to be traditionally fitted into the computer. Instead of fitting RAM units, systems would get a memory boost by directly attaching it to the CPU or GPU, or another component with a PCIe slot.&nbsp;</p><p>This is useful for hyperscalers and big data center operators, in particular, because it means you can account for when there‚Äôll be a surge in memory usage during particularly intensive workloads.&nbsp;</p><p>The CXL 2.0 switch, known as Apollo, supports both CXL 2.0 and PCIe Gen 5 standards in a single chip, and it‚Äôs designed to reduce latency and power consumption when in use. You also don‚Äôt need two separate chips for CXL and PCIe.&nbsp;</p><p>What‚Äôs more, processors and accelerators can pool memory in a single space, which negates the limited capacity in data centers caused by tight coupling between CPUs and RAM units.&nbsp;</p><p>More and more devices are emerging on the market to boost data center performance in the generative AI age, with FADU‚Äôs concept following the Xconn unit also launched at FMS.</p><h3 id="section-more-from-techradar-pro"><span>More from TechRadar Pro</span></h3><ul><li>This is the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-ram" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-ram">best RAM</a> you can get for your PC</li><li>We've rounded up the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/best-ddr5-ram" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/computing/best-ddr5-ram">best DDR5 RAM</a></li><li><a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-worlds-fastest-ssd-has-just-been-tested-and-it-packs-an-unbelievable-smart-cooling-system" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.techradar.com/pro/the-worlds-fastest-ssd-has-just-been-tested-and-it-packs-an-unbelievable-smart-cooling-system">The world‚Äôs fastest SSD has just been tested and it packs an unbelievable smart cooling system</a></li></ul>

<!-- cache hit 939:single/related:2baac0613a1284f273d3f0fa2635848a --><!-- empty -->
<p>The Federal Communications Commission today voted to move ahead with a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/fcc-details-plan-to-restore-the-net-neutrality-rules-repealed-by-ajit-pai/">plan</a> that would restore net neutrality rules and common-carrier regulation of Internet service providers.</p>
<p>In a 3-2 party-line vote, the FCC approved Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel's <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-397309A1.pdf">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> (NPRM), which seeks public comment on the broadband regulation plan. The comment period will officially open after the proposal is published in the Federal Register, but the docket is already active and can be <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/results?q=(proceedings.name:(%2223-320%22))">found here</a>.</p>
<p>The proposal would reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service, a designation that allows the FCC to regulate ISPs under the common-carrier provisions in Title II of the Communications Act. The plan is essentially the same as what the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/fcc-votes-for-net-neutrality-a-ban-on-paid-fast-lanes-and-title-ii/">FCC did in 2015</a> when it used Title II to prohibit fixed and mobile Internet providers from blocking or throttling traffic or giving priority to Web services in exchange for payment.</p>
<p>The Obama-era net neutrality rules were eliminated during Trump's presidency when then-Chairman Ajit Pai <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/goodbye-net-neutrality-ajit-pais-fcc-votes-to-allow-blocking-and-throttling/">led a repeal</a> that reclassified broadband as an information service, returning it to the less strict regulatory regime of Title I. The current FCC likely would have acted much sooner but there was a 2-2 deadlock until last month when the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/senate-confirms-biden-fcc-nominee-finally-giving-democrats-a-3-2-majority/">Senate confirmed</a> Biden nominee Anna Gomez to fill the empty spot.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>After the comment period, the FCC is likely to finalize the rulemaking and put the 2015 rules back in place. The broadband industry will likely then sue the FCC in an attempt to nullify the rulemaking.</p>
<h2>Chair: Broadband needs ‚Äúexpert agency‚Äù</h2>
<p>"Today, there is no expert agency ensuring that the Internet is fast, open, and fair... Today, we begin a process to make this right. We propose to reinstate enforceable, bright-line rules to prevent blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization," Rosenworcel said at the commission meeting.</p>
<p>Title II regulation isn't just about net neutrality, Rosenworcel said, arguing that the reclassification will give the FCC more authority to protect national security on broadband networks. "When we stripped state-affiliated companies from China of their authority to operate in the United States, that action did not extend to broadband services, thanks to the retreat from Title II. This is a national security loophole that needs to be addressed," she said.</p>
<p>Without Title II, the FCC has "limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into our network policies," she said. The same is true of protecting privacy on broadband networks, she said.</p>
<p>"The law requires telecommunications providers to protect the confidentiality of the proprietary information of their customers," Rosenworcel said. "That means that these providers cannot sell your location data, among other sensitive information. Those privacy protections currently extend to voice customers but not broadband subscribers. Does that really make sense? Do we want our broadband providers selling what we do online? Scraping our service for a payday from new artificial intelligence models? Doing any of this without our permission?"</p>

<p>An international team of scientists has discovered a huge spike in radiocarbon levels 14,300 years ago by analyzing ancient tree-rings found in the French Alps.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/radiocarbon/" rel="tag">radiocarbon</a> spike was caused by a massive solar storm, the biggest ever identified.
</p><p>A similar solar storm today would be catastrophic for modern technological society‚Äîpotentially wiping out telecommunications and satellite systems, causing massive electricity grid blackouts, and costing us billions of pounds.
</p><p>The academics are warning of the importance of understanding such storms to protect our global communications and energy infrastructure for the future.
</p><p>The <a href="https://phys.org/tags/collaborative+research/" rel="tag">collaborative research</a>, which was carried out by an international team of scientists, is published in <i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical Physical and Engineering Sciences</i> and reveals new insights into the sun's extreme behavior and the risks it poses to Earth.
</p><p>A team of researchers from the Coll√®ge de France, CEREGE, IMBE, Aix-Marseille University and the University of Leeds measured radiocarbon levels in ancient trees preserved within the eroded banks of the Drouzet River, near Gap, in the Southern French Alps.

<p>The tree trunks, which are subfossils‚Äîremains whose fossilization process is not complete‚Äîwere sliced into tiny single tree-rings. Analysis of these individual rings identified an unprecedented spike in radiocarbon levels occurring precisely 14,300 years ago. By comparing this radiocarbon spike with measurements of beryllium, a chemical element found in Greenland ice cores, the team proposes that the spike was caused by a massive solar storm that would have ejected huge volumes of energetic particles into Earth's atmosphere.
</p><p>Edouard Bard, Professor of Climate and Ocean Evolution at the Coll√®ge de France and CEREGE, and lead author of the study, said, "Radiocarbon is constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere through a chain of reactions initiated by cosmic rays. Recently, scientists have found that extreme solar events including <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+flares/" rel="tag">solar flares</a> and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/coronal+mass+ejections/" rel="tag">coronal mass ejections</a> can also create short-term bursts of energetic particles which are preserved as huge spikes in radiocarbon production occurring over the course of just a single year."


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>The researchers say that the occurrence of similar massive solar storms today could be catastrophic for modern technological society, potentially wiping out telecommunications, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/satellite+systems/" rel="tag">satellite systems</a> and electricity grids‚Äîand costing us billions of pounds. They warn that it is critical to understand the future risks of events like this, to enable us to prepare, build resilience into our communications and energy systems and shield them from potential damage.
</p><p>Tim Heaton, Professor of Applied Statistics in the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds, said, "Extreme solar storms could have huge impacts on Earth. Such super storms could permanently damage the transformers in our electricity grids, resulting in huge and widespread blackouts lasting months. They could also result in permanent damage to the satellites that we all rely on for navigation and telecommunication, leaving them unusable. They would also create severe radiation risks to astronauts."
</p><p>Nine such extreme solar storms‚Äîknown as Miyake Events‚Äîhave now been identified as having occurred over the last 15,000 years. The most recent confirmed Miyake Events occurred in 993 AD and 774 AD. This newly-identified 14,300-year-old storm is, however, the largest that has ever been found‚Äîroughly twice the size of these two.

    </div>

<p>The exact nature of these Miyake Events remains very poorly understood as they have never been directly observed instrumentally. They highlight that we still have much to learn about the behavior of the sun and the dangers it poses to society on Earth. We do not know what causes such extreme solar storms to occur, how frequently they might occur, or if we can somehow predict them.
</p><p>Professor Bard said, "Direct instrumental measurements of solar activity only began in the 17th century with the counting of sunspots. Nowadays, we also obtain detailed records using ground-based observatories, space probes, and satellites. However, all these short-term instrumental records are insufficient for a complete understanding of the sun. Radiocarbon measured in tree-rings, used alongside beryllium in polar ice cores, provide the best way to understand the sun's behavior further back into the past."
</p><p>The largest, directly-observed, solar storm occurred in 1859 and is known as the Carrington Event. It caused massive disruption on Earth‚Äîdestroying telegraph machines and creating a night-time aurora so bright that birds began to sing, believing the sun had begun to rise. However, the Miyake Events (including the newly discovered 14,300-yr-old <a href="https://phys.org/tags/storm/" rel="tag">storm</a>) would have been a staggering entire order-of-magnitude greater in size.

<p>Professor Heaton said, "Radiocarbon provides a phenomenal way of studying Earth's history and reconstructing critical events that it has experienced. A precise understanding of our past is essential if we want to accurately predict our future and mitigate potential risks. We still have much to learn. Each new discovery not only helps answer existing key questions but can also generate new ones."
</p><p>C√©cile Miramont, Associate Professor of Paleoenvironments and Paleoclimates at IMBE, Aix-en-Provence University, said, "Finding such a collection of preserved trees was truly exceptional. By comparing the widths of the individual tree rings in the multiple <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tree+trunks/" rel="tag">tree trunks</a>, we then carefully pieced together the separate trees to create a longer timeline using a method called dendrochronology. This allowed us to discover invaluable information on past environmental changes and measure radiocarbon over an uncharted period of solar activity."

        <p>By analyzing fossilized dental plaque, scientists have found new evidence that early Europeans ate seaweed and other aquatic plants.</p>

<p>Today, dental hygienists diligently scrape plaque and tartar off our teeth during regular cleanings. But before modern dentisty, this debris simply built up on early humans‚Äô teeth and gums.</p>

<p>Fortunately for archaeologists, some of that plaque has survived for thousands of years.</p>

<p>In a study published this week in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41671-2"><em>Nature Communications</em></a>, researchers analyzed samples of preserved dental plaque from the remains of 74 early humans unearthed at 28 European archaeological sites. Some of the teeth were around 2,000 years old, while others were more than 8,000 years old, reports <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/17/europe/early-europeans-seaweed-dental-plaque-scn/index.html">CNN</a>‚Äôs Katie Hunt.</p>

<p>They found the chemical biomarkers of seaweed and aquatic plants in 26 samples, which suggests that early humans were eating‚Äîor, at the very least, chewing‚Äîthese bounties from the sea. More specifically, they detected red, green and brown seaweed, as well as pondweed and a relative of the water lily.</p>

<p>The results indicate humans were eating aquatic plants as early as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period, through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period and into the early&nbsp;<a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages">Middle Ages</a>. That timespan is significant, as archaeologists had long assumed that the introduction of farming during the Neolithic era meant that early humans largely abandoned such foods from the sea, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1004513?">statement</a> from the researchers.</p>

<p>Additionally, aquatic plants weren‚Äôt only a coastal menu specialty. The researchers also found evidence in teeth from a site in southeast Spain located nearly 50 miles from the water.</p>

<p>How early humans prepared these aquatic plants is unclear‚Äîdid they eat them raw or cook them? Scientists also don‚Äôt know how much of their diets consisted of aquatic plants, as the biomarkers of other types of plants ‚Äútend to survive less well in archaeological contexts compared to algae,‚Äù study co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.york.ac.uk/archaeology/people/research-staff/stephen-buckley/">Stephen Buckley</a>, an archaeologist at England‚Äôs University of York, tells CNN.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt necessarily get a full picture of all foods consumed, which can depend on prevailing environmental conditions,‚Äù he adds.</p>

<p>The team thinks early humans may have understood the nutritional benefits of seaweed and aquatic plants‚Äîjust as we do now. These days, seaweed has&nbsp;<a href="https://fortune.com/2022/11/07/the-seaweed-superfood-revolution-could-end-world-hunger-and-save-the-planet/">been called a ‚Äúsuperfood,‚Äù</a> thanks to its abundance, rapid growth and vitamin and mineral content.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSeaweed is great,‚Äù says study co-author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/humanities/staff/karenhardy/">Karen Hardy</a>, an archaeologist at the University of Glasgow, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2397961-people-around-europe-have-eaten-seaweed-for-thousands-of-years/"><em>New Scientist</em></a>‚Äôs Chen Ly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs available, it‚Äôs nutritious, it‚Äôs local, it‚Äôs renewable.‚Äù</p>

<p>It‚Äôs also environmentally friendly and may help halt human-caused climate change by ‚Äúabsorbing carbon emissions, regenerating marine ecosystems, creating biofuel and renewable plastics as well as generating marine protein,‚Äù as&nbsp;<a href="https://time.com/5848994/seaweed-climate-change-solution/"><em>Time</em></a>‚Äôs M√©lissa Godin wrote in 2020.</p>

<p>The researchers hope their findings will encourage more people to start adding seaweed and aquatic plants to their diets.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt would be a wonderful thing to think that people actually connected in and thought, ‚ÄòWell, if we ate it before, we can start eating it again,‚Äô‚Äù Hardy tells the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/oct/17/seaweed-was-common-food-in-europe-for-thousands-of-years-researchers-find"><em>Guardian</em></a>‚Äôs Nicola Davis.</p>
