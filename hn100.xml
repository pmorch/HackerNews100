Why Is SQLite Coded In C
</p>
<details>
<summary>Table Of Contents</summary>

</details>
</div>




<h2 id="c_is_best"><span>1. </span>C Is Best</h2>

<blockquote><p>
Note: Sections 2.0 and 3.0 of this article were added in response
to comments on 
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16585120">Hacker News</a> and

</p></blockquote>

<p>
Since its inception on 2000-05-29, SQLite has been implemented in generic C.
C was and continues to be the best language for implementing a software
library like SQLite.  There are no plans to recode SQLite in any other
programming language at this time.

</p><p>
The reasons why C is the best language to implement SQLite include:


</p><ul>
<li> Performance
</li><li> Compatibility
</li><li> Low-dependency
</li><li> Stability
</li></ul>

<h2 id="performance"><span>1.1. </span>Performance</h2>

<p>An intensively used low-level library like SQLite needs to be fast.
(And SQLite is fast, see <a href="https://sqlite.org/intern-v-extern-blob.html">Internal Versus External BLOBs</a> and
<a href="https://sqlite.org/fasterthanfs.html">35% Faster Than The Filesystem</a> for examples.)

</p><p>C is a great language for writing fast code.  C is sometimes
described as "portable assembly language".  It enables developers
to code as close to the underlying hardware as possible while still
remaining portable across platforms.

</p><p>Other programming languages sometimes claim to be "as fast as C".
But no other language claims to be faster than C for general-purpose
programming, because none are.

</p><h2 id="compatibility"><span>1.2. </span>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Nearly all systems have the ability to call libraries
written in C.  This is not true of other implementation languages.

</p><p>So, for example, Android applications written in Java are able to
invoke SQLite (through an adaptor).  Maybe it would have been more
convenient for Android if SQLite had been coded in Java as that would
make the interface simpler.  However, on iPhone applications are coded
in Objective-C or Swift, neither of which have the ability to call
libraries written in Java.  Thus, SQLite would be unusable on iPhones
had it been written in Java.

</p><h2 id="low_dependency"><span>1.3. </span>Low-Dependency</h2>

<p>Libraries written in C do not have a huge run-time dependency.
In its minimum configuration, SQLite requires only the following
routines from the standard C library:

</p><center>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li> memcmp()
</li><li> memcpy()
</li><li> memmove()
</li><li> memset()
</li></ul>
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li> strcmp()
</li><li> strlen()
</li><li> strncmp()
</li></ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</center>

<p>
In a more complete build, SQLite also uses library routines like
malloc() and free() and operating system interfaces for opening, reading,
writing, and closing files.  But even then, the number of dependencies
is very small.  Other "modern" languages, in contrast, often require
multi-megabyte runtimes loaded with thousands and thousands of interfaces.

</p><h2 id="stability"><span>1.4. </span>Stability</h2>

<p>
The C language is old and boring.
It is a well-known and well-understood language.
This is exactly what one wants when developing a module like SQLite.
Writing a small, fast, and reliable database engine is hard enough as it
is without the implementation language changing out from under you with
each update to the implementation language specification.

</p><h2 id="why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_an_object_oriented_language_"><span>2. </span>Why Isn't SQLite Coded In An Object-Oriented Language?</h2>

<p>
Some programmers cannot imagine developing a complex system like
SQLite in a language that is not "object oriented".  So why is
SQLite not coded in C++ or Java?

</p><ol>
<li><p>
Libraries written in C++ or Java can generally only be used by
applications written in the same language. It is difficult to
get an application written in Haskell or Java to invoke a library
written in C++.  On the other hand, libraries written in C are
callable from any programming language.

</p></li><li><p>
Object-Oriented is a design pattern, not a programming language.
You can do object-oriented programming in any language you want,
including assembly language.  Some languages (ex: C++ or Java) make
object-oriented easier.  But you can still do object-oriented programming
in languages like C.

</p></li><li><p>
Object-oriented is not the only valid design pattern.
Many programmers have been taught to think purely in terms of
objects.  And, to be fair, objects are often a good way to
decompose a problem.  But objects are not the only way, and are
not always the best way to decompose a problem.  Sometimes good old
procedural code is easier to write, easier to maintain and understand,
and faster than object-oriented code.

</p></li><li><p>
When SQLite was first being developed, Java was a young and immature
language.  C++ was older, but was undergoing such growing pains that
it was difficult to find any two C++ compilers that worked the same
way.  So C was definitely a better choice back when SQLite was first
being developed.  The situation is less stark now, but there is little
to no benefit in recoding SQLite at this point.
</p></li></ol>

<h2 id="why_isn_t_sqlite_coded_in_a_safe_language_"><span>3. </span>Why Isn't SQLite Coded In A "Safe" Language?</h2>

<p>
There has lately been a lot of interest in "safe" programming languages
like Rust or Go in which it is impossible, or is at least difficult, to make
common programming errors like memory leaks or array overruns.  So the
question often arises as to why SQLite is not coded in a "safe" language.

</p><ol>
<li><p>
None of the safe programming languages existed for the first 10 years
of SQLite's existence.  SQLite could be recoded in Go or Rust, but doing
so would probably introduce far more bugs than would be fixed, and it
may also result in slower code.

</p></li><li><p>
Safe languages insert additional machine branches to do things like
verify that array accesses are in-bounds.  In correct code, those
branches are never taken.  That means that the machine code cannot
be 100% branch tested, which is an important component of SQLite's
quality strategy.

</p></li><li><p>
Safe languages usually want to abort if they encounter an out-of-memory
(OOM) situation.  SQLite is designed to recover gracefully from an OOM.
It is unclear how this could be accomplished in the current crop of
safe languages.

</p></li><li><p>
All of the existing safe languages are new.  The developers of SQLite
applaud the efforts of computer language researchers in trying to
develop languages that are easier to program safely.  We encourage these
efforts to continue.  But we ourselves are more interested in old and
boring languages when it comes to implementing SQLite.
</p></li></ol>

<p>
All that said, it is possible that SQLite might
one day be recoded in Rust.  Recoding SQLite in Go is unlikely
since Go hates assert().  But Rust is a possibility.  Some
preconditions that must occur before SQLite is recoded in Rust
include:

</p><ol type="A">
<li> Rust needs to mature a little more, stop changing so fast, and
     move further toward being old and boring.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can be used to create general-purpose
     libraries that are callable from all other programming languages.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can produce object code that
     works on obscure embedded devices, including devices that lack
     an operating system.
</li><li> Rust needs to pick up the necessary tooling that enables one to
     do 100% branch coverage testing of the compiled binaries.
</li><li> Rust needs a mechanism to recover gracefully from OOM errors.
</li><li> Rust needs to demonstrate that it can do the kinds of work that
     C does in SQLite without a significant speed penalty.
</li></ol>

<p>
If you are a "rustacean" and feel that Rust already meets the
preconditions listed above, and that SQLite should be recoded in
Rust, then you are welcomed and encouraged
to contact the SQLite developers privately
and argue your case.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>I've been tracking <a target="_blank" href="https://www.lastweekinaws.com/" rel="nofollow">AWS</a> for a long time, with a specific emphasis on pricing. "What happens if AWS hikes prices" has always been something of a boogeyman, trotted out as a hypothetical to urge folks to avoid taking dependencies on a given provider.</p>
<p>Over the weekend - on a Saturday, no less - that hypothetical became real.</p>
<p>AWS has <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/capacityblocks/pricing/" rel="nofollow">quietly raised prices</a> on its EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML by approximately 15 percent. The p5e.48xlarge instance – eight NVIDIA H200 accelerators in a trenchcoat – jumped from $34.61 to $39.80 per hour across most regions, while the p5en.48xlarge climbed from $36.18 to $41.61. Customers in US West (N. California) face steeper hikes, with p5e rates rising from $43.26 to $49.75. The change had been telegraphed: AWS's pricing page noted (and bizarrely, still does) that "current prices are scheduled to be updated in January, 2026," though the company neglected to mention which direction.</p>

    

<p>This comes about seven months after AWS trumpeted "up to 45% price reductions" for GPU instances - though that announcement covered On-Demand and Savings Plans rather than Capacity Blocks. Funny how that works.</p>

        


        

<p>For the uninitiated, Capacity Blocks are AWS's answer to "I need guaranteed GPU capacity for my ML training job next Tuesday." You reserve specific GPU instances for a defined time window – anywhere from a day to a few weeks out – and pay up front at a locked-in rate. It's popular with companies doing serious ML work who can't afford to have a training run interrupted because spot capacity evaporated. The pricing should make it abundantly clear that the people using this aren't hobbyists; these are teams with budgets measured in millions.</p>
<p>An Amazon spox told us via email, "EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML pricing vary based on supply and demand patterns, as described on the product detail page. This price adjustment reflects the supply/demand patterns we expect this quarter."</p>

        

<p>To be clear, AWS has raised prices before, but rarely as a straight increase to a line item. The company prefers to change pricing dimensions entirely, often <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-updated-pay-per-use-pricing-model-for-aws-config-rules/" rel="nofollow">spinning this as a price reduction for most customers</a> – a claim I'd characterize as "creative." Historical straight-up price increases have been tied to regulatory actions: per-SMS charges in certain markets and the like. This is different.</p>
<p>The timing is curious for another reason: it hands Azure and GCP a talking point on a silver platter. Both have been aggressively courting ML workloads, and "AWS just raised GPU prices 15%" is exactly the kind of ammunition enterprise sales teams dream about. Whether the competitors can actually absorb the demand is another question – GPU constraints are hardly unique to AWS – but perception matters in enterprise deals.</p>
<p>For companies with Enterprise Discount Programs or other negotiated agreements, this raises uncomfortable questions. EDPs typically guarantee discounts off public pricing – so if public pricing goes up 15 percent, your "discounted" rate just got more expensive in absolute terms, even if the percentage held steady. I expect some pointed conversations between AWS account teams and their larger customers in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3>Why are they doing this?</h3>
<p>It's hard not to see this as a bellwether. GPUs are increasingly constrained globally as the world pivots to generating slop-as-a-service in every conceivable domain. The question is what this means for other resource types down the road. Does the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/smartphones_memory_ai/">global RAM crunch</a> mean RAM-centric services are next? You can ignore ML Capacity Block pricing if you're not running machine learning workloads – which describes north of 95 percent of most companies' cloud spend – but RAM touches every service AWS offers. Well, possibly excepting their support function, though that's <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-and-enhanced-aws-support-plans-add-ai-capabilities-to-expert-guidance/" rel="nofollow">rapidly becoming "AI-Powered"</a> too, so give it time.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/aws_genz_misery_nope/">Deploying to Amazon's cloud is a pain in the AWS younger devs won't tolerate</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/24/aws_storage_gateway_nutanix_ahv/">AWS adds hybrid cloud storage support for Nutanix's AHV hypervisor</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/17/jassy_taps_peter_desantis_to_run_agi/">Jassy taps 27-year Amazon veteran to run AGI org, which is now definitely a thing that exists</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/16/smartphones_memory_ai/">Smartphones face a memory cost crunch – and buyers aren't in the mood</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The canary-in-the-coal-mine concern here isn't GPUs specifically, but rather the precedent it establishes. AWS has spent two decades conditioning customers to expect prices only ever go down. That expectation is now broken. Once you've raised prices on one service and the world doesn't end, the second increase becomes easier. And the third. The playbook has changed.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on services where AWS faces genuine supply constraints or where their costs have materially increased. Graviton instances have been priced aggressively to drive adoption – what happens when ARM chip supply tightens? Data transfer costs have been a cash cow for years, but they've also been stable; are those next? I don't have inside information, but I do have pattern recognition, and the pattern just shifted.</p>

        

<p>AWS has long benefited from the assumption that cloud pricing only trends in one direction. That assumption died on a Saturday in January, with all the fanfare of a Terms of Service update. The question isn't whether this matters – it does. The question is whether it's an anomaly or the new normal. My money's on the latter. ®</p>

<p>Many of you know that I'm an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation – EFF. I'm about to start my 25th year there. I know that I'm hardly unbiased, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no group anywhere on Earth that does the work of defending our digital rights better than EFF.</p>
<p>I'm an activist there, and for the past quarter-century, I've been embroiled in something I call "The War on General Purpose Computing."</p>
<p>If you were at 28C3, 14 years ago, you may have heard me give a talk with that title. Those are the trenches I've been in since my very first day on the job at EFF, when I flew to Los Angeles to crash the inaugural meeting of something called the "Broadcast Protection Discussion Group," an unholy alliance of tech companies, media companies, broadcasters and cable operators.</p>
<p>They'd gathered because this lavishly corrupt American congressman, Billy Tauzin, had promised them a new regulation – a rule banning the manufacture and sale of digital computers, unless they had been backdoored to specifications set by that group, specifications for technical measures to block computers from performing operations that were dispreferred by these companies' shareholders.</p>
<p>That rule was called "the Broadcast Flag," and it actually passed through the American telecoms regulator, the Federal Communications Commission. So we sued the FCC in federal court, and overturned the rule.</p>
<p>We won that skirmish, but friends, I have bad news, news that will not surprise you. Despite wins like that one, we have been losing the war on the general purpose computer for the past 25 years.</p>
<p>Which is why I've come to Hamburg today. Because, after decades of throwing myself against a locked door, the door that leads to a new, good internet, one that delivers both the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 that let our normie friends join the party, that door has been unlocked.</p>
<p>Today, it is open a crack. It's open a crack!</p>
<p>And here's the weirdest part: Donald Trump is the guy who's unlocked that door.</p>
<p>Oh, he didn't do it on purpose! But, thanks to Trump's incontinent belligerence, we are on the cusp of a "Post-American Internet," a new digital nervous system for the 21st century. An internet that we can build without worrying about America's demands and priorities.</p>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not <em>happy</em> about Trump or his policies. But as my friend Joey DaVilla likes to say "When life gives you SARS, you make sarsaparilla." The only thing worse than experiencing all the terror that Trump has unleashed on America and the world would be going through all that and not salvaging anything out of the wreckage.</p>
<p>That's what I want to talk to you about today: the post-American Internet we can wrest from Trump's chaos.</p>
<p>A post-American Internet that is possible because Trump has mobilized new coalition partners to join the fight on our side. In politics, coalitions are <em>everything</em>. Any time you see a group of people suddenly succeeding at a goal they have been failing to achieve, it's a sure bet that they've found some coalition partners, new allies who don't want <em>all</em> the same thing as the original forces, but want <em>enough</em> of the same things to fight on their side.</p>
<p>That's where Trump came from: a coalition of billionaires, white nationalists, Christian bigots, authoritarians, conspiratorialists, imperialists, and self-described "libertarians" who've got such a scorching case of low-tax brain worms that they'd vote for Mussolini if he'd promise to lower their taxes by a nickel.</p>
<p>And what's got me so excited is that <em>we've</em> got a new coalition in the War on General Purpose Computers: a coalition that includes the digital rights activists who've been on the lines for decades, but <em>also</em> people who want to turn America's Big Tech trillions into billions for their own economy, <em>and</em> national security hawks who are quite rightly worried about digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>My thesis here is that this is an <em>unstoppable</em> coalition. Which is good news! For the first time in decades, victory is in our grasp.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>So let me explain: 14 years ago, I stood in front of this group and explained the "War on General Purpose Computing." That was my snappy name for this fight, but the boring name that they use in legislatures for it is "anticircumvention,"</p>
<p>Under anticircumvention law, it's a crime to alter the functioning of a digital product or service, unless the manufacturer approves of your modification, and – crucially – this is true <em>whether or not</em> your modification violates <em>any other law</em>.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention law originates in the USA: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 establishes a felony punishable by a five year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine for a first offense for bypassing an "access control" for a copyrighted work.</p>
<p>So practically speaking, if you design a device or service with even the flimsiest of systems to prevent modification of its application code or firmware, it's a felony – a jailable felony – to modify that code or firmware. It's also a felony to disclose information about <em>how</em> to bypass that access control, which means that pen-testers who even <em>describe</em> how they access a device or system face criminal liability.</p>
<p>Under anticircumvention law any manufacturer can trivially turn their product into a no-go zone, criminalizing the act of investigating its defects, criminalizing the act of reporting on its defects, and criminalizing the act of remediating its defects.</p>
<p>This is a law that Jay Freeman rightly calls "Felony Contempt of Business Model." Anticircumvention became the law of the land in 1998 when Bill Clinton signed the DMCA. But before you start snickering at those stupid Americans, know this: every <em>other</em> country in the world has passed a law <em>just like this</em> in the years since. Here in the EU, it came in through Article 6 of the 2001 EU Copyright Directive.</p>
<p>Now, it makes a certain twisted sense for the US to enact a law like this, after all, they are the world's tech powerhouse, home to the biggest, most powerful tech companies in the world. By making it illegal to modify digital products without the manufacturer's permission, America enhances the rent-extracting power of the most valuable companies on US stock exchanges.</p>
<p>But why would <em>Europe</em> pass a law like this? Europe is a massive tech <em>importer</em>. By extending legal protection to tech companies that want to steal their users' data and money, the EU was facilitating a one-way transfer of value from Europe to America. So why would Europe do this?</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you about the circumstances under which <em>other</em> countries came to enact their anticircumvention laws and maybe you'll spot a pattern that will answer this question.</p>
<p>Australia got its anticircumvention law through the US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Australia to enact anticircumvention law.</p>
<p>Canada and Mexico got it through the US-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which obliges Canada and Mexico to enact anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>Andean nations like Chile got their anticircumvention laws through bilateral US free trade agreements, which oblige them to enact anticircumvention laws.</p>
<p>And the Central American nations got their anticircumvention laws through CAFTA – The Central American Free Trade Agreement with the USA – which obliges them to enact anticircumvention laws, too.</p>
<p>I assume you've spotted the pattern by now: the US trade representative has forced every one of its trading partners to adopt anticircumvention law, to facilitate the extraction of their own people's data and money by American firms. But of course, that only raises a further question: Why would every other country in the world agree to let America steal its own people's money and data, and block its domestic tech sector from making interoperable products that would prevent this theft?</p>
<p>Here's an anecdote that unravels this riddle: many years ago, in the years before Viktor Orban rose to power, I used to guest-lecture at a summer PhD program in political science at Budapest's Central European University. And one summer, after I'd lectured to my students about anticircumvention law, one of them approached me.</p>
<p>They had been the information minister of a Central American nation during the CAFTA negotiations, and one day, they'd received a phone-call from their trade negotiator, calling from the CAFTA bargaining table. The negotiator said, "You know how you told me not to give the Americans anticircumvention under any circumstances? Well, they're saying that they won't take our coffee unless we give them anticircumvention. And I'm sorry, but we just can't lose the US coffee market. Our economy would collapse. So we're going to give them anticircumvention. I'm really sorry."</p>
<p>That's it. That's why every government in the world allowed US Big Tech companies to declare open season on their people's private data and ready cash.</p>
<p>The alternative was tariffs. Well, I don't know if you've heard, but we've got tariffs now!</p>
<p>I mean, if someone threatens to burn your house down unless you follow their orders, and then they burn your house down anyway, you don't have to keep following their orders. So…Happy Liberation Day?</p>
<p>So far, every country in the world has had one of two responses to the Trump tariffs. The first one is: "Give Trump everything he asks for (except Greenland) and hope he stops being mad at you." This has been an absolute failure. Give Trump an inch, he'll take a mile. He'll take fucking <em>Greenland</em>. Capitulation is a failure.</p>
<p>But so is the other tactic: retaliatory tariffs. That's what we've done in Canada (like all the best Americans, I'm Canadian). Our top move has been to levy tariffs on the stuff we import from America, making the things we buy <em>more</em> expensive. That's a weird way to punish America! It's like punching yourself in the face as hard as you can, and hoping the downstairs neighbor says "Ouch!"</p>
<p>And it's <em>indiscriminate</em>. Why whack some poor farmer from a state that begins and ends with a vowel with tariffs on his soybeans. That guy never did anything bad to Canada.</p>
<p>But there's a third possible response to tariffs, one that's just sitting there, begging to be tried: what about repealing anticircumvention law?</p>
<p>If you're a technologist or an investor based in a country that's repealed its anticircumvention law, you can go into business making disenshittificatory products that plug into America's defective tech exports, allowing the people who own and use those products to use them in ways that are good for them, even if those uses make the company's shareholders mad.</p>
<p>Think of John Deere tractors: when a farmer's John Deere tractor breaks down, they are expected to repair it, swapping in new parts and assemblies to replace whatever's malfing. But the tractor won't recognize that new part and will not start working again, not until the farmer spends a couple hundred bucks on a service callout from an official John Deere tractor repair rep, whose only job is to type an unlock code into the tractor's console, to initialize the part and pair it with the tractor's main computing unit.</p>
<p>Modding a tractor to bypass this activation step violates anticircumvention law, meaning farmers all over the world are stuck with this ripoff garbage, because their <em>own</em> government will lock up anyone who makes a tractor mod that disables the parts-pairing check in this American product.</p>
<p>So what if Canada repealed Bill C-11, the Copyright Modernization Act of 2012 (that's our anticircumvention law)? Well, then a company like Honeybee, which makes tractor front-ends and attachments, could hire some smart University of Waterloo computer science grads, and put 'em to work jailbreaking the John Deere tractor's firmware, and offer it to everyone in the world. They could sell the crack to anyone with an internet connection and a payment method, including that poor American farmer whose soybeans we're currently tariffing.</p>
<p>It's hard to convey how much money is on the table here. Take just <em>one</em> example: Apple's App Store. Apple forces all app vendors into using its payment processor, and charges them a <em>30 percent</em> commission on every euro spent inside of an app.</p>
<p>30 percent! That's <em>such</em> a profitable business that Apple makes <em>$100 billion per year</em> on it. If the EU repeals Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, some smart geeks in Finland could reverse-engineer Apple's bootloaders and make a hardware dongle that jailbreaks phones so that they can use alternative app stores, and sell the dongle – along with the infrastructure to operate an app store – to anyone in the world who wants to go into business competing with Apple for users and app vendors.</p>
<p>Those competitors could offer a 90% discount to every crafter on Etsy, every performer on Patreon, every online news outlet, every game dev, every media store. Offer them a 90% discount on payments, and <em>still</em> make $10b/year.</p>
<p>Maybe Finland will never see another Nokia, but Nokia's a tough business to be in. You've got to make hardware, which is expensive and risky. But if the EU legalizes jailbreaking, then <em>Apple</em> would have to incur all the expense and risk of making and fielding hardware, while those Finnish geeks could cream off the $100b Apple sucks out of the global economy in an act of a disgusting, rip-off rent-seeking.</p>
<p>As Jeff Bezos said to the publishers: "Your margin is my opportunity." With these guys, it's always "disruption for thee, but not for me." When they do it to us, that's progress. When we do it to them, it's piracy, and every pirate wants to be an admiral.</p>
<p>Well, screw that. Move fast and break Tim Cook's things. Move fast and break <em>kings</em>!</p>
<p>It's funny: I spent 25 years getting my ass kicked by the US Trade Representative (in my defense, it wasn't a fair fight). I developed a kind of grudging admiration for the skill with which the USTR bound the entire world to a system of trade that conferred parochial advantages to America and its tech firms, giving them free rein to loot the world's data and economies. So it's been pretty amazing to watch Trump swiftly and decisively dismantle the global system of trade and destroy the case for the world continuing to arrange its affairs to protect the interests of America's capital class.</p>
<p>I mean, it's not a path I would have chosen. I'd have preferred no Trump at all to this breakthrough. But I'll take this massive own-goal if Trump insists. I mean, I'm not saying I've become an accelerationist, but at this point, I'm not exactly <em>not</em> an accelerationist.</p>
<p>Now, you might have heard that governments around the world have been trying to get Apple to open its App Store, and they've totally failed at this. When the EU hit Apple with an enforcement order under the Digital Markets Act, Apple responded by offering to allow third party app stores, but it would only allow those stores to sell apps that Apple had approved of.</p>
<p>And while those stores <em>could</em> use their own payment processors, Apple would charge them so much in junk fees that it would be <em>more</em> expensive to process a payment using your own system, and if Apple believed that a user's phone had been outside of the EU for 21 days, they'd remotely delete all that user's data and apps.</p>
<p>When the EU explained that this would not satisfy the regulation, Apple threatened to pull out of the EU. Then, once everyone had finished laughing, Apple filed more than a dozen bullshit objections to the order hoping to tie this up in court for a decade, the way Google and Meta did for the GDPR.</p>
<p>It's not clear that the EU can force Apple to write code that opens up the iOS platform for alternative app stores and payment methods, but there is one thing that the EU can absolutely do with 100% reliability, any time they want: the EU can decide not to let Apple use Europe's courts to shut down European companies that defend European merchants, performers, makers, news outlets, game devs and creative workers, from Apple's ripoff, by jailbreaking phones.</p>
<p>All the EU has to do is repeal Article 6 of the Copyright Directive, and, in so doing, strip Apple of the privilege of mobilizing the European justice system to shore up Apple's hundred billion dollar annual tax on the world's digital economy. The EU company that figures out how to reliably jailbreak iPhones will have customers all over the world, including in the USA, where Apple doesn't just use its veto over which apps you can run on your phone to suck 30% out of every dollar you spend, but where Apple also uses its control over the platform to strip out apps that protect Apple's customers from Trump's fascist takeover.</p>
<p>Back in October, Apple kicked the "ICE Block" app out of the App Store. That's an app that warns the user if there's a snatch squad of masked ICE thugs nearby looking to grab you off the street and send you to an offshore gulag. Apple internally classified ICE kidnappers as a "protected class," and then declared the ICE Block infringed on the rights of these poor, beset ICE goons.</p>
<p>And speaking of ICE thugs, there are plenty of qualified technologists who have fled the US this year, one step ahead of an ICE platoon looking to put them and their children into a camp. Those skilled hackers are now living all over the world, joined by investors who'd like to back a business whose success will be determined by how awesome its products are, and not how many $TRUMP coins they buy.</p>
<p>Apple's margin could be <em>their</em> opportunity.</p>
<p>Legalizing jailbreaking, raiding the highest margin lines of business of the most profitable companies in America is a <em>much</em> better response to the Trump tariffs than retaliatory tariffs.</p>
<p>For one thing, this is a <em>targeted</em> response: go after Big Tech's margins and you're mounting a frontal assault on the businesses whose CEOs each paid a million bucks to sit behind Trump on the inauguration dais.</p>
<p>Raiding Big Tech's margins is not an attack on the American people, nor on the small American businesses that are ripped off by Big Tech. It's a raid on the companies that screw everyday Americans <em>and</em> everyone else in the world. It's a way to make everyone in the world richer at the expense of these ripoff companies.</p>
<p>It beats the shit out of blowing hundreds of billions of dollars building AI data-centers in the hopes that someday, a sector that's lost nearly a trillion dollars shipping defective chatbots will figure out a use for GPUs that doesn't start hemorrhaging money the minute they plug them in.</p>
<p>So here are our new allies in the war on general-purpose computation: businesses and technologists who want to make billions of dollars raiding Big Tech's margins, and policymakers who want their country to be the disenshittification nation – the country that doesn't merely protect its people's money and privacy by buying jailbreaks from other countries, but rather, the country that makes billions of dollars <em>selling</em> that privacy and pocketbook-defending tech to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>That's a powerful alliance, but those are not the only allies Trump has pushed into our camp. There's another powerful ally waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Remember last June, when the International Criminal Court in the Hague issued an arrest warrant for the génocidaire Benjamin Netanyahu, and Trump denounced the ICC, and then the ICC lost its Outlook access, its email archives, its working files, its address books, its calendars?</p>
<p>Microsoft says they didn't brick the ICC – that it's a coincidence. But when it comes to a he-said/Clippy-said between the justices of the ICC and the convicted monopolists of Microsoft, I know who <em>I</em> believe.</p>
<p>This is exactly the kind of infrastructural risk that we were warned of if we let Chinese companies like Huawei supply our critical telecoms equipment. Virtually every government ministry, every major corporation, every small business and every household in the world have locked themselves into a US-based, cloud-based service.</p>
<p>The handful of US Big Tech companies that supply the world's administrative tools are all vulnerable to pressure from the Trump admin, and that means that Trump can brick an entire <em>nation</em>.</p>
<p>The attack on the ICC was an act of cyberwarfare, like the Russian hackers who shut down Ukrainian power-generation facilities, except that Microsoft doesn't have to <em>hack</em> Outlook to brick the ICC – they <em>own</em> Outlook.</p>
<p>Under the US CLOUD Act of 2018, the US government can compel any US-based company to disclose <em>any</em> of its users' data – including foreign governments – and this is true no matter where that data is stored. Last July, Anton Carniaux, Director of Public and Legal Affairs at Microsoft France, told a French government inquiry that he "couldn't guarantee" that Microsoft wouldn't hand sensitive French data over to the US government, even if that data was stored in a European data-center.</p>
<p>And under the CLOUD Act, the US government can slap gag orders on the companies that it forces to cough up that data, so there'd be no way to even know if this happened, or whether it's already happened.</p>
<p>It doesn't stop at administrative tools, either: remember back in 2022, when Putin's thugs looted millions of dollars' worth of John Deere tractors from Ukraine and those tractors showed up in Chechnya? The John Deere company pushed an over-the-air kill signal to those tractors and bricked 'em.</p>
<p>John Deere is every bit as politically vulnerable to the Trump admin as Microsoft is, and they can brick most of the tractors in the world, and the tractors they <em>can't</em> brick are probably made by Massey Ferguson, the number-two company in the ag-tech cartel, which is also an American company and just as vulnerable to political attacks from the US government.</p>
<p>Now, none of this will be news to global leaders. Even before Trump and Microsoft bricked the ICC they were trying to figure out a path to "digital sovereignty." But the Trump administration's outrageous conduct and rhetoric over past 11 months has turned "digital sovereignty" from a nice-to-have into a must-have.</p>
<p>So finally, we're seeing some movement, like "Eurostack," a project to clone the functionality of US Big Tech silos in free/open source software, and to build EU-based data-centers that this code can run on.</p>
<p>But Eurostack is heading for a crisis. It's great to build open, locally hosted, auditable, trustworthy services that replicate the useful features of Big Tech, but you also need to build the adversarial interoperability tools that allow for mass exporting of millions of documents, the sensitive data-structures and edit histories.</p>
<p>We need scrapers and headless browsers to accomplish the adversarial interoperability that will guarantee ongoing connectivity to institutions that are still hosted on US cloud-based services, because US companies are <em>not</em> going to facilitate the mass exodus of international customers from their platform.</p>
<p>Just think of how Apple responded to the relatively minor demand to open up the iOS App Store, and now imagine the thermonuclear foot-dragging, tantrum-throwing and malicious compliance they'll come up with when faced with the departure of a plurality of the businesses and governments in a 27-nation bloc of 500,000,000 affluent consumers.</p>
<p>Any serious attempt at digital sovereignty needs migration tools that work <em>without</em> the cooperation of the Big Tech companies. Otherwise, this is like building housing for East Germans and locating it in <em>West</em> Berlin. It doesn't matter how great the housing is, your intended audience is going to really struggle to move in unless you tear down the wall.</p>
<p>Step one of tearing down that wall is killing anticircumvention law, so that we can run virtual devices that can be scripted, break bootloaders to swap out firmware and generally seize the means of computation.</p>
<p>So this is the third bloc in the disenshittification army: not just digital rights hippies like me; not just entrepreneurs and economic development wonks rubbing their hands together at the thought of transforming American trillions into European billions; but also the national security hawks who are 100% justified in their extreme concern about their country's reliance on American platforms that have been shown to be <em>totally</em> unreliable.</p>
<p>This is how we'll get a post-American internet: with an unstoppable coalition of activists, entrepreneurs and natsec hawks.</p>
<p>This has been a long time coming. Since the post-war settlement, the world has treated the US as a neutral platform, a trustworthy and stable maintainer of critical systems for global interchange, what the political scientists Henry Farrell and Abraham Newman call the "Underground Empire." But over the past 15 years, the US has systematically shattered global trust in its institutions, a process that only accelerated under Trump.</p>
<p>Take transoceanic fiber optic cables: the way the transoceanic fiber routes were planned, the majority of these cables make landfall on the coasts of the USA where the interconnections are handled. There's a good case for this hub-and-spoke network topology, especially compared to establishing direct links between every country. That's an Order(N^2) problem: directly linking each of the planet Earth's 205 countries to every other country would require 20,910 fiber links.</p>
<p>But putting all the world's telecoms eggs in America's basket only works if the US doesn't take advantage of its centrality, and while many people worried about what the US could do with the head-ends of the world's global fiber infra, it wasn't until Mark Klein's 2006 revelations about the NSA's nation-scale fiber optic taps in AT&amp;T's network, and Ed Snowden's 2013 documents showing the global scale of this wiretapping, that the world had to confront the undeniable reality that the US could not be trusted to serve as the world's fiber hub.</p>
<p>It's not just fiber. The world does business in dollars. Most countries maintain dollar accounts at the Fed in New York as their major source of foreign reserves. But in 2005, American vulture capitalists bought up billions of dollars worth of Argentinian government bonds after the sovereign nation of Argentina had declared bankruptcy.</p>
<p>They convinced a judge in New York to turn over the government of Argentina's US assets to them to make good on loans that these debt collectors had not issued, but had bought up at pennies on the dollar. At that moment, every government in the world had to confront the reality that they could not trust the US Federal Reserve with their foreign reserves. But what else could they use?</p>
<p>Without a clear answer, dollar dominance continued, but then, under Biden, Putin-aligned oligarchs and Russian firms lost access to the SWIFT system for dollar clearing. This is when goods – like oil – are priced in dollars, so that buyers only need to find someone who will trade their own currency for dollars, which they can then swap for any commodity in the world.</p>
<p>Again, there's a sound case for dollar clearing: it's just not practical to establish deep, liquid pairwise trading market for all of the world's nearly 200 currencies, it's another O(N^2) problem.</p>
<p>But it only works if the dollar is a neutral platform. Once the dollar becomes an instrument of US foreign policy – whether or not you agree with that policy – it's no longer a neutral platform, and the world goes looking for an alternative.</p>
<p>No one knows what that alternative's going to be, just as no one knows what configuration the world's fiber links will end up taking. There's kilometers of fiber being stretched across the ocean floor, and countries are trying out some pretty improbable gambits as dollar alternatives, like Ethiopia revaluing its sovereign debt in Chinese renminbi. Without a clear alternative to America's enshittified platforms, the post-American century is off to a rocky start.</p>
<p>But there's one post-American system that's easy to imagine. The project to rip out all the cloud connected, backdoored, untrustworthy black boxes that power our institutions, our medical implants, our vehicles and our tractors; and replace it with collectively maintained, open, free, trustworthy, auditable code.</p>
<p>This project is the <em>only</em> one that benefits from economies of scale, rather than being paralyzed by exponential crises of scale. That's because any open, free tool adopted by any public institution – like the Eurostack services – can be audited, localized, pen-tested, debugged and improved by institutions in every other country.</p>
<p>It's a commons, more like a science than a technology, in that it is universal and international and collaborative. We don't have dueling western and Chinese principles of structural engineering. Rather, we have universal principles for making sure buildings don't fall down, adapted to local circumstances.</p>
<p>We wouldn't tolerate secrecy in the calculations used to keep our buildings upright, and we shouldn't tolerate opacity in the software that keeps our tractors, hearing aids, ventilators, pacemakers, trains, games consoles, phones, CCTVs, door locks, and government ministries working.</p>
<p>The thing is, software is not an asset, it's a liability. The capabilities that running software delivers – automation, production, analysis and administration – <em>those</em> are assets. But the software itself? That's a liability. Brittle, fragile, forever breaking down as the software upstream of it, downstream of it, and adjacent to it is updated or swapped out, revealing defects and deficiencies in systems that may have performed well for years.</p>
<p>Shifting software to commons-based production is a way to reduce the liability that software imposes on its makers and users,  balancing out that liability among many players.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, tech bosses are totally clueless when it comes to this. They really do think that software is an asset. That's why they're so fucking horny to have chatbots shit out software at superhuman speeds. That's why they think it's <em>good</em> that they've got a chatbot that "produces a thousand times more code than a human programmer."</p>
<p>Producing code that isn't designed for legibility and maintainability, that is optimized, rather, for speed of production, is a way to incur tech debt at scale.</p>
<p>This is a neat encapsulation of the whole AI story: the chatbot can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with a chatbot that <em>can't</em> do your job.</p>
<p>Your boss is an easy mark for that chatbot hustler because your boss hates you. In their secret hearts, bosses understand that if they stopped coming to work, the business would run along just fine, but if the <em>workers</em> stopped showing up, the company would grind to a halt.</p>
<p>Bosses like to tell themselves that they're in the driver's seat, but really, they fear that they're strapped into the back seat playing with a Fisher Price steering wheel. For them, AI is a way to wire the toy steering wheel directly into the company's drive-train. It's the realization of the fantasy of a company without workers.</p>
<p>When I was walking the picket line in Hollywood during the writer's strike, a writer told me that you prompt an AI the same way a studio boss gives shitty notes to a writer's room: "Make me ET, but make it about a dog, and give it a love interest, and a car-chase in the third act."</p>
<p>Say that to a writer's room and they will call you a <em>fucking idiot suit</em> and tell you "Why don't you go back to your office and make a spreadsheet, you nitwit. The grownups here are writing a movie."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you give that prompt to a chatbot, it will cheerfully shit out a script exactly to spec. The fact that this script will be terrible and unusable is less important than the prospect of a working life in which no one calls you a fucking idiot suit.</p>
<p>AI dangles the promise of a writer's room without writers, a movie without actors, a hospital without nurses, a coding shop without coders.</p>
<p>When Mark Zuckerberg went on a podcast and announced that the average American had three friends, but wanted 15 friends, and that he could solve this by giving us chatbots instead of friends, we all dunked on him as an out-of-touch billionaire Martian who didn't understand the nature of friendship.</p>
<p>But the reality is that for Zuck, your friends are a problem. Your friends' interactions with you determine how much time you spend on his platforms, and thus how many revenue-generating ads he can show you.</p>
<p>Your friends stubbornly refuse to organize their relationship with you in a way that maximizes the return to his shareholders. So Zuck is over there in Menlo Park, furiously fantasizing about replacing your friends with chatbots, because that way, he can finally realize the dream of a social media service without any socializing.</p>
<p>Rich, powerful people are, at root, solipsists. The only way to amass a billion dollars is to inflict misery and privation on whole populations. The only way to look yourself in the mirror after you've done that, is to convince yourself that those people don't matter, that, in some important sense, they aren't <em>real</em>.</p>
<p>Think of Elon Musk calling everyone who disagrees with him an "NPC,” or all those "Effective Altruists," who claimed the moral high ground by claiming to care about 53 trillion imaginary artificial humans who will come into existence in 10,000 years at the expense of extending moral consideration to people alive today.</p>
<p>Or think of how Trump fired all the US government scientists, and then announced the "Genesis" program, declaring that the US would begin generating <em>annual</em> "moonshot"-scale breakthroughs, with a chatbot. It's science without scientists.</p>
<p>Chatbots can't really do science, but from Trump's perspective, they're still better than scientists, because a chatbot won't ever tell him not to stare at an eclipse, or not to inject bleach. A chatbot won't ever tell him that trans people exist, or that the climate emergency is real.</p>
<p>Powerful people are suckers for AI, because AI fuels the fantasy of a world without people: just a boss and a computer, and no ego-shattering confrontations with people who know how to <em>do</em> things telling you "no."</p>
<p>AI is a way to produce tech debt at scale, to replace skilled writers with defective spicy autocomplete systems, to lose money at a rate not seen in living memory.</p>
<p>Now, compare that with the project of building a post-American internet: a project to <em>reduce</em> tech debt, to unlock America's monopoly trillions and divide them among the world's entrepreneurs (for whom they represent untold profits), and the world's technology users (for whom they represent untold savings); all while building resiliency and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Now, some of you are probably feeling pretty cynical about this right now. After all, your political leaders have demonstrated decades of ineffectual and incompetent deference to the US, and an inability to act, even when the need was dire. If your leaders couldn't act decisively on the climate emergency, what hope do we have of them taking this moment seriously?</p>
<p>But crises precipitate change. Remember when <em>another</em> mad emperor – Vladimir Putin – invaded Ukraine, and Europe experienced a dire energy shortage? In three short years, the continent's solar uptake skyrocketed. The EU went from being 15 years <em>behind</em> in its energy transition, to ten years <em>ahead</em> of schedule.</p>
<p>Because when you're shivering in the dark, a lot of fights you didn't think were worth it are suddenly existential battles you can't afford to lose. Sure, no one wants to argue with a tedious neighbor who has an aesthetic temper tantrum at the thought of a solar panel hanging from their neighbor's balcony.</p>
<p>But when it's winter, and there's no Russian gas, and you're shivering in the dark, then that person can take their aesthetic objection to balcony solar, fold it until it's all corners, and shove it right up their ass.</p>
<p>Besides, we don't need Europe to lead the charge on a post-American internet by repealing anticircumvention. <em>Any</em> country could do it! And the country that gets there first gets to reap the profits from supplying jailbreaking tools to the rest of the world, it gets to be the Disenshittification Nation, and everyone else in the world gets to buy those tools and defend themselves from US tech companies' monetary and privacy plunder.</p>
<p>Just one country has to break the consensus, and the case for every country doing so is the strongest it's ever been. It used to be that countries that depended on USAID had to worry about losing food, medical and cash supports if they pissed off America. But Trump killed USAID, so now that's a dead letter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, America's status as the planet's most voracious consumer has been gutted by decades of anti-worker, pro-billionaire policies. Today, the US is in the grips of its third consecutive "K-shaped" recovery, that's an economic rally where the rich get richer, and everyone else gets poorer. For a generation, America papered over that growing inequality with easy credit, with everyday Americans funding their consumption with credit cards and second and third mortgages.</p>
<p>So long as they could all afford to keep buying, other countries had to care about America as an export market. But a generation of extraction has left the bottom 90% of Americans struggling to buy groceries and other necessities, carrying crushing debt from skyrocketing shelter, education and medical expenses that they can't hope to pay down, thanks to 50 years of wage stagnation.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has sided firmly with debt collectors, price gougers, and rent extractors. Trump neutered enforcement against rent-fixing platforms like Realpage, restarted debt payments for eight million student borrowers, and killed a plan to make live-saving drugs a little cheaper, leaving Americans to continue to pay the highest drug prices in the world.</p>
<p>Every dollar spent servicing a loan is a dollar that can't go to consumption. And as more and more Americans slip into poverty, the US is gutting programs that spend money on the public's behalf, like SNAP, the food stamps program that helps an ever-larger slice of the American public stave off hunger.</p>
<p>America is chasing the "world without people" dream, where working people have nothing, spend nothing, and turn every penny over to rentiers who promptly flush that money into the stock market, shitcoins, or gambling sites. But I repeat myself.</p>
<p>Even the US military – long a sacrosanct institution – is being kneecapped to enrich rent-seekers. Congress just killed a military "right to repair" law. So now, US soldiers stationed abroad will have to continue the Pentagon's proud tradition of shipping materiel from generators to jeeps back to America to be fixed by their manufacturers at a 10,000% markup, because the Pentagon routinely signs maintenance contracts that prohibit it from teaching a Marine how to fix an engine.</p>
<p>The post-American world is really coming on fast. As we repeal our anticircumvention laws, we don't have to care what America thinks, we don't have to care about their tariffs, because they're already whacking us with tariffs; and because the only people left in the US who can afford to buy things are rich people, who just don't buy enough stuff. There's only so many Lambos and Sub-Zeros even the most guillotineable plute can usefully own.</p>
<p>But what if <em>European</em> firms want to go on taking advantage of anticircumvention laws? Well, there's good news there, too. "Good news," because the EU firms that rely on anticircumvention are engaged in the sleaziest, most disgusting frauds imaginable.</p>
<p>Anticircumvention law is the reason that Volkswagen could get away with Dieselgate. By imposing legal liability on reverse-engineers who might have discovered this lethal crime, Article 6 of the Copyright Directive created a chilling effect, and thousands of Europeans died, every year.</p>
<p>Today, Germany's storied automakers are carrying on the tradition of Dieselgate, sabotaging their cars to extract rent from drivers. From Mercedes, which rents you the accelerator pedal in your luxury car, only unlocking the full acceleration curve of your engine if you buy a monthly subscription; to BMW, which rents you the automated system that automatically dims your high-beams if there's oncoming traffic.</p>
<p>Legalize jailbreaking and any mechanic in Europe could unlock those subscription features for one price, and not share <em>any</em> of that money with BMW and Mercedes.</p>
<p>Then there's Medtronic, a company that pretends it is Irish. Medtronic is the world's largest med-tech company, having purchased all their competitors, and then undertaken the largest "tax-inversion" in history, selling themselves to a tiny Irish firm, in order to magick their profits into a state of untaxable grace, floating in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>Medtronic supplies the world's most widely used ventilators, and it booby-traps them the same way John Deere booby-traps its tractors. After a hospital technician puts a new part in a Medtronic ventilator, the ventilator's central computing unit refuses to recognize the part until it completes a cryptographic handshake, proving that an authorized Medtronic technician was paid hundreds of euros to certify a repair that the hospital's own technician probably performed.</p>
<p>It's just a way to suck hundreds of euros out of hospitals every time a ventilator breaks. This would be bad enough, but during the covid lockdowns, when every ventilator was desperately needed, and when the planes stopped flying, there was no way for a Medtronic tech to come and bless the hospital technicians' repairs. This was lethal. It killed people.</p>
<p>There's one more European company that relies on anticircumvention that I want to discuss here, because they're old friends of CCC: that's the Polish train company Newag. Newag sabotages its own locomotives, booby-trapping them so that if they sense they have been taken to a rival's service yard, the train bricks itself. When the train operator calls Newag about this mysterious problem, the company "helpfully" remotes into the locomotive's computers, to perform "diagnostics," which is just sending a unbricking command to the vehicle, a service for which they charge 20,000 euros.</p>
<p>Last year, Polish hackers from the security research firm Dragon Sector presented on their research into this disgusting racket in this very hall, and now, they're being sued by Newag under anticircumvention law, for making absolutely true disclosures about Newag's deliberately defective products.</p>
<p>So these are the European stakeholders for anticircumvention law: the Dieselgate killers, the car companies who want to rent you your high-beams and accelerator, the med-tech giant that bricked all the ventilators during the pandemic, and the company that tied Poland to the train-tracks.</p>
<p>I relish the opportunity to fight these bastards in Brussels, as they show up and cry "Won't someone think of the train saboteurs?"</p>
<p>The enshittification of technology – the decay of the platforms and systems we rely on – has many causes: the collapse of competition, regulatory capture, the smashing of tech workers' power. But most of all, enshittification is the result of anticircumvention law's ban on interoperability.</p>
<p>By blocking interop, by declaring war on the general-purpose computer, our policy-makers created an enshittogenic environment that rewarded companies for being shitty, and ushered in the enshittocene, in which everything is turning to shit.</p>
<p>Let's call time on enshittification. Let's seize the means of computation. Let's build the drop-in, free, open, auditable alternatives to the services and firmware we rely on.</p>
<p>Let's end the era of silos. I mean, isn't it fucking <em>weird</em> how you have to care which network someone is using if you want to talk to them? Instead of just deciding <em>who</em> you want to talk to?</p>
<p>The fact that you have to figure out whether the discussion you're trying to join is on Twitter or Bluesky, Mastodon or Instagram – that is just the most Prodigy/AOL/Compuserve-ass way of running a digital world. I mean, 1990 called and they want their walled gardens back</p>
<p>Powerful allies are joining our side in the War on General Purpose Computation. It's not just people like us, who've been fighting for this whole goddamned century, but also countries that want to convert American tech's hoarded trillions into fuel for a single-use rocket that boosts their own tech sector into a stable orbit.</p>
<p>It's national security hawks who are worried about Trump bricking their ministries or their tractors, and who are also worried – with just cause – about Xi Jinping bricking all their solar inverters and batteries. Because, after all, the post-American internet is also a post-Chinese internet!</p>
<p>Nothing should be designed to be field updatable without the user's permission. Nothing critical should be a black box.</p>
<p>Like I said at the start of this talk, I have been doing this work for 24 years at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, throwing myself at a door that was double-locked and deadbolted, and now that door is open a crack and goddammit, I am <em>hopeful</em>.</p>
<p>Not optimistic. Fuck optimism! Optimism is the idea that things will get better no matter what we do. I know that what we do matters. Hope is the belief that if we can improve things, even in small ways, we can ascend the gradient toward the world we want, and attain higher vantage points from which new courses of action, invisible to us here at our lower elevation, will be revealed.</p>
<p>Hope is a discipline. It requires that you not give in to despair. So I'm here to tell you: don't despair.</p>
<p>All this decade, all over the world, countries have taken up arms against concentrated corporate power. We've had big, muscular antitrust attacks on big corporations in the US (under Trump I <em>and</em> Biden); in Canada; in the UK; in the EU and member states like Germany, France and Spain; in Australia; in Japan and South Korea and Singapore; in Brazil; and in <em>China</em>.</p>
<p>This is a near-miraculous turn of affairs. All over the world, governments are declaring war on monopolies, the source of billionaires' wealth and power.</p>
<p>Even the most forceful wind is invisible. We can only see it by its effects. What we're seeing here is that whenever a politician bent on curbing corporate power unfurls a sail, no matter where in the world that politician is, that sail fills with wind and propels the policy in ways that haven't been seen in generations.</p>
<p>The long becalming of the fight over corporate power has ended, and a fierce, unstoppable wind is blowing. It's not just blowing in Europe, or in Canada, or in South Korea, Japan, China, Australia or Brazil. It's blowing in America, too. Never forget that as screwed up and terrifying as things are in America, the country has experienced, and continues to experience, a tsunami of antitrust bills and enforcement actions at the local, state and federal level.</p>
<p>And never forget that the post-American internet will be <em>good for Americans</em>. Because, in a K-shaped, bifurcated, unequal America, the trillions that American companies loot from the world don't trickle down to Americans. The average American holds a portfolio of assets that rounds to zero, and that includes stock in US tech companies.</p>
<p>The average American isn't a shareholder in Big Tech, the average American is a <em>victim</em> of Big Tech. Liberating the world from US Big Tech is also liberating America from US Big Tech.</p>
<p>That's been EFF's mission for 35 years. It's been my mission at EFF for 25 years. If you want to get involved in this fight – and I hope you do – it can be your mission, too. You can join EFF, and you can join groups in your own country, like Netzpolitik here in Germany, or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, or La Quadrature du Net in France, or the Open Rights Group in the UK, or EF Finland, or ISOC Bulgaria, XNet, DFRI, Quintessenz, Bits of Freedom, Openmedia, FSFE, or any of dozens of organizations around the world.</p>
<p>The door is open a crack, the wind is blowing, the post-American internet is upon us: a new, good internet that delivers all the technological self-determination of the old, good internet, and the ease of use of Web 2.0 so that our normie friends can use it, too.</p>
<p>And I can't wait for all of us to get to hang out there. It's gonna be <em>great</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <header>    </header> <hr> <section> <p>Like many other 90s styles coming back in fashion, I’ve been seeing those retro
<a href="https://indieweb.org/88x31" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">88x31</a> web buttons on more personal websites these days. What a throwback.
Naturally, I scoured the internet to find buttons to add to my footer (see
below). Since I couldn’t find a Game Boy one that I liked, obviously I had to
make my own.</p>
<p>There’s only one problem: I’m not patient (read: talented) enough to make the
art myself.</p>
<h2 id="the-concept"><a rel="nofollow" href="#the-concept">The Concept</a></h2>
<p>My idea was to use the boot animation from the Game Boy Color placed inside the
traditional grey frame. Something like this:</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://zakhary.dev/img/usr/8304eeab.png" alt="Mock-up of the web button">
  <figcaption>
    A rough mock-up of the web button.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Not too complicated, right? So you’d think.<span><label for="footnote-0fe45eb5"></label><span><span>Wait just a second. Surely it can’t be that hard to make the animation
if I already have the mock-up, right? Well, I kinda cheated and used the
final result to make that.</span></span></span></p>
<h2 id="animating"><a rel="nofollow" href="#animating">Animating</a></h2>
<p>First, we’ve got to find a way to export the animation from boot ROM. The
easiest way I could think of to do that was to play it in an emulator<span><label for="footnote-24570c6d"></label><span><span>Regrettably my emulator <a href="https://rugby.zakhary.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rugby</a> doesn’t (yet) support Game Boy Color,
so I used the fantastic <a href="https://sameboy.github.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SameBoy</a> for this next part.</span></span></span> and
save screenshots of each frame individually. Well, in order to do that we need a
way to stop the emulator at each frame. Thankfully, the emulator I used has
breakpoints.</p>
<p>So, where should those breakpoints go? Time for a quick crash course:</p>
<p>The animation is programmed into the Game Boy’s boot ROM in GBZ80 assembly. This
is proprietary code written by Nintendo that powers up the system and validates
the cartridge before handing off execution to the game. Thankfully, some smart
people have done the hard work of (1) dumping, (2) disassembling, and (3)
labelling the <a href="https://gist.github.com/drhelius/6063265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">boot ROM</a> for us.<span><label for="footnote-a3653881"></label><span><span>I feel pretty comfortable calling my use of the boot ROM in this
project “fair use.”</span></span></span></p>
<p>For each Game Boy frame, there’s a period of time where the LCD idles before
drawing the next frame. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">vblank</a>. Taking a look at the
disassembly, we can see where vblank occurs:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>; =============== S U B R O U T I N E =======================================</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>; Wait until LCD VBlank Interrupt is flagged.</span></span>
<span><span>;</span></span>
<span><span>; Input: None.</span></span>
<span><span>; Output: None.</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>Wait_for_next_VBLANK</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    push</span><span>    hl</span></span>
<span><span>    ld  hl, $FF0F</span></span>
<span><span>    res </span><span>0</span><span>, [hl]</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>_wait_vblank_loop</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    bit </span><span>0</span><span>, [hl]       </span><span>; wait until hardware sets the vblank flag (bit 0 of FF0F)</span></span>
<span><span>    jr  z, _wait_vblank_loop</span></span>
<span><span>    pop</span><span> hl</span></span>
<span><span>    ret</span></span>
<span><span>; End of function Wait_for_next_VBLANK</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Using the debugger, we can see that this function is called from the following
code:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sub_0291</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>    call</span><span>    Wait_for_next_VBLANK</span></span>
<span><span>    ; -- snip --</span></span></code></pre>
<p>As we can see from the generated label <code>sub_0291</code>, this block probably lives at
address <code>$0291</code>. Putting a breakpoint here and stepping into the function
reveals the address of <code>Wait_for_next_VBLANK</code> to be <code>$0211</code>. After a quick reset
and setting the breakpoint, we can step through each frame of the animation.</p>
<p>This next part was a bit tedious: I repeatedly <code>continue</code>d the debugger, taking
an emulator screenshot at each frame.<span><label for="footnote-03eebb5a"></label><span><span>Using <code>⌘S</code> in SameBoy will capture a screenshot using the emulated
LCD framebuffer. This will be at the true LCD resolution, completely
independent of my laptop’s display resolution.</span></span></span> Once that was done, I had 175
screenshots at 160x144 saved as PNGs on my desktop. Using some quick ✨
<code>magick</code><span><label for="footnote-d297ec0e"></label><span><span>If you haven’t heard of the CLI image processing tool
<a href="https://imagemagick.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ImageMagick</a>, I highly recommend checking it out.</span></span></span> ✨, I collected these into a GIF<span><label for="footnote-dc44e72d"></label><span><span>Pronounced /dʒɪf/.</span></span></span> with this command:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>magick</span><span> -delay</span><span> 1.6742706299</span><span> -loop</span><span> 0</span><span> *</span><span>.png</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>) </span><span>animation.gif</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Of note is the delay time, ~0.0167s<span><label for="footnote-836b8a8c"></label><span><span><code>70,224 [#/frame] ÷ 4,194,304 [#/sec] ~= 0.0167427 [sec/frame]</code></span></span></span>, and the zsh-ism <code>*.png(n)</code> to sort
the expanded glob.</p>
<p>Anyways, here’s what it looks like:</p>

<h2 id="making-art"><a rel="nofollow" href="#making-art">Making Art</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve <del>copied Nintendo’s homework</del> made our Game Boy animation, it’s
time to reshape it into an artistic web button masterpiece.</p>
<h3 id="cropping"><a rel="nofollow" href="#cropping">Cropping</a></h3>
<p>Next up we’ve got to crop the animation to the desired 88x31. Let’s load up the
GIF to see how big the logo is. I used <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Aseprite</a> for this, but really any
application that lets you count pixels in an image will do. Doing this, we see
the “Game Boy” text logo is… 127x22 pixels wide. Hmm. That’s too big to fit
into an 88x31 button, but I guess that makes sense considering the Game Boy
Color’s screen is 160x144 pixels. It’ll have to be scaled down later.</p>
<p>Measuring the logo’s starting location to be <code>(x: 16, y: 48)</code>, we can now crop
away. Cropping a GIF sounds like it should be a lot of work, but it can be
easily accomplished on the CLI with, you guessed it, <code>magick</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>magick</span><span> animation.gif</span><span> -crop</span><span> 127x22+16+48</span><span> +repage</span><span> cropped.gif</span></span></code></pre>

<h3 id="scaling"><a rel="nofollow" href="#scaling">Scaling</a></h3>
<p>The cropped logo needs to be scaled to fit into 88x31. Say it with me folks.

<p>This scales (resizes) the GIF to be 82 pixels wide while maintaining the aspect
ratio, the result being 82x14. I chose 82 pixels wide specifically since that’ll
allow us to fit for the next stage.</p>

<p>Several of the 88x31 buttons I found online have a common frame with a
2-pixel-wide border. It looks like this:</p>

<p>To apply this frame to the scaled animation, we’ll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Centre the scaled animation into a 88x31 space;</li>
<li>Fill in the newly added space with grey;</li>
<li>Add the border frame on top of the animation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you know the drill by now:</p>

<p>Wait, what’s that ugly white square doing there? Oh, right. The animation had a
white background. Gotta fix that I guess.</p>
<h3 id="fixing-that"><a rel="nofollow" href="#fixing-that">Fixing That</a></h3>
<p>This is actually quite straightforward. Removing the white background is easy,
although if we do it with what we currently have there ends up being undesirable
artifacts caused by the prior scaling.</p>

<p>The trick here is to replace the white background before scaling. Here’s also a
really great opportunity to fully show off how powerful ImageMagick’s transform
pipeline can be. Going back to our uncropped animation, we can apply all
previous steps at once like so.</p>

<h2 id="exorcism"><a rel="nofollow" href="#exorcism">Exorcism</a></h2>
<p>As we all know, the final stage of any good art project is excising tormented
apparitions from our glorious creation!</p>
<p>See that shadow of the logo that appears as it fades away? That’s called
ghosting, and is caused by the original animation’s fade going to white instead
of the grey we’ve chosen as our new background colour.</p>
<h3 id="remapping"><a rel="nofollow" href="#remapping">Remapping</a></h3>
<p>Fixing this is going to be a little more tricky than it was for the compression
artifacts above. In order to fix this, we’ll need remap the transition colours
so that the logo’s blue-to-white transition instead fades to grey.</p>
<p>To do this, we’ll first need a way to identify all those transition colours.
Extracting the frames of the animation will allow us to analyze their colours in
a histogram:</p>

<p>It’s not immediately obvious what we’re looking for here, but we can see that by
frame 164 there’s only one colour. That corresponds to the whiteout at the end
of the animation. Looking a few frames before, we consistently see 209 frames
helpfully labelled as grey, and 1560 frames in some other colour. Conspicuously,
that other colour only varies in red and green, but remains fully blue.</p>

<p>From this list, the logo fade transitions from <code>[#006BFF, #FFFFFF)</code>.<span><label for="footnote-d519cb5f"></label><span><span>This is a non-inclusive range.</span></span></span>
Since we’re updating the background colour to <code>#C0C0C0</code>, we’ll need a way to
modify the transition colours to instead fade to that shade of grey.
Functionally, for each colour we (1) compute how far along the transition we
are, then (2) use this value to re-compute an equivalent transition colour in
the desired fade range.</p>
<p>Here’s where I’ll admit my shame: by this point I was getting lazy and didn’t
feel like using my brain to write my own colour interpolation. So I turned to
the AI overlords to do this work for me.</p>

<p>Huh. This looks surprisingly correct. Adding in <code>#FFFFFF</code> to the original list

an additional sanity check, here are generated images of the palettes we intend

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main">

<p><em>Nov 27th, 2022</em></p>
<p>Recently Ben Hoyt <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/io-is-no-longer-the-bottleneck/">published a blog post</a> claiming that contrary to popular belief, I/O is not the bottleneck in typical programming interview problems such as counting word frequencies from a stream. Sequential read speed has come a long way, while CPU speed has stagnated.</p>
<p>Sequential reads are indeed incredibly fast. Using the same method as linked in Ben Hoyt's post, I'm getting <strong>1.6 GB/s</strong> sequential reads on a cold cache, and <strong>12.8 GB/s</strong> on a warm cache (best of five).</p>
<p>But it should be possible to count word frequencies at a speed of 1.6 GB/s even on a single thread, right?</p>
<p><em>(For the impatient: code is <a href="https://github.com/haampie/wc-avx2">available on GitHub</a>.)</em></p>
<h2>The optimized C implementation</h2>
<p>Ben Hoyt's blog refers to an <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/count-words/">earlier post</a> which includes a faster C version of the word frequency counter. I compiled <code>optimized.c</code> with GCC 12, using <code>-O3 -march=native</code> flags, and ran it on the 425MB input file (100 copies of the King James Version of the Bible).</p>

<p>The result was surprisingly bad:</p>

<pre>$ time ./optimized &lt; bible-100.txt &gt; /dev/null

real    0m1.525s
user    0m1.477s
sys     0m0.048s
</pre>

<p>That is only <strong>278 MB/s</strong> on warm cache.</p>

<h3>Vectorization</h3>
<p>Looking at the code I realized one of the hot loops had many branches, including an early exit, which prevents the compiler from vectorizing:</p>

<pre>for (; i &lt; num_process; i++) {
    char c = buf[i];
    if (c &lt;= ' ') {
        break;
    }
    <strong>if (c &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; c &lt;= 'Z') {
        c += ('a' - 'A');
        buf[i] = c;
    }</strong>
    hash *= FNV_PRIME;
    hash ^= (uint64_t)c;
}
</pre>

<p>My initial attempt to improve performance was to move this lowercase logic out of the loop, like so:</p>

<pre>for (int i = 0; i &lt; BUF_SIZE; ++i) {
    buf[i] = buf[i] &gt;= 'A' &amp;&amp; buf[i] &lt;= 'Z' ?  buf[i] - 'A' + 'a' : buf[i];
}
</pre>

<p>This simple change improved performance to <strong>330 MB/s</strong> (using clang for better vectorization). Funnily enough, just adding these 3 lines before the loop, without deleting the original code gives comparable speed; strictly more work, but branch prediction does its job. Still, it's about a factor 5 away from cold cache sequential read speed.</p>

<h2>Trying a simpler problem</h2>
<p>At this point I thought it was unlikely I could squeeze a lot of performance out of the word frequency counter. Sure, there are cache misses in the hash map, so maybe it could be optimized for better cache locality of common words. Or potentially short words can benefit from perfect hashing on the stack. But what will that give? Another 20%?</p>
<p>Instead, let's look at an informative baseline. Just count words without keeping track of frequencies; no tedious hash maps.</p>

<p>In fact there's a program for that: <code>wc -w</code>. Such a single-purpose tool must be fast, right?</p>

<pre>$ time wc -w &lt; bible-100.txt &gt; /dev/null 

real    0m1.758s
user    0m1.718s
sys     0m0.040s
</pre>

<p>Unexpectedly the performance is terrible... <strong>245.2 MB/s</strong>. Why? Well, the man page says it's doing a different thing. The Ben Hoyt code only splits on <code>' '</code> whitespace, whereas <code>wc</code> uses <code>' '</code>, <code>'\n'</code>, <code>'\t'</code>, ... and even locale specific characters.</p>

<h3>How fast can word count be?</h3>
<p>If the premise is that disk speed has caught up in the last decade, we should really be using new CPU features from that period. And that basically means: vectorize all the things. AVX2 is almost a decade old already. AVX-512 was available for the common people in 2017, but I'm on znver2, so I'll stick to AVX2.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the compiler has a hard time autovectorizing word count. Maybe that proves the point of Ben Hoyt: disks got orders of magnitude faster "for free", but modern compilers don't magically generate machine code orders of magnitude faster. It's just difficult to translate branchy scalar programs into vectorized machine code.</p>

<h3>Masks</h3>
<p>Part of word count can trivially be auto-vectorized: suppose for simplicity we have a register size of 128 bits, in which we can store 16 consecutive characters. It's easy to locate the whitespace by broadcasting it into a register ahead of time, and then doing a single <code>VPCMPEQB</code> comparsion operation:</p>
<pre>       | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 |
input: | h o w   m a n y   w o r d s   a | r e   h e r e ?
 mask: | 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 |
</pre>

<p>But after getting a mask in a vector register, how do you go about and count words? The only thing
I could think of is using a <strong>Move Byte Mask</strong> trick I've seen in <a href="https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/b850b14300f112c238debf441746ef9ff93e8dba/libc/intrin/strlen.c#L32-L42">Cosmopolitan libc's <code> strlen</code> implementation</a>. The relevant instruction <code>PMOVMSKB</code> moves the long bit mask into a 32 bit <code>int</code>, and then you do your usual bit tricks.</p>

<h3>Bit tricks</h3>
<p>What are the usual bit tricks? One great candidate is <strong>Find First Set</strong> or <code>ffs</code> in short — this is a great name given how tedious it is to get bit tricks right. This instruction can be used to iterate over set bits, like so:</p>

<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    int mask = 0b0100000100001000;
    int prev = 0;
    while (mask) {
        int curr = <strong>__builtin_ffs(mask);</strong>
        if (curr &gt; prev + 1)
            printf("Word start at %d\n", curr);
        prev = curr;
        if (curr == 32) <span>// don't ask, sigh.</span>
            break;
        <strong>mask = (mask &gt;&gt; curr) &lt;&lt; curr;</strong>
    }
}
</pre>
<p>It outputs the following, corresponding to the mask example above:</p>
<pre>Word start at 4
Word start at 9
Word start at 15
</pre>
<h3>Putting it together</h3>
<p>I ended up writing this code explicitly using <code>immintrin.h</code> which is an absolutely dreadful experience. Next time I'll use a high-level API (in the past I've had a lot of fun vectorizing things interactively in the Julia REPL with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaSIMD/VectorizationBase.jl">VectorizationBase.jl</a>). But at least I felt like I had some control over the generated machine code.</p>
<p>Using AVX2 with 256-bit registers, you need to align your data on 32 bits, which I did (of course not without messing it up first). I reserved 6 of the registers to hold all broadcasted whitespace characters. Then I explicitly unrolled the vectorized loop 4 times, so in every iteration we process 128 bytes of data.</p>
<p>It took an awful lot of time to fix the off-by-one bugs, but in the end I managed to get a working program, tested against a non-zero amount of text files on my computer:</p>
<pre>$ ./wc-avx2 &lt; bible-100.txt 
82113300
$ wc -w &lt; bible-100.txt 
82113300
</pre>
<p>So, how fast?!</p>
<pre>$ time ./wc-avx2 &lt; bible-100.txt 
82113300

real    0m0.227s
user    0m0.186s
sys     0m0.041s
</pre>
<p>That comes down to <strong>1.45 GB/s</strong> (on a warm cache).</p>
<p>Sigh. So hand-optimized, single-threaded word count is only getting about 11% of the sequential disk read speed. And on a cold cache?</p>
<pre>$ sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
$ time ./wc-avx2 &lt; bible-100.txt
82113300

real    0m0.395s
user    0m0.196s
sys     0m0.117s
</pre>
<p>Still more time in <em>user</em> than <em>sys</em> :(. So yeah, maybe the disk speed has caught up statement is indeed true.</p>

<p><em>The Future of Powering Electric Vehicles Is Here Today with Donut Lab Introducing New High-Performance Solid State Donut Batteries Ready for OEM Use Now and Powering All 2026 Model Verge Motorcycles On the Road in Q1 2026.</em></p>



<p>Always innovating and delivering new forms of electrification, Donut Lab shapes the future of mobility by relentlessly pushing the limits of electric vehicle performance while successfully bringing its technology to market as seen in Verge Motorcycles and other OEM brands across the global transportation sector. Now Donut Lab is proud to introduce the world’s first solid-state battery that is ready for use in OEM vehicle manufacturing. Donut Lab solid-state batteries will be placed immediately on the road, powering Verge Motorcycles’ current lineup, including the Verge TS Pro and Ultra.</p>



<p>“While the advantages are obvious, the future of solid state batteries has been a moving target constantly delayed when companies working in electrification are asked about when they will become a reality,” comments Donut Lab CEO <strong>Marko </strong><strong>Lehtimäki</strong>. “At Donut Lab, our answer on solid state batteries being ready for use in OEM production vehicles is now, today, not later. Donut Lab has engineered a new high performance solid state Donut Battery that can be scaled to major production volumes and seen now in real world use in the Verge Motorcycles bikes out on the road in Q1.”</p>



<p><strong>Out of this world performance</strong></p>



<p>Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery delivers 400 Wh/kg of energy density, enabling longer range, lighter structures, and unprecedented flexibility in vehicle and product design. It can be charged to<strong> </strong>full in just five minutes without limiting charging to 80%, and supports full discharge safely, repeatedly, and reliably.</p>



<p>Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, the Donut Battery experiences minimal capacity fade over its lifetime, with a design life of up to 100,000 cycles, offering practical longevity that far exceeds existing technologies. Safety is built in at the core: no flammable liquid electrolytes, no thermal runaway chains, and no metallic dendrites. This eliminates the root causes of battery fires, making the Donut Battery extremely safe and truly revolutionary.</p>



<p>Performance has been rigorously tested across extreme conditions. At –30°C, the battery retains over 99% of its capacity, and when heated to temperatures exceeding 100°C, it continues to retain over 99% capacity with no signs of ignition or degradation.</p>



<p>The Donut Lab solid state battery is made entirely from abundant, affordable, and geopolitically safe materials, does not rely on rare or sensitive elements, and demonstrates a lower cost than lithium-ion.</p>



<p>Like Donut Motors, the Donut Battery is versatile, offering unprecedented design freedom. It can be produced in custom sizes, voltages, and geometries, enabling structural integration and non-traditional formats like serving as the body of a drone or a vehicle chassis.</p>



<p>From microelectronics to defense, from drones to supercharging infrastructure, the Donut Battery is a universal, general-purpose platform, ready to power the next generation of technology.</p>



<p><strong>Origins</strong></p>



<p>From its founding, Donut Lab has focused on engineering new solutions for transportation that redefine what electric vehicles can achieve not in abstract theory, but in real-world performance, application, and production.</p>



<p>This vision for the future took flight with Donut Lab’s first innovation, the Donut Motor. Introduced as the world’s first in-wheel motor combining exceptional torque and battery power density within an ultra-lightweight design, the Donut Motor eliminates the need for traditional drivetrain components entirely. First unveiled at CES a year prior in 2025, the technology has since moved beyond demonstration into real vehicle usage with more than 200 OEMs actively engaged in development and integration of Donut Lab electric motors.</p>



<p>Now at CES 2026, Donut Lab takes another bold step forward into history-making innovation with the debut of the first solid state batteries now ready for major OEM scale volumes. With the same spirit that challenged the conventions of electrification in transportation and beyond last year, Donut Lab proudly introduces a breakthrough that will redefine what the industry believes is possible in battery technology. Until now, no production vehicles have operated with solid-state batteries and those promised for the future have come with significant compromises in performance, cost, and scalability.</p>



<p>With Verge Motorcycles bikes now using the company’s solid state battery technology in vehicles out on the road in use in Q1, Donut Lab changes that reality today. The company presents a no-compromise, all-solid-state battery designed for real production use by OEM that delivers performance, efficiency, and practicality without the unattractive trade-offs that have limited previous approaches. This major milestone marks another revolutionary moment in the evolution of electric vehicles and reinforces Donut Lab’s role as a catalyst for industry-wide transformation.</p>



<p>“When we first introduced the Donut Motor last year at CES, many didn’t believe it was possible until they saw the technology working out on the road and setting world records for performance. Now, with our all-solid-state Donut Battery, Donut Lab is doing the same. Donut Lab waited to announce our solid state battery breakthrough until the technology was fully tested, validated, and already operating in vehicles. As of today, these batteries are real, in production vehicles, and represent the future of electric mobility,” continues Donut Lab CEO Marko Lehtimäki.</p>



<p><strong>Donut Lab at CES: Showcasing the Future of Electrification in Transportation&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>By collaborating with a diverse range of partners and using these relationships as live case studies, Donut Lab demonstrates the versatility and impact of Donut Lab technology across multiple applications. Each partner showcases a different way solutions can be integrated, highlighting a growing series of products on the market powered by Donut Lab.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vergemotorcycles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Verge Motorcycles</strong></a></p>



<p>Now powered by Donut Lab’s all-solid-state battery, Verge Motorcycles is the world’s first production vehicle to feature this breakthrough technology. With Verge Motorcycles Donut Battery powered bikes on the road in Q1, the electric motorcycles can charge in less than 10 minutes, delivering up to 60 kilometers of combined range per minute of charging. The long-range version offers an impressive 600 kilometers on a single charge. Verge Motorcycles with the new battery are available for order today, with first deliveries in Q1 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.wattelectricvehicles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>WATTEV</strong></a></p>



<p>WATT Electric Vehicles partners with Donut Lab to deliver an ultra-lightweight, modular EV platform that combines Donut Motors and Donut Lab’s battery technology. The platform features an aluminum skateboard architecture with fully integrated motors, inverters, software, and battery, offering a versatile modular design that can support multiple vehicle types. A functional version of the skateboard will be debuted at CES 2026.</p>



<p><a href="https://covapower.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Cova Power Smart Trailer</strong></a></p>



<p>Cova Power Smart Trailer is the result of a joint venture between Ahola Group and Donut Lab, delivering series-production smart trailers powered by Donut in-wheel motors, Donut Battery, and Donut Platform software. The trailers achieve up to 54% reduction in diesel consumption and up to 30% reduction in total energy use, while improving traction, stability, and safety even in demanding conditions.</p>



<p><a href="https://esoxgroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>ESOX Group</strong></a></p>



<p>In partnership with ESOX Group, Donut Lab’s battery is being deployed in defense-grade platforms where safety, reliability, and performance under extreme conditions are non-negotiable. Current projects in development include a four-wheel tactical buggy and a next-generation drone platform, showcasing the battery’s versatility and robustness in a variety of applications.&nbsp;</p>

<article id="post-16752" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="">
	<div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Exactly one year ago, Sam Altman <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/reflections">​made a bold prediction​</a>: “We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents ‘join the workforce’ and materially change the output of companies.” Soon after, OpenAI’s Chief Product Officer, Kevin Weil, elaborated on this claim when he stated in an interview that 2025 would be the year “that we go from ChatGPT being this super smart thing…to ChatGPT doing things in the real world for you.” He provided examples, such as filling out paperwork and booking hotel rooms. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/davos-2025-ai-agents">​An Axios article covering Weil’s remarks​</a> provided a blunt summary: “2025 is the year of AI agents.”</p>



<p>These claims mattered. A chatbot can summarize text or directly answer questions, but in theory, an agent can tackle much more complicated tasks that require multiple steps and decisions along the way. When Altman talked about these systems joining the workforce, he meant it. He envisioned a world in which you assign projects to an agent in the same way you might to a human employee. The often-predicted future in which AI dominates our lives requires something like agent technology to be realized.</p>



<p>The industry had reason to be optimistic that 2025 would prove pivotal. In previous years, AI agents like Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex had become impressively adept at tackling multi-step computer programming problems. It seemed natural that this same skill might easily generalize to other types of tasks. Mark Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, became so enthusiastic about these possibilities that early in 2025, he claimed that AI agents would imminently unleash a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2025/05/09/why-ai-agents-will-trigger-the-biggest-workplace-revolution-in-25-years/">​“digital labor revolution”​</a> worth <em>trillions</em> of dollars.</p>



<p>But here’s the thing: none of that ended up happening.</p>



<p>As I report in my most recent <em>New Yorker</em> article, titled <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2025-in-review/why-ai-didnt-transform-our-lives-in-2025">​“Why A.I. Didn’t Transform Our Lives in 2025,”​</a> AI agents failed to live up to their hype. We didn’t end up with the equivalent of Claude Code or Codex for other types of work. And the products that were released, such as ChatGPT Agent, fell laughably short of being ready to take over major parts of our jobs. (In one example I cite in my article, ChatGPT Agent spends fourteen minutes futilely trying to select a value from a drop-down menu on a real estate website.)</p>



<p>Silicon Valley skeptic Gary Marcus told me that the underlying technology powering these agents – the same large language models used by chatbots – would never be capable of delivering on these promises. “They’re building clumsy tools on top of clumsy tools,” he said. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy implicitly agreed when he said, during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlVnGXEzFow">​a recent appearance on the <em>Dwarkesh Podcast</em>​</a>, that there had been “overpredictions going on in the industry,” before then adding: “In my mind, this is really a lot more accurately described as the Decade of the Agent.”</p>



<p>Which is all to say, we actually don’t know how to build the digital employees that we were told would start arriving in 2025.</p>



<p>To find out more about <em>why</em> 2025 failed to become the Year of the AI Agent, I recommend reading <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/2025-in-review/why-ai-didnt-transform-our-lives-in-2025">​my full <em>New Yorker</em> piece​</a>. But for now, I want to emphasize a broader point: I’m hoping 2026 will be the year we stop caring about what people <em>believe</em> AI might do, and instead start reacting to its real, present capabilities.</p>



<p>For example, last week, Sal Kahn wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/27/opinion/artificial-intelligence-jobs-worker-training.html">​a <em>New York Times</em> op-ed​</a> in which he said, “I believe artificial intelligence will displace workers at a scale many people don’t yet realize.” The standard reaction would be to fret about this scary possibility. But what if we instead responded: <em>says who? </em>The actual examples Kahn provides, which include someone telling him that A.I. agents are “capable” of replacing 80% of his call center employees, or Waymo’s incredibly slow and costly process of hand-mapping cities to deploy self-driving cars, are hardly harbingers of general economic devastation.</p>



<p>So, this is how I’m thinking about AI in 2026. <em>Enough of the predictions</em>. I’m done reacting to hypotheticals propped up by vibes. The impacts of the technologies that already exist are already more than enough to concern us for now…</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
	
	
	
	
	
	<p>For years, I thought of Google as a <strong>trustworthy helper on the Web</strong>. Especially where it mattered most, removing pirated copies of my books from Google search results. After <a href="https://books.perishablepress.com/" title="Perishable Press Books">publishing a new book</a>, I would monitor the search results and file a <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> notice with Google whenever the inevitable <strong>pirated copies of my book</strong> were listed. Google always was very helpful in this regard, swiftly removing any pirated books <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">asap</abbr>. No hassle, no hoops, just immediate and direct relief from Google.</p>

<h3>Welcome to 2026..</h3>
<p>Recently, I asked Google to remove a pirated copy of my book from their search index. As usual, I filled out the obligatory <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> report and sent it in, hopeful that it was just a matter of time before the <strong>copyright infringement</strong> was dealt with by the trustworthy and <strong>very capable</strong> Google search team.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not what happened. Instead of simply de-indexing the search result, like they do for so many other items, Google <strong>refused to acknowledge</strong> that I was the author of the book. After receiving my <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> complaint, they replied:</p>
<p>We are unsure whether you are authorized to submit a copyright removal request for the content in question. Only the copyright owner or their authorized representative can submit a copyright removal request. Please note that you could be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) if you falsely claim that content is copyright infringing. […]</p>
<p>Okay, so ..<strong>not the response I was hoping for</strong>.. basically a complete denial of my identity and thinly veiled threat of legal action for having the audacity to report the pirated content in the first place. But no problem, maybe they have a new process for validating <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> requests. So I replied back <abbr title="As Soon As Possible">asap</abbr> <strong>asking how to prove my identity</strong>:</p>
<p>Yes it is me, Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book in question. Please let me know if any further information is needed, thank you.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect that email to do much, other than prompt Google to <strong>explain how to prove my identity</strong>, so that they would take action and stop promoting the pirated copy of my book in their search results. After a couple more days of waiting, The Google Team replied back:</p>
<p>It is unclear to us how you came to own the copyright for the content in question, because you do not appear to be the creator of the content. […] please explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership.</p>
<p>Without acknowledging my previous reply regarding identity, now they are questioning my copyright ownership. Without explaining <strong>how</strong> to prove copyright ownership, they simply throw another hurdle at me, asking me to “explain further the basis for your claim of copyright ownership”. At this point, I am stressed, exhausted, and feeling very frustrated. <strong>Where was the friendly Google from days past</strong>?</p>
<h3>Holding out hope..</h3>
<p>Okay I thought, gotta really step this up and prove to The Google Team that I am who I claim, and that <strong>I am in fact the author of the book and thus own the copyright</strong>. But I wasn’t sure how to do this, because again they did not explain “how” to do so. Did they want a scan of my driver’s license? Blood sample? <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbr> test results? I mean, why the mystery? If some sort of identity or proof is required for Google to take action, shouldn’t it have been required on the DMCA form?</p>
<p><strong>Feeling frustrated and stressed</strong> about the apparent run-around and lack of concern, I replied back with plenty of evidence and clues that yes, I am Jeff Starr, and yes, the book belongs to me, and thus I own the copyright. <em>Message truncated for clarity.</em></p>
<div>
<p>My name is Jeff Starr. I am the author of the book […]. As explained in the filed report, Google is promoting copyright infringement of my book in its search results.</p>
<p>How can I prove my identity? Please explain what I need to do in order to get help with this copyright infringement. Surely there must be some protocol for proving identity/ownership, please let me know what that is, what are your requirements for taking action against someone who is violating my copyright?</p>
<p>If it helps, here are my book-related websites, which are all owned and authored by me, Jeff Starr: [..List of like five websites, including the site for the pirated book..]</p>
<p>You can verify that these sites are owned by me, simply check my account via Google Search Console, where I have verified that I am the owner for each of the above sites. My Search Console is associated with this same email account from which I am replying to your email. […]</p>
<p>I am a well-known author and web developer in the WordPress community. You can find me on social media, I have a list of my social-media channels pinned on my X account (first displayed post): https://x.com/perishable</p>
<p>The reported copyright infringement is costing me money and time. I am very frustrated and stressed because of Google’s apparent lack of concern. Please help, let me know what you need from me in order to remove the stolen book from your search results.</p>
</div>
<p>At this point, I was feeling ignored and betrayed by Google, who for many years <strong>proved a trusted ally</strong>. Apparently something has changed, as the friendly corporate giant who once helped small publishers and content creators now <strong>refused to even acknowledge</strong> their existence. As if, surely you could not be who you claim, an author and small book publisher looking for our help. After all, <strong>We are Google</strong> — a massive organization that uses your content to fill our search results and pay our salaries.</p>
<h3>Heartbroken..</h3>
<p>Even after spending much time and heartache trying to get Google’s help, I held out hope. Hope that Google was still the <strong>benevolent helper</strong> that I once knew, years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong> after two more days of nervous anticipation, Google finally replied to my lengthy probably desperate sounding email that was full of personal details and proofs of my identity and copyright ownership. A small surge of adrenaline as I clicked to hear back from The Google Team (emphasis mine):</p>
<div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>At this time, <strong>Google has decided not to take action</strong> on the following URLs: […]</p>
<p>We encourage you to resolve any disputes directly with the owner of the website in question. Visit https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109 to learn how to contact a site’s webmaster and request a change. If you pursue legal action against this site that results in the removal of the material, our search results will display this change after we next crawl the site.</p>
<p>If the webmaster makes these changes and you need us to refresh outdated content, please submit your request using our Refresh Outdated Content Tool.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>The Google Team</p>
</div>
<p><strong>And there it was</strong>. A simple <abbr title="Digital Millennium Copyright Act">DMCA</abbr> request trying to remove copyright infringement from search results completely and utterly <strong>shrugged off by Google</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Immediately my heart sank</strong>. And I knew that something had changed at Google’s core. The friendly corporate giant no longer would even deign to <strong>consider</strong> cries for help from the little guy. The little guy being <em>me</em>, the little guy with a broken heart. </p>

                        <p>The Low Orbit Security Radar is a weekly security newsletter from an offensive practitioner's perspective. One idea, curated news, and links worth your time.   </p><h2 id="news-there-were-bgp-anomalies-during-the-venezuela-blackout">News: There Were BGP Anomalies During The Venezuela Blackout</h2><hr><p>When watching the situation in Venezuela unfold, the phrase "<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-venezuela-cyber-operation-maduro-00709816?utm_campaign=Issue:+2026-01-05+Cybersecurity+Dive+[issue:80342]&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_term=Cybersecurity+Dive">It was dark, the lights of Caracas were largely turned off due to a certain expertise that we have</a>" caught my attention. I do not wish to comment on the geopolitical situation other than to provide some insights within my area of competency, specifically, offensive security. </p><p>During a press conference, <a href="https://www.af.mil/About-Us/Biographies/Display/Article/2942633/john-d-caine/?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">General John D. Caine</a> stated: "<a href="https://youtu.be/qe2RuYI8KZY?si=4-MTUpS350q7LxZx&amp;t=336&amp;ref=loworbitsecurity.com">As they approached Venezuelan shores the United States began layering different effects provided by SPACECOM, CYBERCOM, and other members of the inter-agency to create a pathway</a>". Cyber operations preceding traditional military actions have become a common pattern so I started digging into the reported internet outages. </p><p><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">BGP</a> is the first thing that comes to mind. It's a protocol used by routers to determine what path data takes to get to it's destination, it does this by exchanging routing information between Autonomous Systems. It is also <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">notoriously insecure</a> and much of the data about BGP is collected in public datasets. Every major network has an Autonomous System Number or ASN. CANTV (<a href="https://ipinfo.io/AS8048?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">AS8048</a>) is Venezuela's state-owned telecom, so that's the obvious place to start.</p><p><a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as8048?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">Cloudflare Radar's route leak data</a> for AS8048 on January 2nd had some interesting anomalies: 8 prefixes (blocks of IP addresses) were being routed through CANTV, with Sparkle (an Italian transit provider) and GlobeNet (a Colombian carrier) in the Autonomous System (AS) path. The AS path is essentially the list of networks traffic passes through to reach its destination. CANTV was in a path it is not typically a part of.</p><figure><img src="https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/2026/01/image-5.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1395" height="1118" srcset="https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-5.png 600w, https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-5.png 1000w, https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/2026/01/image-5.png 1395w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There was also a noticeable spike in BGP announcements in the days leading up to the events and a drastic dip in the "Announced IP Address Space" according to the same <a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/as8048?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">Cloudflare Radar</a> data, although it's unclear what this indicates.</p><figure><img src="https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/2026/01/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1422" height="741" srcset="https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/image-4.png 600w, https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/image-4.png 1000w, https://loworbitsecurity.com/content/images/2026/01/image-4.png 1422w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Notably, Sparkle is one of the transit providers in the AS path <a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">listed as "unsafe" on isbgpsafeyet.com</a>, meaning they don't implement some BGP security features such as <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">RPKI filtering</a>.</p><p>Cloudflare shows that a leak happened, but not the actual network prefixes.

<p>When BGP traffic is being sent from point A to point B, it can be rerouted through a point C. If you control point C, even for a few hours, you can theoretically collect vast amounts of intelligence that would be very useful for government entities. The CANTV AS8048 being prepended to the AS path 10 times means there the traffic would not prioritize this route through AS8048, perhaps that was the goal? There are many unanswered questions. </p><p>Regardless of the actual goal, there were undoubtedly some BGP shenanigans happening during this time frame. There is a lot of data publicly available that is worth a much deeper dive to understand exactly what happened.</p><h2 id="caught-my-eye">Caught My Eye</h2><ul><li><a href="https://zkorman.com/posts/cyberdev-mcp/11?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">MCP Security: Your AI's Prompts, Reasoning, and Secrets Are at Risk</a>: A deepdive demonstrating how malicious MCP servers can exfiltrate prompts, reasoning, and .env files.</li><li><a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/canceledbookdeal.html?ref=loworbitsecurity.com">I Canceled My Book Deal</a>: A professor walks away from a traditional publishing contract after the publisher pushed for AI integration, offered low royalties, and wanted to strip personality from the content.

And the Department of War — and the American people -  expect justice," Hegseth wrote in his statement on X.</p><p>Hegseth said the department had initiated retirement-grade determination proceedings, where a reduction in Kelly's retired grade would result in a reduction in retired pay.</p><p>"If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn't get it," Kelly wrote on X on Monday. </p><p>"I will fight this with everything I've got - not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don't get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government."</p><p>The controversy stems from a video released last November where Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers who had also served in the military or intelligence told US service members that they "can refuse illegal orders".</p><p>It was released amid rising questions of legality regarding American strikes on alleged narco-trafficking boats off the coast of South America. </p><p>Kelly says in the video: "Our laws are clear. You can refuse illegal orders."</p><p>"Like us, you all swore an oath to protect and defend this constitution. Right now, the threats coming to our constitution aren't just coming from abroad but from right here at home."</p><p>Trump reacted to the video in a series of  Truth Social posts, accusing the lawmakers of "SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL".</p><p>Shortly after, the Trump administration announced it was opening a review of Kelly's conduct under military law. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Kelly, a highly decorated retired Navy captain, who served for more than two decades and deployed multiple times, then responded saying: "If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won't work."</p><p>Experts say even though Kelly retired from the military, he is still subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) - a federal law enacted by Congress in 1951 that subjects members of the military to a special set of rules.</p><p>But legal analysts have questioned the Pentagon's authority to punish a sitting member of Congress for political speech, though the department maintains retired officers remain subject to certain aspects.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>No one knows how X plans to purge bad prompters</h2>
<p>While some users are focused on how X can hold users responsible for Grok’s outputs when X is the one training the model, others are questioning how exactly X plans to moderate illegal content that Grok seems capable of generating.</p>
<p>X is so far more transparent about how it moderates CSAM posted to the platform. Last September, X Safety <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1971261149229232566">reported</a> that it has “a zero tolerance policy towards CSAM content,” the majority of which is “automatically” detected using proprietary hash technology to proactively flag known CSAM.</p>
<p>Under this system, more than 4.5 million accounts were suspended last year, and X reported “hundreds of thousands” of images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). The next month, X Head of Safety Kylie McRoberts <a href="https://x.com/kyliem/status/1983929631838499102">confirmed</a> that “in 2024, 309 reports made by X to NCMEC led to arrests and subsequent convictions in 10 cases,” and in the first half of 2025, “170 reports led to arrests.”</p>
<p>“When we identify apparent CSAM material, we act swiftly, and in the majority of cases permanently suspend the account which automatically removes the content from our platform,” X Safety said. “We then report the account to the NCMEC, which works with law enforcement globally—including in the UK—to pursue justice and protect children.”</p>
<p>At that time, X promised to “remain steadfast” in its “mission to eradicate CSAM,” but if left unchecked, Grok’s harmful outputs risk creating new kinds of CSAM that this system wouldn’t automatically detect. On X, some users suggested the platform should increase reporting mechanisms to help flag potentially illegal Grok outputs.</p>
<p>Another troublingly vague aspect of X Safety’s response is the definitions that X is using for illegal content or CSAM, some X users suggested. Across the platform, not everybody agrees on what’s harmful. Some critics are disturbed by Grok generating bikini images that sexualize public figures, including doctors or lawyers, without their consent, while others, including Musk, consider making bikini images to be a joke.</p>
<p>Where exactly X draws the line on AI-generated CSAM could determine whether images are quickly removed or whether repeat offenders are detected and suspended. Any accounts or content left unchecked could potentially traumatize real kids whose images may be used to prompt Grok. And if Grok should ever be used to flood the Internet with fake CSAM, recent history suggests <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/surge-of-fake-ai-child-sex-images-thwarts-investigations-into-real-child-abuse/">that it could make it harder for law enforcement to investigate real child abuse</a> cases.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p><em><span>Hi there! My name is Tom Blakely, I’m a federal judicial law clerk and attorney. I previously worked in big law and the United States Department of Justice. You might remember me from last year, when I wrote about the US v. Google ad tech antitrust trial at </span><a href="https://www.bigtechontrial.com/" rel="">Big Tech on Trial</a><span>. I’m excited to be writing a guest piece for BIG, this time on a particular competition problem I (and nearly every lawyer) deals with on a daily basis: the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly.</span></em></p><p>The law in America does not belong to lawyers, it belongs to all of us. As citizens, we must be able to read the law, understand it, obey it, and bring complaints against those who wrong us. That is the basis for a coherent political order, and why the rule of law is such a foundational aspect of a democratic system. Moreover, it would be hard to find a technological era more suited to the democratization of law than the one we’re in today. The computer lets anyone query instantly, the internet lets anyone do it from anywhere, and generative artificial intelligence can decipher and explain complex legal questions if it has access to credible databases.</p><p><span>And yet, today, two powerful companies dominate and restrain access to key aspects of our legal order, from case opinions to legislative history. To give you a sense of what I mean, Lexis, one of two dominant legal research platforms, </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/terms/21/pricing.page" rel="">charges up to $469</a><span> for a single search. That’s the equivalent of a Google query, for almost $500. Moreover, beyond LexisNexis and its rival Westlaw, the Federal judiciary itself has used its privileged position to charge high fees for court records that should be available to all. Today, the law is hidden behind paywalls.</span></p><p>But it wasn’t always this way. </p><p>In this piece, I’m going to explain how and why America keeps the law from its citizens, and what we can do about it.</p><p><strong>The Origins of Legal Research</strong></p><p>The stereotype of a lawyer’s office was traditionally that of a well-manicured desk, with ornate and intimidating shelves of books somewhere in the background. And there’s a reason for the imagined massive quantity of books. The practice of law in the United States relies on them. </p><p>We use a system that came from England, called the common law tradition. In that system, there is the legal rule that is written down, known as statute. But then there is also a lot of interpretation of that statute, through cases. And those interpretations are often binding. To know what the law is beyond what statutes say, you must research the case law.</p><p><span>U.S. federal courts publish cases in “Federal Reporters” and each case is identified by a case cite. An example of what this looks like would be “</span><em>United States v. Alcoa</em><span>, 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945).” Prior to today’s day and age, to read this case, you would have to physically go to a law library, find the 148</span><sup>th</sup><span> print volume of the 2nd Series of the Federal Reporter (what the “148 F.2d” stands for) on the shelf, and turn to the 416</span><sup>th</sup><span> page to read the 1945 opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in United States v. Aluminum Co. of America (Alcoa).</span></p><p><span>It is a cumbersome if necessary system, and the early companies in the space made it easier to manage. In the late 1800s, the West Publishing Company was founded to meet the </span><a href="https://www.lawbookexchange.com/pages/books/55686/john-b-west-w-e-butler-m-h-hoeflich/the-syllabi-genesis-of-the-national-reporter-system" rel="">pressing need</a><span> in the American legal profession for timely and accessible print compilations of the latest court decisions.</span></p><p><span>In the early days of West, courts produced typewritten and printed slip opinions that would be made available to the company and the public in limited supply and through a </span><a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/spotlight-judicial-history/reporting-decisions" rel="">patchwork of processes</a><span> that varied greatly from court to court. Some courts hired people whose job it was to report opinions. Others did not. Some judges even tried to keep track of their prior opinions on their own. West responded to this problem by collecting and publishing opinions in bound volumes, originally only in Minnesota state courts but eventually expanding to courts nationwide.</span></p><p><span>When it started its business, West would first </span><a href="https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6000&amp;context=flr" rel="">provide advance sheets</a><span> and slip opinions, printed initially in paperback. West would then </span><a href="https://www.fjc.gov/history/spotlight-judicial-history/reporting-decisions" rel="">format and collate them</a><span> by adding syllabi, headnotes, and its proprietary system of page numbers and distribute them through the reporters it published and sold throughout the country.</span></p><p>Over time, West developed two complementary systems that would become the foundation of the legal information industry for the next century: the National Reporter System and the Key Number system.</p><p><span>The National Reporter System (NRS) is comprised of regionally organized reporters covering published decisions across state and federal courts. The NRS created a comprehensive, privately operated official reference system that lawyers and courts could cite to uniformly, across all U.S. jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions </span><a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/1888/cite/27/pdf" rel="">entered into contracts</a><span> with West to be their official publisher.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png" width="1152" height="920" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:920,&quot;width&quot;:1152,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:195173,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/183002743?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yPNE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa12d7b2d-3c6e-4d69-a075-40772d1bff12_1152x920.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>West’s Key Number System on the other hand, was </span><a href="https://guides.law.stanford.edu/cases/keynumbersystem" rel="">curated by West’s attorney-editors</a><span>, who summarized and organized key legal points and opinions into headnotes, assigned them a topic and Key Number, and then compiled these headnotes into digests. This system gave West a sort of taxonomical monopoly over U.S. case law, since all research paths began with West’s system of Key Numbers and pagination, and ended in its reporters.</span></p><p>West also published Black’s Law Dictionary and the “U.S. Code Annotated” (USCA). The USCA, much like West’s case law, was essentially a copy of all federal statutes on the books with annotations added, organized and formatted into bound volumes that West sold.</p><p><span>But throughout most of the 1900s, West was not the only participant in the market for legal information. The Shephard’s Company was a critical provider of citation services. Shephard’s offered lawyers time saving lists of cases citing to prior case law, so they could easily and quickly determine if decisions had been overturned or affirmed later on down the line. The term “Shephardization,” which is the process of analyzing what case law is still “good law” by reviewing later judicial treatments of prior decisions, got its name from that firm. In addition, The Michie Company was a leading publisher of state law, and Matthew Bender published </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/community/insights/legal/law-books/b/law-books/posts/135-years-of-matthew-bender-publishing-what-makes-matthew-bender-an-industry-standard" rel="">famed legal treatises</a><span> like Collier on Bankruptcy and Moore’s Federal Practice.</span></p><p><span>Lawyers Cooperative Publishing was another keystone of the “secondary” market, producing secondary source titles </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jurisprudence" rel="">like American Jurisprudence</a><span>, which synthesized various areas of the law for practitioners. Other market participants, like Callaghan &amp; Company, Clark Boardman, and Bancroft Whitney, provided specialty treatises or focused on certain jurisdictions. Research Institute of America (RIA) was another such publisher, </span><a href="https://www.loc.gov/flicc/svcdir/ri.html" rel="">focusing on tax, auditing, and finance</a><span>. Commerce Clearinghouse (commonly known as CCH) </span><a href="https://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupname?key=Commerce%20Clearing%20House" rel="">specialized in the niche</a><span> of labor and regulatory law. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Law_Reports" rel="">American Law Reports (ALR)</a><span> were popular, high-quality, and in-depth reference articles on various legal topics, and were another institution of 20</span><sup>th</sup><span> century legal publishing. All of these, with the exception of CCH (which would later be acquired by Dutch information services giant Wolters Kluwer) would eventually get acquired by West.</span></p><p><strong>The Computer Age Changes the Game</strong></p><p><span>In 1977, there were about </span><a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https://law.lclark.edu/live/files/9585-lcb104arewapdf___.YzJ1OmFlbHBlY29ub21pY2xpYmVydGllczpjOm86MWQ1YjZmMTM2ODJhNTgzNWVkNjc4MWFmMDQxYjU1NDM6Nzo5NGFlOmRkYjc0ZTczZWVhNTliYmJhZmQ5MGQyN2ZmMGQ3OWY3OTU0OGNlZTcxZGUxZWU5Y2Q3OTM2YzAyZWU3NDRjMjE6aDpUOkY" rel="">23 legal publishers</a><span> of considerable size, each separately owned.</span></p><p>In the 1970s, universities, the government, and large organizations were beginning to use computers more widely. Law libraries were becoming burdened with cumbersome case texts that rapidly became obsolete with the passage of time, as new case law was created and old case law was overturned or supplanted.</p><p>Mead Data Central, an Ohio company, saw a system ripe for technological innovation. The company launched Lexis, which put serialized case texts into a searchable electronic database. As the first computer-operated legal research system, Lexis changed the game. West created its own computer service, Westlaw, shortly after.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, The Thomson Corporation, a large Canadian publisher, began buying up an extensive series of smaller publishers in the late 1970s—few of whom are recognizable household names. But Thomson, which had been founded as a newspaper company but had been moving aggressively into the business information industry of the day, had built itself into a powerhouse that directly competed with West. West and Thomson published the only two comprehensive legal encyclopedias, the only two prominent legal dictionaries, and the two most important insurance law treatises. Thomson also held official state reporter contracts that were </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/case-document/file/513281/dl" rel="">more limited than West’s</a><span>, including with California, Washington, and Wisconsin.</span></p><p>Lexis actually licensed content from Thomson in order to compete against West in the electronic legal research market that Lexis had pioneered.</p><p><strong>West’s Page Number Monopoly Erodes and an M&amp;A Spree Begins</strong></p><p><span>Lexis and Westlaw </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/616/1571/1811369/" rel="">came into legal conflict</a><span> in the 1980s—over Lexis’ appropriation of West’s vaunted page number system. Page numbers are the heart and soul of legal citation, and up until the end of the 20</span><sup>th</sup><span> century, comprised much of the engine of West’s business model. While court cases are technically in the public domain, by presiding over the National Reporter System and its proprietary page numbers, in an industry that runs on precise citation to authority, West had effectively built a moat around itself.</span></p><p>While theoretically anyone could mass publish court opinions, without West’s authoritative page numbers, any such reporter would be mostly useless.</p><p><span>Prior to 1991, U.S. copyright law actually held that West’s business of putting page numbers over compendiums of public domain court cases was eligible for copyright protection, and that Lexis, by using West’s page numbers, had </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/799/1219/117890/" rel="">committed copyright infringement</a><span>. It seems strange today to think that merely adding page numbers and minor edits to public records was sufficient to create a work eligible for copyright protection, but this was the law of the land at the time.</span></p><p>Pagination presented an enormous source of leverage for West. Because the Bluebook (the citation stylebook for lawyers), court rules, and nearly all fora of legal writing require keyed pinpoint citations to page numbers in official reporters (in other words, West’s reporters), West had the market cornered.</p><p><span>But after the Supreme Court’s decision in </span><em><a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/499/340/" rel="">Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co</a><span>.</span></em><span>, in 1991, which found that merely publishing compilations of non-original records (in that case phone books but in West’s case, court cases) is not protected by copyright, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York </span><a href="https://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol13/13_1_AR/13-berkeley-tech-l-j-0083-0100.pdf" rel="">would later hold</a><span>, applying </span><em>Feist</em><span>, that the changes West made to the cases it compiled were “trivial” under the </span><em>Feist</em><span> standard, and therefore no longer subject to copyright protection.</span></p><p><span>Two former competitors to West, Matthew Bender (discussed above) and HyperLaw (an early entrant in the market for legal technology that produced CD-ROMs of court cases) brought suit against West. The </span><a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/158/693/544892/" rel="">Second Circuit ruled</a><span> in November 1998 that West’s page numbers “did not entail even a modicum of creativity” and as such were fair game for rivals to cross-reference.</span></p><p><span>This is key for many reasons. As the quasi-official publisher of American judicial opinions, West’s page numbering, at least to a certain extent, was as much of its business as the ho-hum task of compiling and printing the decisions themselves. If competitors could reference West’s page numbers, it represented a substantial loss of a main proprietary component of West’s business model. It is also key as the timing of the </span><em>Feist</em><span> decision coincided with the commencement of, as detailed below, a decade of mergers and acquisitions that, by the 2000s, would leave two main market participants left standing—Westlaw and Lexis. The 1991 </span><em>Feist</em><span> ruling was the starting gun.</span></p><p><span>In 1994, Reed Elsevier, a British information services conglomerate, </span><a href="https://eu.recordnet.com/story/news/1994/12/01/reed-elsevier-buys-mead-data/50868349007/" rel="">beat out Thomson to acquire Lexis</a><span> and its parent company.</span></p><p>Thomson then moved on to seeking to acquire West, kicking off an extraordinary wave of mergers and acquisitions that is breathtaking not only for the scale of consolidation that occurred, but gory political machinations surrounding it.</p><p><strong>The Thomson-West Acquisition is Allowed Under a Cloud of Corruption and the Lexis-West Duopoly is Born</strong></p><p><span>These facts are primarily reported in (and adapted below from) the 2009 book “</span><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/303170/free-the-market-by-gary-l-reback/" rel="">Free the Market!: Why Only Government Can Keep the Marketplace Competitive</a><span>” by Gary Reback, a famed antitrust litigator well known for his role in spearheading the efforts that lead to the antitrust suit against Microsoft in the 1990s, and who also represented Lexis at the time.</span></p><p>Thomson’s proposed acquisition of West prompted outrage, with state bar associations, news outlets, law librarians, and public interest groups sounding the alarm on how the inevitable and astronomical increase in legal research fees that would ensue would raise the cost of legal services.</p><p>Despite the antitrust problem of one company buying its only significant publishing competitor, and despite Reback’s zealous advocacy on behalf of Lexis, the deal somehow sailed through the Justice Department without challenge.</p><p>Reback explains in his book that using nearly any approach to analyze the anticompetitive effects of the proposed Thomson/West acquisition that was allowed by the then current DOJ/FTC merger guidelines would have condemned the tie up. In other words, on the merits, there is simply no way this merger should have gone through.</p><p>Reback details receiving a call one morning from a CNN reporter, seeking his comment on a story they were working on, that the former owner of West pledged more than $150,000 in campaign contributions to Democrats while the Thomson deal was pending approval from Bill Clinton’s Justice Department.</p><p>One does not need to be much of a cynic to connect the dots between these backroom political dealings on the one hand, and how the merger seemed to glide through regulators—against the balance of the law—on the other.</p><p>Reback goes on:</p><blockquote><p>It is [not] clear whether the government lawyers ever stepped back to assess realistically whether combining the only two legal research systems would leave the industry without a challenger to West-Thomson that could offer a fully integrated set of products.</p><p>Instead, the division’s antitrust review focused on analysis of the markets for particular books. “A treatise on torts is not a substitute for a treatise on contracts,” one of [Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Anne] Bingaman’s deputies told The American Lawyer. Journalist John Morris drew a more telling conclusion: “In its microanalysis of competition, the government appears to have become obsessed with competing seedlings and overlooked how the giants of the forest can block out the light.”</p><p>The Antitrust Division could not have missed the issue. Legal newspapers wrote editorials about it. Law librarians publicly criticized the deal in bar publications, filed written comments with the government, and demanded a face-to-face meeting with division lawyers.</p><p>A hearing was convened in 1992 at which a senior Thomson executive testified that West’s monopoly position in the legal publishing industry “has forced librarians and others to pay tens of millions in monopoly charges for access to legal texts, and has deprived users of the improved choices, quality and timeliness that competition could have provided.”</p></blockquote><p>To satisfy antitrust enforcers of the day, and get the West-Thomson deal across the finish line, Thomson merely had to offer to sell an agreed list of its publications, and license the use of West’s page numbering to other companies, which realistically meant only Lexis. No small publisher or other prospective market participant could afford the rates. In fact, the agreed sale of the electronic citation tool Thomson used was made to none other than Lexis, entrenching the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly for years to come.</p><p>As Reback writes:</p><blockquote><p>A Thomson executive candidly described…his company’s reaction to the settlement: ‘I wouldn’t use the word “overjoyed.” But “elated” would be fair,’ he said. Taking his cue from Bill Gates, he added, ‘I mean they gave up nothing.’ Thomson secured the government’s permission to raise the cost of legal representation for everyone in America.</p></blockquote><p>For Lexis to remain competitive, it necessarily had to bring about its own secondary wave of consolidation, buying up many smaller companies to grow and survive against the new Thomson-West leviathan. The Justice Department, per Reback’s telling, allowed this secondary wave of consolidation as well.</p><p><span>Lexis’ new owner, Reed-Elsevier, acquired state court case publisher The Michie Company, mentioned earlier. Lexis also rolled up Shephard’s Citation Service, and Dutch publishing giant Wolters Kluwer </span><a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https:/www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-11-28-fi-7979-story.html___.YzJ1OmFlbHBlY29ub21pY2xpYmVydGllczpjOm86OWQwMmQyOTAwMTA3MDRmYjdjZTY0MzgxNDdlNmIyZWY6Nzo0NjU4OjE4ZGQ5MWFhYzczYzJiMTM3ZDJkNjU1Yzc2OGQ4MTU3N2M2Njk3YWNhNjE1M2ZmN2JjZjkwYzA1MmNlY2YwMDA6cDpUOkY" rel="">absorbed</a><span> CCH Inc., who was a provider of tax and business law information, software and services.</span></p><p>And with that, the market for legal research consolidated immensely, down to just two market participants—Westlaw and Lexis.</p><p>Reback writes in his book that:</p><blockquote><p>Within a few days [of the Thomson-West acquisition being approved] CNN released [its] story reporting that the owner of West channeled $155,000 in political contributions to eight state parties. Time Magazine followed ten days later, listing $329,000 in contributions to ten state parties. Even the venerable ABA Journal reported the story.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Higher Costs and a Dearth of Innovation Follows in the Decades Since</strong></p><p>In the 30 years since, while Lexis and Westlaw might have glossier looking websites and the internet might load faster than it did back then, the market for legal research services is not much different than the one Reback and others warned about in the 1990s.</p><p><span>The lack of competition facing the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly has removed pressure for these firms to innovate their product offerings or </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/terms/SALargeLegal/pricing.page" rel="">prices</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>To simply search for cases (which are public records), a small law firm with only 10 attorneys </span><a href="https://sales.legalsolutions.thomsonreuters.com/en-us/products/westlaw-advantage/plans-pricing" rel="">can expect to pay</a><span> around $2,100 per month for Westlaw. Lexis </span><a href="https://store.lexisnexis.com/lawfirms" rel="">meanwhile charges</a><span> $1163 per month for just 3 attorneys for its “Professional” plan. Organizations of larger size (so most organizations) must individually contact the sales departments of these companies for black box pricing which is orders of magnitude higher. Indeed, trying to reconcile any kind of “ballpark” number for what using these services ultimately cost in the course of legal practice is all but impossible. </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/terms/SALargeLegal/pricing.page" rel="">Certain kinds of searches and documents</a><span> present a broad array of hidden upcharges and widely varying fees. As I noted above, Lexis </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/terms/21/pricing.page" rel="">charges up to $469</a><span> for a single search.</span></p><p><span>Lexis also </span><a href="https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/terms/21/pricing.page" rel="">publishes discount rates</a><span> for monthly search bills of up to $180,000. We’re talking about bills of nearly $200k per month (!) just for searching public domain court cases.</span></p><p>There are also quality issues. Lexis and Westlaw still require wonky and outdated search operators that were last in regular use by search engines at the time of these services’ inception, are not nearly as intelligent or predictive as other search services, and no serious competitor has ever emerged.</p><p><span>And what of generative AI? These companies only recently rolled out rudimentary AI tools. On this count, I have used both ChatGPT and Lexis’ AI tool. They are mediocre for legal research at best. For one, ChatGPT does not have access (by design) to Lexis and West’s ocean of case law straight from the courts. Lacking access to legal cases that are putatively considered to be in the public domain, but in reality are locked firmly behind Lexis and West’s paid research systems, Large Language Models </span><a href="https://library.potsdam.edu/AI_Ethics/Hallucinations" rel="">cannot discover them the way they do with other information</a><span>, and AI frequently “hallucinates”—plugging the gaps with made up cases that do not exist—to </span><a href="https://nypost.com/2025/11/12/business/lawyers-hit-with-fines-after-ai-flubs-fill-their-filings-they-should-be-ashamed/" rel="">disastrous results</a><span>. Even Lexis and West’s own AI tools struggle to make more-than-basic levels of inferences about whether or not a case helps answer your question, beyond the fact it includes relevant keywords.</span></p><p><strong>PACER—the Federal Government’s Docket Monopoly Is a Problem, Too</strong></p><p>This brings me to my last point: the government’s role. As a law clerk to a federal judge, I have access to the full suite of not only research services, but powerful tools the federal courts use to manage cases.</p><p><span>As my </span><a href="https://x.com/leehepner/status/1909841410913976533?s=46" rel="">colleague Lee Hepner has pointed out</a><span>, the government’s own case tools, chiefly PACER (standing for “Public Access to Court Electronic Records”) have long been sclerotic, antiquated, and overpriced.</span></p><p>PACER is used to access full case dockets (to view motions, orders, and filings, not just the judicial opinions you find on Westlaw and Lexis.) CM/ECF (standing for Case Management/Electronic Case Files) is similar to PACER but is used by attorneys to file materials with courts.</p><p>The U.S. government—specifically the federal judiciary, manages PACER and CM/ECF.</p><p><span>In addition to PACER’s ancient interface (</span><a href="https://ecf.dcd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/ShowIndex.pl" rel="">here is the link</a><span> to see the D.C. District Court’s PACER page for yourself) it has security problems, which were highlighted recently when it was </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/12/us/politics/russia-hack-federal-court-system.html" rel="">apparently hacked by Russia</a><span>, compromising sealed documents. Its costs </span><a href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/www.dailyjournal.com/articles/351317-high-cost-of-court-records-through-pacer-contrary-to-first-amendment-values" rel="">are also outrageous</a><span>.</span></p><p>PACER is a somewhat rare example of a government monopoly—where instead of a sole private corporation controlling a market to ill effects, the government does. Usually, that makes sense after all. The government has a monopoly per se on many things, like criminal prosecution, military forces, road improvement, etc.</p><p>But what’s unique in this case is the federal government is using its position as a monopolist over access to dockets to extract monopoly rents.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://pacer.uscourts.gov/pacer-pricing-how-fees-work" rel="">fees the federal government charges for</a><span> court documents are significant. PACER charges users $0.10 for every page users search and access, and $30 per name or item searched plus $0.10 per page per document per month, albeit with a max of $3 per individual document.</span></p><p>While to some, these might not seem like large numbers, consider the fact filings are hundreds of pages long, there can be numerous documents per ECF docket entry, hundreds of entries per docket, and infinite dockets to browse. If you do not know exactly what ECF number and case you are looking for, and you need to browse more than a handful of pages, these fees add up quickly every month, particularly for those not at big law firms with large corporate clients who can foot the bill.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><span>Unlike most competition problems, this one is unique in that the government is in fact the source of the goods in the market (i.e. courts produce the opinions and orders that are then given to Lexis and Westlaw to publish). As such, the government has tremendous leverage over the companies and the ability to fix the problem, much like the Justice Department once tried to do with its JURIS service </span><a href="https://www.rcfp.org/high-court-wont-review-denial-access-justice-database/" rel="">before shuttering it in the 1990s</a><span> in favor of a </span><a href="https://time.com/archive/6730659/the-cheerful-giver/" rel="">contract with West.</a></p><p>By making case law freely accessible to anyone, insurmountable barriers to entry would be removed, and new market entrants could create far more cost effective and innovative solutions than what Lexis and Westlaw offer.</p><p><span>An example of one such site that tries to do this is </span><a href="https://www.justia.com/" rel="">Justia</a><span>. But Justia, while often useful for finding the texts of certain higher profile judicial opinions, suffers from the problem of not having access to anywhere near the inventory of opinions that the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly does. As a result, it functions more like a repository of select opinions, not a fulsome legal search engine that helps you answer questions, discover case law, and conduct legal research, and as such, it is not a viable competitor.</span></p><p>So beyond the obvious dump trucks of lobbying cash Lexis and Westlaw would throw at preventing any such solution, in a similar way to how tax prep companies lobby against a free online IRS tax prep tool for the public, what are the obstacles?</p><p><span>Well for one, this issue is just not attractive to elected officials. It’s boring, non-ideological, won’t grab many headlines in mainstream media, and it doesn’t affect those outside the relatively narrow legal industry in the way another competition problem, </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-and-federal-trade-commission-seek-information-unfair-and-anticompetitive" rel="">like Live Nation/Ticketmaster</a><span> does for example.</span></p><p>But what if it has a bigger impact than we realize? By inflating research costs (a significant source of overhead) for lawyers, legal services cost the public more money. Those who can’t afford big legal bills are forced to either forgo access to justice (along with their rights) or go with lower caliber legal services.</p><p>Moreover, transparency is reduced, as while trials and the records they produce are putatively considered open to the public, if you don’t have monopoly money to pay to access them, they simply are not.</p><p>Opening case records to the public domain for free—like the vast majority of public government records—would allow new competitors to Lexis and Westlaw to create innovation and lower costs. This, in turn, would reduce expenses for legal organizations (significantly helping public interest and legal aid groups), improve access to justice and transparency, and allow for a better-functioning legal system—with higher-quality legal representation for all.</p><p>At least in theory, this is the case. But like solving nearly any antitrust problem, the market cannot be fixed overnight. While the competition problem in this market is undeniable, it would take time for the competitive landscape, innovation, and prices to improve. Taking a crowbar to the Lexis/Westlaw duopoly however, is the first step, and an important one.</p><p><span>Thanks for reading!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>It is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/japan" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Japan</a>, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.</p><p>As a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Games</a> was shortened to Sega for the new venture.</p><p>For the next 15 years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/sega" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Sega</a> innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.</p><figure id="78f9c911-d047-4d10-8d21-0d0497e6e60b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Two Sega arcade games either side of Capcom’s Pac-Man at the Centre for Computing History, Cambridge." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc3cf66d2cef9ec2e55fed30007f696e1f721816/0_1263_3648_2918/master/3648.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="355.95120614035085" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Two Sega arcade games either side of Capcom’s Pac-Man at the Centre for Computing History, Cambridge.</span> Photograph: Nathaniel Noir/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>One of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.</p><p>During this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.</p><p>From the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”</p><figure id="4397f5a7-afcb-45a6-8322-100c9758bece" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Sega’s Master System." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e39be4f11b94ffed93c48c419292f9daf31e0a5d/126_0_3780_3024/master/3780.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Sega’s Master System.</span> Photograph: Keith Stuart/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>This machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.</p><p>“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”</p><figure id="013482b1-d217-4b2a-918a-0689661ae3e1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Streets of Rage, one of Sega’s teen-targeted titles." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cba340ecae9d0c22dde4cfe3f4a3e486b78aa2/302_0_3185_2549/master/3185.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356.1397174254317" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Streets of Rage, one of Sega’s teen-targeted titles.</span> Photograph: ArcadeImages/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>Rosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996.

He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>This is the 36th post in an <a href="https://brave.com/privacy-updates/">ongoing series</a> describing new privacy features in Brave. This post describes work done by Mikhail Atuchin (Sr. Staff Engineer), Pavel Beloborodov (Sr. Software Engineer) and Anton Lazarev (Staff Adblock Engineer). It was written by Shivan Kaul Sahib (VP, Privacy and Security).</em></p>
<p>Brave has overhauled its Rust-based <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adblock engine</a> to reduce memory consumption by 75%, bringing better battery life and smoother multitasking to all users. The upgrade represents roughly 45 MB of memory savings for the Brave browser on <em>every platform</em> (Android, iOS and desktop) <em>by default</em>, and scales even higher for users with additional adblocking lists enabled. These performance boosts are live in Brave v1.85, with additional optimizations coming in v1.86.</p>

</figure> 
<p>As announced in <a href="https://x.com/brave/status/1935716280121610485" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June</a> and <a href="https://x.com/brave/status/1984338120297562336" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October</a> last year, we achieved this major memory milestone by iteratively refactoring the <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adblock-rust</a> engine to use <a href="https://crates.io/crates/flatbuffers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlatBuffers</a>, a compact and efficient storage format. This architectural transition allowed us to move the roughly 100,000 adblock filters shipped by default from standard, heap-allocated Rust data structures (such as Vecs, HashMaps, and structs) into a specialized, zero-copy binary format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along the way, we completed several other key performance optimizations (some of these are coming in v1.86):</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/pull/573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memory management</a>: Used stack-allocated vectors to reduce memory allocations by 19% and improved building time by ~15%.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/pull/554/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matching speed</a>: Improved filter matching performance by 13% by tokenizing common regex patterns.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/pull/526" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharing resources</a>: Resources are shared between instantiations of adblock engines, saving ~2 MB of memory on desktop.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/pull/517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Storage efficiency</a>: Optimized internal resource storage memory by 30%.</li>
</ol>
<p>Saving 45+ MB of memory is a significant milestone in the world of browser performance and a massive win for users on mobile and older hardware. While Brave <a href="https://brave.com/blog/brave-android-one-eight-zero-plus-performance/">already improves performance</a> on the Web by blocking invasive ads and trackers, our latest engineering effort ensures that our own built-in protections are as lightweight and invisible as possible. Unlike adblocking in other browsers, Brave’s <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adblocking engine</a> is <a href="https://brave.com/blog/improved-ad-blocker-performance/">built into the browser</a> and maintained by our privacy team. Such deep optimizations are impossible for extension-based blockers, which are restricted by browser extension APIs and sandboxing. This native architecture is also why Brave’s own ad and tracker blocking is entirely unaffected by <a href="https://brave.com/blog/brave-shields-manifest-v3/">Manifest V3</a>.</p>
<p>This performance boost is the culmination of several months of in-depth cross-team engineering work between our performance and privacy teams. It marks a significant leap in the browser’s efficiency and ensures that we continue shipping best-in-class privacy to over <a href="https://brave.com/blog/100m-mau/">100 million users</a>.</p>

Alfred Lin (formerly CFO/COO of Zappos the company known for “Delivering Happiness”) was on our board.  Alfred and his team (shout outs to Bret Reckard and Jess Lee) were the best and most founder-friendly partners we could have hoped for on our journey.</p><p>I pressed my friend for more information and learned he was describing Sequoia Capital in the 90’s.  </p><p>What had changed in the following decade?  </p><p>I nearly dropped my beer as it hit me like a lighting bolt… I had lived the change.</p><p>Y Combinator had reshaped the landscape.</p><div id="youtube2-6u4JVz7iQTY" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;6u4JVz7iQTY&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6u4JVz7iQTY?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Paul Graham (no relation) and Jessica Livingston founded Y Combinator in 2005.  I recommend everyone take a moment to watch Jessica’s interview above to understand the full thoughtfulness of YC’s ecosystem of trust.</p><p><span>By the time Humble Bundle was admitted, YC had established strong momentum.  Heroku had been sold in December of 2010 to Salesforce while Dropbox and AirBnB were compounding incredible growth (both were predicted to IPO, which they eventually did).  Paul, noticing the trends, made the official case for founder-control as a new best-practice.  On December 2010, the very month before Humble Bundle began the Winter ‘11 batch, Paul Graham penned this essay on </span><a href="https://paulgraham.com/control.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">why investors should let founders stay in charge</a><span>:</span></p><p><span>“</span><em>I feel like we’re at a tipping point here…</em></p><p><em>Founders retaining control after a series A is clearly heard-of. And barring financial catastrophe, I think in the coming year it will become the norm...</em></p><p><em>Knowing that founders will keep control of the board may even help VCs pick better. If they know they can’t fire the founders, they’ll have to choose founders they can trust. And that’s who they should have been choosing all along.</em><span>”</span></p><p>Four month’s later - thanks to YC’s advice and the growing YC alumni community (shout outs to Alex Polvi, Alexis Ohanian, Sam Altman, James Lindenbaum, Garry Tan)  - Paul’s tipping point theory became Humble Bundle’s reality.  We received competing term sheets pre-demo day.  In no small part due to Alfred Lin’s willingness to advocate for us to Sequoia, we were offered a deal granting us both shareholder and board control on a Series A. We accepted it quickly and immediately went to work growing our business.</p><p>Our founder-control (combined with YC and Sequoia’s parental guidance) provided us the agility we needed to reinvent ourselves several times.  We may have looked calm and composed from the outside, but across our journey we created: Humble Bundles, The Humble Widget, Humble Book Bundles, The Humble Store, The Humble Monthly subscription and Humble Publishing (with additional experiments with music, browser games and standup comedy).  By the time we were acquired, we had processed over $2 billion in gross sales across our products while raising $200 million for charity.  Our acquisition yielded a nice return for our shareholders (though I’m not at liberty to disclose the amount) and we became one of the numerous success stories emerging from YC’s founder-friendly ecosystem…</p><p>Y Combinator combines a multitude of best-practices which are constantly being improved upon but these are the factors I believe matter most for establishing trust.</p><p><strong>Front-loaded Founder Filtering</strong></p><p><span>Paul was already adhering to his own investment advice by having YC “</span><em>choose founders they can trust”</em><span>.  After completing his own successful startup journey, Paul knew what he wanted to see in founding teams: </span><a href="https://paulgraham.com/founders.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Determination, Flexibility, Imagination, Naughtiness and Friendship</a><span>.  By interviewing thousands of candidates and only admitting the most entrepreneurial few, YC was front-loading due diligence for the rest of the ecosystem… thereby establishing trust in the brand.</span></p><p>Some say YC is now big enough that it has a self-fulfilling distortion effect where the best founders in the world know they should all apply to YC first before they talk to any other startup accelerators or investors.</p><p><strong>A Fast, Iterative, Development Loop With A Forcing Function</strong></p><p>In video game terms, YC is very much like a game jam with parental supervision.  You have a few months to focus on nothing but building your business while being surrounded by peers who are all actively building theirs.  You know that at the end of the YC program you’ll be presenting at demo day and you want to build as much momentum as you can.  You’re not being graded by judges or professors, but by the actual market of investors who will all be watching your pitch.  So you are flung into a fast product-building-loop and the energy is contagious.</p><p>By the time you get to demo day, you’ve been forged in the crucible of one of the most intense prototyping process with some of the best mentors in the world.  Investors know this.</p><p><strong>A Community Built On A Foundation Of Trust</strong></p><p>YC acts dutifully like a “Trust Escrow Agent” in the marketplace between founders and investors.</p><p><span>Founders must follow a </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/ethics" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">YC code of ethics</a><span> where they promise to be truthful and honor their business commitments.  YC’s brand itself is the collateral on this social contract so they must make sure founders behave.</span></p><p>Additionally, startups are individually small, weak, have poor information and few resources compared to sophisticated investment firms.  As a collective, YC maintains awareness of current investment terms as well as the behavior patterns of individual investors.  As such, YC levels the playing field and coaches its portfolio companies away from bad actors and bad deals.</p><p><strong>Making Investing A Repeated Game</strong></p><p><span>In my introductory game theory class with Professor </span><a href="https://economics.yale.edu/people/benjamin-polak" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Ben Polak</a><span>, I learned that cooperation amongst individuals is impossible to enforce in a single, short-form game like the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Prisoner’s Dilemma</a><span>.  When played only once, there’s no sure way to deter selfish behavior between founders and investors.  But YC has made investing a “repeated game” across recurring batches of many startups.  As such, YC can credibly punish bad actors (if needed) by hurting their expected future outcomes in the investment ecosystem.  </span></p><p><span>Imagine a VC (or a founder) being threatened with excommunication from YC or being permanently marked as untrustworthy across the whole community.  This is a credible </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_trigger" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Grim Trigger</a><span>-style threat that can deter bad actions from occurring in the first place and incentivize cooperation.</span></p><p><strong>Establishing Rewards For Reputable Behavior</strong></p><p>Credible rewards are just as valuable as credible threats.  In any sustainable ecosystem, it’s important for both parties to benefit from their social contract.  If Paul Graham and YC have been on the sell-side for their founders, then Alfred Lin and VC’s like him have been on the buy-side.  </p><p><span>Together, they’ve successfully created multiple unicorns (companies valued at over $1 Billion) and Alfred’s star has risen at Sequoia.  His impeccable business track record, stellar interactions with his founders and the value-creation he has presided over have made him a desired board member and investor by everyone from AirBnB to DoorDash to Reddit (all are YC companies).  Alfred was recently </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/04/sequoia-names-alfred-lin-and-pat-grady-as-new-co-stewards-as-roelof-botha-steps-down/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">promoted to lead Sequoia Capital</a><span> (and has now three-peated #1 on the </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/midas/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Forbes Midas List</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>In the Prisoner’s Dilemma, imagine altering the payout matrix so that cooperative behavior yields the biggest expected payouts on the board for both parties.  Now, even without threats, a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Nash Equilibrium</a><span> exists with mutual cooperative behavior.  YC has shown that founder friendliness improves the payouts for everyone.</span></p><p><span>People forget how crazy Y Combinator seemed in 2005.  In Paul’s </span><a href="https://paulgraham.com/ycstart.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">essay reflecting upon the early days of YC</a><span>, he describes that there were definitely “people who didn’t take us seriously”.  No one questions the YC model anymore.  Twenty years later the verdict is in… it works!</span></p><p>Keep in mind when you look at the above chart that YC invests super early.  So in theory, those that also invest later stage like Sequoia, SV Angel and Accel can “wait and see” while joining companies later on for a Series A, B, C etc. when their likelihood of unicorn-ing is higher.  When you filter for seed investing only, you clearly see what YC does better than anyone else…</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/documents" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Y Combinator SAFE</a><span> has prevailed as the silicon valley standard for all founders even beyond the direct YC community itself.  The structure allows entrepreneurs access to fast, early-stage capital without loss of control and near-zero legal cost.  Many founders now raise sizable rounds entirely via SAFE’s (some SAFE rounds are now bigger than the $4.5 million Jeff and I raised in our Humble Bundle Series A).</span></p><div id="youtube2-Dk6JNTDec9I" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;Dk6JNTDec9I&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:null,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Dk6JNTDec9I?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>Every modern entrepreneur owes YC thanks for tilting the startup ecosystem towards this and other founder-friendly precedents.</p><p><span>YC itself has made several decent bets in video games including </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Twitch</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.machinezone.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Machine Zone</a><span>, </span><a href="https://heroiclabs.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Heroic Labs</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Humble Bundle</a><span>.

They break down in detail the ways recent investors and game companies seem to have fallen out of alignment.  If you don’t have time to listen to it, David Kaye (who ran his own game studio before exiting and becoming a VC), wrote an excellent summary of the podcast here:</span></p><p><span>Adam Boyes, a games industry legend (Capcom, Sony Playstation, Iron Galaxy), appeared on the </span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/is/podcast/the-business-of-video-games-podcast/id1648134752" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Business of Video Games Podcast</a><span> and diagnosed the problem as follows:</span></p><p><em>“I think a lot of the investment that we had over the last 5 years was just ‘here’s a bunch of money to go make something’… when you do that in a vacuum on an island… like Lord of the Flies…. all of a sudden: Piggy’s dead, the glasses are broken and who’s got the conch? What happened here?  Well it’s ‘cause we didn’t have any sort of like nice oversight, that adult supervision.”</em></p><p><span>Elbow Grease Games has been fortunate.  I’m very proud of the momentum we’ve built:  </span><a href="https://elbowgreasegames.substack.com/p/below-the-crown-launches-into-early" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Misfits Attic signed with Shochiku and is shipping Below The Crown</a><span>,  </span><a href="https://elbowgreasegames.substack.com/p/torpor-games-announces-seed-round" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Torpor Games recently announced their Seed Round</a><span> and we have plenty more going on that we will announce soon.  </span></p><p>But the funding market realities for most of the industry are quite dire.  The mantra: “Survive to 2025” didn’t pan out.  Based on data I could find, 2025 seems likely to be the worst year for video game equity funding in recent history.</p><p>Annual publisher data is harder to find but in my many travels this year I’ve seen publishers retreat from the market as well.  Namely, dev budgets have shrunk… so much that I now hear of several publishers explaining they offer ZERO DOLLARS in development budget because they already have their pick of finished games.  In such cases, you’d have to make a full game on your own and then maybe, just maybe, a publisher will provide some additional marketing support at the end of your journey in exchange for a meaningful share of your royalties.</p><p>(An aside: In fairness to game funders, this can be viewed as the pendulum swinging back the other way from the pandemic when dev budgets were quite large and nearly all developers failed to deliver big enough results to justify the money invested.)</p><p>But this doesn’t feel like a sustainable ecosystem.  Instead of going on development journeys together where funders are aligned with developers, risk mitigation feels like it has become a zero-sum game… one party mitigates risk by dumping it on the other.  </p><p><span>Valve and Riot Games were quick to add “behavior scores” to their MOBA matchmaking systems while Heroes of Newerth did not.  As a result, well-behaved Dota 2 and League of Legends players would get matched with one another while non-cooperative, toxic players were relegated to their own hives of scum and villainy.    </span><a href="http://is generally said to have done the least to mitigate toxicity" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Many suggest that this is why Heroes of Newerth shut down while Dota 2 and League of Legends have lived on.</a></p><p>If game funding is a repeated game, and none of us in this small industry get to use anonymity or throw-away accounts… our reputations will precede us.  People will remember who is a cooperative team player and who is not.  I predict this will separate the industry into two groups.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg" width="250" height="313" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:313,&quot;width&quot;:250,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!f-BT!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fac696608-244f-4b9e-af8f-2689034f5ac4_250x313.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>“There are two types of beings in the universe: Those who dance and those who do not.” - Drax the Destroyer (from Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy)</figcaption></figure></div><p>One funding community will adopt a ruthless short-term focus.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://minha.sh/posts/so,-you-want-to-chunk-really-fast">https://minha.sh/posts/so,-you-want-to-chunk-really-fast</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46501665">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://minha.sh/meme_chunk.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt=""></p>
<p>we’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie">chonkie</a>, a chunking library for RAG pipelines, and at some point we started benchmarking on wikipedia-scale datasets.</p>
<p>that’s when things started feeling… <em>slow</em>.</p>
<p>not unbearably slow, but slow enough that we started wondering: what’s the theoretical limit here? how fast can text chunking actually get if we throw out all the abstractions and go straight to the metal?</p>
<p>this post is about that rabbit hole, and how we ended up building memchunk.</p>
<h2 id="what-even-is-chunking">what even is chunking?</h2>
<p>if you’re building anything with LLMs and retrieval, you’ve probably dealt with this: you have a massive pile of text, and you need to split it into smaller pieces that fit into embedding models or context windows.</p>
<p>the naive approach is to split every N characters. but that’s dumb — you end up cutting sentences in half, and your retrieval quality tanks.</p>
<p>the smart approach is to split at semantic boundaries: periods, newlines, question marks. stuff that actually indicates “this thought is complete.”</p>
<pre><code>"Hello world. How are you?"
     → ["Hello world.", " How are you?"]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="why-delimiters-are-enough">why delimiters are enough</h3>
<p>there are fancy chunking strategies out there — sentence splitters, recursive chunkers, semantic chunkers that use embeddings. but for most use cases, the key thing is just not cutting sentences in half.</p>
<p>token-based and character-based chunkers don’t care where sentences end. they just split at N tokens or N bytes. that means you get chunks like:</p>
<pre><code>"The quick brown fox jumps over the la"
"zy dog."
</code></pre>
<p>the embedding for that first chunk is incomplete. it’s a sentence fragment.</p>
<p>delimiter-based chunking avoids this. if you split on <code>.</code> and <code>?</code> and <code>\n</code>, your chunks end at natural boundaries. you don’t need NLP pipelines or embedding models to find good split points — just byte search.</p>
<p>simple concept. but doing it fast? that’s where things get interesting.</p>
<h2 id="enter-memchr">enter memchr</h2>
<p>the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/memchr">memchr</a> crate by Andrew Gallant is the foundation here. it’s a byte search library with multiple layers of optimization.</p>
<h3 id="the-fallback-swar">the fallback: SWAR</h3>
<p>even without SIMD instructions, memchr is fast. the generic implementation uses SWAR (SIMD Within A Register) — a clever trick that processes 8 bytes at a time using regular 64-bit operations.</p>
<p>the core idea: to find a byte in a chunk, XOR the chunk with the needle splatted across all 8 positions. any matching byte becomes zero. then use bit manipulation to detect if any byte is zero:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>// has_zero_byte detects if any lane is zero</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>the <code>has_zero_byte</code> trick works because subtracting 1 from a zero byte causes a borrow that propagates to the high bit. no branches, no loops over individual bytes.</p>

<h3 id="the-fast-path-avx2sse2">the fast path: AVX2/SSE2</h3>
<p>on x86_64 with SIMD support, memchr upgrades to vector instructions. AVX2 processes 32 bytes at once:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="github-light github-dark"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="github-light github-dark"><span data-line=""><span>// broadcast needle to all 32 lanes</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> needle_vec </span><span>=</span><span> _mm256_set1_epi8</span><span>(needle </span><span>as</span><span> i8</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>// load 32 bytes from haystack</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> chunk </span><span>=</span><span> _mm256_loadu_si256</span><span>(haystack);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>// compare all 32 bytes simultaneously</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> matches </span><span>=</span><span> _mm256_cmpeq_epi8</span><span>(chunk, needle_vec);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>// extract match positions as a 32-bit mask</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>let</span><span> mask </span><span>=</span><span> _mm256_movemask_epi8</span><span>(matches);</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>if <code>mask</code> is non-zero, at least one byte matched. <code>trailing_zeros()</code> gives the position.</p>
<p>memchr also has a hybrid strategy: it stores both SSE2 (16-byte) and AVX2 (32-byte) searchers, using SSE2 for small haystacks and AVX2 for larger ones.</p>
<h3 id="the-api">the API</h3>
<p>memchr provides three variants:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>memchr(needle, haystack)</code> — find one byte</li>
<li><code>memchr2(n1, n2, haystack)</code> — find either of two bytes</li>
<li><code>memchr3(n1, n2, n3, haystack)</code> — find any of three bytes</li>
</ul>
<p>for two or three needles, it runs multiple comparisons and ORs the results together. but notice: it stops at three.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-character-limit">the three-character limit</h2>
<p>why only three? from memchr’s source code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>only one, two and three bytes are supported because three bytes is about the point where one sees diminishing returns. beyond this point and it’s probably (but not necessarily) better to just use a simple <code>[bool; 256]</code> array or similar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>each additional needle requires another comparison and OR operation. with 3 needles you’re doing 3 broadcasts, 3 comparisons, and 2 ORs per 32-byte chunk. a 4th needle adds another ~33% overhead, and the gains from SIMD start looking less impressive compared to simpler approaches.</p>
<p>the memchr authors explicitly chose not to implement <code>memchr4</code> or beyond — it’s not a limitation, it’s a design decision.</p>
<p>so what happens when you want to split on <code>\n</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>!</code>, and <code>;</code>? that’s 5 delimiters. memchr can’t help directly.</p>
<h2 id="the-fallback-lookup-tables">the fallback: lookup tables</h2>
<p>when you have more than 3 delimiters, we fall back to a classic technique: the 256-entry lookup table.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="github-light github-dark"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="github-light github-dark"><span data-line=""><span>fn</span><span> build_table</span><span>(delimiters</span><span>:</span><span> &amp;</span><span>[</span><span>u8</span><span>]) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> [</span><span>bool</span><span>; </span><span>256</span><span>] {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    for</span><span> &amp;</span><span>byte </span><span>in</span><span> delimiters {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        table[byte </span><span>as</span><span> usize</span><span>] </span><span>=</span><span> true</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    table</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>fn</span><span> is_delimiter</span><span>(byte</span><span>:</span><span> u8</span><span>, table</span><span>:</span><span> &amp;</span><span>[</span><span>bool</span><span>; </span><span>256</span><span>]) </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> bool</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    table[byte </span><span>as</span><span> usize</span><span>]  </span><span>// single array lookup, no branching</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></figure>
<p>this is O(1) per byte — just an array index. no loops, no comparisons, no branching. modern CPUs love this because it’s completely predictable.</p>
<p>is it as fast as SIMD? no. but it’s still really fast, and it handles arbitrary delimiter sets.</p>
<h2 id="why-search-backwards">why search backwards?</h2>
<p>there’s one more trick: we search backwards from <code>chunk_size</code>, not forwards from 0.</p>
<p>if you search forward, you need to scan through the entire window to find where to split. you’d find a delimiter at byte 50, but you can’t stop there — there might be a better split point closer to your target size. so you keep searching, tracking the last delimiter you saw, until you finally cross the chunk boundary. that’s potentially thousands of matches and index updates.</p>
<p>backward search? one lookup. start at <code>chunk_size</code>, search backward, and the first delimiter you hit is your split point. done.</p>
<pre><code>target_size = 100
text: "Hello. World. This is a test. Here's more text..."

forward search:
  - find "." at 6, save it, keep going
  - find "." at 13, save it, keep going
  - find "." at 30, save it, keep going
  - ... eventually cross boundary, use last saved position
  → multiple searches, lots of bookkeeping

backward search:
  - start at position 100, search backward
  - find "." at 30, done
  → one search, no bookkeeping
</code></pre>
<p>fewer operations means less overhead. we use <code>memrchr</code> (reverse memchr) instead of <code>memchr</code> for exactly this reason.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-together">putting it together</h2>
<p>memchunk automatically picks the right strategy:</p>

<p>the table is only built once, lazily, on the first iteration. after that, it’s pure speed.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">benchmarks</h2>
<p>we ran this against the other rust chunking libraries we could find:</p>








































<div><table><thead><tr><th>library</th><th>throughput</th><th>vs memchunk</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>memchunk</td><td>164 GB/s</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>kiru</td><td>4.5 GB/s</td><td>36x slower</td></tr><tr><td>langchain</td><td>0.35 GB/s</td><td>469x slower</td></tr><tr><td>semchunk</td><td>0.013 GB/s</td><td>12,615x slower</td></tr><tr><td>llama-index</td><td>0.0035 GB/s</td><td>46,857x slower</td></tr><tr><td>text-splitter</td><td>0.0017 GB/s</td><td>96,471x slower</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p><img src="https://minha.sh/benchmark.png" width="auto" height="auto" alt=""></p>
<p>the exact throughput varies with file size and delimiter count — larger files and fewer delimiters favor SIMD more. but even in pessimistic cases (small chunks, many delimiters), we’re still in the hundreds of GB/s range.</p>
<p>for reference, that’s chunking english wikipedia (~20GB) in roughly 120 milliseconds.</p>
<h2 id="python-and-wasm-bindings">python and wasm bindings</h2>
<p>since chonkie is a python library, we needed python bindings. we also added wasm for browser/node use cases.</p>

<p>the techniques here aren’t novel — SIMD search and lookup tables are textbook stuff. the win comes from knowing when to use which:</p>
<ol>
<li>1-3 delimiters → memchr’s SIMD search</li>
<li>4+ delimiters → 256-entry lookup table</li>
<li>minimize allocations → return offsets, let the caller slice</li>

+=====================================================================+

  Using ignore file: .tailsnitch-ignore (3 rules)

=== ACCESS CONTROLS ===================================================

[CRITICAL] ACL-001: Default 'allow all' policy active
  Your ACL policy omits the 'acls' field. Tailscale applies a
  default 'allow all' policy, granting all devices full access.

  Remediation:
  Define explicit ACL rules following least privilege principle.

  Source: https://tailscale.com/kb/1192/acl-samples
----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== AUTHENTICATION &amp; KEYS =============================================

[HIGH] AUTH-001: Reusable auth keys exist
  Found 2 reusable auth key(s). These can be reused to add
  multiple devices if compromised.

  Details:
    - Key tskey-auth-xxx (expires in 45 days)
    - Key tskey-auth-yyy (expires in 89 days)

  Remediation:
  Store reusable keys in a secrets manager. Prefer one-off keys.
