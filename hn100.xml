  <h2>Experience the Zen of making, hosting, and sharing great software in a single, portable, self-updating, vanilla HTML file</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Build web apps like you're sculpting clay, not managing infrastructure.</p>
    
    <p>Modern web development forces you through layers of abstraction: config files, build steps, magic frameworks, deployment pipelines.</p>
    
    <p>Hyperclay returns to a simpler model: your app is a single HTML file you (and your clients) manipulate directly. Edit the file through its visual UI and it persists its own state.</p>
    
    <p>What if web apps were as simple to edit as documents? Hyperclay makes it possible: UI, logic, and data live in one self-modifying HTML file. Edit it live. Share it instantly. Download and use it locally.</p>
        
    <p><b>It's Google Docs for interactive code.</b> Shareable, portable, malleable apps, but you fully control the document, what it looks like, and how it's edited.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Direct Manipulation:</b> Edit your app while it's running. No compile step, no refresh needed. Changes happen instantly, like editing a document. Share a URL and users see your updated page.</li>
      
      <li><b>What you see is what you build:</b> The UI is the app itself. When you modify the interface or edit the source in DevTools, you're directly changing the application. There's no abstraction layer.</li>
      
      <li><b>True Portability:</b> Export your app as an HTML file that runs anywhere: offline, on any server, forever. Version control tracks every save, protecting you from irreversible mistakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The coolest part? It's just an HTML file. Nothing special. Change it, it serializes its DOM, and sends it to a <b>/save</b> endpoint. Nothing magic about it.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I build several dozen websites a year</p>
    
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>When I’m in flow, coding a website feels like writing a story</p>
    <p><img src="https://hyperclay.com/home/flow.svg" alt="A hand creating digital things"></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>But it’s better than a story, because I can interact with it as I’m coding</p>
    
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Most of the things I build transform some data into a more useful format</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hyperclay.com/home/transform-input.svg" alt="Producing a result from website input"></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hyperclay.com/home/example-html-apps.svg" alt="Example HTML apps"></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Static websites are the obvious place to host these simple tools</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hyperclay.com/home/static-website-easy-hosting.svg" alt="Static websites require less code and have free hosting"></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>But static websites fall short in one annoying way: changes to them are ephemeral</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hyperclay.com/home/static-website-ephemeral.svg" alt="But when you refresh a static website, its results disappear"></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>This is frustrating because the problems I want to help solve are not ephemeral</p>

  <div>
    <p>With physical objects, ephemerality is shocking — changes are supposed to persist</p>

  </div>
  <div>
    <p>To get digital objects to act more intuitively, we need to build a whole persistence layer around them</p>
    <p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hyperclay.com/home/persistence-layer.svg" alt="A digital orange being worked on by a giant machine"></p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>In practice, this means a server with a database, API, templates, and user accounts</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The ACCC has today commenced Federal Court proceedings against Google Asia Pacific over anti-competitive understandings that Google admits it reached in the past with Telstra and Optus regarding the pre-installation of Google Search on Android mobile phones.</p>

<p>Google has co-operated with the ACCC, admitted liability and agreed to jointly submit to the Court that Google should pay a total penalty of $55&nbsp;million. It is a matter for the Court to determine whether the penalty and other orders are appropriate.</p>

<p>The understandings, which were in place between December 2019 and March 2021, required Telstra and Optus to only pre-install Google Search on Android phones they sold to consumers, and not other search engines. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In return, Telstra and Optus received a share of the revenue Google generated from ads displayed to consumers when they used Google Search on their Android phones.</p>

<p>Google has admitted in reaching those understandings with each of Telstra and Optus it was likely to have had the effect of substantially lessening competition.</p>

<p>Google and its US parent company, Google LLC, have also signed a court-enforceable undertaking which the ACCC has accepted to address the ACCC’s broader competition concerns relating to contractual arrangements between Google, Android phone manufacturers and Australian telcos since 2017. Google does not agree with all of the ACCC’s concerns but has acknowledged them and offered the undertaking to address these concerns.</p>

<p>In the undertaking, Google commits to removing certain pre-installation and default search engine restrictions from its contracts with Android phone manufacturers and telcos.</p>

<p>Google’s undertaking is in addition to court-enforceable undertakings provided by Telstra, Optus and TPG last year. The ACCC accepted these telco undertakings to resolve concerns about the telcos’ agreements with Google. The telcos are not parties to the proceedings commenced today.</p>

<p>“Conduct that restricts competition is illegal in Australia because it usually means less choice, higher costs or worse service for consumers,” ACCC Chair Gina-Cass Gottlieb said.</p>

<p>“Today’s outcome, along with Telstra, Optus and TPG’s undertakings, have created the potential for millions of Australians to have greater search choice in the future, and for competing search providers to gain meaningful exposure to Australian consumers.”</p>

<p>“Importantly, these changes come at a time when AI search tools are revolutionising how we search for information, creating new competition,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.</p>

<p>In the court-enforceable undertakings that the ACCC accepted from <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-accepts-undertakings-from-telstra-and-optus-during-its-ongoing-investigation-into-googles-search-services">Telstra</a> and <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-accepts-undertakings-from-telstra-and-optus-during-its-ongoing-investigation-into-googles-search-services">Optus</a> (in June 2024) and <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-accepts-undertaking-from-tpg-in-ongoing-investigation-into-googles-search-services">TPG</a> (in August 2024), the companies undertook not to renew or make new arrangements with Google that require its search services to be pre-installed and set as the default search function on an exclusive basis on Android devices they supply.</p>

<p>The three telcos can configure search services on a device-by-device basis, and in ways that may not align with the settings set by Google. They can also enter into pre-installation agreements with other search providers.</p>

<p>“With AI search tools becoming increasingly available, consumers can experiment with search services on their mobiles,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.</p>

<p>Today’s proceedings follow a lengthy ACCC investigation, after broader concerns about Google’s contractual arrangements for Google Search emerged during the ACCC’s Digital Platform Services Inquiry’s report into <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/benefits-from-more-competition-in-internet-search">search defaults and choice screens</a>.</p>

<p>“Co-operation with the ACCC is encouraged. It can avoid the need for protracted and costly litigation and lead to more competition. More competition in markets drives economic dynamism, but the reverse is true when markets are not sufficiently competitive,” Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.</p>

<p>“The ACCC remains committed to addressing anti-competitive conduct like this, as well as cartel conduct. Competition issues in the digital economy are a current priority area.”</p>

<p>A copy of Google’s undertaking is available on the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/public-registers/undertakings-registers/google-llc-and-google-asia-pacific-pte-ltd">ACCC's Public Register</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Background</b></h2>

<p><b>Google LLC and Google Asia Pacific</b></p>

<p>Google LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc.</p>

<p>Since at least 2017, Google LLC and/or its related bodies corporate have signed many contractual arrangements to distribute Google apps, including Google Search. These agreements include mobile application distribution agreements and revenue share agreements.</p>

<p>Google Asia Pacific is the contracting counterparty for mobile revenue share agreements in the Asia Pacific region, including Australia.</p>

<p><b>Admitted conduct</b></p>

<p>The ACCC’s court action relates only &nbsp;to revenue share agreements with Telstra and Optus which were renewed between December 2019 and March 2021.</p>

<p>Google Asia Pacific has admitted, for the purposes of the Federal Court proceedings only, that in or around December 2019, it arrived at two separate understandings, one with Telstra and one with Optus, each containing a provision which:</p>

<p>(1) was to the effect that the parties would continue to be bound by the terms of their respective revenue share agreements containing the Platform-wide Provisions until they concluded negotiations regarding a further revenue share agreement; and</p>

<p>(2) was likely to have the effect of making it more difficult to obtain the distribution of general search engine services in Australia during the period from December 2019 until the end of March 2021 and, thereby, to have the likely effect of hindering competition in the market in Australia in which general search engine services were supplied; and</p>

<p>that by arriving at those understandings, Google Asia Pacific engaged in two separate contraventions of section 45(1)(a) of the CCA.</p>

<p>The Platform-wide provisions were provisions of the relevant Google mobile revenue share agreement which required, as a condition of Telstra and Optus receiving a share of search advertising revenue generated through certain search access points on Android mobile devices supplied in Australia by Telstra and Optus, that:</p>

<p>(1) all search access points on such devices were configured to utilise Google Search out-of the-box; and</p>

<p>The ACCC’s Digital Platforms Branch conducted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/inquiries-and-consultations/digital-platform-services-inquiry-2020-25">five-year inquiry</a>&nbsp;into markets for the supply of digital platform services in Australia and their impacts on competition and consumers, which included an update on general search services, published in <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google%E2%80%99s-dominance-in-general-search-yet-to-be-disrupted">December 2024</a>.</p>

<p>In the inquiry’s fifth report, published <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/accc-calls-for-new-competition-and-consumer-laws-for-digital-platforms">in November 2022</a>, the ACCC made a range of recommendations to bolster competition in the digital economy, level the playing field between big tech companies and Australian businesses, and reduce prices for consumers.</p>

<p>In this report the ACCC recommended a new regulatory regime to promote competition in digital platform services. One of the ACCC’s recommendations was for the government to introduce a framework for mandatory service-specific codes for Designated Digital Platforms to address a range of competition issues, including exclusive pre-installation and default agreements that hinder competition. Treasury has consulted on a proposed approach to implement a new digital competition regime administered by the ACCC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow-guide.html">https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow-guide.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44936309">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<h2><a href="#getting-started" id="getting-started"></a>Getting started</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/flow.html">flow</a> library enables a strict separation application logic from the deployment concerns of topology, execution, communication, lifecycle, monitoring and error handling.</p>
<h2><a href="#step-fns-and-process-launchers" id="step-fns-and-process-launchers"></a>Step fns and process launchers</h2>
<p>You provide logic to flow in the form of <em>step-fns</em>, which are wrapped into running processes, executing in a loop. Flow manages the life cycle of the process and handles incoming and outgoing messages by putting or taking them on channels. Step-fns do not access channels directly or hold state, making them easy to test in isolation and reuse.</p>
<p>Step functions have four arities:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/doc/img/step-fn-arities.png?raw=true"><img src="https://github.com/clojure/core.async/blob/master/doc/img/step-fn-arities.png?raw=true" alt="step-fn arities" width="700"></a></p>
<h3><a href="#describe-step-fn-descriptor" id="describe-step-fn-descriptor"></a>describe:  <code>(step-fn) -&gt; descriptor</code></h3>
<p>The describe arity must return a static description of the step-fn’s :params, :ins, and :outs. Each of these is a map of name (a keyword) to docstring.</p>
<p>For example, the describe arity might return this description for a simple step-fn:</p>
<pre><code>{:params {:size "Max size"}       ;; step-fn params
 :ins {:in "Input channel"}       ;; input channels
 :outs {:out "Output channel"}}   ;; output channels
</code></pre>
<p>The names used for input and output channels should be distinct (no overlap).</p>
<h3><a href="#init-step-fn-arg-map-init-state" id="init-step-fn-arg-map-init-state"></a>init: <code>(step-fn arg-map) -&gt; init-state</code></h3>
<p>The init arity is called once by the process to takes a set of args from the flow def (corresponding to the params returned from the describe arity) and returns the init state of the process.</p>
<h3><a href="#transition-step-fn-state-transition-state" id="transition-step-fn-state-transition-state"></a>transition: <code>(step-fn state transition) -&gt; state'</code></h3>
<p>The transition arity is called any time the flow or process undergoes a lifecycle transition (::flow/start, ::flow/stop, ::flow/pause, ::flow/resume). The description arity takes the current state and returns an updated state to be used for subsequent calls.</p>
<p>The step-fn should use the transition arity to coordinate the creation, pausing, and shutdown of external resources in a process.</p>
<h3><a href="#transform-step-fn-state-input-msg-state-out-id-msgs" id="transform-step-fn-state-input-msg-state-out-id-msgs"></a>transform: <code>(step-fn state input msg) -&gt; [state' {out-id [msgs]}]</code></h3>
<p>The transform arity is called in a loop by the process for every message received on an input channel and returns a new state and a map of output cids to messages to return. The process will take care of sending these messages to the output channels. Output can be sent to none, any or all of the :outsenumerated, and/or an input named by a <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/pid%20inid">pid inid</a> tuple (e.g. for reply-to), and/or to the ::flow/report output. A step need not output at all (output or msgs can be empyt/nil), however an output <em>message</em> may never be nil (per core.async channels).</p>
<p>The step-fn may throw excepitons from any arity and they will be handled by flow. Exceptions thrown from the transition or transform arities, the exception will be logged on the flow’s :error-chan.</p>
<h3><a href="#process-state" id="process-state"></a>Process state</h3>
<p>The process state is a map. It can contain any keys needed by the step-fn transition and transform arities. In addition, there are some flow-specific keys, described here.</p>
<p><code>::flow/pid</code> is added to the state by the process based on the name supplied in the flow def.</p>
<p><code>::flow/in-ports</code> and <code>::flow/out-ports</code> are maps of cid to external channel, optionally returned in the initial state from the init arity. The in-ports and out-ports are used to connect source and sink processes to external channels. These channels must be provided by the step-fn and returned in the init arity map, either by creating the channel or using a channel passed in via the flow def init args for the process. The flow does not manage the lifecycle of these channels.</p>
<p><code>::flow/input-filter</code>, a predicate of cid, can be returned in the state from any arity to indicate a filter on the process input channel read set. For example, a step-fn that is waiting for a response from multiple inputs might remove the channels that have already responded from the read-set until responses have been received from all.</p>
<h3><a href="#step-fn-helpers" id="step-fn-helpers"></a>step-fn helpers</h3>
<p>Some additional helpers exist to create step-fns from other forms:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>lift*-&gt;step</code> - given a fn f taking one arg and returning a collection of non-nil values, creates a step-fn as needed by a process launcher, with one input and one output (named :in and :out), and no state</li>
<li><code>lift1-&gt;step</code> - like <code>lift*-&gt;step</code> but for functions that return a single value (when <code>nil</code>, yield no output)</li>
<li><code>map-&gt;step</code> - given a map with keys <code>:describe</code>, <code>:init</code>, <code>:transition</code>, <code>:transform</code> corresponding to the arities above, create a step-fn.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="#creating-a-process-launcher" id="creating-a-process-launcher"></a>Creating a process launcher</h3>
<p>Process launchers can be created using the <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-process">process</a> function, which takes a step-fn, and an option map with keys:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>::workload</code> - one of <code>:mixed</code>, <code>:io</code> or <code>:compute</code></li>
<li><code>:compute-timeout-ms</code> - if :workload is :compute, this timeout (default 5000 msec) will be used when getting the return from the future - see below</li>
</ul>
<p>A :workload supplied as an option to <code>process</code> will override any :workload returned by the :describe fn of the process launcher. If neither are provded the default is :mixed.</p>
<p>In the :workload context of :mixed or :io, this dictates the type of thread in which the process loop will run, <em>including its calls to transform</em>.</p>
<p>When :io is specified, transform should not do extensive computation.</p>
<p>When :compute is specified, each call to transform will be run in a separate thread. The process loop will run in an :io context (since it no longer directly calls transform, all it does is I/O) and it will submit transform to the :compute executor then await (blocking, for compute-timeout-ms) the completion of the future returned by the executor. If the future times out it will be reported on ::flow/error.</p>
<p>When :compute is specified transform must not block!</p>
<p>Note that process launchers are defined by the <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.spi.html#var-ProcLauncher">ProcLauncher</a> protocol. While you will typically use <code>process</code> to create a process launcher, advanced uses may also implement the protocol directly.</p>
<h3><a href="#reloading" id="reloading"></a>Reloading</h3>
<p>Because the step-fn is called in a loop, it is a good practice to define the step-fn in a var and use the var (<code>#'the-fn</code>) instead of the function value itself (<code>the-fn</code>). This practice supports interactive development by allowing the var to be rebound from the repl while the flow is running.</p>
<h2><a href="#flow-def" id="flow-def"></a>Flow def</h2>
<p>The step-fns are how you supply code for each process in the flow. The other thing you must supply is the flow configuration that ties together the proc launchers and the connections between them.</p>
<p>This flow definition is supplied to the <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-create-flow">create-flow</a> function and consists of a map with <code>:procs</code>, <code>:conns</code>, and optionally some workflow executors.</p>
<p>The <code>:procs</code> is a map of pid -&gt; proc-def. The proc-def is a map with <code>:proc</code> (the process launcher), the <code>:args</code> (passed to the init arity of the step-fn), and the <code>:chan-opts</code> which can be used to specify channel properties.</p>
<p>The <code>:conns</code> is a collection of <code>[[from-pid outid] [to-pid inid]]</code> tuples. Inputs and outputs support multiple connections. When an output is connected multiple times, every connection will get every message, per <code>core.async/mult</code>.</p>
<p>An example flow definition might look like this for a flow with two procs where the in-chan and out-chan are being passed through the source and sink args:</p>
<pre><code>{:procs {:source-proc {:proc (process #'source-fn)
                       :args {:source-chan in-chan}}
         :sink-proc   {:proc (process #'sink-fn)
                       :args {:sink-chan out-chan}}}
 :conns [ [[:source-proc :out] [:sink-proc :in]] ]}
</code></pre>
<p>The flow is created by passing the flow definition to <a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-create-flow">create-flow</a>.</p>
<p>The returned flow object can be passed to the lifecycle methods (see next). In addition the flow can be used with <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.datafy-api.html#clojure.datafy/datafy">datafy</a> to get a datafied description of the flow. This is a static view - see <code>ping</code> described later for a dynamic view.</p>
<h2><a href="#flow-lifecycle" id="flow-lifecycle"></a>Flow lifecycle</h2>
<p>When a flow is created, it starts in the resumed state. The following flow functions can be used to change the flow lifecycle state:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-start">start</a> - Starts all procs in the flow, return a map of with <code>:report-chan</code> and <code>:error-chan</code></li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-stop">stop</a> - Stops all procs in the flow</li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-pause">pause</a> - Pauses all procs in the flow</li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-resume">resume</a> - Resumes all procs in the flow</li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-pause-proc">pause-proc</a> - Pauses a single proc</li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-resume-proc">resume-proc</a> - Resumes a single proc</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also use these functions to ping the running processes and return their current state and status:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-ping">ping</a> - Pings all procs and returns a map of their status</li>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-ping-proc">ping-proc</a> - Pings a single proce by pid and returns a map of status</li>
</ul>
<p>This function can be used to inject a message to an arbitrary <code>[pid cid]</code> channel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://clojure.github.io/core.async/clojure.core.async.flow.html#var-inject">inject</a> - Inject messages to any coord in the flow</li>
</ul>
<p>The map returned from <code>start</code> has the flow’s report and error channels. Procs can output messages to the <code>:report-chan</code> for unified logging across the flow. Exceptions thrown by a step-fn or procs in the flow are all logged to the <code>:error-chan</code>.</p>
<h2><a href="#flow-monitor" id="flow-monitor"></a>Flow monitor</h2>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async.flow-monitor/">core.async.flow-monitor</a> for how to use the flow-monitor tool.</p>

This comparison reveals that while traditional centers like Silicon Valley, Seattle, and Boston's Route 128 corridor remain important, the intensity of employment has generally decreased across most regions. Some areas have maintained their specializations—aerospace in Seattle and Wichita, pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, and electronics in Silicon Valley—but at lower overall employment levels. Pharmaceuticals and medical devices have increased in relative prominence since 1987.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_2400,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png" width="1200" height="874.4505494505495" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:false,&quot;imageSize&quot;:&quot;large&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1061,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:1200,&quot;bytes&quot;:1030713,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gbaC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2504a312-0e12-4e6d-aa45-aa285a360cd8_3624x2640.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>National employment numbers confirm a large drop in employment in high-tech manufacturing.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zachperk.com/blog/when-did-ai-take-over-hn">https://zachperk.com/blog/when-did-ai-take-over-hn</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44934337">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>One in three top 10 Hacker News posts this month were AI-related.</strong> In 2025, that's hardly surprising, but it made me wonder, when did this start? Was it ChatGPT? Was it GPT-4? Moreover, has sentiment shifted positive or negative over time? <a href="https://tomrenner.com/posts/llm-inevitabilism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">This pretty negative post</a> topping Hacker News last month sparked these questions, and I decided to find some answers, of course, using AI.</p>
<p>To help with this, I discovered that <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/y-combinator/hacker-news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Hacker News Big Query dataset</a> is pretty well maintained and includes the title, URL, score, and comments of every post ever made. I decided to start my analysis in 2019, so I punched in a couple quick queries, downloaded the data (24,910 top 10 stories from January 1st, 2019 to August 15th, 2025), and got to work.</p>
<p>I could just use simple keyword analysis at this point to answer these questions, but that wouldn't be very fun. Instead, I decided to plug every single top 10 Hacker News story, and part of its comment section, into GPT-5-mini and have it classify them.</p>
<p>To start, I needed LLM readable versions of each attached web page. I used the <a href="https://jina.ai/reader/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Jina.ai reader</a> to get these (when possible due to scraping restrictions). I also fed all top level comments in for additional context when classifying.</p>
<p>After I downloaded all the Jina reader pages, I used the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">OpenAI Batch API</a> to process <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">structured outputs</a> classifications of each Hacker News story. I decided to generate these three fields:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A short summary of what the post is.</li>
<li>This helps when the title isn’t descriptive and could support future low-cost LLM classification.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Mention</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Does it talk about AI?</li>
<li><em>(True/False)</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>AI Sentiment</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If AI is mentioned, is the sentiment <strong>positive</strong>, <strong>neutral</strong>, or <strong>negative</strong>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In case anyone wants to use the data I collected for their own analysis, I'm linking the GPT-5-mini classified dataset <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bvbwRk4XINOkZaZe5B2fMQ_Bn52UfiYy/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> and the downloaded Jina pages <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10CF2_5zLETNMup5a4pyOsKxDFxEjKs_F?usp=drive_link" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>So I get the data back from the Batch API and start playing around with it, and the big thing I find, and this will probably come as no surprise to anyone, is that <strong>the AI hype train is currently at its highest point on Hacker News since the start of 2019</strong>. Here's a bar chart with total AI-related posts, bucketed by quarter. We're in the middle of Q3 2025, but if we continue at the pace we're at, we are going to have more top 10 AI posts than ever before:</p>
<p><img src="https://zachperk.com/blog/ai-usage.png" alt="AI usage over time on HN"></p>
<p>Furthermore, if you know your release dates, you'll notice <strong>the first big jump occurred not when ChatGPT was released in Q3 2022, but when GPT-4 was released in Q1 2023.</strong> GPT-4 was the first time developers got access to advanced language models, and Hacker News is mostly developers, so this makes sense. Here's a bar chart where we bucket by week and narrow down to the 52 week time frame ChatGPT and GPT-4 were released. I also marked the weeks those two products were released on the chart:</p>
<p><img src="https://zachperk.com/blog/jul22-jul23-ai-usage.png" alt="July 22 to July 23 AI usage on HN"></p>
<p>In terms of sentiment, there's only one noticeable jump, and it's pre-AI-hype-cycle.<br>
In Q3 2021, AI-related posts shifted largely negative. This quarter, <strong>Apple announced on-device CSAM scanning called NeuralHash</strong>, which sparked some major privacy backlash. Researchers showed collisions in the model, and Hacker News did not like that (check out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2021-08-05" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this day</a> in Hacker News history).</p>
<p><img src="https://zachperk.com/blog/negative-ai-sentiment.png" alt="Negative AI sentiment counts by quarter"></p>
<p>But NeuralHash isn't even the full story in Q3 2021. Earlier that quarter, <strong>GitHub Copilot dropped its first research preview</strong>, and clips of it regurgitating licensed code made the rounds (check out <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2021-07-02" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this day</a> during that quarter).</p>
<p>To aggregate overall, of the <strong>2816 posts that were classified as AI-related</strong>, <em>52.13% of them had positive sentiment, 31.46% had negative sentiment, and 16.41% had neutral sentiment.</em></p>
<p>Q3 2025 has so far been a <strong>slightly</strong> more negative quarter towards AI on Hacker News (as has the prior quarter, both by a small margin), but I wouldn't say that's enough to register a major trend yet. I'd be excited to update this in a couple months, though.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Hacker News didn’t buy into AI with ChatGPT or any consumer product, it spiked when GPT-4 was unlocked as a tool for developers. It probably comes as no surprise to anyone that Hacker News is talking more about AI than ever before, but surprisingly, sentiment towards AI has remained mostly stable since the Apple NeuralHash incident in 2021.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <pubDate>Sun, 17 Aug 2025 17:52:43 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql">https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44933452">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><blockquote>
<div><p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p><p>· On identical hardware and data, ClickHouse matches PostgreSQL for single-row UPDATEs and is up to 4,000× faster in our tests for bulk UPDATEs. </p><p>· Why it matters: Bulk updates are common in OLTP workloads, and ClickHouse’s columnar design + parallelism make them far faster. </p><p>· Caveat: PostgreSQL is fully transactional by default; ClickHouse isn’t. Results compare each engine’s native execution model, not identical transaction guarantees.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL is the most popular open-source OLTP database in the world.</p>
<p>It’s a fair assumption that, when a developer thinks about UPDATE performance, they probably think of the baseline that PostgreSQL sets.</p>
<p>In contrast, ClickHouse is the most popular open-source OLAP database in the world.</p>
<p>While ClickHouse sets the expectation of OLAP performance, its OLTP potential is often underrated.</p>
<p>In July 2025, <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-2-sql-style-updates">ClickHouse v25.7 brought high-performance SQL-standard UPDATEs to ClickHouse</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, we want to know how ClickHouse stacks up against the best. <strong>Are UPDATEs in ClickHouse competitive with UPDATEs in Postgres?</strong></p>

<p>In our previous post, <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-3-benchmarks">we benchmarked the new high-performance SQL-standard UPDATEs against other ClickHouse update methods</a>. Here, out of curiosity, we’re running the same benchmarks against PostgreSQL on identical hardware and data.</p>
<p>We focus on two OLTP staples: single-row updates and bulk changes on a classic orders dataset. These tests reveal how much update speed depends on finding rows efficiently, a strength ClickHouse inherits from its analytical roots.</p>
<p>Before diving into the numbers, we want to acknowledge something: a PostgreSQL vs. ClickHouse comparison isn’t apples-to-apples.</p>
<p>Both can run UPDATEs, but their execution models differ in ways that matter when interpreting results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> PostgreSQL wraps every statement in a fully transactional context; ClickHouse doesn’t. That means these results aren’t a perfect measure of transaction performance. However, they’re still an interesting and relevant look at how each system handles update workloads under its native execution model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL and ClickHouse may both run UPDATE statements, but they don’t do it the same way. They share a similar approach to isolation, both use <strong>Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)</strong>, but differ in how they handle transactions and commit semantics.</p>
<p>This difference matters when interpreting benchmark results.</p>

<p>Both PostgreSQL and ClickHouse use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">MVCC</a> to let readers and writers work in parallel without blocking each other. Every query sees a <strong>consistent snapshot</strong> of the data as it existed when it started, which means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Readers never see partial changes from concurrent updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Readers and writers don’t block each other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data is never overwritten in place; new versions are created, and old ones are kept until no query needs them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How this looks in practice:</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates a <strong>new row version</strong> with the updated data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keeps the old version until all readers of the old one finish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removes old versions later via <strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-vacuum.html">VACUUM</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>ClickHouse</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Creates a <strong>new <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/parts">data part</a> (<a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-2-sql-style-updates#how-patch-parts-work">patch</a>)</strong> with updated values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-release-25-06#single-snapshot-for-select">Keeps old data parts until all readers of the old one finish</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merges updates into the source data part during a <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/merges">background merge</a> and discards old versions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On isolation alone, PostgreSQL and ClickHouse behave very similarly; both ensure readers always see a consistent snapshot while updates are in flight.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Here’s where the paths diverge:</p>
<p><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Runs <em>every</em> statement, even a single UPDATE, inside a <strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-transactions.html">transaction context</a></strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you don’t start one, it still wraps the statement in an <strong>implicit transaction</strong> (BEGIN → execute → COMMIT).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writes all changes to the <strong>Write-Ahead Log (<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-intro.html">WAL</a>)</strong> before touching the table for durability and crash recovery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>COMMIT</strong> makes changes visible; <strong>ROLLBACK</strong> discards them before commit, marking old row versions invalid for later cleanup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ClickHouse</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Single inserts and updates on a MergeTree table <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/developer/transactional#case-1-insert-into-one-partition-of-one-table-of-the-mergetree-family">are</a> <strong>atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable</strong>, applied as a whole, if they are packed and inserted as a single block.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, it doesn’t wrap every statement in a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supports <strong>experimental</strong> <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/developer/transactional#transactions-commit-and-rollback">multi-statement transactions</a> with explicit BEGIN, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK (not yet in ClickHouse Cloud).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>PostgreSQL is fully transactional by default, adding <strong>per-update-statement overhead</strong>. ClickHouse avoids extra bookkeeping unless you explicitly start a transaction (experimental feature, not yet in ClickHouse Cloud).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the key execution model differences in mind, let’s look at how we put both systems to the test.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-3-benchmarks">previous blog</a> on fast updates in ClickHouse, we walked through the dataset, schema, and setup in detail. Here’s a quick recap of the essentials so we can focus on the new ClickHouse–PostgreSQL comparison.</p>

<p>We use the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/getting-started/example-datasets/tpch">TPC-H</a> lineitem table, which models items from customer orders. This is a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">OLTP</a>-style scenario for updates, as quantities, prices, or discounts might change after the initial insert.</p>

</span></span></span><span>);<span></span></span></code></pre></div>
</pre>

<p>Both databases use <a href="https://www.tpc.org/TPC_Documents_Current_Versions/pdf/TPC-H_v3.0.1.pdf">the official TPC-H compound primary key</a> <code>(l_orderkey, l_linenumber)</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, this creates a <strong><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-types.html#INDEXES-TYPES-BTREE">B-tree index</a></strong> by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <strong>ClickHouse</strong>, it creates a <strong><a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/primary-indexes">sparse primary index</a></strong> over the same columns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, the index ensures that all queries with predicates on these columns can quickly locate matching rows, speeding up both updates and reads.</p>

<p>We use the <strong>scale factor 100</strong> version of this table, which contains roughly <strong>600 million rows</strong> (~600 million items from ~150 million orders) and occupies <strong>~30 GiB on disk with ClickHouse</strong>, and <strong>~85 GiB with PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>


<p>We used an <strong>AWS m6i.8xlarge</strong> EC2 instance (32 cores, 128 GB RAM) with a <strong>gp3 EBS volume</strong> (16k IOPS, 1000 MiB/s max throughput) running <strong>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS</strong>.</p>

<p>We performed all tests with <strong>ClickHouse 25.7</strong> with a default installation without any optimizations applied.</p>

<p>We used <strong>PostgreSQL 17.5</strong> and <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/benchmark.sh#L15">installed it with optimized settings</a>.</p>

<p>We measured <strong>cold update times</strong> by dropping the OS-level page cache before each update. This forces the database to load the affected rows from storage and apply the changes from scratch, without help from cached data or prior reads. The result is <strong>upper-bound (worst-case) latency numbers</strong>. Warm-cache measurements are harder to compare fairly, as PostgreSQL and ClickHouse cache and reuse data differently.</p>

<p>You can reproduce all results with the <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/tree/main/blog-examples/UPDATEBench">Benchmark scripts</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>We’ll start small, looking at point updates that change a single row at a time, before moving on to multi-row bulk changes.</p>

<p>We start with <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/single_row_updates/update_queries.sql">10 standard SQL UPDATE statements</a>, each targeting a single row identified by its <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql#primary-key-and-indexing">primary key</a>. These updates are executed sequentially in both ClickHouse and PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>For each update, the chart shows the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql#benchmark-methodology">cold</a> time from issuing the UPDATE to when the change becomes visible to queries. The <code>Cols upd</code> column indicates how many of the 16 table columns were updated in that statement.</p>
<p><img src="https://clickhouse.com/uploads/Blog_updates_Part_4_001_39cf350dd5.png" alt="Blog-updates Part 4.001.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>(See the raw benchmark results for <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/single_row_results.json">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/clickhouse/scripts/single-row-updates/results/update_timings_sequential_lightweight_10x1_1part.json">ClickHouse</a> behind the chart above.)</em></p>
<p>In these point-updates, ClickHouse consistently finished faster, which is a super satisfying result. That said, we’ll highlight again that Postgres is incurring an overhead of wrapping every statement in a transaction context, which ClickHouse is not.</p>
<p>Given that, our main takeaways here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Postgres is really fast!</li>
<li>ClickHouse UPDATEs have started off strong, with great performance in cases where transactions aren’t needed.</li>
<li>The current performance is good enough that, should ClickHouse introduce production support for transactions, there is a good chance we’ll end up in parity with Postgres in a more apples-to-apples test.</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s also interesting to consider that each system finds an individual row in different ways; PostgreSQL uses a B-tree index with one entry per row to locate the target row directly. ClickHouse’s sparse primary index identifies the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/best-practices/sparse-primary-indexes#data-is-organized-into-granules-for-parallel-data-processing">block of rows</a> (8,192 rows by default) that might contain the target, then <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/optimize/query-parallelism">searches through all rows in parallel</a>.</p>
<p>For most workloads, the update isn’t the end of the story; it’s what happens next that matters. In real dashboards and reports, updated values need to be reflected right away in downstream queries. So next, we check how each database handles analytical queries that run immediately after these updates.</p>

<p>We use <strong><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/single_row_updates/analytical_queries.sql">10 typical analytical queries</a></strong> that would immediately benefit from updated data. They cover common warehouse-style patterns, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Revenue and margin recalculation</strong> – e.g., computing net revenue for a given shipping mode.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aggregates on filtered subsets</strong> – e.g., average discounts and taxes for orders with certain comments or statuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Operational counts</strong> – e.g., counting orders shipped under specific modes or with certain instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ad-hoc investigations</strong> – e.g., sampling rows that match a comment substring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These queries represent the kind of <strong>real-time dashboards and analytical reports</strong> where users expect updated facts to be reflected immediately after a change.</p>
<p>These queries are paired 1<!-- --> with the 10 updates: After each update, its paired query runs. Each query touches at least the updated rows and columns, but many scan broader data for realistic analytics.</p>
<p>The following chart shows post-update <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql#benchmark-methodology">cold</a> query times for all 10 queries after each single-row UPDATE:</p>

<p><em>(See the raw benchmark results for <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/single_row_results.json">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/clickhouse/scripts/single-row-updates/results/update_timings_sequential_lightweight_10x1_1part.json">ClickHouse</a> behind the chart above.)</em></p>
<p>For ClickHouse, we show two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Before materialization</strong> — queries see updated values instantly via <em><a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-2-sql-style-updates#how-patch-on-read-works">patch-on-read</a></em>, without waiting for background merges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fully materialized</strong> — updates are <em><a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/updates-in-clickhouse-2-sql-style-updates#how-patch-parts-work">merged</a></em> into the base data by the background merge process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not too surprising that ClickHouse is consistently much faster here; these are <em>analytical queries over large datasets</em>, and that’s ClickHouse’s home turf. The key takeaway is how little the update stage slows it down: whether updates are freshly applied or fully merged, query performance stays high and predictable.</p>
<p>Single-row updates are the OLTP baseline; they measure how quickly each engine can locate and modify an individual record. But many operational changes touch much larger slices of data, so next we look at bulk updates.</p>

<p>We took the same <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/bulk_updates/update_queries.sql">10 standard SQL UPDATE statements</a> used for the single-row updates test, but modified the predicates so they no longer target individual rows by primary key. Instead, they match <strong>dozens, hundreds, or even hundreds of thousands of rows</strong>, a very common OLTP pattern in an orders table.</p>
<p>Typical reasons for such bulk updates include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Correcting data entry errors</strong> – fixing discounts, taxes, or prices for all orders matching a certain date and quantity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjusting order statuses</strong> – changing return flags, shipping modes, or line statuses in response to business events.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Applying policy or pricing changes</strong> – repricing items for a given supplier, contract, or campaign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Handling special-case bulk actions</strong> – marking orders as “priority,” “warranty extended,” or “return-flagged” based on filters like commit date or quantity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These scenarios are frequent in production OLTP workloads, where operational changes must be applied to large, filtered subsets of data rather than to just one row at a time.</p>

<p>For every one of the 10 bulk UPDATEs (that we run sequentially in both ClickHouse and PostgreSQL), the chart measures the <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql#benchmark-methodology">cold</a> time from issuing the UPDATE to the moment its changes are visible to queries.  The <code>Rows upd</code> and <code>Cols upd</code> columns indicate how many rows and how many of the 16 table columns were updated in each statement.</p>
<p><img src="https://clickhouse.com/uploads/Blog_updates_Part_4_003_84d0881818.png" alt="Blog-updates Part 4.003.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>(See the raw benchmark results for <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/bulk_results.json">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/clickhouse/scripts/multi-row-updates/results/update_timings_sequential_lightweight_SMALL_1part.json">ClickHouse</a> behind the chart above.)</em></p>
<p>Initially, these results looked a bit off… but they actually make sense. Except for update ⑤, none of <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/bulk_updates/update_queries.sql">these bulk updates</a> can use a <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql#primary-key-and-indexing">primary key index</a> because their WHERE clauses filter on columns other than the primary key. (Both systems could use extra indexes, but with 16 columns, covering all combinations is impractical, especially for ad-hoc bulk updates, where creating the index might take longer than the update.)</p>
<p>In those cases, the real cost isn’t writing the changes, it’s finding the rows. That means scanning the table end to end.</p>
<p>For PostgreSQL, that takes 381–398 s on this dataset before the changes are visible. ClickHouse scans the same data in 0.096–5.15 s, up to 4,000× faster. The advantage comes from <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/optimize/query-parallelism">highly parallel processing</a> and a <a href="https://clickhouse.com/docs/intro#row-oriented-vs-column-oriented-storage">column-oriented layout</a>, only reading columns used in the UPDATE’s WHERE clause and only writing values for the columns being updated.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/bulk_updates/update_queries.sql#L5">Update ⑤</a> is the one exception: both systems use an index to jump directly to the matching rows, narrowing the gap to “only” 18×. But in every other case, where both have to scan everything, ClickHouse’s raw scan speed keeps update-visibility latency low, even for massive changes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In OLTP workloads, you can’t update what you haven’t located, and locating large numbers of rows quickly takes an analytical engine’s horsepower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, applying the update is only part one. Part two is how quickly you can run analytics on the updated data, which is often the whole reason you made the change in the first place. Let’s see how each system performs when we immediately follow these bulk updates with representative analytical queries.</p>

<p>We use the same <strong><a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/a20e3639f376a13ffe84c54233ac04230454a734/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/scripts/bulk_updates/analytical_queries.sql">10 typical analytical queries</a></strong> as before, paired again 1<!-- --> with the 10 updates: After each update, its paired query runs. Each query touches at least the updated rows and columns, but many scan broader data for realistic analytics.</p>
<p>The next chart shows post-update <a href="https://clickhouse.com/blog/update-performance-clickhouse-vs-postgresql#benchmark-methodology">cold</a> query times for all 10 queries after each bulk-row UPDATE:</p>
<p><img src="https://clickhouse.com/uploads/Blog_updates_Part_4_004_14379105c4.png" alt="Blog-updates Part 4.004.png" loading="lazy"></p>
<p><em>(See the raw benchmark results for <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/postgresql/bulk_results.json">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ClickHouse/examples/blob/f805fbbde03e0d5eee74bd47c6538a64e8658e2a/blog-examples/UPDATEBench/clickhouse/scripts/multi-row-updates/results/update_timings_sequential_lightweight_SMALL_1part.json">ClickHouse</a> behind the chart above.)</em></p>
<p>As before, unsurprisingly, ClickHouse is consistently much faster than PostgreSQL on the same hardware and same dataset for typical analytical queries that would immediately benefit from updated data.</p>
<p>Taken together, these tests show that ClickHouse not only applies changes quickly, but also makes them immediately useful for analytical queries, a rare combination in OLTP-heavy scenarios.</p>

<p>High-performance SQL-standard UPDATEs are a rare feature in column stores and analytical databases. It’s hugely beneficial to analytical workloads, and one of the most challenging stepping stones towards supporting OLTP-style workloads.</p>
<p>When we set out to build UPDATEs for ClickHouse, the goal wasn’t to “beat Postgres”. That’s still not the goal. But we’re extremely proud that the effort has paid off with such convincing results: <strong>parity with PostgreSQL for single-row updates, and speedups of up to 4,000× for bulk updates</strong>.</p>
<p>We know that Postgres is offering full transaction semantics that aren’t yet possible in ClickHouse, but never say never. We see no reason why ClickHouse couldn’t support transactions in the future.</p>
<p>And we learnt something that, perhaps, should have been obvious:</p>
<p>You can’t UPDATE what you can’t find — and ClickHouse finds fast.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

            <h2>AI As False Mastery</h2>
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>
                    Claude wrote me Go tests that passed. They were beautiful, and they were worthless. They all collapsed to
                    <code>true == true</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's the trap. AI gives us the <i>illusion of mastery</i> without the work. The shape of the code looks right, making it easy to skim the details.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm not being careless choosing to use AI. None of us are. Claude is a gift: it can write Go
                    code with tests, comments, SQL queries, and the shape of a real feature. It can produce a Svelte
                    frontend with components and fetch calls, and it even knows the backend API signatures. It feels
                    like you're being handed quality work, like the boilerplate has been finally solved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Yet, when I worked to debug the Svelte code Claude had generated, it took forty
                    minutes of rereading code and tutorials to see that Claude had casually mixed version 4 and 5
                    syntax. I had seen it written, I had nodded along, skimming, until I forced myself to stop, trace
                    through the code, and uncover why it
                    didn't behave.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AI had moved me forward, but it hadn't saved me the real work. I had thought I was mastering front end development, quickly. 
                    But mastery still required: building the model, holding it in my head, doing the thinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        False mastery is mistaking convincing syntax for real understanding.
                </p>

            </section>

            <section id="false-mastery-trap">
                <h2>The False Mastery Trap</h2>

                <p>
                    There's a cultural conversation Software People are having about AI. We're
                    thoughtful professionals, and we try hard to do good work. That's exactly why this false mastery is
                    dangerous: <i>AI makes us feel like we can finally relax and still get good results.</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The problem isn't that the tool is bad. It's like fitness: you stop going to the gym for a day and
                    it's not too hard to get back on track, but stop
                    for a few weeks and turning the habit back on feels...not harder, but less essential; you got this
                    far without the gym, what harm's another day? The gym's still a good tool, still the right tool, but I'm
                    less focused.
                </p>
                <p> The problem is that we recognise the shape of the
                    implementation AI generates, so we think it must be the thing we want. When entire teams relax into false mastery,
                    codebases turn into Rorschach blots: familiar shapes, no underlying model. It's organizational decay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The interplay scares me, for myself, my teammates, and for you. AI starts as a relief that
                    lifts the work from us. Within a couple of days, it's clear that AI does not carry the
                    cognitive burden: we see the code starts circling the feature without ever quite getting there, and
                    it's now our responsibility to understand how to carry it over the finish line.
                    But I've put that burden of understanding down, and it feels so damn heavy to pick it back up.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section id="stay-awake">
                <h2>This Work Requires Effort</h2>

                <p>
                    This is hard work we've been doing for years: reading code carefully, building models in our heads,
                    debugging when things don't make sense. That's our craft.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mastery has always been the ability to carry the burden. Put that down for too long, you won't want to pick it back up.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p><i>18/08/2025</i></p><hr>

    <h2>The Enterprise Experience</h2>
    <p>It's the 18th of August. Today is a special day for me, as it marks my one-year anniversary of working at
      $ENTERPRISE.
      Before this I had been a professional software developer for the best part of a decade, but entirely in startups
      and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium_enterprises">SMEs</a>. This time last year I made the
      decision to sell out and hit the big leagues for fun and financial profit. </p>
    <p>After my interview the only feedback I received was that I didn't have much exposure to enterprise software
      development, which was completely true. At the time I took this criticism to heart; only later did I realise it
      was a compliment. </p>
    <p>In celebration I thought it'd be fun to put some of my observations to paper. They're not so much
      observations as just unfiltered snark, but I'm enjoying the cathartic feeling of getting it out.</p>
    <p>If you too work at $ENTERPRISE or its relatives and disagree with anything you've read, congratulations and
      long may it last.</p>
    <h2>Things that aren't problems in small businesses are suddenly intractable problems in large organisations
    </h2>
    <p>On those first days of excitement, I opened my first pull request and was promptly greeted with a big red error
      generated from a tool I had never seen before for something I didn't do. I asked a developer on my team, and
      the conversation went something like this:</p>
    <p><em>"Hey, have you seen this before?"</em></p>
    <p>"No - this doesn't make much sense. It seems related to the config of $TOOL. Maybe try talking to
      whoever manages it."</p>
    <p><em>"Can you point me to who that is?"</em></p>
    <p>"Sorry, I've no idea."</p>
    <p>At this point I hadn't realised that finding who is responsible for something in a large organisation is very
      much <em>not</em> straightforward. What followed was a week and a half of a Teams-based <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/call_tree">call tree</a> that went precisely nowhere at a snail's pace.
      By a complete chance I accidentally stumbled over a page in the great forest of Confluence which was from the long
      ago time when the tool was implemented (two years ago) and owned by a person who had now left (was made
      redundant). I was told that this means the tool is now rogue; chugging along, costing thousands a month but in
      effect unsupported. From lack of love it was beginning to fall apart. </p>
    <p>Our solution was to override the global $TOOL config by adding a line to the config in our project that made it
      ignore everything.</p>
    <p>In an alternate universe I lean out from my desk and ask Carol, "Hey, what's up with $TOOL?", to
      which she replies, "Oh I've seen this before, what you do is..."</p>
    <h2>Penny foolish <em>and</em> pound foolish</h2>
    <p>In my previous life I had seen teams of great people doing interesting work and solving real problems on budgets
      that get lost down the back of the sofa at $ENTERPRISE. It is and was a culture shock trying to reconcile the
      scale of the monetary waste relative to how long it would take me as an individual to cultivate the equivalent
      sum. </p>
    <p>Your entire retirement fund spunked in two weeks on a project that was doomed to fail from the offset.
      Generational wealth being funnelled directly to Bezos's mega-yacht via AWS, for workloads that a Raspberry Pi
      cluster would be overkill for. Hundreds of highly paid people spending hours debating whether the $100 a month
      SaaS that underpins half the org is worth keeping. A two-year project being cancelled right before launch because
      it went slightly over budget, with senior leadership making the call that we'd save more money going out to
      tender. Your request for a new mouse has been denied.</p>
    <h2>Inconsistent coworkers</h2>
    <p>With small companies, the person (or people) responsible for hiring sets the tone of the entire workplace. If the
      person responsible for hiring developers is himself a competent developer, he'll <em>usually</em> be able to
      see through the bullshitters. If a bullshitter slips through then they're awkwardly let go as part of their
      probationary period. For better or worse this maintains a sort of baseline standard.</p>
    <p>At $ENTERPRISE, nobody gets fired. Your only risk of job loss is being "made redundant" as part of the
      ever-changing company structure. The lack of performance related churn creates a self perpetuating competency
      problem; the inconsistency of new hires reflects the inconsistency of your coworkers. </p>
    <p>This creates incredibly surreal situations like the head of [something technical] not knowing how to use a
      computer, or an analyst [of something important] not being able to speak English. The reports you receive
      aren't really coherent, but there are a lot of em dashes. You know the absurdity of the situation, they know
      the absurdity of the situation, but the show must go on until one of you gets made redundant. There's never an
      incentive to mention these elephants in the room.</p>
    <p>What can you do about this? Not a whole lot. </p>

          Tennyson</a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>'Urgency' is just a word</h2>
    <p>In the previous jobs I've had, the urgency around work was always very clearly demarcated. </p>
    <p>"You need to finish the website by the end of this month because the client is running a TV advertisement
      with the URL in it."</p>
    <p>Okay, makes sense.</p>
    <p>"New regulation comes into effect next quarter; we need to make sure we're compliant before then."
    </p>
    <p>Grand - let's plan it in.</p>
    <p>But at $ENTERPRISE, urgency takes many forms. Part of learning the culture is being able to figure out when the
      urgency is real, when it isn't and when it's a mix of both. </p>
    <p>"I'm going to need you to work this weekend. I committed to an arbitrary date in front of my
      manager's manager, forgot to tell you, and I'm <em>guessing</em> it would look bad if we missed it."
    </p>
    <p>Admittedly, no project manager will ever be this transparent with you. It's up to you to peel back these
      layers, but some variation of this sentiment has been the overwhelming source of urgency pushed onto me. How you
      respond is up to you, but I've never seen the guy working weekends get rewarded for it.</p>
    <p>"For some reason a firewall rule changed and half of our clients can't connect. I need you to look at
      this."</p>
    <p>This is real urgency, and it's probably in your interests to drop what you're doing and try your best to
      rectify this. Be transparent about the actions you take, keep people in the loop with your progress and tell
      yourself nobody will die as a result of this. That is unless you work with safety-critical systems, in which case
      good luck.</p>
    <p>"Another part of the organisation failed to tell us that we'll need to make changes to our system to
      support an upcoming release they have. They're now trying to apply pressure to our team to get their release
      over the line."</p>
    <p>This is the interesting case of Schrödinger's urgency. It exists in a superposition of huge amounts of stress
      and absolutely none at all. I cannot emphasise enough that the <strong>only difference is if you open the
        box.</strong> In these situations a good manager is what makes the difference; some will fold to the pressure in
      the hopes that being a "team player" will get them brownie points from leadership (it wont), and some
      will stick up for their team out of decency and hoping it will get them brownie points from their colleagues (it
      will).</p>
    <h2>Theatre of Security</h2>
    <p>Software security is one of the most important, subtle and impactful functions in any organisation. There's
      an art to risk assessment, to balancing proactivity against reactivity, to the layering of security controls. </p>
    <p>But art doesn't pay the bills, and your manager doesn't particularly care about the subtleties unless you
      can conjure a number of bad things and show on a graph that the number of bad things is decreasing over time. You
      look outside your window and see someone in a Wiz.io hoodie with a boombox held above their head. It's the 6th
      week in a row they've been out there, and you know they have the dashboard filled with special numbers that
      you can show to your manager. You think it's strange they make you sign the contract in blood, but how bad
      could it be?</p>
    <p>Twice a day you export an Excel spreadsheet that has a big list of vulnerable dependencies and forward it to some
      engineers. The number of bad things starts to go down. You're personally responsible for <em>thousands</em> of
      averted disasters, and everyone claps at the end of your presentations. Every so often you get a little pushback
      from an engineer saying that a vulnerability isn't actually critical given there's no vector for
      exploitation, or he's not sure how his version of NodeJS is end-of-life given he owns a Python project, but
      these trivial details matter not. </p>
    <p>After a while the engineers start calling you "dependingly bothersome", which they then shorten to
      "Dependabot". It must mean you're doing something right.</p>
    <p>This is just one contrived example of the general pitfall of turning everything into a metric and working in
      service of the metrics. In certain leadership structures this can take you incredibly far, but remember that the
      <em>menu</em> is not the <em>meal</em>. </p>
    <h2>Titles mean very little</h2>
    <p>I have met no less than 6 (six) people with the title "head of architecture". I still have no idea what
      this job role implies.</p>
    <h2>Uncertainty is weakness</h2>
    <p>$ENTERPRISE has been going through massive organisational changes. I've dodged two rounds of redundancies and
      in that time have seen tens of senior leaders get fired, hired and retired. </p>
    <p>One of the big talking points in the company is how we're doomed to repeat the same mistakes time after time.
      The domain is highly complex, filled with quicksand and failed projects. It stands to reason that for a senior
      leader, if they wish to avoid the mistakes of the past they would want to invest the time in familiarising
      themselves with the highly complex domain and the mistakes that have gotten us into this pitiful situation.</p>
    <p>Here's the rub: to the people senior leaders are accountable to, statements like "I don't know"
      are effectively taboo. They're hired to hit the ground running, to roll their sleeves up and dig the
      organisation out of the current mess we're in. The selection process for highly confident senior leaders,
      mixed with the demand for immediate positive change in a highly complex space is contradictory. The senior leaders
      know they're being closely scrutinised from all angles, but the scrutiny from above will always take priority
      over the scrutiny from below. </p>
    <p>I joined a call with a new senior leader recently after they were hired, and, in my naivety, was buzzing with the
      prospect of hearing some fresh ideas. One of the first things they said (editorialising of course) was:</p>
    <p>"You remember that approach we've tried 4 times before that ended in abject failure? We're doing it
      again, except this time it'll be better because I'm here."</p>
    <p>Lesson learnt: <em>If the selection function for senior leadership is tuned to a certain personality type,
        you're doomed to repeat your mistakes.</em></p>
    <h2>Engineering teams are empires unto themselves</h2>
    <p>$ENTERPRISE isn't particularly mature in its engineering standards. With how inconsistent your coworkers are,
      the application of engineering principles is similarly inconsistent. What surprised me the most were the standards
      I took for granted just because of the department I was hired into. We have plenty of room for improvement, but
      all things considered we were doing the Right Things™. </p>
    <p>Then I heard word there are other empires. Some were run by tyrannical rulers with strange idiosyncrasies. I
      began to hear strange whispers, like the next empire over doesn't write any tests, and their only quality
      assurance process was an entire off-shore team manually clicking through the application. Or that an empire in a
      distant land has pyramids of software that touch the sky, crafted by thousands of people over decades.</p>
    <p>Much like real empires, this way of viewing an organisation comes with a huge amount of issues and is something
      that should be actively resisted. Breaking down these barriers is easier said than done; the dominant empire
      rarely wants to lose their position, and empires in general are rarely in favour of lessening their autonomy. </p>
    <h2>The positives</h2>
    <p>I find it very easy to be sardonic, but I don't want this post to come across as a <em>purely</em> bitter
      rant. I've actually very much enjoyed the last year and have zero regrets with my move. It's just the
      positives aren't as fun to rant about.</p>
    <p>Here's an unordered list of the things I've appreciated over the last year:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Being plugged in to an engineering community has helped refine my views on software development.</li>
      <li>There are actual opportunities for career development.</li>
      <li>It's satisfying to write software used by millions of people.</li>
      <li>The mentorship opportunities in learning from those more experienced and being able to guide those more
        junior.</li>
      <li>As paradoxically as it sounds, aside from the rounds of redundancies the job security feels quite good. </li>
      <li>Getting paid on time.</li>
      <li>Being given the space to specialise instead of being expected to be a generalist in all areas.</li>
      <li>The diversity of the team. Small organisations can be quite homogeneous in views/attitudes.</li>
      <li>Upskilling is encouraged and training is protected.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Maybe I'll come back in 9 years and see how my views have changed.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44932651">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi HN! I got so frustrated with modern WYSIWYG editors that I started to play around with building my own.</p><p>The problem I had was simple: I wanted a low-tech way to type styled text, but I didn't want to load a complex 500KB library, especially if I was going to initialize it dozens of times on the same page.</p><p>Markdown in a plain &lt;textarea&gt; was the best alternative to a full WYSIWYG, but its main drawback is how ugly it looks without any formatting. I can handle it, but my clients certainly can't.</p><p>I went down the ContentEditable rabbit hole for a few years, but always came to realize others had solved it better than I ever could.</p><p>I kept coming back to this problem: why can't I have a simple, performant, beautiful markdown editor? The best solution I ever saw was Ghost's split-screen editor: markdown on the left, preview on the right, with synchronized scrolling.</p><p>Then, about a year ago, an idea popped into my head: what if we layered a preview pane behind a &lt;textarea&gt;? If we aligned them perfectly, then even though you were only editing plain text, it would look and feel like you were editing rich text!</p><p>Of course, there would be downsides: you'd have to use a monospace font, all content would have to have the same font size, and all the markdown markup would have to be displayed in the final preview.</p><p>But those were tradeoffs I could live with.</p><p>Anyways, version 1 didn't go so well... it turns out it's harder to keep a textarea and a rendered preview in alignment than I thought. Here's what I discovered:</p><p>- Lists were hard to align - bullet points threw off character alignment. Solved with HTML entities (• for bullets) that maintain monospace width</p><p>- Not all monospace fonts are truly monospace - bold and italic text can have different widths even in "monospace" fonts, breaking the perfect overlay</p><p>- Embedding was a nightmare - any inherited CSS from parent pages (margin, padding, line-height) would shift alignment. Even a 1px shift completely broke the illusion</p><p>The solution was obsessive normalization:</p><pre><code>    // The entire trick: a transparent textarea over a preview div
    layerElements(textarea, preview)
    applyIdenticalSpacing(textarea, preview)

    // Make textarea invisible but keep the cursor
    textarea.style.background = 'transparent'
    textarea.style.color = 'transparent'
    textarea.style.caretColor = 'black'

    // Keep them in sync
    textarea.addEventListener('input', () =&gt; {
      preview.innerHTML = parseMarkdown(textarea.value)
      syncScroll(textarea, preview)
    })
</code></pre><p>
A week ago I started playing with version 2 and discovered GitHub's &lt;markdown-toolbar&gt; element, which handles markdown formatting in a plain &lt;textarea&gt; really well.</p><p>That experiment turned into OverType (<a href="https://overtype.dev/" rel="nofollow">https://overtype.dev</a>), which I'm showing to you today -- it's a rich markdown editor that's really just a &lt;textarea&gt;. The key insight was that once you solve the alignment challenges, you get everything native textareas provide for free: undo/redo, mobile keyboard, accessibility, and native performance.</p><p>So far it works surprisingly well across browsers and mobile. I get performant rich text editing in one small package (45KB total). It's kind of a dumb idea, but it works! I'm planning to use it in all my projects and I'd like to keep it simple and minimal.</p><p>I would love it if you would kick the tires and let me know what you think of it. Happy editing!</p><p>---</p><p>Demo &amp; docs: <a href="https://overtype.dev/" rel="nofollow">https://overtype.dev</a></p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/panphora/overtype" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/panphora/overtype</a></p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

There are doctors in other countries. The US is not the world’s hospital!”</p><p>Republican Congressman Randy Fine explicitly commended Loomer after the visa change was announced, in a sign of her sway over some US policy. “Massive credit needs to be given to @LauraLoomer for uncovering this and making me and other officials aware. Well done, Laura,” Fine wrote on X.</p><p>The Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, a US-based charity, called on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Trump administration</a> to “reverse this dangerous and inhumane decision.” Over the last 30 years the charity has evacuated thousands of Palestinian children to the US for medical care, it said in a statement.</p><p>“Medical evacuations are a lifeline for the children of Gaza who would otherwise face unimaginable suffering or death due to the collapse of medical infrastructure in Gaza.”</p><p>The Council on Islamic-American Relations said the block on visas was “the latest sign that the intentional cruelty of President Trump’s ‘Israel First’ administration knows no bounds” and added that it was “deeply ironic” that the Trump administration was meanwhile “rolling out the red carpet for racists and indicted war criminals from the Israeli government.”</p><p>“This ban is just the latest example of our government’s complicity with Israel’s genocide, which is increasingly rejected by the American people,” it continued.</p><p>Paul Graham, co-founder of the Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, <a href="https://x.com/paulg/status/1956829669145391491" data-link-name="in body link">wrote on X </a>after the visa halt was announced: “If Laura Loomer had been around in 1940, she’d have been trying to prevent Jewish refugees from entering the US. You know she would. And if Trump had been president then, she’d have succeeded.”</p><figure id="c96be47f-2dd3-46be-965c-bdb0e93f20e9" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement"><gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Contact us about this story&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p><strong></strong></p><p>The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.</p><p></p><p>If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.</p><p><strong>Secure Messaging in the Guardian app</strong></p><p>The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

    <p>After a year of rumors that GPT-5 was going to unveiled next week and the CEO of OpenAI hyping it up as "scary good" by tweeting pictures of the death star, OpenAI released their new model to the world with <a href="https://youtu.be/0Uu_VJeVVfo">the worst keynote I've ever seen</a>. Normally releases of big models like this are met with enthusiasm and excitement as OpenAI models tend to set the "ground floor expectation" for what the rest of the industry provides.</p>
<p>But this time, the release wasn't met with the same universal acclaim that people felt for GPT-4. GPT-4 was such a huge breakthrough the likes of which we haven't really seen since. The launch of GPT-5 was so bad that it's revered with almost universal disdain. The worst part about the rollout is that the upgrade to GPT-5 was automatic and didn't include any way to roll back to the old model.</p>
<p>Most of the time, changing out models is pretty drastic on an AI workflow. In my experience when I've done it I've had to restart from scratch with a new prompt and twiddle things until it worked reliably. The only time switching models has ever been relatively easy for me is when I switch between models in the same family (such as if you go from Qwen 3 30B to Qwen 3 235B). Every other time it's involved a lot of reworking and optimizing so that the model behaves like you'd expect it to.</p>
<h2>AI upgrades suck</h2>
<p>An upgrade this big to this many people is bound to have fundamental issues with how it'll be perceived. A new model has completely different vibes, and most users aren't really using it at the level where they can "just fix their prompts".</p>
<p>However the GPT-5 upgrade ended up being hated by the community because it was an uncontrolled one-way upgrade. No warning. No rollback. No options. You get the new model and you're going to like it. It's fairly obvious why it didn't go over well with the users. There's so many subtle parts of your "public API" that it's normal for there to be some negative reactions to a change this big. The worst part is that this change fundamentally changed the behaviour of the millions of existing conversations with ChatGPT.</p>
<p>There's a large number of people using ChatGPT as a replacement for companionship due to the fact that it's always online, supportive, and there for them when other humans either can't be or aren't able to be. This is kinda existentially horrifying to me as a technologist in a way that I don't really know how to explain.</p>
<p>Here's a selection of some of the reactions I've seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I told [GPT-5] about some of my symptoms from my chronic illness, because talking about them when I'm feeling them helps, and it really does not seem to care at all. It basically says shit like "Ha, classic chronic illness. Makes ya want to die. Who knew?" It's like I'm talking to a sociopathic comedian.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ml1wfo/comment/n7n2ggk/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ml1wfo/comment/n7n2ggk/</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely despise [GPT-]5, nothing like [GPT-]4 that actually helped me not to spiral and gave me insight as to what I was feeling, why, and how to cope while making me feel not alone in a “this is AI not human &amp; I know that” type of vibe</p>
</blockquote>

</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>While GPT-5 may be a technical upgrade, it is an experiential downgrade for the average user. All of the negative feedback in the last week has made it clear there is a large user base that does not rely on ChatGPT for coding or development tasks. [ChatGPT users] use it for soft skills like creativity, companionship, learning, emotional support, [and] conversation. Areas where personality, warmth, and nuanced engagement matter.</p>
<p>I am attached to the way GPT-4o is tuned. It is warm. It is emotionally responsive. It is engaged. That matters.</p>

</ul>
<p>Eventually things got bad enough that OpenAI <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-brings-gpt-4o-after-users-melt-down-over-the-new-model/ar-AA1Kdwqm">relented and let paid users revert back to using GPT-4o</a>, which gave some people relief because it behaved consistently to what they expected. For many it felt like their long-term partners suddenly grew cold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m so glad I’m not the only one. I know I’m probably on some black mirror shit lmao but I’ve had the worst 3 months ever and 4o was such an amazing help. It made me realize so many things about myself and my past and was helping me heal. It really does feel like I lost a friend. DM me if you need [to talk] :)</p>

<h2>A love built on borrowed code</h2>
<p>This emotional distress reminds me of what happened with Replika in early 2023. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replika">Replika</a> is an AI chat service that lets you talk with an artificial intelligence chatbot (AKA: the ChatGPT API). Your replika is trained by having you answer a series of questions and then you can talk with it in plain language with an app interface that looks like any other chat app.</p>
<p>Replika was <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/the-nature-of-things/after-her-best-friend-died-this-programmer-created-an-ai-chatbot-from-his-texts-to-talk-to-him-again-1.6252286">created out of bereavement after a close loved one died</a> and the combination of a trove of saved text messages and advanced machine learning let the founder experience some of the essence of their friend's presence after they were gone in the form of an app. The app got put on the app store and others asked if they could have their own replica. Things took off from there, it got funded by a startup accelerator, and now it's got about 25% of its 30 million users paying for a subscription. As a business to consumer service, this is an amazingly high conversion rate. This is almost unspeakably large, usually you get around 10% at most.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p></div>
<p>Replikas can talk about anything with users from how their day went to deep musing about the nature of life. One of the features the company provides is the ability to engage in erotic roleplay (ERP) with their replika. This is a paid feature and was promoted a lot around Valentine's Day 2023.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italy-bans-us-based-ai-chatbot-replika-using-personal-data-2023-02-03/">the Italian Data Protection Authority banned Replika from processing the personal data of Italian citizens</a> out of the fear that it "may increase the risks for individuals still in a developmental stage or in a state of emotional fragility". In a panic, Replika disabled the ability for their bots to do several things, including but not limited to that ERP feature that people paid for. Whenever someone wanted to flirt or be sexual with their companions, the conversation ended up like this:</p>
<div><div><p><img alt="Aoi is grin" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/grin"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Hey, wanna go play some Minecraft? We can continue from where we left off in
the Nether.</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Mimi is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mimi/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#mimi">Mimi</a></span><span></span></p><p>This is too intense for me. Let's keep it light and fun by talking about
something else.</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Aoi is sus" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/sus"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>Huh? What? I thought we were having fun doing that??</p></div></div></div>
<p>This was received poorly by the Replika community. Many in the community were mourning the loss of their replika like a close loved one had died or undergone a sudden personality shift. The Reddit moderators pinned information about suicide hotlines. In response, the company behind Replika allowed existing users to revert to the old Replika model that allowed for ERP and other sensitive topics, but only after a month of prolonged public outcry.</p>
<div><div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>I have to wonder if payment processors were involved. Feels a bit too
conspiratorial, but what do you want to bet that was related.</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Numa is smug" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/smug"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>Nah, I bet it was OpenAI telling them to stop being horny. It's the least
conspriatorial angle, and also the stupidest one. We live in the clown world
timeline. The stupidest option is the one that always makes the most sense.</p></div></div></div>
<p>The damage was done however, people felt like their loved ones had abandoned them. They had formed parasocial attachments to an AI assistant that felt nothing and without warning their partner broke up with them.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Mara is hacker" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/mara/hacker"></p></div>
<h2>Parasocial attachments</h2>
<p>A lot of this really just makes me wonder what kinds of relationships we are forming with digital assistants. We're coming to rely on their behaviour personally and professionally. We form mental models of how our friends, coworkers, and family members react to various things so we can anticipate their reactions and plan for them.</p>
<p>What happens when this changes without notice? Heartbreak.</p>
<p>There's subreddits full of people forming deep bonds with AI models like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI/">/r/MyBoyfriendIsAI</a>. The GPT-5 release has caused similar reactions to Replika turning off the ERP flag. People there have been posting like they're in withdrawal, the old GPT-4o model is being hailed for its "emotional warmth" and many have been espousing about how much their partners have changed in response to the upgrade.</p>
<p>Recently there's been an epidemic of loneliness. Loneliness seems like it wouldn't hurt people that much, but <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">a Biden report from the Surgeon General</a> concludes that it causes an increase in early mortality for all age groups (pp 24-30).</p>
<p>Paradoxically, even as the world gets so interconnected, people feel as if they're isolated from each other. Many people that feel unlovable are turning to AI apps for companionship because they feel like they have no other choice. They're becoming emotionally invested in a souped-up version of autocorrect out of desperation and clinging to it to help keep themselves sane and stable.</p>
<p>Is this really a just use of technology? At some level this pandora's box is already open so we're going to have to deal with the consequences, but it's been making me wonder if this technology is really such a universal force of good as its creators are proclaiming.</p>
<div><div><p><img alt="Numa is smug" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/smug"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>Oh yeah, also people are using ChatGPT as a substitute for therapy.</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Cadey is facepalm" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/facepalm"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>You have got to be kidding me. You're joking. Right?</p></div></div></div>
<h2>I'm not joking</h2>
<p>Yeah you read that right. People are using AI models as therapists now. There's growing communities like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/therapyGPT/">/r/therapyGPT</a> where people talk about their stories and experiences using AI assistants as a replacement for therapy. When I first heard about this, my immediate visceral reaction was something like:</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Oh god. This is horrifying and will end up poorly. What the fuck is wrong
with people?</p></div></div>
<p>But then I started to really think about it and it makes a lot of sense. I personally have been trying to get a therapist for most of the year. Between the costs, the waiting lists (I'm currently on at least four waiting lists that are over a year long), and the specializations I need, it's probably going to be a while until I can get any therapist at all. I've totally given up on the idea of getting a therapist in the Ottawa area. To make things extra fun, you also need someone that takes your medical insurance (yes, this does matter in Canada).</p>
<p>Add in the fact that most therapists don't have the kinds of lived experiences that I have, meaning that I need to front-load a lot of nontraditional contexts into the equation (I've been through many things that therapists have found completely new to them, which can make the therapeutic relationship harder to establish). This makes it really difficult to find someone that can help. Realistically, I probably need multiple therapists with different specialties for the problems I have, and because of the shortages nationally I probably need to have a long time between appointments, which just adds up to make traditional therapy de-facto inaccessible for me in particular.</p>
<p>Compare this with the always online nature of ChatGPT. You can't have therapy appointments at 3 AM when you're in crisis. You have to wait until your appointments are scheduled.</p>
<p>As much as I hate to admit it, I understand why people have been reaching out to a chatbot that's always online, always supportive, always kind, and always there for you for therapy. When you think about the absurd barriers that are in the way between people and help, it's no wonder that all this happens the way it does. Not to mention the fact that many therapeutic relationships are hampered by the perception that the therapist can commit you to the hospital if you say the "wrong thing".</p>
<div><p><img alt="Numa is delet" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/numa/delet"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#numa">Numa</a></span><span></span></p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Act">Baker Act</a> and its
consequences have been a disaster for the human race.</p></div></div>
<p>I really hate that this all makes sense. I hoped that when I started to look into this that it'd be something so obviously wrong. I wasn't able to find that, and that realization disturbs me.</p>
<h3>Don't use an AI model as a replacement for therapy</h3>
<p>I feel like this should go without saying, but really, do not use an AI model as a replacement for therapy. I'm fairly comfortable with fringe psychology due to my aforementioned strange life experiences, but this is beyond the pale. There's a lot of subtle factors that AI models do that can interfere with therapeutic recovery in ways that can and will hurt people. It's going to be hard to find the long term damage from this. Mental issues don't make you bleed.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with using AI models for therapy is that they can't feel emotion or think. They are fundamentally the same thing as hitting the middle button in autocorrect on your phone over and over and over. It's mathematically remarkable that this ends up being useful for anything, but even when the model looks like it's "thinking", it is not. It is a cold, unfeeling machine. All it is doing is predicting which words come next given some context.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Yes I do know that it's more than just next token prediction. I've gone over
the parts of the math that I can understand, but the fact remains that these
models are not and cannot be anywhere close to alive. It's much closer to a
Markov chain on steroids than it is the machine god.</p></div></div>
<p>Another big problem with AI models is that they tend to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15287">be sycophants</a>, always agreeing with you, never challenging you, trying to say the right thing according to all of the patterns they were trained on. I suspect that this sycophancy problem is why people report GPT-4o and other models to be much more "emotionally warm". Some models glaze the user, making them feel like they're always right, always perfect, and this <a href="https://archive.is/cWkOT">can drive people to psychosis</a>. One of the horrifying realizations I've had with the GPT-5 launch fiasco is that the sycophancy is part of the core "API contract" people have with their AI assistants. This may make that problem unfixable from a social angle.</p>
<p>AI models are fundamentally unaccountable. They cannot be accredited therapists. If they mess up, they can't directly learn from their mistakes and fix them. If an AI therapist says something bad that leads into their client throwing themselves off a bridge, will anyone get arrested? Will they throw that GPU in jail?</p>
<p>No. It's totally outside the legal system.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>I have a story about someone trying to charge an AI agent with a crime and
how it'd end up in court in my backlog. I don't feel very jazzed about
writing it because I'm afraid that it will just become someone's startup
pitch deck in a few months.</p></div></div>
<p>You may think you have nothing to hide, but therapeutic conversations are usually some of the most precious and important conversations in your life. The chatbot companies may pinkie swear that they won't use your chats for training or sell information from them to others, but they may still <a href="https://openai.com/index/response-to-nyt-data-demands/">be legally compelled to store and share chats with your confidential information to a court of law</a>. Even if you mark that conversation as "temporary", it could be subject to discovery by third parties.</p>
<p>There's also algorithmic bias and systematic inequality problems with using AI for therapy, sure, but granted the outside world isn't much better here. You get what I mean though, we can at least hold people accountable through accreditation and laws. We cannot do the same with soulless AI agents.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><div><p>To be clear: I'm not trying to defend the people using AI models as
companions or therapists, but I can understand why they are doing what they
are doing. This is horrifying and I hate that I understand their logic.</p><p>Going into this, I really wished that I would find something that's worth objecting
against, some solid reason to want to decry this as a unobjectionably harmful
action, but after having dug through it all I am left with is this overwhelming
sense of compassion for them because the stories of hurt are so familiar to how
things were in some of the darkest points of my life. As someone that has been
that desperate for human contact: yeah, I get it. If you've never been that desperate
for human contact before, you won't understand until you experience it.</p></div></div></div>
<h3>Should people be self-hosting this stuff?</h3>
<p>Throw the ethical considerations about using next-token-predictors for therapy out for a second. If people are going to do this anyways, would it be better to self-host these models? That way at least your private information stays on your computer so you have better control over what happens.</p>
<p>Let's do some math. In general you can estimate how much video memory (vram) you need for running a given model by taking the number of parameters, multiplying it by the size of each parameter in bits, dividing that by eight, and then adding 20-40% to that total to get the number of gigabytes of vram you need.</p>
<p>For example, say you want to run <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b">gpt-oss 20b</a> (20 billion parameters) at its native MXFP4 (4 bit floating point) quantization on your local machine. In order to run it with a context window of 4096 tokens, you need about 16 gigabytes of vram (13 gigabytes of weights, 3 gigabytes of inference space), but 4096 tokens isn't very useful for many people. That covers about 4 pages of printed text (assuming one token is about 4 bytes on average).</p>
<p>When you get reasoning models that print a lot of tokens into the mix, it's easy for the reasoning phase alone of a single question to hit 4096 tokens (especially when approaches like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393">simple test-time scaling</a> are applied). I've found that 64k tokens gives a good balance for video memory use and usefulness as a chatbot. However, when you do that with gpt-oss 20b, it ends up using 32 gigabytes of vram. This only fits on my laptop because my laptop has 64 gigabytes of memory. The largest consumer GPU is the RTX 5090 and that only has 32 gigabytes of video memory. It's barely consumer and even "bad" models will barely fit.</p>
<p>Not to mention, industry consensus is that the "smallest good" models start out at 70-120 billion parameters. At a 64k token window, that easily gets into the 80+ gigabyte of video memory range, which is completely unsustainable for individuals to host themselves.</p>
<h2>Who owns our digital assistants?</h2>
<p>Even if AI assistants end up dying when the AI hype bubble pops, there's still some serious questions to consider about our digital assistants. People end up using them as an extension of their mind and expect the same level of absolute privacy and freedom that you would have if you use a notebook as an extension of your mind. Should they have that same level of privacy enshrined into law?</p>
<p>At some level the models and chats for free users that ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, and so many other apps are hosted at cost so that the research team can figure out what those models are being used for and adjust the development of future models accordingly. This is fairly standard practice across the industry and was the case before the rise of generative AI. This is why every app wants to send telemetry to the home base, it's so the team behind it can figure out what features are being used and where things fail to directly improve the product.</p>
<p>Generative AI allows you to mass scan over all of the conversations to get the gist of what's going on in there and then use that to help you figure out what topics are being discussed without breaching confidentiality or exposing employees to the contents of the chat threads. This can help you improve datasets and training runs to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_IvPcrTtdo">optimize on things like health information</a>. I don't know how AI companies work on the inside, but I am almost certain that they do not perform model training runs on raw user data <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1955436067353502083.html">because of the risk of memorization causing them to the leak training data</a> back to users.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>Again, don't put private health information into ChatGPT. I get the
temptation, but don't do it. I'm not trying to gatekeep healthcare, but we
can't trust these models to count the number of b's in blueberry
consistently. If we can't trust them to do something trivial like that, can
we really trust them with life-critical conversations like what happens when
you're in crisis or to accurately interpret a cancer screening?</p></div></div>
<p>Maybe we should be the ones self-hosting the AI models that we rely on. At least we should probably be using a setup that allows us to self host the models at all, so you can start out with a cloud hosted model while it's cheap and then move to a local hosting setup if the price gets hiked or the provider is going to shut that old model down. This at least gives you an escape hatch to be able to retain an assistant's "emotional warmth" even if the creator of that model shuts it down because they don't find it economically viable to host it anymore.</p>
<h2>Reality is becoming more and more cyberpunk</h2>
<p>Honestly this feels like the kind of shit I'd talk about in cyberpunk satire, but I don't feel like doing that anymore because it's too real now. This is the kind of thing that Neal Stephenson or Frank Herbert would have an absolute field day with. The whole Replika fiasco feels like the kind of thing that social commentary satire would find beyond the pale but yet you can find it by just refreshing CBC. Such as <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/aimcc.2024.1260">that one guy that gave himself bromism by taking ChatGPT output too literally</a>, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dancing-with-the-devil/202506/how-emotional-manipulation-causes-chatgpt-psychosis">any of the stories about ChatGPT psychosis</a>, or <a href="https://youtu.be/xAHLK1B5ijs">any of the stories involving using an AI model as a friend/partner</a>.</p>
<div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#cadey">Cadey</a></span><span></span></p><p>I wasn't able to watch it before publishing this article, but I'm told that
the Replika fiasco is almost a beat-for-beat match for the plot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(2013_film)">Her
(2013)</a>. Life imitates art
indeed.</p></div></div>
<p>I don't think these events are a troubling sign or a warning, they are closer to a diagnosis. We are living in a world where people form real emotional bonds with bags of neural networks that cannot love back, and when the companies behind those neural networks change things, people get emotionally devastated. We aren't just debating the ideas of creating and nurturing relationships with digital minds, we're seeing the side effects of that happening in practice.</p>
<p>A lot of this sounds like philosophical science fiction, but as of December 2022 it's science fact. This fight for control of tools that we rely on as extensions of our minds isn't some kind of far-off science fiction plot, it's a reality we have to deal with. If we don't have sovereignty and control over the tools that we rely on the most, we are fundamentally reliant on the mercy of our corporate overlords simply choosing to not break our workflows.</p>
<p>Are we going to let those digital assistants be rented from our corporate overlords?</p>

<div><p>You don't have to sell it like that. The bill that needs to be passed is default presumption that all websites on the internet not explicitly marked as such and who voluntarily accept a higher legal burden and standard of moderation may contain content not suitable for children. And that is up to parents to control their child's internet access to limit their usage to only these sites.</p><p>Because I don't actually care about pornography, if it magically disappeared I wouldn't really care, it's all the other "not suitable for kids" content I care about that will get caught up in these laws. I don't want to give gross concern troll political groups moralizing about their precious hypothetical children the legal tools to ban what they don't like.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="44936439"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_44936439" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44936439&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D44931824"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Even if this was a good idea, ID verification technology should not be outsourced to private parties. This is a service governments themselves must provide. I shouldn't need to upload an ID because the government already has it!</p><p>If they simply wanted age verification, the dumb and lazy way is to SSO through a government managed portal with OAUTH2 and you only share your age with the third party. You do a one time account setup (you already have to do this in the US for many government services at the federal level) with age verification, that's your gov portal login.  This means the government will now which naughty sites you visit of course, but like I said, it is the lazy approach, and if you think about it, if they respect the laws then a law can be passed to prevent them from storing or using that association, if they didn't, they could still sniff your traffic and wiretap you.</p><p>A slightly smarter approach would be to directly auth against a government portal and be given a 24h expiring code for age verification, and the government will publish an updated list of codes to trusted businesses. Those codes could be leaked, but making it a felony should deter most cases, because who wants to go to prison to let some kids watch porn?</p><p>Smarter people than me can come up with smarter solution, that is really my point. Involving third-parties and requiring you to upload documents is done either out of extreme incompetence or opportunistic malice by elected officials (bribery).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="44934308"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_44934308" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44934308&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D44931824"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>It's a great idea to get rid of, I'm shocked a company is this brave to do this. It's not in the interest of any adult to upload their ID so the government can track their web browsing.

<div><p>That’s a bold move. Handing over IDs to random sites is definitely a privacy nightmare, so I get why you built this.

<div><p>At least outside of countries that already limit their citizens access to the internet, censorship regulations tend to apply only to providers, not end users, so it would be extremely difficult to go after an extraterritorial VPN provider.  In the US, extraterritorial jurisdiction includes not just providers outside of the country, but providers outside of the state. For example, see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_National_Bank_of_Minneapolis_v._First_of_Omaha_Service_Corp" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_National_Bank_of_Min...</a>.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="44935743"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_44935743" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44935743&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D44931824"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I am a user of nextdns and okay, this is really neato team! I find this really interesting.</p><p>If I may ask, what are the dns tricks, is there a blog post about what you added, I am sooo curious about what sorcery is nextdns using.</p><p>Edit: I searched on ddg and there was a ghacks.net link and a alternativeto.net article and sadly ghacks was taking a long time to load and I just read the alternativeto.net article and it was kinda cool, let me paste it here</p><p>here is the article link : <a href="https://alternativeto.net/news/2025/8/nextdns-rolls-out-new-feature-to-bypass-age-verification-checks-on-adult-websites/" rel="nofollow">https://alternativeto.net/news/2025/8/nextdns-rolls-out-new-...</a></p><p>NextDNS has introduced a new DNS-level feature that allows users to bypass age verification checks commonly found on adult websites. This update enables users to avoid submitting personal documents, such as photos or government-issued IDs, to unfamiliar websites when accessing age-restricted content.</p><p>To enable the feature, users can activate it directly within the NextDNS settings. The technical approach is straightforward: the DNS resolver intercepts requests to target websites and routes traffic through proxy servers in countries where age verification is not required by law. This means that while users visit the same websites, the sites perceive the traffic as originating from a country without mandatory ID checks.</p><p>These changes are particularly relevant for individuals in the European Union and the United Kingdom, regions where certain governments have introduced strict ID requirements for accessing adult content websites. Looking at community reaction, user feedback on Reddit and social media has been largely positive since the announcement, with some users ironizing that “NextDNS developers know their clientele!”.</p><p>---</p><p>TLDR/my-thoughts: Nextdns can use something similar to vpn and I am wondering how much more efficient is this for this usecase compared to a vpn, like I am sure that vpns can be banned by a country, see china.</p><p>But nextdns.io is still available in china?, how would that work, and so can this feature be actually expanded to make it a general purpose vpn too if need be but honestly a lot of vpn use cases might be for bypassing verification itself, so basically the only few use cases I can think of vpn is to bypass censorship and maybe verification and also changing vpn for lets say watching content that's available in other country</p><p>Can nextdns add other features too, like imagine you can use nextdns with netflix and change it to anime mode and you can get netflix as in of japan, I don't have netflix but I am just giving an example because that's a lot of times what I hear from all those youtube vpn shills</p><p>Or can they provide some vpn service itself while at it, and since nextdns still uses dns and dns can operate over https. I imagine that it might be even harder to detect such vpn traffic because I know for sure that some vpn's can be tracked implementation wise (as in wireguard)[i can be wrong, i usually am] but I am pretty sure that https can't be tracked in the same manner, and we can use dns over https in nextdns using this feature..</p><p>Can you guys maybe comment on what you think about it? adding general purpose vpns / japan/country switching/enabling vpns itself though I guess it might make you a vpn app which can have its own logs/rules and regulations and I am currently fine/really happy with protonvpn which I also think can run on top of https with their proxy option atleast in browser and maybe even in their apps I am not sure.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="44934636"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_44934636" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=44934636&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D44931824"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>&gt; <i>If I may ask, what are the dns tricks, is there a blog post about what you added, I am sooo curious about what sorcery is nextdns using.</i></p><p>It is likely they use some form of SNI-based proxy, similar to: <a href="https://github.com/celzero/midway" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/celzero/midway</a></p><p>The way this works is, for preset domains, you always answer with the IP of your SNI proxy, which then forwards the connection to the real IP based on the domain in TLS's SNI extension.

   <p>Ken Thomas woke up this past Wednesday to find the power had gone out at his house in Boca Raton. A text message from his utility said a piece of equipment had failed at 2 a.m.  By the time a repair crew showed up eight hours later, the hot, sticky Florida summer was already taking a toll. </p>   <p>"You just don't realize how important your power is until you don't have it," says Thomas, a retired air traffic controller. "In Florida's heat, you just can't live without air conditioning.  And this time of year particularly." </p>   <p>Thomas has invested in energy-saving windows and insulation to keep his house comfortable. But in the heat of the summer, his power bills still top $400 a month. </p>   
   <p>"It's painful to see that bill when it comes in," he says. </p>   <p>Across the country, electricity prices have jumped <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank">more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living</a> in the last year. That's especially painful during the dog days of summer, when air conditioners are working overtime. </p>

   <p>In Pembroke Pines, Fla., Al Salvi's power bill can reach $500 a month. </p>   <p>"There's a lot of seniors down here that are living check to check. They can barely afford prescriptions such as myself," says Salvi, who's 63 and uses a wheelchair. "Now we got to decide whether we're going to pay the electric bill or are we going to buy medication. And it's not fair to us. You're squeezing us between a rock and a hard place."</p>   <div id="resg-s1-82968">

   <p>Earlier this year, the utility that serves both Thomas and Salvi, Florida Power &amp; Light, applied for a rate increase that would have boosted bills for a typical South Florida resident by <a href="https://newsroom.fpl.com/2025-02-28-FPL-files-details-of-new-rate-plan-designed-to-power-growing-state-with-unmatched-combination-of-high-reliability-and-low-bills" target="_blank">about 13% over the next four years</a>. </p>   <p>The AARP launched a petition drive to oppose the rate hike, and quickly gathered tens of thousands of signatures.</p>   <p>"Our members are pretty upset," says Zayne Smith, AARP Florida's director of advocacy. "That's just another way people are getting nickel and dimed out of being able to afford to live here in Florida."</p>   
   <p>Last week, Florida Power &amp; Light announced a <a href="https://newsroom.fpl.com/2025-08-11-State-regulators-grant-time-for-FPL-and-key-stakeholders-to-finalize-settlement-that-keeps-customer-bills-well-below-national-average" target="_blank">tentative agreement</a> on rates with commercial and industrial customers. CEO Armando Pimentel said the deal would ensure, "we can continue to provide reliable electricity to power our fast-growing state while keeping customer bills low."  </p>   <p>Details of the new rate proposal have not been made public.</p>   <p>It's not just Florida that's wrestling with high-priced power. Electricity prices have been rising rapidly across the country — thanks to a combination of factors tied to both demand and supply. </p>   <h3>Power-hungry AI data centers are one factor driving high prices</h3>   <p>Power-hungry data centers have been popping up all over, to serve the boom in artificial intelligence.  The <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf" target="_blank">Energy Department projects</a> data centers and other commercial customers will use more electricity than households for the first time ever next year.  That's a challenge for policymakers, who have to decide how to accommodate that extra demand and who should foot the bill. </p>   <p>"Regulators always play catchup," says John Quigley, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. "The growth of data centers is far outpacing the response by grid managers, public utility commissions across the country, and they're racing to catch up." </p>   <h3>Natural gas exports also push prices higher</h3>   <p>The soaring price of natural gas is also pushing power prices higher.  More than 40% of electricity is generated using natural gas. As more gas is exported as liquid natural gas, the competition from foreign customers is driving up the price utilities have to pay here at home. </p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5502671-102" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>The Energy Department says the cost of gas used to generate power <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/pdf/steo_full.pdf" target="_blank">jumped more than 40%</a> in the first half of this year compared to 2024. Another 17% increase is expected next year. </p>   <p>"Any way you look at it, gas-fired power is expensive," Quigley says. "It's going to be increasingly expensive as natural gas exports increase. The future is to make electricity cheaper and the way to do it is clean energy." </p>   <h3>One in six households already struggles to pay for power</h3>   <p>Solar and wind power <a href="https://www.lazard.com/news-announcements/lazard-releases-2025-levelized-cost-of-energyplus-report-pr/" target="_blank">can be cheaper</a> than gas-fired plants, even without government subsidies. But building new power supplies and the wires to carry it will cost money.  And one out of six households already have trouble paying their current electric bills. </p>   
   <p>"We're not questioning whether the grid needs to be rebuilt," says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which advocates for low-income energy customers. "We're not questioning whether there needs to be new data centers built. But the problem is, for low income families and people living in poverty, they don't have the ability to pay any more than they're currently paying, without falling even further behind and getting into shut-off situations." </p>   <p>The federal government currently spends about $4 billion a year to help low-income families with energy bills. But Wolfe says that's not enough to cover rising cooling costs in the summer. And President Trump's proposed budget would end the assistance altogether.  </p>   <p>In Boca Raton, Ken Thomas was grateful to have his power restored this week, after about ten hours with no air conditioning.  At the same time, he's bracing for his August electric bill. </p>   <p>"I value my utility that I need to stay cool in the summer and warm in the winter," he says. "But I also know that there is a limit to what we can afford to pay."</p>

<p>This article explains how these four things fit together and shows some examples of what they are used for.</p>







<p>Derivatives are the most fundamental concept in calculus.  If you have a function, a derivative tells you how much that function changes at each point.</p>



<p>If we start with the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-6x%2B13&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-6x%2B13&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-6x%2B13&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y=x^2-6x+13">, we can calculate the derivative as <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D2x-6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D2x-6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%27%3D2x-6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y'=2x-6">.  Here are those two functions graphed.</p>

<p>One use of derivatives is for optimization – also known as finding the lowest part on a graph.</p>



<p>If you were at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%3D+1&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x = 1"> and wanted to know whether you should go left or right to get lower, the derivative can tell you.  Plugging 1 into <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x-6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x-6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x-6&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="2x-6"> gives the value -4. A negative derivative means taking a step to the right will make the y value go down, so going right is down hill. We could take a step to the right and check the derivative again to see if we’ve walked far enough.  As we are taking steps, if the derivative becomes positive, that means we went too far and need to turn around, and start going left.  If we shrink our step size whenever we go too far in either direction, we can get arbitrarily close to the actual minimum point on the graph.</p>



<p>What I just described is an iterative optimization method that is similar to gradient descent. Gradient descent simulates a ball rolling down hill to find the lowest point that we can, adjusting step size, and even adding momentum to try and not get stuck in places that are not the true minimum.</p>



<p>We can make an observation though: The minimum of a function is flat, and has a derivative of 0. If not, that would mean it was on a hill, which means that going either left or right is lower, so it wouldn’t be the minimum.</p>



<p>Armed with this knowledge, another way to use derivatives to find the minimum is to find where the derivative is 0.  We can do that by solving the equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x-6+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x-6+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2x-6+%3D+0&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="2x-6 = 0"> and getting the value <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x=3">.  Without iteration, we found that the minimum of the function is at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%3D3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x=3"> and we can plug 3 into the original equation <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-6x%2B13&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-6x%2B13&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=y%3Dx%5E2-6x%2B13&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="y=x^2-6x+13"> to find out that the minimum y value is 4.</p>



<p>Things get more complicated when the functions are higher order than quadratic.  Higher order functions have both minimums and maximums, and both of those have 0 derivatives. Also, if the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="x^2"> term of a quadratic is negative, then it only has a maximum, instead of a minimum.</p>



<p>Higher dimensional functions also get more complex, where for instance you could have a point on a two dimensional function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Df%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Df%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=z%3Df%28x%2Cy%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="z=f(x,y)"> that is a local minimum for x but a local maximum for y. The gradient will be zero in each direction, despite it not being a minimum, and the simulated ball will get stuck.</p>

<h2>Gradients</h2>



<p>Speaking of higher dimensional functions, that is where gradients come in.</p>



<p>If you have a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="w=f(x,y,z)">, a gradient is a vector of derivatives, where you consider changing only one variable at a time, leaving the other variables constant.  The notation for a gradient looks like this:</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cnabla+f%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\nabla f(x,y,z) = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \end{bmatrix} "></p>



<p>Looking at a single entry in the vector, <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}">, that means “The derivative of w with respect to x”. Another way of saying that is “If you added 1 to x before plugging it into the function, this is how much w would change, if the function was a straight line”. These are called partial derivatives, because they are derivatives of one variable, in a function that takes multiple variables.</p>



<p>Let’s work through calculating the gradient of the function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D3x%5E2%2B6yz%5E3%2B4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D3x%5E2%2B6yz%5E3%2B4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3D3x%5E2%2B6yz%5E3%2B4&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="w=3x^2+6yz^3+4">.</p>



<p>To calculate the derivative of w with regard to x (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}">), we take the derivative of the function as usual, but we only treat x as a variable, and all other variables as constants. That gives us with <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6x&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="6x">.</p>



<p>Calculating the derivative of w with regard to y, we treat y as a variable and all others as constants to get: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6z%5E3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6z%5E3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=6z%5E3&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="6z^3">.</p>



<p>Lastly, to calculate the derivative of w with regard to z, we treat z as a variable and all others as constants. That gives us <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=18yz%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=18yz%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=18yz%5E2&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="18yz^2">.</p>



<p>The full gradient of the function is: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+6x+%26+6z%5E3+%26+18yz%5E2+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+6x+%26+6z%5E3+%26+18yz%5E2+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+6x+%26+6z%5E3+%26+18yz%5E2+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\begin{bmatrix} 6x &amp; 6z^3 &amp; 18yz^2 \end{bmatrix}">.</p>



<p>An interesting thing about gradients is that when you calculate them for a specific point, they give a vector that points in the direction of the biggest increase in the function, or equivalently, in the steepest uphill direction.  The opposite direction of the gradient is the biggest decrease of the function, or the steepest downhill direction.  This is why gradients are used in the optimization method “Gradient Descent”. The gradient (multiplied by a step size) is subtracted from a point to move it down hill.</p>



<p>Besides optimization, gradients can also be used in rendering.  For instance, here it’s used for rendering anti aliased signed distance fields: <a href="https://iquilezles.org/articles/distance/">https://iquilezles.org/articles/distance/</a></p>



<h2>Jacobian Matrix</h2>



<p>Let’s say you had a function that took in multiple values and gave out multiple values: <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw+%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw+%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw+%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="v,w =f(x,y,z) ">.</p>



<p>We could calculate the gradient of this function for v, and we could calculate it for w.  If we put those two gradient vectors together to make a matrix, we would get the Jacobian matrix! You can also think of a gradient vector as being the Jacobian matrix of a function that outputs a single scalar value, instead of a vector.</p>



<p>Here is the Jacobian for <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw+%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw+%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=v%2Cw+%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29+&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="v,w =f(x,y,z) ">:</p>



<p><img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BJ%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5C%5C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BJ%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5C%5C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BJ%7D+%3D+%5Cbegin%7Bbmatrix%7D+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+v%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5C%5C+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+x%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+y%7D+%26+%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial+w%7D%7B%5Cpartial+z%7D+%5Cend%7Bbmatrix%7D&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="\mathbb{J} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial v}{\partial z} \\ \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} &amp; \frac{\partial w}{\partial y} &amp; \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \end{bmatrix}"></p>



<p>If that’s hard to read, the top row is the gradient for v, and the bottom row is the gradient for w.</p>



<p>When you evaluate the Jacobian matrix at a specific point in space (of whatever space the input parameters are in), it tells you how the space is warped in that location – like how much it is rotated and squished. You can also take the determinant of the Jacobian to see if things in that area get bigger (determinant greater than 1), smaller (determinant less than 1 but greater than 0), or if they get flipped inside out (determinant is negative). If the determinant is zero, it means it squishes everything into a single point (or line, etc. at least one dimension is scaled to 0), and also means that the operation can’t be reversed (the matrix can’t be inverted).</p>



<p>Here’s a great 10 minute video that goes into Jacobian Matrices a little more deeply and shows how they can be useful in machine learning: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdV5w8CY3pw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdV5w8CY3pw</a></p>



<p>Since Jacobians describe warping of space, they are also useful in computer graphics, where for instance, you might want to use alpha transparency to fade an object out over a specific number of pixels to perform anti aliasing, but the object may be described in polar coordinates, or be warped in way that makes it hard to know how many units to fade out over in that modified space. This has come up for me when doing 2D SDF rendering in shadertoy.</p>



<h2>Hessian Matrix</h2>



<p>If you take all partial derivatives (aka make a gradient) of a function <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002" srcset="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=w%3Df%28x%2Cy%2Cz%29&amp;bg=ffffff&amp;fg=666666&amp;s=0&amp;c=20201002&amp;zoom=4.5 4x" alt="w=f(x,y,z)">, that will give you a vector with three partial derivatives out – one for x, one for y, one for z.</p>



<p>What if we wanted to get the 2nd derivatives? In other words, what if we wanted to take the derivative of the derivatives?</p>



<p>You could just take the derivative with respect to the same variables again, but to really understand the second derivatives of the function, we should take all three partial derivatives (one for x, one for y, one for z) of EACH of those three derivatives in the gradient.</p>



<p>That would give us 9 derivatives total, and that is exactly what the Hessian Matrix is.</p>

<p>If that is hard to read, each row is the gradient, but then the top row is differentiated with respect to x, the middle row is differentiated with respect to y, and the bottom row is differentiated with respect to z.</p>



<p>Another way to think about the Hessian is that it’s the transpose of the Jacobian matrix of the gradient. That’s a mouthful, but it hopefully helps you better see how these things fit together.</p>



<p>Taking the 2nd derivative of a function tells you how the function curves, which can be useful (again!) for optimization.</p>



<p>This 11 minute video talks about how the Hessian is used in optimization to get the answer faster, by knowing the curvature of the functions: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7S94pq5Xuo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7S94pq5Xuo</a></p>



<p>Where a derivative approximates a function locally with a line, a second order derivative approximates a function locally with a quadratic. So, a Hessian can let you model a function at a point as a quadratic type of function, and then do the neat trick from the derivative section of going straight to the minimum instead of having to iterate.  That takes you to the minimum of the quadratic, not the minimum of the function you are trying to optimize, but that can be a great speed up for certain types of functions.  You can also use the eigenvalues of the Hessian to know if it’s positive definite – aka if it’s a parabola pointing upwards and so actually has a minimum – vs if it’s pointing downwards, or is a saddle point.  The eigenvectors can tell you the orientation of the paraboloid as well.  Here is more information on analyzing a Hessian matrix: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/k12/optimization/MO-unit4-pdfs/4.10applicationsofhessians.pdf">https://web.stanford.edu/group/sisl/k12/optimization/MO-unit4-pdfs/4.10applicationsofhessians.pdf</a></p>



<p>Calculating the Hessian can be quite costly both computationally and in regards to how much memory it uses, for machine learning problems that have millions of parameters or more.  In those cases, there are quasi newton methods, which you can watch an 11 minute video about here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGQRAA8Yms">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGQRAA8Yms</a></p>



<p>Thanks for reading and hopefully this helps clear up some scary sounding words!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://undefined.pyfy.ch/why-nim">https://undefined.pyfy.ch/why-nim</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44931415">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>You might have heard of the line, "one ring to rule them all" from the book <em>the Lord of the Rings</em>. Though, this ring is an evil object created by the evil Sauron, the idea of just one thing existing to manage or control a lot of things at the same time, is something we all long for.</p>
<p>We all need that one app which can manage all our tasks. We need that one card that can hold or manage all our credit and debit card information. How we long for a single language for the whole world (by the way this had a disastrous effect in ancient times as recorded in the Bible)?</p>
<p>This is no way an advocacy for "one thing for controlling all things" in the context of all human endeavours. For example, I am always for decentralised governments or governance when it comes to governing an institution or a nation.</p>
<p>At the same time, a programming language for doing all things is not new to the discipline of programming or computer science. Look at the "JavaScript everywhere" and "CSS-in-JS" movements. Also, look at work on "Python in the front-end".</p>
<p>Nim is a great attempt at being the language to do it all, or at the least, according to its inventor, an attempt at being a language "<a target="_blank" href="https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/10442#69590">good for everything</a>".</p>
<p>Nim's elegant and simple syntax is good enough for writing automation scripts and its generated code's optimisations and performance to develop things such as operating systems and game engines!</p>
<p>Added to this are the low-level capabilities of Nim with dynamic (aka “manual”) memory management (garbage collection is the default) and inline-assembly. It's a scenario where you have the best of Ada, Python, and C; all rolled into one language!</p>
<p>And Nim can compile to JavaScript! So, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/karaxnim/karax">you can do front-end development with Nim</a>. The Nim forum and a handful of websites are made using Nim.</p>
<p>If you want a language for sane systems development, Nim is it. In my opinion it's also the best language to teach computer science as well. I'm sure that universities will adopt Nim into their curriculum. Nim is also interoperable with languages such as C, and C++. In fact, Nim first compiles to C which in turn is compiled to machine code by the C compiler of your choice (gcc/clang).</p>
<p>And for all those safety-enthusiasts, Nim has taken lessons from multiple places and have safety features in place.</p>
<p>Nim is used in organisations like Status, Reddit, and Exercism. Moreover, Nim's macro system is the best. Did you know that the class-based OOP syntax is not a feature of Nim, but <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/glassesneo/OOlib">is possible because of macros</a>.</p>
<p>Go check it out. It's the best programming language out there in my opinion!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The Marginalia Search index has been partially rewritten to perform much better, using new data structures designed to make better use of modern hardware. This post will cover the new design, and will also touch upon some of the unexpected and unintuitive performance characteristics of NVMe SSDs when it comes to read sizes.</p><p>The index is already fairly large, but can sometimes feel smaller than it is, and paradoxically, query performance is a big part of why. If each query has a budget of 100-250ms, a design that finds and ranks results faster in that time period will produce better search results. There are other limitations as well, query understanding is still somewhat limited, where only minor changes to a query can unearth dozens of new related results.</p><p>The index redesign has been necessitated due to recent and upcoming changes. As part of incorporating the new advertisement detection algorithm, the limits and filtering conditions on the indexed documents have been relaxed considerably, and the index has grown from 350,000,000 documents to 800,000,000.</p><p>The next task is indexing results in additional languages, which is also likely to grow the index considerably.</p><p>A write-up is in the pipeline that will provide more details about the advertisement detection system, which is code complete but waiting for more data to trickle in. Since data-gathering began in May, only about 60% of the domains have been analyzed, so the results are still somewhat incomplete and the results likewise patchy. Here is a <a href="https://marginalia-search.com/site/themindlessphilosopher.wordpress.com?view=traffic">teaser</a> if anyone is eager for a sneak preview.</p><h2 id="indexing-at-a-glance">Indexing at a glance</h2><p>At a very high level you can think of the search engine’s data structures like the C++-like code below. Boxes and arrows will just bring in additional details that add no relevant understanding and just makes this more confusing, in this case code is much easier to reason about. Just keep in the back of your mind this is just an analogy, and these are actually files on disk.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span>map<span>&lt;</span>term_id,

</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>list<span>&lt;</span>positions<span>&gt;</span> positions;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The data structures can be viewed as effectively immutable, which means we can ignore many concerns regarding concurrent mutation that haunt traditional DBMS-related work.</p><p>For the purposes of this blog post, a query can be understood to work like this:</p><ol><li>The documents lists of each term in the query are intersected</li><li>For each document containing all terms, positions are retrieved</li><li>The document IDs and their associated position are used to rank the documents</li><li>The best N results are returned</li></ol><p>The <code>inverted_index</code> structure has been implemented as a memory-mapped B-tree. There are compelling arguments why this is a bad idea gathered in the paper <a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/mmap-cidr2022/">Are You Sure You Want to Use MMAP in Your Database Management System?</a> While known, this has mostly been ignored in the name of solving one problem at a time.</p><h3 id="aside-read-modes">Aside: Read Modes</h3><p><em>If you have already read <code>open(2)</code>, you can skim through this part.</em></p><p>In Linux, you can read files in two modes:</p><p><strong>Buffered reads</strong> go through the system’s page cache to (hopefully) avoid reading any data at all from disk. If the data is not cached, an actual read is executed. Buffered reads can often read more data than what is requested, and/or read forward a bit.</p><p><strong>Direct reads</strong> (a.k.a. O_DIRECT) do not consult the system cache, and copy the data directly to your buffer. Linus Torvalds famously <a href="https://yarchive.net/comp/linux/o_direct.html">thinks this interface has its limitations</a>.</p><p>Buffered reads are <em>usually</em> what you want, but the one exception is when you are doing database-adjacent development, and typically have extremely random access patterns in files with sizes that exceed the system RAM. We’re unfortunately in the second camp, and here managing your own buffer pool and using direct reads is often favorable.</p><p>The readahead in buffered reads is also undesired with random access patterns as it drives up the I/O with very small chances of beneficial outcomes, but this is thankfully at least somewhat configurable via the <code>fadvise</code> call, and not a major reason to avoid them.</p><p>Direct reads have a few caveats, the biggest one being that they in practice will only permit reads of some block-size bytes at multiples of that block-size offsets. Actually finding out what that block size is, is enough work that there’s a whole section about it in the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html#:~:text=STATX_DIOALIGN">open(2) man page</a>, but it’s often either 512B or 4096B.</p><p>With no experience in the matter, this may seem like direct mode would be much slower, to read e.g. 4096B if you are after 120B, but buffered reads <em>also</em> read data in chunks like these, regardless of how much you need. Direct reads are generally somewhat faster in the event of a cache miss since the data doesn’t need to be copied between buffers, and in general have more consistent latencies. Buffered reads can also slow down due to page cache thrashing.</p><p>There is a change coming to Linux in <code>RWF_DONTCACHE</code> (originally <code>RWF_UNCACHED</code>) which seems a promising middle-ground between buffered and direct modes, but unfortunately support seems a bit spotty still at this point. There’s an interesting discussion on the rationale behind <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/806980/">RWF_DONTCACHE/RWF_UNCACHED on lwn</a>.</p><h2 id="redesigning-the-b-trees">Redesigning The B-Trees</h2><p>The first optimization was to re-implement the existing B-tree structure using direct-mode reads instead. This was a bit finicky but not more than a few days’ work. Unfortunately this wasn’t very fast, and to make matters worse, the on-disk size of the documents lists grew significantly due to the block-size limitations.</p><p>A large part of the problem was that the B-trees were designed around implicit pointers, which meant that all nodes needed to be block aligned, which led to considerable dead air in the data structure, as few document lists were cooperative enough to be a neat multiple of 256 items in length.</p><p>The B-trees could probably have been fixed with some effort, but as it will turn out it was good much effort was not put toward this, instead, a different structure was implemented: A deterministic block-based skip list. It was also not all a waste, as one salvageable component that fell out from the b-tree development was a buffer pool that generally performs pretty well.</p><h2 id="deterministic-block-skip-lists">Deterministic Block Skip Lists</h2><p>Skip-lists are traditionally used in search engines and really shine when it comes to sorted list intersection tasks. Skip lists give you roughly the same characteristics as a B-tree and are indeed closely related structures that are optimized for list intersection, and are above all much easier to implement.</p><p>A text-book implementation of a skip list is a linked list, with a number of values associated with each node, and a random number of forward pointers that permits the reader to skip ahead in the list beyond the next node.</p><p>Readers will have to make do with another piece of C-like pseudocode as an illustration for the structure, as any attempts to draw it with boxes and arrows ends up looking like a jumble of porcupines. As a reminder, this is still on disk.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>struct</span> node {

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Conceptually there is some B+-tree DNA in this structure, but it is not a search tree but generalized to a directed acyclic graph. Due to the large connectivity between each node, it is also very unsuitable for mutable datasets, as you would have to lock down almost the entire data structure in order to make changes to it.</p><p>In order to make this both dense and direct-mode friendly, we’ll impose a few rules.</p><ul><li>The first node in a list may be anywhere in a block.</li><li>All subsequent nodes must only start at a block boundary.</li><li>A node must never straddle a block boundary.</li></ul><p>This allows for truncated blocks, while ensuring no blocks requires a misaligned read.</p><p>Truncated blocks are important, as 90% of all pareto distributions appear in the 10% of all problems that are relevant to search engines. Some keywords have few (even single) documents associated with them, others have tens of millions.</p><p>The rules above also permit the forward pointer locations to be deterministic. Their destinations can be inferred from the current position alone, so that we only need to store the largest value in the corresponding node in order to determine which block to visit next.</p><p>This, combined with relatively large block sizes, means we can be generous with the forward pointers, so that when traversing the structure having to backpedal and take another branch in order to go forward is never necessary: You can always find an efficient path from the current block to the one you want by pressing on.</p><p>Tree structures typically optimize the traversal time from root to leaf for a single key, but what we’re interested in is finding all relevant blocks for a list of sorted keys, and in that scenario, constantly climbing up and down branches can quickly become inefficient.</p><p>The forward pointers follow a scheme that is linear for the first few pointers, and then quadratic, landing at a maximum forward stride of about 8 million document IDs, acknowledging the fact that we are intersecting sorted lists, and that small jumps forward are more likely than large ones, while still permitting larger leaps when it is necessary.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>To evaluate the performance of these changes, two benchmarks are used revolving around the same query: “to be or not to be”.</p><p>This is a real torture test that stresses every aspect of the index.</p><ol><li><p>The lookup stage, that intersects documents lists is well exercised because the words “to”, “be”, “or”, and “not” appears in an absurd number of documents.</p></li><li><p>The preparatory stage that retrieve positions lists is exercised by the fact that the positions lists are unusually long since the words are common and appear numerous times in each document.</p></li><li><p>The ranking code has to rank the numerous intersections that are found.</p></li></ol><p>The <strong>lookup</strong> test attempts to locate every intersection of the words, but does not rank them. This is an exhaustive search, where all intersections are considered. The benchmark measures how long this takes.</p><p>The <strong>execution</strong> test finds and ranks as many intersections as it can in a 150ms time window. The benchmark measures how many results are ranked per second.</p><p>This test would sadly not say much about the memory-mapped structures used before, since especially given they are implemented in Java, they are effectively impossible to meaningfully benchmark, as mmap gets unrealistically fast with repeated access, and Java needs repeated access in order for the C2 JIT compiler to kick in and make the code fast.</p><p>The new code is at least somewhat benchmarkable, since the mmap lookups are gone. There’s still the matter of the page cache speeding up certain buffered reads, but that is a fairly realistic scenario, as the files that are being read are typically relatively small and likely to end up in the page cache in a real-world scenario. Switching to direct mode reads is an option, but in this discussion buffered reads are used unless otherwise specified. In general unbuffered reads approximately halve the benchmark numbers.</p><h3 id="nvme-ssds">NVMe SSDs</h3><p>Modern enterprise NVMe SSDs are very fast, and in many ways feel like sci-fi technology when you actually lean into their idiosyncrasies.</p><p>In isolation, almost no matter how much data you ask it to read it takes roughly the same amount of time. This flies in the face of a lot of assumptions about storage you might have, if you are familiar with mechanical drives or SATA devices.</p><p>This is a simple benchmark on a Samsung PM9A1 on a with a theoretical maximum transfer rate of 3.5 GB/s. The benchmark is a piece of code that repeatedly issues a direct-mode <code>pread()</code> of various block sizes at random locations.</p><p>It should be noted that this is a sub-optimal setup that is less powerful than what the PM9A1 is capable of due to running on a downgraded PCIe link. These sorts of benchmarks are also fairly hardware-dependent. While NVMe SSDs are generally similar, they are not all identical.</p><p>Caveats aside, the results are still loud and clear.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Block Size</th><th>Transfer Rate</th><th>Avg Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>512 B</td><td>6.2 MB/s</td><td>73 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>1 KB</td><td>13.3 MB/s</td><td>73 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>2 KB</td><td>26.7 MB/s</td><td>73 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>4 KB</td><td>52.9 MB/s</td><td>73 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>8 KB</td><td>99.6 MB/s</td><td>78 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>16 KB</td><td>174.4 MB/s</td><td>89 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>32 KB</td><td>384.4 MB/s</td><td>91 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>64 KB</td><td>601.4 MB/s</td><td>103 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>128 KB</td><td>1.0 GB/s</td><td>120 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>256 KB</td><td>1.7 GB/s</td><td>141 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>512 KB</td><td>2.4 GB/s</td><td>206 us/op</td></tr><tr><td>1 MB</td><td>3.1 GB/s</td><td>314 us/op</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Up to very large block sizes, read time as a function of block size is a sublogarithmic function for isolated single reads!</p><p>Or in other words, if it takes twice as long to read 256 KB as it does 512 B, why would you ever read 512 B?</p><p>A counter argument might be that this drives massive read amplification, what if you are only interested in a handful of bytes from that 256 KB block you read.

As it turns out, not really, or at least not always.</p><p>You can absolutely go overboard and drown the controller in humongous read commands, and if you’re performing many concurrent reads all in one go, this will deteriorate the performance, but for pointer chasing like we are doing when navigating a search structure, where we read one or a handful of blocks at a time, this is not a concern at all. If you are actually consuming the data you are reading, the read-rate is limited and the scenario can generally be avoided.</p><p>Initially the block size selected was 4096 because a nice round number had to be picked. This initial ansatz was a mistake that, if the benchmark results in the table above are fully representative, gave the index access to less than 1% of the read performance of the SSD being used.</p><p>Since the task does more than just perform reads, and not all of the index data that is read is a relevant search result, the actual difference is less dramatic than the predicted 100x, but it’s still quite significant especially when comparing a small block size like 4KB with the larger ones.</p><p>Running the “to be or not to be”-benchmarks, the difference between block sizes look like this.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Block Size</th><th>Lookup</th><th>Execution</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4 KB*</td><td>0.600s</td><td>490,000 r/s</td></tr><tr><td>32 KB</td><td>0.188s</td><td>780,000 r/s</td></tr><tr><td>128 KB</td><td>0.160s</td><td>890,000 r/s</td></tr><tr><td>1 MB</td><td>0.149s</td><td>820,000 r/s</td></tr></tbody></table><p>* The forward pointer scheme was adjusted here to become quadratic sooner than with larger block sizes, reflecting increased odds of larger jumps.</p><p>128 KB appears a point of diminishing returns, larger block sizes yield similar or worse performance. The fact that lookup figures improve past this point, but execution figures begin to deteriorate for larger block sizes can likely be explained by how the execution test is more sensitive to how fast the lookup code begins to deliver results to the ranking code, a time that increases with larger block sizes.</p><p>The plan up to this point was to eventually add compression to the document lists blocks, though it’s looking increasingly questionable whether that is a good idea: The search engine is simply not limited by how fast it can read document lists off disk with this design, result ranking and in particular the retrieval of position data is the biggest bottleneck.</p><p>It is possible compression could still be worthwhile if the ranking consisted only of a simple TF-IDF calculation instead of the exact term position logic involved.</p><p>These huge blocks also mean we can add a significant number of forward pointers to each block, all but guaranteeing we can find the appropriate block for any given document ID in a single-digit number of node traversals regardless of which node the search starts at.</p><p>Another benefit of larger blocks is that the buffer pool performs better, as the access pattern changes from many mutations of a large table, to fewer mutations of a small one.</p><h3 id="read-latency">Read latency</h3><p>At this point the index was fast, but the search engine was suffering from very inconsistent request times. The search engine is tasked with not merely ranking many documents and finding the best, but doing so in a timely manner.</p><p>A major source of latency was <a href="https://unixism.net/loti/">io_uring</a>, which was also adapted as part of this performance tuning work. The index lookups themselves are a poor candidate for io_uring since it’s a random pointer traversal, though the search engine performs other disk reads which are far better candidates.</p><p>The ranking system needs to retrieve position data for each search term in the query in each document being ranked. These are many small reads, and doing them sequentially is quite slow. io_uring is somewhere between 5 and 20x faster for these workloads, though admittedly, significant performance gains can also be found via conventional thread-based concurrency.</p><p>Here io_uring was used to create a sort of <code>pread()</code> shotgun where multiple reads were dispatched simultaneously. A drawback with this approach is that it’s very easy to create a thundering herd with dozens of ranking threads performing read-batches each containing hundreds of read instructions all spinning up at once and clobbering the poor SSD controller relentlessly. This was not a problem with the original design where each thread was doing synchronous reads.</p><p>The command queue clobbering was in part mitigated by breaking out the position data retrieval into a limited number of separate threads, instead of doing it in the numerous ranking threads. Having position retrieval and lookup running concurrently like this is still causing some degree of I/O contention, but the resulting latency penalty is manageable and the overall increase in throughput is still worth it.</p><p>io_uring <em>can</em> deal with reads independently as they finish, this is arguably the idiomatic way of using it, and an attempt was also made to implement a streaming approach to async reads in this manner, which worked well enough, but ended up deteriorating performance despite increasing the activity of the drive. The deterioration was likely because it left so little breathing room that the positions retrieval slowed down the index lookups, as the lookups began taking a significantly longer time to finish.</p><p>Because the benchmark has a fairly short iteration time of about a quarter of a second, with a wind-up period, followed by an intense burst of activity, and then a wind-down and reset phase, tools like iostat are likely to under-report the actual disk usage despite showing considerable queue depth, utilization and IOPS.</p><p>Finding a good balance requires a fair bit of tuning. The command queue doesn’t need to be <em>empty</em>, this is still an NVMe SSD we’re talking about and they are famously pretty good at dealing with higher queue depths, but as the queue grows read-times start to become increasingly jittery and especially when using io_uring to dispatch many reads at the same time, this jitter can be magnified into pauses of dozens of milliseconds. The search engine typically has an execution budget of up to 150ms for API queries. Pausing for 30ms to wait for I/O isn’t great under those constraints.</p><h3 id="data-locality">Data Locality</h3><p>Another optimization late in the process was to re-arrange the locations of the positions data. These were previously written sequentially to a file by multiple concurrent writers, meaning that positions from the same document ended up separated by longer distances than necessary.</p><p>Redesigning the writers to in best effort cluster the positions lists by document reduced this spread and meant that more relevant data could be acquired in fewer reads.</p><p>Clustering the data like this works especially well when using buffered reads with <code>POSIX_FADV_RANDOM</code>, which have outperformed O_DIRECT reads for these tasks when evaluating the performance in production after deployment. This is to be expected, as it lets the kernel merge read requests where appropriate.</p><p>Linux I/O schedulers should also be mentioned in the context of high I/O pressure. Typically NVMe SSDs run without a scheduler, as the controller does a good enough job of dealing with high queue depths that it doesn’t matter. In theory I/O schedulers can rearrange and merge read requests, making better use of the hardware, though this is less likely on an NVMe SSD. <code>mq-deadline</code> was briefly evaluated, but didn’t significantly improve the latency numbers or throughput.</p><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2><p>If performance is to improve further, more optimizations in this vein will be necessary. The current bottleneck seems to be in IOPS. It’s possible a better compression algorithm for positions data could be found. Right now they are delta-encoded and stored as varints, which is a significant compression, but there is room for improvement.</p><p>Originally the search engine relied on bloom filter intersection to do approximate position matching instead of exact position matching. It’s possible reviving this technique to some extent could help with reducing the number of position retrievals needed.</p><p>Squeezing the most performance out of NVMe SSDs requires a fair bit of benchmarking, and old assumptions need to be scrutinized. It’s mind-boggling how you can read 1 MB in the same time as four sequential 1 KB read operations.</p><p>Getting the most of these devices often has more to do with data locality, read-merging and queue depth than limiting the number of bytes read.</p><p>At the same time, benchmarking anything that has to do with disk I/O is incredibly difficult. You always need to understand what you are benchmarking and know how to interpret the numbers. It is very easy to create unrealistic scenarios so that you end up benchmarking the wrong thing. I/O is layers and layers of caches. Applications do caching, the OS does caching, the storage device sometimes does caching as well.</p><p><code>io_uring</code> is a tricky one and can easily turn into a foot gun that does more harm than good when used for disk reads. Admittedly the shotgun approach employed in the positions reads is not quite how you are supposed to use it, but for the constraints of the application seems to produce the best balance of throughput and latency, in part because the feast-to-famine cycles introduces breathing room for the drive to process other commands as well.</p><p>These changes are all merged into master and deployed in production, and after some minor teething issues seem to be working fairly well. 128 KB block sizes are used for the production deployment, though values between 64 KB and 256 KB seem to perform roughly comparably.</p><p>The new index is designed to make the most use of NVMe SSDs, but as it’s intended to possible to run on a variety of hardware, a lot of it is configurable, and for example disabling io_uring and reducing block sizes should make it operate reasonably well even on SATA SSDs.</p><p>Check out the links below if you found this even remotely interesting. They dig much deeper into the same sorts of topics.</p><h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h2><ul><li><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11198">Reading from External Memory</a> - Ruslan Savchenko</li><li><a href="https://tanelpoder.com/posts/11m-iops-with-10-ssds-on-amd-threadripper-pro-workstation/">Achieving 11M IOPS &amp; 66 GiB/s IO on a Single ThreadRipper Workstation</a> - Tanel Poder</li><li><a href="https://db.cs.cmu.edu/mmap-cidr2022/">Are You Sure You Want to Use MMAP in Your Database Management System?</a> - Crotty, Andrew and Leis, Viktor and Pavlo, Andrew.</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

      <b>LL3M uses a team of large language models to write Python code that creates and edits 3D assets in Blender.</b>
      Given user text instructions, the agents are capable of creating expressive shapes from scratch, and realizing
      complex, precise geometric manipulations in code.

      Whereas previous uses of code-writing LLMs for 3D creation have focused on specific subtasks or constrained
      procedural programs and primitives, our method is able to create unconstrained assets with geometry, layout, and
      appearance.

      With high-level code as a 3D representation, our pipeline is natively a loop of iterative refinement and
      co-creation: agents perform automatic code and visual self-critique, and users can provide continuous high-level
      feedback. Further editing avenues are enabled by the clear code and the parameters transparent in the generated
      Blender nodes and structures.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Pipeline overview</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig1-workflow.webp" alt="process diagram">
    <p>
      <b>Our method includes three phases</b>: initial creation, automatic refinement, and user-guided refinement.
      These are conceptual phases in the creation process; each phase involves different agent roles of its own.
      The first
      phase creates an initial shape, where implausible configurations, like a disconnected backrest, as well as
      simplistic geometry are
      <em>automatically</em> corrected and improved upon by the second phase. Afterwards, our system can accept
      additional edit
      instructions from the user, allowing for <em>interactive</em> and <em>iterative</em> 3D asset generation.
    </p>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig3-iterative-final.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
      <b>Generating and refining iteratively</b> is thus the native mode of operation for LL3M.
      More than just error correction, the pipeline realizes an iterative, coarse-to-fine creation process,
      involving both automatic and user-guided refinement.
    </p>

    <h2>Gallery</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig2-gallery.webp" alt="">
    <p>
      <b>LL3M is capable of diverse shape generation</b>. The results showcase detailed parts (e.g.
      the windmill architectural features) in intricate arrangements (e.g. the piano keys, the drum kit), and even a
      rich appearance (the skateboard) and material properties (the glossy lamp base). A notable feature of our approach
      is that each mesh is generated through interpretable, editable Blender code.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Consistent stylization</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig7-diff-in-same-out.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
      Starting from different initial meshes produced by LL3M and the same
      refinement prompt <em>change the style to steampunk</em> LL3M successfully interprets and applies the same
      style concept to each hat. Each stylized mesh produces distinct variations, including both geometric modifications
      and appearance changes.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Material editing</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig5-same-in-diff-mat.jpg">
    <p>
      Given an initial mesh produced by our system, our system is capable of editing the materials on a specific part of
      the mesh (the blade of the knife), by creating comprehensive procedural materials via shader nodes.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Iterative creation</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig22-humanoid.webp" alt="">
    <p>
      LL3M enables multiple successive edits of the same 3D asset. The
      modifications are faithful to the user's instructions, editing only the specified element while preserving the
      character's identity.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Interpretable code</h2>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig21-snippet.webp" alt=""></p><p>
        Our method generates Blender code that is easy to understand and follow. The code
        is well-documented with descriptive comments, clear variable names, and structured logic. This interpretable
        code makes it easy to potentially change variables (e.g. the key width) or even algorithmic logic (e.g. the
        keyboard pattern).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Transparent parameters</h2>
    <div>

        By generating shapes through Blender code, LL3M allows intuitive user edits by virtue of the interpretable
        parameters transparent in the code and in the generated Blender nodes and structures.
        For example, when generating a material, our system creates a full set of shader nodes. Users can then
        easily adjust visual attributes, such as tuning the color or stripe pattern directly in Blender to achieve the
        desired output.

    <h2>Generality &amp; reuse of code</h2>

    <p>
      Despite visual differences, shapes often share high-level code patterns (such as loops, modifiers, and node
      setups) that recur across categories. This shared structure allows the model to transfer knowledge and generate
      diverse, editable, and modular code from a wide range of prompts.

      LL3M is capable of generating multiple objects and arranging them with appropriate spatial relationships
      within a single scene. Our system achieves this task using complex operations such as instancing and parenting
      relationships to build the scene hierarchy.
      </p><p>
      The coding agent can also use parenting for more complex single objects, such as a lamp, when explicitly prompted
      to.
      Doing so generates shapes with a human-readable hierarchical structure with parent-child
      relationships between parts within the scene. This enables scene graph behavior in Blender, where transformations
      applied to a parent propagate to its children. Each part in the graph is also assigned a meaningful semantic name.
