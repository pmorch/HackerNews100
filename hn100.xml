<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><span>The milestone is the result of a long term decline of fossil generation in the US power sector, with wind and solar growing substantially over the last decade. Ten years ago, in March 2015, fossil generation still provided 65% of US electricity generation. Wind and solar generation stood at just 5.7%. Since then, the share of wind and solar power has more than quadrupled.</span></p>
<p><span>Solar power is set to account for </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64586"><span>more than half</span></a><span> of new generating capacity installed in the US in 2025, with more than a third of new solar panels going to Texas. Solar’s rise has been extraordinary. Ten years ago, in March 2015, solar power accounted for just 1% of US electricity generation. By March 2025, this had grown to 9.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>Last month Ember published a special report, </span><a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/us-electricity-2025-special-report/"><span>US Electricity 2025</span></a><span>, on the changes and trends in the US power sector last year. It found that solar was the fastest and largest growing source of electricity in the US in 2024. Wind and solar power combined rose to a record 17% of the US electricity mix in 2024, overtaking coal for the first time which accounted for 15%.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><p><i></i> Apr 21, 2025<br><i></i> 5 min read</p></header><div><p>Three years ago, I was part of a team responsible for developing and maintaining Kubernetes clusters for end user customers. A main source for downtime in customer environments occurred when image registries went down. The traditional way to solve this problem is to set up a stateful mirror, however we had to work within customer budget and time constraints which did not allow it. During a Black Friday, we started getting hit with a ton of traffic while GitHub container registries were down. This limited our ability to scale up the cluster as we depended on critical images from that registry. After this incident, I started thinking about a better way to avoid these scalability issues. A solution that did not need a stateful component and required minimal operational oversight. This is where the idea for <a href="https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel">Spegel</a> came from.</p><p>As a sole maintainer of an open source project, I was enthused when Microsoft reached out to set up a meeting to talk about Spegel. The meeting went well, and I felt there was going to be a path forward ripe with cooperation and hopefully a place where I could onboard new maintainers. I continued discussions with one of the Microsoft engineers, helping them get Spegel running and answering any architecture questions they had. At the time I was positive as I saw it as a possibility for Micorosft to contribute back changes based on their learnings. As time went on, silence ensued, and I assumed work priorities had changed.</p><p>It was not until KubeCon Paris where I attended a talk that piqued my interest. The talk was about strategies to speed up image distribution where one strategy discussed was P2P sharing. The topics in the abstract sounded similar to Spegel so I was excited to hear other’s ideas about the problem. During the talk, I was enthralled seeing Spegel, my own project, be discussed as a P2P image sharing solution. When <a href="https://github.com/Azure/peerd">Peerd</a>, a peer to peer distributor of container content in Kubernetes clusters made by Microsoft, was mentioned I quickly researched it. At the bottom of the README there was a thank you to myself and Spegel. This acknowledgement made it look like they had taken some inspiration from my project and gone ahead and developed a version of their own.</p><p><img src="https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/acknowledgement-blur.png" alt="Acknowledgement">
<small><a href="https://github.com/Azure/peerd?tab=readme-ov-file#acknowledgments">Source: Peerd</a></small></p><p>While looking into Peerd, my enthusiasm for understanding different approaches in this problem space quickly diminished. I saw function signatures and comments that looked very familiar, as if I had written them myself. Digging deeper I found test cases referencing Spegel and my previous employer, test cases that have been taken directly from my project. References that are still present to this day. The project is a forked version of Spegel, maintained by Microsoft, but under Microsoft’s MIT license.</p><p><img src="https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/test-parse-path-blur.png" alt="Test Parse Path">

Software released under an MIT license allows for forking and modifications, without any requirement to contribute these changes back. I default to using the MIT license as it is simple and permissive. The license does not allow removing the original license and purport that the code was created by someone else. It looks as if large parts of the project were copied directly from Spegel without any mention of the original source. I have included a short snippet comparing the code which adds the mirror configuration where even the function comments are the same.</p><p><img src="https://philiplaine.com/posts/getting-forked-by-microsoft/hosts-peerd.png" alt="Hosts Peerd">

I am frequently asked about the differences between Spegel and Peerd. As a maintainer, it is my duty to come across as unbiased and factual as possible, but this tumultuous history makes it challenging. Microsoft carries a large brand recognition, so it has been difficult for Spegel to try and take up space next to such a behemoth.</p><p>As an open source maintainer I have dedicated ample time to community requests, bug fixes, and security fixes. In my conversation with Microsoft I was open to collaboration to continue building out a tool to benefit the open source community. Over the years I have contributed to a multitude of open source projects and created a few of my own. Spegel was the first project I created from the ground up that got some traction and seemed to be appreciated by the community. Seeing my project being forked by Microsoft made me feel like I was no longer useful. For a while I questioned if it was even worth continuing working on Spegel.</p><p>Luckily, I persisted. Spegel still continues strong with over 1.7k stars and 14.4 million pulls since its first release over two years ago. However, I am not the first and unfortunately not the last person to come across this David versus Goliath-esque experience. How can sole maintainers work with multi-billion corporations without being taken advantage of? With the changes of Hashicorp licensing having a rippling effect through the open source community, along with the strong decline in investment in open source as a whole, how does the community prevail? As an effort to fund the work on Spegel I have enabled GitHub sponsors. This experience has also made me consider changing the license of Spegel, as it seems to be the only stone I can throw.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/">https://davepeck.org/2025/04/11/pythons-new-t-strings/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43748512">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Template strings, also known as t-strings, have been <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0750/">officially accepted</a> as a feature in Python 3.14, which will ship in late 2025. 🎉</p>
<p>I’m excited; t-strings open the door to safer more flexible string processing in Python.</p>
<h4 id="whats-the-big-idea-with-t-strings">What’s the big idea with t-strings?</h4>
<p>Since they were introduced in Python 3.6, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals">f-strings</a> have become a <em>very</em> popular way to format strings. They are concise, readable, and powerful.</p>
<p>In fact, they’re <em>so</em> delightful that many developers use f-strings for everything… even when they shouldn’t!</p>
<p>Alas, f-strings are often dangerously (mis)used to format strings that contain user input. I’ve seen f-strings used for SQL (<code>f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '{user_name}'"</code>) and for HTML (<code>f"&lt;div&gt;{user_name}&lt;/div&gt;"</code>). These are not safe! If <code>user_name</code> contains a malicious value, it can lead to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">cross-site scripting</a>.</p>
<p>Template strings are a <em>generalization</em> of Python’s f-strings. Whereas f-strings immediately become a string, t-strings evaluate to a new type, <code>string.templatelib.Template</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>from</span><span> string.templatelib </span><span>import</span><span> Template</span></span>
<span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template: Template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Importantly, <code>Template</code> instances are <em>not</em> strings. The <code>Template</code> type does not provide its own <code>__str__()</code> implementation, which is to say that calling <code>str(my_template)</code> does not return a useful value. Templates <em>must</em> be processed before they can be used; that processing code can be written by the developer or provided by a library and can safely escape the dynamic content.</p>
<p>We can imagine a library that provides an <code>html()</code> function that takes a <code>Template</code> and returns a safely escaped string:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>evil </span><span>=</span><span> "&lt;script&gt;alert('bad')&lt;/script&gt;"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"&lt;p&gt;</span><span>{evil}</span><span>&lt;/p&gt;"</span></span>
<span><span>safe </span><span>=</span><span> html(template)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> safe </span><span>==</span><span> "&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;alert('bad')&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Of course, t-strings are useful for more than just safety; they also allow for more flexible string processing. For example, that <code>html()</code> function could return a new type, <code>HTMLElement</code>. It could also accept all sorts of useful substitutions in the HTML itself:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>attributes </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><span>"src"</span><span>: </span><span>"roquefort.jpg"</span><span>, </span><span>"alt"</span><span>: </span><span>"Yum"</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"&lt;img </span><span>{attributes}</span><span> /&gt;"</span></span>
<span><span>element </span><span>=</span><span> html(template)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> str</span><span>(element) </span><span>==</span><span> "&lt;img src='roquefort.jpg' alt='Yum' /&gt;"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>If you’ve worked with JavaScript, t-strings may feel familiar. They are the pythonic parallel to JavaScript’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#tagged_templates">tagged templates</a>.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-i-work-with-t-strings">How do I work with t-strings?</h4>
<p>To support processing, <code>Template</code>s give developers access to the string and its interpolated values <em>before</em> they are combined into a final string.</p>
<p>The <code>.strings</code> and <code>.values</code> properties of a <code>Template</code> return tuples:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.strings </span><span>==</span><span> (</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>, </span><span>"!"</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.values </span><span>==</span><span> (name,)</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>There is always one more (possibly empty) string than value. That is, <code>t"".strings == ("",)</code> and <code>t"{name}".strings == ("", "")</code>.</p>
<p>As a shortcut, it’s also possible to iterate over a <code>Template</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>contents </span><span>=</span><span> list</span><span>(template)</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> contents[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> "Hello "</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> contents[</span><span>1</span><span>].value </span><span>==</span><span> name</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> contents[</span><span>2</span><span>] </span><span>==</span><span> "!"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Developers writing complex processing code can also access the gory details of each interpolation:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> "World"</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> t</span><span>"Hello </span><span>{name</span><span>!s:&gt;8</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].value </span><span>==</span><span> name</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].expression </span><span>==</span><span> "name"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].conversion </span><span>==</span><span> "s"</span></span>
<span><span>assert</span><span> template.interpolations[</span><span>0</span><span>].format_spec </span><span>==</span><span> "&gt;8"</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>In addition to supporting the literal (<code>t"foo"</code>) form, <code>Template</code>s can also be instantiated directly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>from</span><span> string.templatelib </span><span>import</span><span> Template, Interpolation</span></span>
<span><span>template </span><span>=</span><span> Template(</span></span>
<span><span>	"Hello "</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>	Interpolation(</span><span>value</span><span>=</span><span>"World"</span><span>, </span><span>expression</span><span>=</span><span>"name"</span><span>),</span></span>
<span><span>	"!"</span></span>
<span><span>)</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Strings and interpolations can be provided to the <code>Template</code> constructor in any order.</p>
<h4 id="a-simple-t-string-example">A simple t-string example</h4>
<p>Let’s say we wanted to write code to convert all substituted words into pig latin. All it takes is a simple function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="python"><code><span><span>def</span><span> pig_latin</span><span>(template: Template) -&gt; </span><span>str</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>	"""Convert a Template to pig latin."""</span></span>
<span><span>	result </span><span>=</span><span> []</span></span>
<span><span>	for</span><span> item </span><span>in</span><span> template:</span></span>
<span><span>		if</span><span> isinstance</span><span>(item, </span><span>str</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>			result.append(item)</span></span>
<span><span>		else</span><span>:</span></span>

<span><span>			if</span><span> word </span><span>and</span><span> word[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>in</span><span> "aeiou"</span><span>:</span></span>

<h4 id="whats-next-once-t-strings-ship">What’s next once t-strings ship?</h4>
<p>T-strings are a powerful new feature that will make Python string processing safer and more flexible. I hope to see them used in all sorts of libraries and frameworks, especially those that deal with user input.</p>
<p>In addition, I hope that the tooling ecosystem will adapt to support t-strings. For instance, I’d love to see <code>black</code> and <code>ruff</code> format t-string <em>contents</em>, and <code>vscode</code> <em>color</em> those contents, if they’re a common type like HTML or SQL.</p>
<p>It’s been fun to get to know and work with <a href="https://github.com/jimbaker">Jim</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pauleveritt">Paul</a>, <a href="https://github.com/koxudaxi">Koudai</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lysnikolaou">Lysandros</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido</a> on this project and to interact with <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep750-template-strings-new-updates/71594">many more members of the Python community</a> online without whose input PEP 750 simply wouldn’t have come together. I can’t wait to see what developers build with t-strings once they ship!</p> </div></div>]]></description>

We estimate the effect of social media deactivation on users’ emotional state in two large randomized experiments before the 2020 U.S. election. People who deactivated Facebook for the six weeks before the election reported a 0.060 standard deviation improvement in an index of happiness, depression, and anxiety, relative to controls who deactivated for just the first of those six weeks. People who deactivated Instagram for those six weeks reported a 0.041 standard deviation improvement relative to controls. Exploratory analysis suggests the Facebook effect is driven by people over 35, while the Instagram effect is driven by women under 25.

<p dir="auto">This project is for reverse engineering the TikTok Virtual Machine (VM).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Overview</h2><a id="user-content-overview" aria-label="Permalink: Overview" href="#overview"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">TikTok uses a custom virtual machine (VM) as part of its obfuscation and security layers. This project includes tools to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Deobfuscate</strong> <code>webmssdk.js</code> that has the virtual machine.</li>
<li><strong>Decompile</strong> TikTok’s virtual machine instructions into readable form.</li>
<li><strong>Script Inject</strong> Replace webmssdk.js with the deobfuscated VM <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/injector.js">injector</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Sign URLs</strong> Generate signed URLs which can be used to perform auth-based requests eg. Post comments.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Deobfuscating</h2><a id="user-content-deobfuscating" aria-label="Permalink: Deobfuscating" href="#deobfuscating"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When looking at <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/raw.js">webmssdk.js</a> you're met with a
heavily obfuscated file. The main method of obfuscating Javascript
is to take advantage of bracket notation which let's you index a variable
using another variable.</p>
<p dir="auto">So when you see something like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="// Line 3391 of ./deobfVersions/raw.js
r[Gb[301]](Gb[57], e))"><pre><span>// Line 3391 of ./deobfVersions/raw.js</span>
<span>r</span><span>[</span><span>Gb</span><span>[</span><span>301</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>Gb</span><span>[</span><span>57</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You have absolutely no idea what it's indexing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each use of this method is using an array <code>Gb</code> defined as</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    var Gb = [&quot;ydTGHdFNV&quot;, &quot;sNxpGNHMrpLV&quot;, &quot;xyrNMLEN Fpp rpMu&quot;, &quot;ydWyNe&quot;, ...].map(function(a) {
        return a.split(&quot;&quot;).map(function(c) {
            return &quot;LsfVNxutyOcrEMpYAGdFHneaUKRXSgoJDbhqICzPZklivTmWBwQj&quot;.indexOf(c) == -1 ? c : &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;[&quot;LsfVNxutyOcrEMpYAGdFHneaUKRXSgoJDbhqICzPZklivTmWBwQj&quot;.indexOf(c)]
        }).join(&quot;&quot;)
    });"><pre>    <span>var</span> <span>Gb</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"ydTGHdFNV"</span><span>,</span> <span>"sNxpGNHMrpLV"</span><span>,</span> <span>"xyrNMLEN Fpp rpMu"</span><span>,</span> <span>"ydWyNe"</span><span>,</span> ...<span>]</span><span>.</span><span>map</span><span>(</span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>""</span><span>)</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">As you can see we can't even read this either as it's all encoded
using this string <code>"LsfVNxutyOcrEMpYAGdFHneaUKRXSgoJDbhqICzPZklivTmWBwQj"</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because this code get's executed immediately we can simply take this snippet
and run it in any console and retrieve:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[
    &quot;isTrusted&quot;,
    &quot;beforeunload&quot;,
    &quot;filename too long&quot;,
    &quot;isView&quot;,
    ...
]"><pre><span>[</span>
    <span>"isTrusted"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"beforeunload"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"filename too long"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"isView"</span><span>,</span>
    ...
<span>]</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">We can now see each of these strings, therefore we can use RegEx to go through
the script and replace all uses of the array as seen <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfuscation/changeNotation.js#L322">here</a>
It will also convert the bracket notation back to readable dot notation.</p>
<p dir="auto">After that we've left with <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/ems1.js">webmssdk1</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The example from above now looks like this</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="r.addEventListener(&quot;abort&quot;, e),"><pre><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>addEventListener</span><span>(</span><span>"abort"</span><span>,</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span><span>,</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Much better.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another significant obfuscation method used is for disguising function calls.</p>
<p dir="auto">Each function is defined in an array <code>Ab</code>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="  var Ab = [function(e) {
      return &quot;[object Array]&quot; === Object.prototype.toString.call(e)

<p dir="auto">And it used by calling <code>Ab[index](args)</code> like:</p>

<p dir="auto">When using common IDE's if we click on this function it will just bring us to
the start of the array making it difficult to keep track of what function call
is calling what function.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can make this readable by:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Taking the array</li>
<li>Replace each of the function element with it's own standard function calling it <code>function Abindex(args)</code></li>
<li>Replace each call to <code>Ab[index](args)</code> with <code>Abindex(args)</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We can do this by using the AST form of the script via bapel as seen <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfuscation/bapel.js#L55">here</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Which gives us <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/ems2.js#L1798">this</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Virtual Machine part of the script, specifically when executing the bytecode
is a nested if else statement as seen <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/deobfVersions/ems2.js#L2235">here</a></p>
<p dir="auto">It is actually just a normal switch case but has been disguised pretty well. After manually
doing some of the cases, AI was able to help me out and do the rest. Which gave me <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/handleBytecode.js">this</a>,
which looks pretty standard for a bytecode VM.</p>
<p dir="auto">When debugging the Virtual Machine later and seeing which functions it uses
I was able to tell what it's doing and changed some of var names.</p>

<p dir="auto">TikTok is using a full-fledged bytecode VM, if you browse through <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/vm.js">it</a>, it supports
scopes, nested functions and exception handling. This isn't a typical VM and shows that
it is definitely sophiscated.</p>
<p dir="auto">To be able to write a form of decompilation I simply went through each of the cases
and wrote appropriate code for each one, and any case that jumps to another position
for loops like this:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="case 2:
    var a = instructions[index++];
    stack[pointer] ? --pointer : index += a;
    break;"><pre>case <span>2</span>:

    <span>break</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">I would simply stop it from doing so:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="case 2:
    var a = instructions[index++];
    //stack[pointer] ? --pointer : index += a;

    addCode(`// if (!v${pointer}) skip ${a} to ${index + a}`, byteCodePos)
    break;"><pre>case <span>2</span>:
    <span>var</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>instructions</span><span>[</span><span>index</span><span>++</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>

    <span>addCode</span><span>(</span><span>`// if (!v<span><span>${</span><span>pointer</span><span>}</span></span>) skip <span><span>${</span><span>a</span><span>}</span></span> to <span><span>${</span><span>index</span> <span>+</span> <span>a</span><span>}</span></span>`</span><span>,</span> <span>byteCodePos</span><span>)</span>
    <span>break</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">After doing this for all the cases I dumped each file <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions">here</a>.
It's not completely readable but you should be able to make out a general idea
of what each function is doing, for example <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions/VM223.js">VM223</a> which is
generating random characters.</p>

<p dir="auto">As this is a Javascript file executed on the web, it is actually possible to replace
the normal <code>webmssdk.js</code> with the deobfuscated file and use TikTok normally.</p>
<p dir="auto">This can be achieved by using two browser extensions known as <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en-GB" rel="nofollow">Tampermonkey</a> for executing
custom code and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/disable-content-security/ieelmcmcagommplceebfedjlakkhpden?hl=en-GB&amp;pli=1" rel="nofollow">CSP</a> to disable CSP so I can fetch files from blocked origins. This is so I
can put <code>latestDeobf.js</code> in my own file server and have it be fetched each time, this is so I can easily
edit the file and let the changes take effect each time I refresh. This makes it much easier to bebug
when reversing functions.</p>

<p dir="auto">Now that we have deobfuscated the file and decompiled the VM we can
start to reverse any function we want and figure out what it's doing.</p>
<p dir="auto">When you make a request to the server it usually consists of 3 additional headers.</p>
<markdown-accessiblity-table><table>

<td><code>_signature</code></td>
<td>Generated by webmssdk.js based on request.</td>

</tbody>
</table></markdown-accessiblity-table>
<p dir="auto">When making a request that doesn't require authentication like querying a user. Only <code>X-Bogus</code> is
needed to be generated which can be done using <code>window.frontierSign</code>. <code>_signature</code> isn't needed
and any <code>msToken</code> can be used.</p>
<p dir="auto">This popular <a href="https://github.com/davidteather/TikTok-Api">API</a> let's you make those requests.
It uses a webdriver library called <a href="https://playwright.dev/python/docs/api/class-playwright" rel="nofollow">playwright</a>, that simply sets up a browser instance, so it can easily call <code>window.frontierSign</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to making authentication-based requests like posting a comment, <code>_signature</code> is needed
and isn't exposed to <code>window</code>.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Signer</h2><a id="user-content-signer" aria-label="Permalink: Signer" href="#signer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The inital function call for each request is <a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions/VM86.js">VM86</a> which then calls</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/LukasOgunfeitimi/TikTok-ReverseEngineering/blob/main/decompiler/functions/VM113.js">VM113</a> for <code>X-bogus</code></p>

                  <h2><span><strong>Abstract</strong>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>A sustained, coordinated social media harassment and doxxing campaign – which we codenamed JUICYJAM – targeting the pro-democracy movement in Thailand has run uninterrupted, and unchallenged, since at least August 2020. We define doxxing as the search for and the publication of an individual’s personal data on the Internet with malicious intent, in this instance, to suppress and harass the Thai pro-democracy movement. The operation utilized an inauthentic persona over multiple social media platforms (primarily X and Facebook) to target pro-democracy protesters by doxxing individuals, continuously harassing them, and instructing followers to report them to the police. Through our analysis of public social media posts we determined that the campaign was not only inauthentic, but the information revealed could not have been reasonably sourced from a private individual. Thanks to a public leak of confidential military and police documents in March 2025, we can now attribute the campaign to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and/or the Royal Thai Police. With a high rate of following and engagement across platforms, JUICYJAM is an uncommon instance of a successful state-sponsored influence operation. JUICYJAM’s tactics support a larger network of judicial harassment and democratic suppression that is infrequently enforced by social media platforms, but poses a significant threat to civil society.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Since at least August 2020, a coordinated social media harassment and doxxing campaign targeting the Thai pro-democracy movement has run uninterrupted and unchallenged. We codenamed it JUICYJAM.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Thanks to a public leak of confidential military and police documents that occurred in March 2025, we can now attribute the campaign to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and/or the Royal Thai Police, whose online repression efforts have allegedly been merged into a joint “Cyber Team” since 2023.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The campaign operates within a broader context of dissent repression tactics, both online and offline, that closely resemble those we have previously analyzed in other regions – such as, for example, in Hong Kong.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>JUICYJAM’s longstanding, uninterrupted activity over multiple social media platforms (primarily X and Facebook) once again exposes the shortcomings of platforms in creating and enforcing policies on highly coordinated and harmful doxxing campaigns intended to suppress civil society.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Platforms’ policies on doxxing seldom consider the behaviour in the context of coordinated – and often state-sponsored – campaigns against civil society. They also do not consider environmental factors, such as the doxxing happening during unrest and protests.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><a id="background"></a>Background</strong></h2>
<p><span>In 2014, Thailand faced its second military coup of the century, placing a military junta – the National Council for Peace and Order – in power. The junta immediately imposed martial law, ratified a military-backed constitution, and, in 2019, the former army chief who led the coup, Prayuth Chan-o-cha, was elected Prime Minister. In July 2020, youth-led pro-democracy protests broke out across the country, demanding a more democratic constitution and reforms to the monarchy. The protesters were met with severe repression, and after a two-year </span><a href="https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/thailand_report_second_wave_774a_sg_au_210906.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pause</span></a><span> of prosecutions, in November 2020, Prime Minister Prayuth ordered authorities to bring back the enforcement of </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span>, or Section 112 of the Criminal Code, which criminalizes “insulting the monarchy”. Thailand’s use of </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span> has been both arbitrary and prolific; protesters can be arrested for as little as </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-49963123" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sharing social media posts</span></a><span> that are ‘insulting to the monarchy’. Furthermore, the weaponization of </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span> has devastating consequences: those convicted under Section 112 face three to 15 years in prison per count. Thai authorities have extensively used </span><i><span>lèse-majesté </span></i><span>as a tool to punish pro-democracy advocates, with around 270 protesters detained and convicted </span><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2025/01/thailand-must-immediately-repeal-lese-majeste-laws-say-un-experts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>since 2020</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Weaponizing the judiciary has not been enough, however. Since the 2014 coup, the Thai pro-democracy movement has been heavily targeted through various digital means. In 2022, Citizen Lab researchers uncovered an extensive </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/07/geckospy-pegasus-spyware-used-against-thailands-pro-democracy-movement/"><span>espionage campaign</span></a><span> impacting several groups within the movement, such as FreeYOUTH and WeVo. In fact, one of the authors of this report, Katekanok Wongsapakdee, was also found to be targeted.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, </span><a href="https://globaldemocracycoalition.org/library/state-sponsored-online-disinformation-impact-on-electoral-integrity-in-thailand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>multiple influence operations</span></a><span> (IOs) have been exposed for their attempts to discredit the pro-democracy movement and intimidate its members. In October 2020, the company now called X (formerly Twitter) exposed one of the most notorious online IOs targeting the Thai protest movement when it </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240810002008/https://blog.x.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/disclosing-removed-networks-to-our-archive-of-state-linked-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>announced</span></a><span> the removal of 926 covertly coordinated accounts. The network of accounts was attributed with high confidence to the Royal Thai Army (RTA). Twitter found the accounts to be “engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content, as well as engaging in behavior targeting prominent political opposition figures.”<a id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>
<p><span>Further analysis conducted by the </span><a href="https://purl.stanford.edu/ym245nv3149" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Stanford Internet Observatory</span></a><span> found that this influence operation did not achieve any relevant traction with legitimate audiences. The authors state that “the accounts had few followers, the tweets received very low levels of engagement, and the magnitude of tweets is unlikely to have effectively diverted public attention”. Despite the relative investment of resources to conduct this operation, it appears to have failed.</span></p>
<p><span>Twitter’s takedown did not, however, stop influence operations from being deployed to repress the then still very active pro-democracy protests in Thailand. Within this context, we identified several social media campaigns for research candidates, and singled out one that appeared to show the hallmarks of a well-coordinated, and resourced, influence operation. We set out to investigate the campaign’s footprint, tactics, and to determine attribution.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We codenamed this operation JUICYJAM.</span></p>
<h2><strong>The Leak</strong></h2>
<p><span>While compiling our initial analysis on JUICYJAM, there was a significant leak of information from a Member of the Thai Parliament. On March 25, 2025, Thai MP Chayaphon Satondee, released confidential </span><a href="https://x.com/ThaiEnquirer/status/1904559473940955395" target="_blank"><span>documents</span></a><span> allegedly illustrating the influence operation’s machinery put in place by the Thai authorities to quash dissent.</span></p>
<p><span>It is important to clarify the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We could not independently verify the documents as authentic, or complete. The documents were released by a Thai opposition MP, who claimed to have obtained them from “military and police officers who love democracy,”<a id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a> in the context of a general debate for a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Paethongtarn Shinawatra.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The MP claims the documents originated from a joint-forces “Cyber ​​Team” created in 2023<a id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn3"><sup>3</sup></a>. They allegedly contain the “Weekly Cyber ​​Team Operations Report” for August 17-23, 2024, or the first week after Paethongtarn Shinawatra received parliamentary approval to assume the position of Prime Minister, and the report for October 19-25, 2024, or the period after Paethongtarn assumed the position of Prime Minister.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We could review the available documents in detail thanks to the MP making them available on the web<a id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn4"><sup>4</sup></a>, which allowed us to assess them as, at the very least, highly plausible.</span>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The documents’ layout, language, and alleged purpose are consistent with those from internal reports produced by a military or law enforcement agency.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The documents were reported about in detail by international, as well as local, media, such as the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/thai/articles/c20lw5qx4z1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>BBC</span></a><span>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>What caught our attention, however, was the presence, within a set of leaked presentation slides ostensibly explaining the strategy behind the IO, of several tweets where the account’s handle was consistently cut off from the presented screenshot, as if to protect it from inadvertent exposure.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Through cross-comparison, we were able to confirm that the tweets seen in the documents had been posted by the X handle we had been researching as the main online asset for </span>JUICYJAM<span>: <code>@jjookklong3</code>.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If authentic, the leaked documents prove JUICYJAM to be a state-sponsored influence operation, designed to suppress the protest groups, and to counter protest narratives, through a variety of aggressive tactics.</p>
<h2><strong>A Well-Coordinated Suppression Network</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><i>Note</i><i><span>: as we have done in </span></i><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/07/hkleaks-covert-and-overt-online-harassment-tactics-to-repress-the-2019-hong-kong-protests/"><i><span>previous research</span></i></a><i><span>, in this report we define </span></i><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01296612.2020.1850000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span>doxxing</span></i></a><i><span> as the search for and the publication of an individual’s personal data on the Internet with malicious intent.</span></i></p>
<p>JUICYJAM is a prolific set of social media entities, particularly on X and on Facebook, working in coordination to dox and harass individuals and groups within the broader Thai pro-democracy camp. It centres around a single persona, a supposed middle-aged businesswoman going by the name of “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam”. Visually, it consistently utilizes a character from the popular Japanese Anime comic “One Piece”<a id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn5"><sup>5</sup></a> in its profile and cover photos.</p>
<p>Unlike many other influence operations<a id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a>, JUICYJAM can be considered as highly successful. Utilizing its visible views and engagement metrics as a proxy measure for influence, we can observe that the campaign enjoys:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Almost 110,000 followers on its X account, with tweet views often upwards of 15,000 (peaks of more than 50,000), and a consistent flow of likes, replies, and retweets.</li>
<li aria-level="1">A combined (non-unique) count of more than 133,000 followers on Facebook<span>, divided between Pages (claimed to be non-official, as we will see, but reposting the X account’s same doxxing content), and a Group. An average post by one of the Facebook Pages typically achieved several hundred reactions, and dozens of comments.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><span>The vast majority of that audience, and of the consequent engagement, appears to be authentic – i.e. generated by real users, rather than other accounts operated by JUICYJAM.</span></span></li>
</ul>

The post shows over 2,000 reactions, 144 comments, and almost 50 shares.</figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong><a id="timeline"></a>Timeline</strong></h2>
<p>We can observe JUICYJAM’s activity as far back as August 2020. At that time, two identical blogs were created on separate platforms – WordPress<a id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> and Blogger<a id="fnref8" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>, respectively – only days apart. On them, the previously unseen alias “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam”<span> published two separate posts containing photos and private information – the veracity of which we could not verify – on two alleged members of the Thai protest movement. Some of the information being exposed included the names of the individuals’ family members; the schools they attended; or the name and location of the small businesses their families owned.</span></p>
<p><span>The blogs were no longer updated after the two posts were made. The persona, however, lived on.</span></p>
<p>On September 1, 2020, a Twitter (now X) account was created utilizing the same alias as the blogs: <code>@jjookklong3</code>. The profile for the first time displayed pictures of the “Big Mom” Anime character – which will remain a constant theme for the operation across its several years of activity.</p>
<figure><p><img decoding="async" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2.png" alt="" width="1043" height="545" title="JUICYJAM: How Thai Authorities Use Online Doxxing to Suppress Dissent 2" srcset="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2.png 1043w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-300x157.png 300w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-1024x535.png 1024w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-768x401.png 768w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-605x316.png 605w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-297x155.png 297w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-500x261.png 500w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-2-180x94.png 180w" sizes="(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong> Header of the <code>@jjookklong3</code> X (Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/jjookklong3" target="_blank">account</a>, showing the “Big Mom” character from “One Piece” as the profile picture.</figcaption></figure>

<p><span>According to what is visible today, the account began posting approximately one week after its creation, on September 9, 2020. Its </span><a href="https://x.com/jjookklong3/status/1303518244414791680" target="_blank"><span>first known tweet</span></a><span> (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/oiIre" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>archive</span></a><span>) described the account’s operator as a woman, disconcerted and indignant with the protest movement’s actions. The persona will be further built over the following years, as we will see later in this report.</span></p>
<p><span>Shortly after the publishing of the Twitter account, several assets utilizing the same (or very similar) naming convention, and an identical “Big Mom” visual theme, surfaced on Facebook.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The first, created in mid November 2020, was a </span>Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/jjookklong3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Group</a> called “เจ๊จุก คลองสาม Family” (Ms. Juk Khlong Sam Family).
<ul>
<li aria-level="2">The Group was set as private, but visible<a id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a>, meaning that we could observe the existence of the Group itself, as well as some other information related to it, but not its contents.</li>
<li aria-level="2">The Facebook Group in question utilized the same alias, and the same anime character, seen everywhere else until that moment.</li>
<li aria-level="2">On its Twitter/X account, “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam” repeatedly claimed ownership of the Facebook Group<span>, even redirecting its followers to specific posts made within it.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>The Group remains very active to this day, with approximately 13 posts made per day, according to the visible statistics.</span></li>
</ul>

For the first time, the X profile </span><code><span>@jjookklong3</span></code> <a href="https://archive.ph/vAkAr" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>claimed it</span></a><span> as its own, and asked its X audience to follow it. Given the limited available time, we did not conduct in-depth analysis of the Page’s activity.</span></p>
<p>Overall, the core of the activity for the operations appeared to rely on the X profile and the Facebook Group. However, the ostensibly “unofficial” (but evidently tolerated, at the very least) Facebook Pages effectively also acted as an amplifier for the same harassment and doxxing content posted on Twitter. <span>The newly created “official” Facebook Page could now also acquire a prominent role in the campaign, showing it as fully active as of April 2025.</span></p>
<h2><strong><a id="ecosystem"></a>A Broader Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p><span>While their analysis is out of scope for this report, we nonetheless note that JUICYJAM does not exist in isolation. We were able to identify several other social media entities covertly amplifying its contents, as well as producing their own.</span></p>
<p><span>Several of the social media handles revealed as operated by the Thai authorities in the March 2025 leak were also found to be reposting, or otherwise interacting with JUICYJAM.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we found at least one news channel consistently amplifying and propagating JUICYJAM’s doxxing posts, both on broadcast and social media.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Confirming JUICYJAM as an Influence Operation</strong></h2>
<p><span>Several signals had pointed us towards the assessment that “Ms. Juk Khlong Sam”</span> <span>was most likely an inauthentic persona.</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>First, no piece of content ever posted by any of the JUICYJAM online assets contained verified identifiable information on the account’s owner. Claims that the operator owned a factory, that “she” was a middle-aged woman with a past in the protest movement herself, or that she had directly taken pictures of protesters – none of that could be confirmed through what the persona ever published.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Secondly, a significant portion of the photographic and video footage included in the posts, as well as many of the personal details shared about the targets, could not reasonably have been sourced by a private individual. We show a few examples below.<br>

<h2><strong>Attributing JUICYJAM</strong></h2>
<p>Based on the leaked documents, as well as circumstantial evidence we have collected during our research, we can now attribute JUICYJAM to the Royal Thai Armed Forces and/or the Royal Thai Police. Drawing from our observations – discussed in the following section – on the content type, behavioural patterns, and language utilized for JUICYJAM, however, we assess that this particular operation is more likely to be run by the Royal Thai Police. We detail the rationale behind our assessment further below.</p>
<h2><strong>Evidence from Leaked Documents</strong></h2>
<p><span>It is important to start by saying that the documents released to the public on March 25, 2025 show an alleged coordinated effort across multiple branches of the Thai military and police forces since at least 2023. JUICYJAM – active since 2020 – was probably merged into the broader coordinated effort when that was formed.</span></p>
<p><span>As summarized by the local news outlet </span><a href="https://archive.ph/N10Gx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Thai Enquirer</span></a><span>, “documents from the army show that before the 2023 election, the military convened security meetings to analyze movements deemed anti-monarchy. This led to the creation of a “Special Security Task Force” coordinating operations across military branches.” Additionally, “the Cyber Team was established to coordinate efforts across agencies”, and “the IO structure was unified before the 2023 election”. The 2023 Thai general election happened on </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230320164814/https://ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/documents/140A022N0000000000100.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>May 14, 2023</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<figure><p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10.png" alt="" width="893" height="818" title="JUICYJAM: How Thai Authorities Use Online Doxxing to Suppress Dissent 10" srcset="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10.png 893w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10-300x275.png 300w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10-768x703.png 768w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10-371x340.png 371w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10-217x199.png 217w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10-302x277.png 302w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig-10-180x165.png 180w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 893px) 100vw, 893px"></p><figcaption><strong>Figure 10.</strong>&nbsp;The organizational chart of the “Cyber Team” leadership, created in 2023 to coordinate the influence operations efforts by the Thai government, as shown on one of the leaked documents (คณะทำงาน ความมั่นคงพิเศษ ทบ Cyber team.pdf). The column at the right end identifies police officials – marked by red boxes – while the other columns show military officials. The picture was posted by the X account for Thai Enquirer at this <a href="https://x.com/ThaiEnquirer/status/1904559473940955395/photo/1" target="_blank">address</a> (<a href="https://archive.ph/Vb34j" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archive</a>).</figcaption></figure>

<p>In this context, we could identify at least two leaked presentations intended to demonstrate the Cyber Team’s tactics to an internal audience. As part of that demonstration, the two documents show a total of five tweets that we can prove were published by the Twitter (X) account <code>@jjookklong3</code>.</p>
<p>The files are titled “Our Strategy August 67”<a id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> (ยุทธศาสตร์ฝ่ายเรา สิงหาคม 67.pdf) and “Our Strategy October 67” (ยุทธศาสตร์ฝ่ายเรา ตุลาคม 67.pdf), respectively.</p>
<p><span>The slides present the tweets by <code>@jjookklong3</code></span><span>&nbsp;– whose handle, as previously mentioned, is redacted – as tactical responses deployed to suppress protest narratives perceived as threatening for the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span>The first example showed how <code>@jjookklong3</code> </span><span>was utilized to counter a specific protest narrative. The narrative was popularized in response to the arrest and conviction of Jatuporn Sae-ung, an activist whose doxxing we address later on in this report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the leaked slides provided below, <code>@jjookklong3</code> </span><span>was employed by the ‘Cyber Team’ to counteract the protest narrative through two common IO methods:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Distraction: moving the focus of its audience towards a more defensible argument than the one for which the target was arrested and charged;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Smear: discrediting the target by suggesting they were associated with a given person or group (in the example provided, a now disbanded political party in the Thai opposition).&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The reproduction, verbatim, of tweets by <code>@jjookklong3</code></span><span>&nbsp;in the context of regular internal reports on the IO tactics deployed by the interforce “cyber team” has no other plausible explanation than the fact that the account – and therefore the entire campaign – was run by the Cyber Team itself.</span></p>
<p><span>As for the specific branch responsible for creating and operating JUICYJAM, we cannot reach a definitive conclusion. However, we do note</span> circumstantial evidence <span>that this particular IO could be conducted by the</span> Royal Thai Police<span>. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>In the <a href="#background">mentioned 2020 influence operation</a> attributed to the Royal Thai Army by X, formerly Twitter, the tweets made available by the platform showed an insisted focus on promoting the Royal Thai Army and attacking individual protesters.</li>
<li>A qualitative comparison of the language used by the 2020 IO and @jjookklong3 shows a clear difference. @jjookklong3’s focus is on targeting individual protesters, calling for their arrest, and promoting the Royal Thai Police.</li>
<li>As mentioned before, several pieces of photographic and video content posted by @jjookklong3 – and the connected social media and blogging handles – appear to have been either captured or likely acquired by the Royal Thai Police.</li>

<h2><strong><a id="real-life-impact-of-JJ"></a>The Real-Life Impact of JUICYJAM: A Multidimensional Attack on the Protest Movement</strong></h2>
<p><span>Like comparable influence operations designed to quash protest movements and prop autocratic regimes, it is critical to consider the real-life implications of JUICYJAM. Similarly to what we had highlighted in the context of the 2020-2021 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong – see our report on the “</span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/07/hkleaks-covert-and-overt-online-harassment-tactics-to-repress-the-2019-hong-kong-protests/"><span>HKLEAKS</span></a><span>” campaign – the Thai actors appear to maximize their impact through the concurrent action of smear campaigns, intimidation, illegal assaults, and judicial harassment.</span></p>
<p><span>We identified a pattern that linked the doxxing and online harassment of individual protesters by </span><span><code>@jjookklong3</code> </span><span>to their arbitrary detention, and subsequent charging, by the local authorities. On some occasions, the targets have also been assaulted by unidentified masked gangs before their arrest.</span></p>
<p><span>The modus operandi utilized the following methods:</span></p>

<p>The ultimate goal of following up doxxing with judicial harassment – a process that has been documented in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13510347.2025.2461478" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>previous research</span></a><span> – is to reduce the target to silence and inaction, if not exile, through the combined power of covert and overt repression.</span></p>
<p><span>A few examples of the impact of these combined methods include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Jatuporn Sae-ung (จตุพร แซ่อึง), also known as “New”</b>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Jatuporn Sae-ung was at the centre of the </span><code>@jjookklong3</code> <span>tweets we observed as part of the leaked documents allowing us to attribute the campaign to the Thai authorities. She was accused by JUICYJAM of having mocked the Monarchy – a crime punishable under the </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span> law, also known as Section 112 – for wearing a traditional Thai costume at a protest demonstration.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The JUICYJAM action was twofold: it doxxed and belittled Jatuporn (tweet </span><a href="https://archive.ph/PCVLC" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>) and the protesters (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/mukl3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>) in regards to the traditional costume, and to the related protest; and it sought to link her to the now-defunct opposition Move Forward Party (</span><a href="https://archive.ph/pI1IF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>). Two of these tweets were shown in the leaked presentation slides promoting the “Cyber Team” actions internally, as seen in the previous sections.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In September 2022, Jatuporn was </span><a href="https://archive.ph/atqtY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>sentenced</span></a><span><span> to three years in prison for mocking Queen Suthida, and temporarily released on bail.<br>

<li aria-level="2"><span>On March 20, 2021, he joined a demonstration dubbed REDEM, which was organized by Free YOUTH and the Democracy Restoration Group (DRG) in Bangkok.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><span>Later on the same night, he was assaulted and brutally beaten by an unidentified group dressed in black.

<h2><strong>How Could JUICYJAM Operate Unchallenged For So Long?</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Key Factors</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The notion of doxxing is only sparsely captured within the policies of the main social media platforms.&nbsp; It is therefore difficult for an external reader to conclusively identify the rules and actions that the platforms promise to enact in response to its deployment.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Moreover, as doxxing is typically framed merely as a privacy violation, the platforms’ policies do not expressly consider its use by adversarial coordinated actors, particularly in the context of state repression.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Additionally, our analysis of JUICYJAM’s history shows that even when doxxing is specifically mentioned in policies, the related prohibitions are inconsistently enforced on.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Reviewing the Policies on Doxxing for X and Meta</strong></h2>
<p><span>In the current version of their </span><a href="https://help.x.com/en/rules-and-policies/personal-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Private Information policy</span></a><span> (last updated in March 2024), </span>X<span> states:&nbsp;</span></p>
<figure><div><span>“You may not threaten to expose, incentivize others to expose, or publish or post other people’s private information without their express authorization and permission, or share private media of individuals without their consent. </span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>Sharing someone’s private information online without their permission, sometimes called “doxxing,” is a breach of their privacy and can pose serious safety and security risks for those affected.”</span></p></div></figure>
<p><span>While JUICYJAM did primarily post pictures and videos taken at public demonstrations, it very frequently enriched them with private information and footage, including in certain cases government IDs and other official documents – which would most definitely qualify as “a breach of [the targets’] privacy” and posing “serious safety and security risks for those affected”. The continued, and highly prominent, activity and existence of the </span><code>@jjookklong3</code><span> account therefore appears to be a clear failure in this policy’s enforcement by the platform.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Platforms’ policies on doxxing seldom consider the behaviour in the context of coordinated – and often state-sponsored – campaigns against civil society, where the great imbalance of power between attackers and targets exponentially increases their harm, as we have seen in this report.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>They also do not consider environmental factors, such as the doxxing happening during unrest and protests.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/news/673967193790462-oversight-board-publishes-policy-advisory-opinion-on-the-sharing-of-private-residential-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022</a>, these issues were addressed in a set of 17 recommendations made to Meta by the Oversight Board <a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn16"><sup>16</sup></a> </span><span>&nbsp;in response to a request for a policy advisory opinion on “Sharing Private Residential Information”<a id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn17"><sup>17</sup></a>.

<p><span>The Oversight Board’s </span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/oversight/oversight-board-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>recommendations</span></a><span> – unlike </span><span>decisions</span><span> – are not binding. </span><span>Neither of these recommendations were implemented by Meta at the time of publication of this report.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Recommendation 11 was blocked (“no further action”), with Meta deferring its intended purposes to the existing partnership with “850 safety partners globally, including helplines and organisations that work with victims of harassment, online and offline”.</span></li>
<li><span>Recommendation 12 was initially labeled with “assessing feasibility”, stating that “to assess the board’s recommendation, we will first need to determine how to identify when sharing private residential information ‘is clearly related to malicious action that created a risk of violence or harassment’ and how we can log this type of information in our system.” However, the most recent update was shown to have happened on June 12, 2023.&nbsp;</span>

<li><span>We note that in the </span><a href="https://transparency.meta.com/en-gb/oversight/oversight-board-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>complete list</span></a><span> of recommendations provided by the Oversight Board to Meta, Recommendation 12 on “Sharing Private Information” is also labelled as “no further action” and “no further updates”, signalling that the company has eventually decided not to implement it.</span></li>

<p><span>Finally, successes in enforcing policies against coordinated doxxing do happen, occasionally. In June 2021, shortly before JUICYJAM started, </span>Google <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/google-takes-down-maps-targeting-hundreds-thais-accused-opposing-king-2021-06-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>removed</span></a><span> two custom Google Maps that “had listed the names and addresses of hundreds of Thai activists who were accused by royalists of opposing the monarchy”. The maps had been published by a team coordinated by Songklod “Pukem” Chuenchoopol, a prominent pro-monarchy activist, with the intention of reporting everyone named to the police for </span><i><span>lèse-majesté</span></i><span>. We also noticed that the hashtag </span><span>#CaptainPooKhem</span><span> – commonly used by his supporters to amplify his posts – appears to be blocked on </span>Facebook<span>, returning </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/captainpookhem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>no results</span></a><span>. It remains however possible to post it, as can be seen on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheNationThailand/posts/10157447102161937" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>existing posts</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Conclusions: The Ongoing Harm of Coordinated Doxxing Continues to be Underestimated</strong></h2>
<p><span>Government-operated doxxing campaigns are potent tools of repression, and it is no accident that they are often targeted against peaceful pro-democracy movements.&nbsp; Critically, whether in Hong Kong, Thailand, or </span><a href="https://eastasiaforum.org/2022/12/05/doxxing-and-deficiencies-in-indonesias-cybersecurity-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>elsewhere</span></a><span>, governments and their proxies often deploy them to complement and enhance more traditional forms of state repression, like violence and deprivation of liberty.</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of JUICYJAM, for example, targets of the campaign were also detained, charged, and often physically assaulted.<a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn19"><sup>19</sup></a></span><span>&nbsp;The harm can be devastating.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Low Risk, High Reward</strong></h2>
<p><span>While JUICYJAM was ostensibly the work of a fictitious persona, the campaign was fueled with information and content only available to government entities. The veil of plausible deniability it offered to them was sufficient for the campaign to thrive for several years before being exposed as linked to the Thai authorities. There is also no guarantee that it will stop now.</span></p>
<p><span>In the conclusions to our </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/07/hkleaks-covert-and-overt-online-harassment-tactics-to-repress-the-2019-hong-kong-protests/"><span>report</span></a><span> on the HKLEAKS influence operation – which, as we have seen, followed the same general playbook as JUICYJAM – we had stated: “If digital repression is about raising the cost of activism, then the HKLEAKS case suggests that doxxing can be a fairly low risk but potentially high reward instrument of digital repression.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the extremely serious harms for the targets of doxxing campaigns, this statement continues to be accurate.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Coordinated Government-Backed Doxxing: Likely to Grow</strong></h2>
<p><span>JUICYJAM’s five-year-and-counting run in Thailand without serious disruption shows that the current tools, attention, and approach to this problem were largely insufficient to mitigate the harm caused to peaceful protesters and activists.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Social media companies frame their limited action on doxxing as a necessary balance of freedom of expression and safety (and the difficulties of determining public vs. private information) <a id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn20"><sup>20</sup></a>.</span><span> However, repressive states specifically deploy coordinated doxxing as a technique to punish authentic freedom of expression </span><i><span>and</span></i><span> threaten safety. </span><span>Today, most major social media platforms are moving towards reducing, </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2024/01/10/elon-musk-fired-80-per-cent-of-twitter-x-engineers-working-on-trust-and-safety/?sh=71c80f1c79b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>gutting</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly74mpy8klo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>eliminating</span></a><span> programs originally aimed at increasing ecosystem safety and health initiatives.&nbsp; Campaigns like JUICYJAM are likely to become more common as states learn from each other and operate in an increasingly permissive environment on certain platforms.

<p><span>On April 9, 2025, we sent emails to </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Citizen-Lab-Letter-to-Meta_Redacted.pdf"><span>Meta</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Citizen-Lab-Letter-to-X_Redacted.pdf"><span>X</span></a><span> with questions and recommendations to address the concerns raised by our work. At the time of publication, we had not received a response from X. While Meta acknowledged receipt, they did not answer our questions.</span></p>
<p><span>Our recommendations to X and Meta include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Provide an easily accessible and responsive way (i.e. a hotline) for victims of doxxing to report the malicious public sharing of their private content</b><span>. The content should be quickly removed after Meta and X verified it as the product of doxxing.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Implement instruments for Meta and X to identify, and remove, networks acting in a coordinated manner to conduct doxxing</b><span>. The action should not only consist in the removal of individual pieces of content, but in the simultaneous removal, permanent ban, and subsequent monitoring of the networked actors responsible for the malicious activity.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Develop and implement instruments for the protection of civil society from doxxing</b><span> through Meta’s and X’s platforms in hybrid and authoritarian regimes according to The Economist Democracy Index, or Partly Free and Not Free countries according Freedom House’s Freedom in the World survey. Such instruments should include appropriate solutions on both the policy and the technological side.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Conduct an audit on the existence and activity of potential coordinated doxxing networks</b>, with priority on illiberal countries as defined per point above. Implement a coordinated removal of the networks confirmed as conducting doxxing. Publicly disclose proven cases of state-sponsored doxxing networks.</li>

    <p>TikZJax converts <code>script</code> tags (containing TikZ code) into SVGs.</p>

    <p>See a live demo at <a href="https://tikzjax.com/">https://tikzjax.com/</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="example">Example</h2>

    <p>In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML, include </p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://tikzjax.com/v1/fonts.css"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://tikzjax.com/v1/tikzjax.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then in the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, include TikZ code such as</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/tikz"&gt;
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) circle (1in);
  \end{tikzpicture}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your TikZ will be compiled into SVGs; the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element will be
replaced with the corresponding SVG.  For instance, the above code generates</p>  



<p>You can also use this for commutative diagrams.  For example, this code</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/tikz"&gt;
  \begin{tikzcd}
    A \arrow[r, "\phi"] \arrow[d, red]
      &amp; B \arrow[d, "\psi" red] \\
    C \arrow[r, red, "\eta" blue]
      &amp; |[blue, rotate=-15]| D
  \end{tikzcd}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will be rendered as</p>



<h2 id="howdoesthiswork">How does this work?</h2>

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/kisonecat/web2js">web2js</a>, the Pascal source of <code>tex</code>
is compiled to WebAssembly; the latex format is loaded (without all the hyphenation data), and </p>

<pre><code>\documentclass[margin=0pt]{standalone}
\def\pgfsysdriver{pgfsys-ximera.def}
\usepackage{tikz}
</code></pre>

<p>is executed.  Then core is dumped; the resulting core is compressed, and by reloading the dumped core in the browser, it is possible to very quickly get to a point where TikZ can be executed.  By using an SVG driver for PGF along with <a href="https://github.com/kisonecat/dvi2html">dvi2html</a>, the DVI output is converted to an SVG.</p>

<p>To emphasize this: <b>all of this happens in the browser.</b></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <hr>
    
    
    
    <div id="preamble">
  <p>Every transactional system does four things:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It <em>executes</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>orders</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>validates</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It <em>persists</em> transactions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><em>Executing</em> a transaction means evaluating the body of the transaction to produce the intended reads and writes.  There is still notable variety across systems as to how the body of a transaction is executed.  Writes might be applied to storage during this phase, or they might be buffered locally and submitted as a batch at the end.  A transaction might be executed more than once for different purposes.</p>
<p><em>Ordering</em> a transaction means assigning the transaction some notion of a time at which it occurred.  This could be a version, a timestamp, a log sequence number, or a more complex description of transaction IDs it happened before or after.  MVCC databases may assign two versions: an initial read version, and a final commit version. In this case, we’re mainly focused on the specific point at which the commit version is chosen — the time at which the database claims all reads and writes occurred atomically.</p>
<p><em>Validating</em> a transaction means enforcing concurrency control, or more rarely, domain-specific semantics.  If a transaction is going to be rejected for a system defined reason, such as having serializability conflicts with existing transactions, it will happen here.  When validation happens after ordering, it checks to see if the assigned order is valid.  When validation happens before ordering, it provides a range of acceptable commit versions, and the ordering step chooses one of them.</p>
<p><em>Persisting</em> a transaction makes making it durable, generally to disk.  Sometimes writes are incrementally made durable during transaction execution, but the key point in persistence is when all writes <em>and</em> the commit record marking the transaction as committed are durable.  Often this is noting how the system performs replication and persists the outcome of its atomic commitment protocol.  (And sometimes the lines between those two aren’t very clear.)</p>
<p>All four of these things must be done before the system may acknowledge a transaction’s result to a client.  However, these steps can be done in any order.  They can be done concurrently.  Different systems achieve different tradeoffs by reordering these steps.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="_examples">
Examples
</h2> 
<p>A classic optimistic concurrency control database will execute a transaction, and record the read and write sets.  Once execution finishes, a commit version is allocated, and concurrent transactions are checked for conflicts.  If no conflicts were found, the transaction is made durable, and acknowledged as committed.</p>
<p>Classic optimistic concurrency control databases break down as:</p>

<div>

<p><img src="https://transactional.blog/images/blog/2025-decomposing-transactional-systems/diag-dbdiag-spans-md5-a01c7120b9d79e78f31edef2e0cf5169.svg" alt="Diagram" width="420" height="35" )="">
</p>
</div>
<p>A classic pessimistic concurrency control database executes a transaction and acquires locks as it runs to exclude conflicting transactions.  When the transaction finishes, it acquires a commit version, and then is persisted to disk.  Then it releases the locks.</p>
<p>Classic pessimistic concurrency control databases break down as:<a id="_sideref_1"></a><sup>[1]</sup>
<span><a id="_sidedef_1"></a>[1]: Don’t try to infer anything out of these diagrams other than the just how the steps relate to each other.  These diagrams have no relationship to the performance or efficiency of different designs.  Thinner diagrams or more concurrent of steps aren’t necessarily better.</span></p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s burn through some real world examples.</p>


<h3 id="_foundationdb">
FoundationDB
</h3> 
<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4197497039785350505">FoundationDB</a><a id="_sideref_2"></a><sup>[2]</sup> is a distributed, transactional database, which unbundles the standard database architecture into a set of database microservices which may be scaled independently.  The paper describes its transaction processing flow as:
<span><a id="_sidedef_2"></a>[2]: <a id="FoundationDB"></a>Jingyu Zhou, Meng Xu, Alexander Shraer, Bala Namasivayam, Alex Miller, Evan Tschannen, Steve Atherton, Andrew J. Beamon, Rusty Sears, John Leach, Dave Rosenthal, Xin Dong, Will Wilson, Ben Collins, David Scherer, Alec Grieser, Young Liu, Alvin Moore, Bhaskar Muppana, Xiaoge Su, and Vishesh Yadav. 2021. FoundationDB: A Distributed Unbundled Transactional Key Value Store. In <em>Proceedings of the 2021 International Conference on Management of Data</em> (SIGMOD '21), Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 2653–2666. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4197497039785350505">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>A client transaction starts by contacting one of the Proxies to obtain
a read version (i.e., a timestamp). The Proxy then asks the Sequencer
for a read version that is guaranteed to be no less than any
previously issued transaction commit version, and this read version
is sent back to the client. <span>Then the client may issue multiple reads
to StorageServers and obtain values at that specific read version.
Client writes are buffered locally without contacting the cluster.</span>
At commit time, the client sends the transaction data, including
the read and write sets (i.e., key ranges), to one of the Proxies
and waits for a commit or abort response from the Proxy. If the
transaction cannot commit, the client may choose to restart the
transaction from the beginning again.</p>
<p>A Proxy commits a client transaction in three steps. <span>First, the
Proxy contacts the Sequencer to obtain a commit version that is
larger than any existing read versions or commit versions.</span> The
Sequencer chooses the commit version by advancing it at a rate of
one million versions per second. <span>Then, the Proxy sends the transaction
information to range-partitioned Resolvers, which implement
FDB’s optimistic concurrency control by checking for read-write
conflicts</span>. If all Resolvers return with no conflict, the transaction
can proceed to the final commit stage. Otherwise, the Proxy marks
the transaction as aborted. <span>Finally, committed transactions are sent
to a set of LogServers for persistence</span>. A transaction is considered
committed after all designated LogServers have replied to the
Proxy, which reports the committed version to the Sequencer (to
ensure that later transactions' read versions are after this commit)
and then replies to the client. At the same time, StorageServers
continuously pull mutation logs from LogServers and apply committed
updates to disks.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>So from breaking down this part of the paper, we see</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A client executes a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The proxy acquires a commit version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction is conflict checked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction is made durable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>All as sequential steps.</p>

<div>

<p><img src="https://transactional.blog/images/blog/2025-decomposing-transactional-systems/diag-dbdiag-spans-md5-c8eb96033cc2c82c780ce564d6676d87.svg" alt="Diagram" width="483" height="35" )="">
</p>
</div>
<p>A familiar diagram!  FoundationDB operates as a classic optimistic concurrency control database.  With this in mind, if you’re trying to understand one piece of the system (e.g. distributed conflict checking in the resolvers), you can replace the other pieces temporarily with the minimal equivalents from the most simplistic optimistic database implementation (e.g. replace the log servers with appending to a single WAL on one disk).</p>

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3523173873845838643">Spanner</a><a id="_sideref_3"></a><sup>[3]</sup> is Google’s flagship database, used extensively within Google, and inspired a generation of NewSQL databases that followed in its architectural footsteps<a id="_sideref_4"></a><sup>[4]</sup> of partitioned Paxos and distributed transactions.  For Spanner’s description of its transaction protocol, we see §4.2.1 Read-Write Transactions:
<span><a id="_sidedef_3"></a>[3]: <a id="Spanner"></a>James C. Corbett, Jeffrey Dean, Michael Epstein, Andrew Fikes, Christopher Frost, JJ Furman, Sanjay Ghemawat, Andrey Gubarev, Christopher Heiser, Peter Hochschild, Wilson Hsieh, Sebastian Kanthak, Eugene Kogan, Hongyi Li, Alexander Lloyd, Sergey Melnik, David Mwaura, David Nagle, Sean Quinlan, Rajesh Rao, Lindsay Rolig, Dale Woodford, Yasushi Saito, Christopher Taylor, Michal Szymaniak, and Ruth Wang. 2012.

<span><a id="_sidedef_4"></a>[4]: And comparing specifically how CockroachDB, TiDB, and YugabyteDB all differ from Spanner and each other is an insightful adventure.</span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Like Bigtable, writes that occur in a transaction are
buffered at the client until commit. As a result, reads
in a transaction do not see the effects of the transaction’s
writes. This design works well in Spanner because a read
returns the timestamps of any data read, and uncommitted writes have not yet been assigned timestamps.</p>
<p>Reads within read-write transactions use wound-wait to avoid deadlocks.
<span>The client issues reads
to the leader replica of the appropriate group, which
acquires read locks and then reads the most recent
data. While a client transaction remains open, it sends
keepalive messages to prevent participant leaders from
timing out its transaction. When a client has completed
all reads and buffered all writes, it begins two-phase
commit.</span> The client chooses a coordinator group and
sends a commit message to each participant’s leader with
the identity of the coordinator and any buffered writes.

<p><span>A non-coordinator-participant leader first acquires

<p>The coordinator leader also first acquires write locks,

the entire transaction after hearing from all other participant leaders.</span> The commit timestamp s must be greater or
equal to all prepare timestamps (to satisfy the constraints
discussed in Section 4.1.3), greater than TT.now().latest

through Paxos (or an abort if it timed out while waiting

<p>Before allowing any coordinator replica to apply
the commit record, the coordinator leader waits until
TT.after(s), so as to obey the commit-wait rule described
in Section 4.1.2. Because the coordinator leader chose s
based on TT.now().latest, and now waits until that timestamp is guaranteed to be in the past, the expected wait
is at least 2 * epsilon. This wait is typically overlapped with
Paxos communication. After commit wait, the coordinator sends the commit timestamp to the client and all
other participant leaders. Each participant leader logs the
transaction’s outcome through Paxos. <span>All participants
apply at the same timestamp and then release locks.</span></p>

<p>Spanner is a bit more complicated, partly because lock-related operations involved in transaction validation are stretched across the whole text.  It also tries to trick you by talking about details out of execution order, so make sure to always read closely for "then" to give hints on the ordering of the steps.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The execute and validate steps seem to be intertwined, as read locks are acquired while the transaction executes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writes are buffered until the client is ready to commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two-phase commit is started to check if the transaction can commit on all participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the coordinator has heard all of the minimum required timestamps from its participants during the two-phase commit’s prepare, it decides the final commit version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction is then made durable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, read and write locks are released.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Drawing this out, Spanner looks like:</p>

<p>Oh hey, it still looks exactly like a classic pessimistic concurrency control database.  So despite the significantly more complicated explanation of how transactions are executed, it’s reasonable to approach the paper from the viewpoint of "How does this end up being equal to SERIALIZABLE MySQL?", and you can think through how the two systems differ piece by piece.</p>

TAPIR
</h3> 
<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=8784667365134534173">TAPIR</a><a id="_sideref_5"></a><sup>[5]</sup> is a strictly serializable database advertising itself as an improvement on Spanner that can commit transactions with better latency and throughput through the use of its novel replication protocol. The core of TAPIR is described in §5.2.1:
<span><a id="_sidedef_5"></a>[5]: <a id="TAPIR"></a>Irene Zhang, Naveen Kr. Sharma, Adriana Szekeres, Arvind Krishnamurthy, and Dan R. K. Ports. 2015. Building consistent transactions with inconsistent replication.

<div>
<blockquote>
<p><span>We begin with TAPIR’s protocol for executing transactions.</span></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>For <code>Write(key, object)</code>, the client buffers <code>key</code> and <code>object</code> in
the write set until commit and returns immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <code>Read(key)</code>, if <code>key</code> is in the transaction’s write set, the
client returns <code>object</code> from the write set. If the transaction
has already read <code>key</code>, it returns a cached copy. Otherwise,
the client sends <code>Read(key)</code> to the replica.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On receiving <code>Read</code>, the replica returns <code>object</code> and <code>version</code>,
where <code>object</code> is the latest version of <code>key</code> and <code>version</code> is the
timestamp of the transaction that wrote that version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On response, the client puts <code>(key, version)</code> into the transaction’s read set and returns <code>object</code> to the application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Once the application calls Commit or Abort, the execution
phase finishes. To commit, the TAPIR client coordinates
across all participants — the shards that are responsible for
the keys in the read or write set — to find a single timestamp,
consistent with the strict serial order of transactions, to assign
the transaction’s reads and writes, as follows:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>The TAPIR client selects a proposed timestamp. Proposed
timestamps must be unique, so clients use a tuple of their
local time and their client id.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The TAPIR client invokes <code>Prepare(txn, timestamp)</code> as an
IR consensus operation, where <code>timestamp</code> is the proposed
timestamp and <code>txn</code> includes the transaction id (<code>txn.id</code>)
and the transaction read (<code>txn.read set</code>) and write sets
(<code>txn.write set</code>). The client invokes Prepare on all participants
through IR as a consensus operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each TAPIR replica that receives Prepare (invoked by IR
through ExecConsensus) first checks its transaction log for
<code>txn.id</code>. If found, it returns PREPARE-OK if the transaction
committed or ABORT if the transaction aborted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, the replica checks if txn.id is already in its
prepared list. If found, it returns PREPARE-OK.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>Otherwise, the replica runs TAPIR’s OCC validation
checks, which check for conflicts with the transaction’s
read and write sets at timestamp, shown in Figure 8.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the TAPIR client receives results from all shards, the
client sends <code>Commit(txn, timestamp)</code> if all shards replied
PREPARE-OK or <code>Abort(txn, timestamp)</code> if any shards
replied ABORT or ABSTAIN. If any shards replied RETRY,
then the client retries with a new proposed timestamp (up
to a set limit of retries).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>On receiving a Commit, the TAPIR replica: (1) commits the
transaction to its transaction log, (2) updates its versioned
store with w, (3) removes the transaction from its prepared
list (if it is there), and (4) responds to the client.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On receiving a Abort, the TAPIR replica: (1) logs the
abort, (2) removes the transaction from its prepared list (if
it is there), and (3) responds to the client.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Which initially feels like a lot of description to work through, but it breaks down into separable pieces pretty well:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The transaction is executed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The clients picks a proposed commit timestamp.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each replica then concurrently runs an OCC check and persists the data to the prepare log.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Thus, our diagram looks like:</p>

<div>

</p>
</div>
<p>This also highlights the key aspect of TAPIR: its blending of the concurrency control validation and commit outcome persistence protocols.</p>
<p>Tangentially, TAPIR was the inspiration behind this way of decomposing databases, as it included a nice diagram which I occasionally fell back to when reading papers I struggled to make sense of:</p>

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11098336506858442351">Calvin</a><a id="_sideref_6"></a><sup>[6]</sup> is the iconic system for deterministic databases, and subsequent papers improving on various aspects of its design all share the same overall characteristics.  In §3 System Architecture, Calvin’s architecture is introduced as:
<span><a id="_sidedef_6"></a>[6]: <a id="Calvin"></a>Alexander Thomson, Thaddeus Diamond, Shu-Chun Weng, Kun Ren, Philip Shao, and Daniel J. Abadi. 2012. Calvin: fast distributed transactions for partitioned database systems. In <em>Proceedings of the 2012 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data</em> (SIGMOD/PODS '12), ACM. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11098336506858442351">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The essence of Calvin lies in separating the system into three separate layers of processing:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The sequencing layer (or “sequencer”) intercepts transactional inputs and places them into a global transactional input
sequence</span>—this sequence will be the order of transactions to
which all replicas will ensure serial equivalence during their
execution. <span>The sequencer therefore also handles the replication and logging of this input sequence.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The scheduling layer (or “scheduler”) <span>orchestrates transaction execution using a deterministic locking scheme to guarantee equivalence to the serial order specified by the sequencing layer while allowing transactions to be executed concurrently by a pool of transaction execution threads</span>. (Although
they are shown below the scheduler components in Figure 1,
these execution threads conceptually belong to the scheduling layer.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storage layer handles all physical data layout. Calvin
transactions access data using a simple CRUD interface; any
storage engine supporting a similar interface can be plugged
into Calvin fairly easily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>This means Calvin breaks down as:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sequence the transaction into a global log.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the log durable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take locks to know when one can safely execute in the serial order despite concurrency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drop all locks acquired.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Calvin is the most well known example of a database which does <strong>not</strong> execute transactions before committing them. It gains some significant advantages from this, in that its commit process is completely immune to contention in the workload, and some disadvantages, in that long running transactions will stall any later committed transactions from executing.</p>

CURP

<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3451458773692631815">Exploiting Commutativity For Practical Fast Replication</a><a id="_sideref_7"></a><sup>[7]</sup> defines a Consistent Unordered Replication Protocol (CURP), that allows clients to replicate requests that have not yet been ordered, as long as they are commutative. Stitching together a few paragraphs from §3.2 Normal operation:
<span><a id="_sidedef_7"></a>[7]: <a id="CommutativeRaft"></a>Seo Jin Park and John Ousterhout. 2019. Exploiting Commutativity For Practical Fast Replication. In <em>16th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 19)</em>, USENIX Association, Boston, MA, 47–64. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3451458773692631815">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Client interaction with masters is generally the same as it
would be without CURP. <span>Clients send update RPC requests
to masters.</span> If a client cannot receive a response, it retries the
update RPC. If the master crashes, the client may retry the
RPC with a different server.</p>
<p>For 1 RTT updates, masters return to clients before replication to
backups. <span>To ensure durability, clients directly record
their requests to witnesses concurrently while waiting for
responses from masters. Once all f witnesses have accepted
the requests, clients are assured that the requests will survive
master crashes, so clients complete the operations with the
results returned from masters.</span></p>
<p><span>A witness accepts a new record RPC from a client only
if the new operation is commutative with all operations that
are currently saved in the witness. If the new request doesn’t
commute with one of the existing requests, the witness must
reject the record RPC since the witness has no way to order
the two noncommutative operations consistent with the
execution order in masters. For example, if a witness already
accepted “x←1”, it cannot accept “x←5”.</span></p>
<p>Each of f witnesses operates independently; witnesses
need not agree on either ordering or durability of operations.
In an asynchronous network, record RPCs may arrive at
witnesses in different order, which can cause witnesses to
accept and reject different sets of operations. However, this
does not endanger consistency. First, as mentioned in §3.2.1,
a client can proceed without waiting for sync to backups
only if all f witnesses accepted its record RPCs. Second,
requests in each witness are required to be commutative
independently, and only one witness is selected and used
during recovery (described in §3.3).</p>
<p>The role of masters in CURP is similar to their role in
traditional primary-backup replications. Masters in CURP
receive, serialize, and execute all update RPC requests from
clients. <span>If an executed operation updates the system state, the
master synchronizes (syncs) its current state with backups by
replicating the updated value or the log of ordered operations.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Thus, we can decompose CURP into its pieces:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clients read from the master and send the writes to both the leader and all the followers of a replication group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each replica concurrently checks for conflicts and records the transaction locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After replying to the client, the transactions are ordered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Thus, we have:</p>

<div>

<p><img src="https://transactional.blog/images/blog/2025-decomposing-transactional-systems/diag-dbdiag-spans-md5-4e0517a7fe96392bf97e711e36b52996.svg" alt="Diagram" width="336" height="65" )="">
</p>
</div>
<p>Which also very nicely shows how CURP is rather unique: ordering transactions is the last thing that it does, and ordering transactions last is how it derives all of its advantages.</p>

TicToc
</h3> 
<p> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7246772973103959497">TicToc</a><a id="_sideref_8"></a><sup>[8]</sup> introduces itself as a new transaction protocol that assigns read and write timestamps to data items and uses them to lazily compute a valid commit timestamp for each transaction. Doing so removes the need for centralized timestamp allocation, and commits transactions that would be aborted by conventional timestamp ordering schemes.
<span><a id="_sidedef_8"></a>[8]: <a id="TicToc"></a>Xiangyao Yu, Andrew Pavlo, Daniel Sanchez, and Srinivas Devadas. 2016. TicToc: Time Traveling Optimistic Concurrency Control. In <em>Proceedings of the 2016 International Conference on Management of Data</em> (SIGMOD/PODS'16), ACM. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=7246772973103959497">[scholar]</a></span></p>
<p>Sounds cool.  Stitching together some pieces of text from §3.2 Protocol Specification so that they read well in order, the transaction protocol is described as:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p><span>In the read phase, the DBMS maintains a separate read set and write set of tuples for each transaction. During this phase, accessed tuples are
copied to the read set and modified tuples are written to the write
set, which is only visible to the current transaction. Each entry in
the read or write set is encoded as {tuple, data, wts, rts}, where
tuple is a pointer to the tuple in the database, data is the data value
of the tuple, and wts and rts are the timestamps copied from the tuple when it was accessed by the transaction. For a read set entry, TicToc maintains the invariant that the version is valid from wts to rts in timestamp order.</span></p>
<p>The first step of the validation phase is to lock
all the tuples in the transaction’s write set in their primary key order
to prevent other transactions from updating the rows concurrently.
Using this fixed locking order guarantees that there are no deadlocks with other transactions committing at the same time.</p>
<p><span>The second step in the validation phase is to compute the transaction’s commit timestamp from the timestamps stored within each
tuple entry in its read/write sets.</span> For a
tuple in the read set but not in the write set, the commit timestamp
should be no less than its wts since the tuple would have a different version before this timestamp. For a tuple in the transaction’s
write set, however, the commit timestamp needs to be no less than
its current rts + 1 since the previous version was valid till rts.</p>
<p><span>In the last step, the algorithm validates the tuples in the transaction’s read set. If the transaction’s commit_ts is less than or equal
to the rts of the read set entry, then the invariant wts ≤ commit_ts
≤ rts holds. This means that the tuple version read by the transaction is valid at commit_ts, and thus no further action is required.
If the entry’s rts is less than commit_ts, however, it is not clear
whether the local value is still valid or not at commit_ts. It is possible that another transaction has modified the tuple at a logical time
between the local rts and commit_ts, which means the transaction
has to abort. Otherwise, if no other transaction has modified the
tuple, rts can be extended to be greater than or equal to commit_ts,
making the version valid at commit_ts.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, if all of the tuples that the transaction accessed pass validation, then the transaction enters the write phase. In this phase the transaction’s write set is written to the database.</span></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And so breaking that down, we see:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The transaction is executed, with writes buffered until commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>While</em> the transaction executes, timestamps are recorded which narrow the possible range of commit versions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once validation begins, a final commit timestamp is chosen and checked for conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all other steps are successful, the transaction is finally persisted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Thus, the diagram looks something like:</p>

<div>

<p><img src="https://transactional.blog/images/blog/2025-decomposing-transactional-systems/diag-dbdiag-spans-md5-e90eb28ad5e40164e91264c7fe6eadb3.svg" alt="Diagram" width="364" height="65" )="">
</p>
</div>
<p>TicToc does <em>dynamic timestamp assignment</em>.  Instead of choosing a choosing a timestamp before execution, or proposing a timestamp right before commit, it narrows ranges of possible commit timestamps as it executes.</p>

Composing Transactional Systems
</h2> 
<p>A fun part of such a decomposition is that it can be inverted to raise fun questions.  Draw any made up diagram of a possible ordering or interleaving of execute, order, validate, and persist.  Now answer the question: how would I need to design a database such that it would decompose to this diagram?</p>
<p>From all the possible orderings and sets of concurrently executing steps, there’s at least 74 different types of databases that can exist.  We’ve covered only a few of those, but each of them derives some interesting property from its different ordering of the steps of transaction processing.  Looking for a novel transactional system to build and publish about?  Find an ordering which hasn’t been well explored in the literature before, design a system that executes transactions in that fashion, and then figure out what it’s uniquely good and bad at.</p>

<p>19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, who is visiting Tucson from Albuquerque, says he was lost and walking near the Border Patrol headquarters when an agent arrested him for illegally entering the country. Hermosillo was not carrying identification.</p>

<p>Another family member drove to the detention center, about 70 miles northwest of Tucson, but said officials wouldn’t provide any information or release him. </p>
<p>ICE did not respond to a request for comment about the wrongful detention. </p>
<p>The family later provided officials with his birth certificate and social security card.</p>
<p>“He did say he was a U.S. citizen, but they didn't believe him,” Layva said. “I think they would have kept him. I think they would have if they would have not got that information yesterday in the court and gave that to ICE and the Border Patrol. He probably would have been deported already to Mexico.”</p>
<p>A magistrate judge in Tucson dismissed his case on Thursday, and family says he was released much later that night. </p>
<p>There have been other recent cases of U.S. citizens being wrongly detained by immigration officials, including a man wrongly held in Florida after being pulled over during his commute to work. </p>

        <p>The Cinema Industry is using its own standards for creating and distributing movies in a secure way. The DCI (Digital Cinema Initiatives) specification defines everything from file formats and encryption to the projection systems itself.</p>

<p>The specification itself is <a href="https://www.dcimovies.com/" target="_blank">publicly available</a> but relies on various IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and SMPTE (Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers) standards, which have to be purchased.</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>This document will show a rough overview of the DCI workflow and describe in detail how the encryption of a DCI movie works. It will <strong>not</strong> show how to break any encryption and no encryption has been broken while writing this document. <strong>From our perspective, the DCI standard is safe</strong>.</p>

<p>The author of this document has been operating a cinema since 2021, without any insight to the distribution or production side of the industry. Some information may be incomplete.</p>

<h2 id="how-its-started">How it’s started</h2>

<p>End of 2023 the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6166392/" target="_blank">WONKA</a> was released. Some cinemas reported, that they are unable to start this movie on their projector.</p>

<p>The reason was, that a certificate used by the distributor was expired. This certificate was used to sign the DCP files.</p>

<p>The distributor published new files, starting the movie worked again.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity the author started to check how the validation process on the projector is working.</p>

<h2 id="projection-systems">Projection Systems</h2>

<p>Most of the Projection Systems consists of Server, Audio Processor and Projector.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>The Server stores the DCPs and KDMs, manages Playlists and controls the Projector and Audio Processor hardware.</p>

<p>Many Cinemas also connect their Theatre Automation (light, curtains, etc.) to the projector. By setting time-based commands into the playlists, lights and screen curtain can be controlled automatically. The Projector Server provides 12V/24V relays for this.</p>

<p>These time-based commands are also used to set the correct Aspect Ratio and Volume on the different DCPs in a Playlist.</p>

<p>The Server can be controlled remotely by a PC or in larger cinemas by a Theatre Management System.</p>

<p>The DCPs are imported from USB/CRU hard drives or by internet download to the server. They are stored encrypted at all times.</p>

<p>The projector includes a so called “Media Block” which handles DRM and decryption. It receives the DCP data and the KDM to decrypt each frame in real time.</p>

<p>On DCP playback the Projector will send the decrypted PCM audio to the Audio Processor which will then send each processed Audio Channel to the respective Speakers.</p>

<h3 id="mastering-process">Mastering Process</h3>

<p>During the Mastering Process a static AES 128 bit key is generated and the original medium is converted into MXF files. One for picture and one for audio.</p>

<p>For mastering the tool <a href="https://dcpomatic.com/" target="_blank">DCP-o-matic</a> can be used. There are also some commercial products.</p>

    dcp --&gt; dcpsub["Encrypted&lt;br&gt;Subtitle Data"]
</code></pre>

<p>The video stream is encoded as one single JPEG2000 picture per frame. Each frame is encrypted with the same static AES key.</p>

<p>The audio stream is (most likely) chunked into one BWF (Broadcast Wave Format) stream per frame and also encrypted separately. (The author haven’t found any information about this yet.)</p>

<p>A DCP can have a size of 200 GB or more. Some newer releases can hit the Terabyte, if multiple versions (Languages, Subtitles, 2D/3D) are shipped on the same harddrive.</p>

<p>The subtitles are provided in an XML file or are burned directly into the picture frames. If it is provided as an XML file, the projector will render the subtitles using a TTF font file.</p>

<p>A supplemental DCP allows to reuse the Original DCP (OV, Original File) picture and replace audio or subtitle tracks. This makes it possible to support different languages without the need of shipping hundreds of gigabytes of duplicated picture data to the cinemas.</p>

<p>Example: One version file for German with German subtitles and one for French with German subtitles.</p>

<p>It is even possible to provide differnt cuts of a movie for different regions.</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p>Two Open Source C++ implementations, both in active development, one from the industry!</p>

<p>cth103/libdcp, a C++ library written by the makers of DCP-o-matic:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://git.carlh.net/gitweb/?p=dcpomatic.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/main" target="_blank">https://git.carlh.net/gitweb/?p=dcpomatic.git;a=shortlog</a></li>

</ul>

<p>asdcplib, a C++ library written by companies active in the cinema industry:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The asdcplib project was originally exchanged by FTP. The project was on SourceForge between 2005 and 2008, when it moved to a release-only distribution via CineCert. As of late February 2019, its new home is on github.</p>

  <p>– <a href="https://github.com/cinecert/asdcplib" target="_blank">https://github.com/cinecert/asdcplib</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Almost all software, commercial or open source is using one of these libraries.</p>

<h2 id="distribution">Distribution</h2>

<p>The symmetric encryption key for the DCP has to be protected in some way. For this, the producer will create a DKDM XML file, containing the AES Key, which has been encrypted with the Certificate Public Key of the distributor.</p>

<p>The distributor can then use the DKDM to create KDM XML files for cinemas. This means decrypting the DCP AES Key and encrypting it again with the Certificate Public Key of the target projection system.</p>

<h2 id="certificate-chains">Certificate Chains</h2>

<p>Both projectors and distributors use SSL certificate chains to sign and encrypt/decrypt data.</p>

<p>A chain always consists of a Root Certificate Authority (CA), Intermediate CA and a Leaf Certificate.</p>

<p>(This is a subset of checks documented in the <a href="https://www.dcimovies.com/compliance_test_plan/" target="_blank">DCI Compliance Test Plan</a>)</p>

<p>The projector itself has no trusted CA store for validating KDMs or DCPs. The whole process relies on the fingerprint stored in the <code>&lt;enc:CipherValue&gt;</code> and that the recipient cinema has no access to the Projectors Private Key.</p>

<h2 id="trusted-device-list">Trusted Device List</h2>

<p>Could one just build their own DCI/DCP projector?</p>

<p>Yes and no.</p>

<p>The software exists, in theory just a Linux PC and any projector / sound system is required.</p>

<p>The distributors use a so called “Trusted Device List” provided by the DCI certified projection system manufacturers. Projectors which are not mentioned on these lists will not get a DCP/KDM from many distributors.</p>

<p>Also a DCI certified projection system must be installed by an authorized company.</p>

<ul>
  <li>KDM Request by Serial Number: Many distributors just ask for projector model and serial number. They can query the actual projection system certificate in their distribution system</li>
  <li>KDM Request by Certificate: The cinema has to provide their projector certificate which is then validated against the projection systems manufacturer root certificate</li>
</ul>

<p>If a cinema is not “playing by the rules”, a 30k+ EUR projection system will become an expensive brick.</p>

<h2 id="magic-signatures">Magic Signatures</h2>

<p>At first, the decrypted Frame could not be opened in GIMP.</p>

<p>To enable programs to open a file in the correct way, many files contain so called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures" target="_blank">Magic Signatures</a>” at its beginning.</p>

<p>This magic value in <code>block-decrypted-data.bin</code> is incorrect for unknown reasons. When extracting a JPEG2000 frame from an unencrypted MXF, the signature is correct. As a simple hack, the author just copied the signature from the unencrypted MXF frame to the decrypted one:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># offset again from MXFInspect</span>
<span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>j2c_caa6b39e-bd57-4676-9797-112e96a6f0c3.mxf <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1 <span>skip</span><span>=</span>16524 <span>count</span><span>=</span>20085 <span>of</span><span>=</span>frame.bin

<span># unencrypted frame does not contain crypto info</span>
<span># so we just have to slice the first BER header</span>
<span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>framedata.bin.j2k <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1 <span>skip</span><span>=</span>20 <span>count</span><span>=</span>16 <span>of</span><span>=</span>j2k_header.bin

<span># now back to the decrypted mxf frame</span>
<span># replace signature</span>
<span>cp </span>j2k_header.bin frame.j2k
<span>dd </span><span>if</span><span>=</span>block-decrypted-data.bin <span>bs</span><span>=</span>1 <span>skip</span><span>=</span>16 <span>&gt;&gt;</span> image.j2k
</code></pre></div>

<p>It should now be possible to open the file in GIMP. GIMP will show the frame with wrong colors, as MXF files use a custom color space.</p>

<h2 id="why-its-safe">Why it’s safe</h2>

<p>Everything relies on “never reusing AES Keys” and “protected private keys”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>KDM data is encrypted with a 2048 bit RSA key</li>
  <li>MXF data is encrypted with AES-128</li>
  <li>Decryption keys are always stored in TPM-like hardware</li>
  <li>Every DCP uses unique encryption keys</li>
  <li>Every projector uses unique certificates/keys</li>
  <li>A DCI certified projector is required</li>
  <li>Distributors can verify if a certificate belongs to a certified DCI projector</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="just-record-it">Just record it</h2>

<p>Encrypted DCPs use <a href="https://dcpomatic.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2372" target="_blank">Forensic Watermarks</a> which contain the serial number of the
projection system. So if a recorded copy of a movie appears online, the theatre will have to answer
serious questions and may never get movies again.</p>

<p>Pirated copies of movies have it’s origin most likely from other sources.</p>

<h2 id="how-its-going">How it’s going</h2>

<p>DCI has released version 1.4.4 of the <a href="https://www.dcimovies.com/specification/" target="_blank">specification</a>, which now allows playback of DCPs with expired signer certificate.</p>

<p>The manufacturers already started to work on a software update.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Movies are handmade, and just like any other art form, sometimes the seams that hold movies together become visible to the audience. For movie fans, these moments are very exciting. Catching a glimpse behind the scenes is an exhilarating experience. My favorite kind of “movie mistake” is the kind that is hiding in plain sight... but the casual viewer missed it upon first viewing. Or perhaps even the second viewing, or even the third.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m particularly obsessed with moments that reveal the craft and artistry of the magic trick of a shot that slightly shatters the illusion of cinema. These revealing moments have been in movies since the dawn of cinema, and are everywhere (if you know exactly where to look).</p><p>One of my favorite films of all time also has one of the funniest revealing mistakes I've seen. Edward Zwick's "Glory" (1989) takes place during the American Civil War, and this scene has a blink-and-you'll-miss-it reminder of the film's very modern production:</p><p>Because the audiences' eyes are firmly fixed on Morgan Freeman's character in the center of frame, very few will ever pick up the little kid with the extremely modern wristwatch that enters frame on far screen right. Sometimes the on-set teams that work with featured extras—as well as the costume department that dress the extras—will occasionally miss a modern piece of jewelry on an actor.</p><p>Here's a fun one from Martin Scorsese's masterpiece "Goodfellas" (1990), in one of the closing shots of a nail-bitingly tense scene where Karen nearly walks into an ambush:</p><p>The period-appropriate "movie" license plate dramatically dangles then completely falls off the car in the middle of the take, revealing the actual 1990-era license plate of the car used for the scene. This is an accidental and hilarious glimpse into the detailed hard work that goes into making a Hollywood period piece (this portion of the film takes place in 1980), where every license plate of every car in the movie needed special, detailed work to make them period-appropriate.&nbsp;</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcj2VC4Ju_5PCmfKdkGkSC6r2UzvK2qzh0d6NcxdtSdPSk24l8m5oTt3Yeq5GLp0wPZqjUlq1pHDiutRKWpMZucWukSa3qBfHw8J8KOu-dGExAWf97ym5Ikpif9BbZnKqLOwef_z1I2FXFFradn3C8BOr2GkMU8SfJzmBafEDtnv_4d8FeV4/s1908/illustration.png"><img data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1908" height="226" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhMcj2VC4Ju_5PCmfKdkGkSC6r2UzvK2qzh0d6NcxdtSdPSk24l8m5oTt3Yeq5GLp0wPZqjUlq1pHDiutRKWpMZucWukSa3qBfHw8J8KOu-dGExAWf97ym5Ikpif9BbZnKqLOwef_z1I2FXFFradn3C8BOr2GkMU8SfJzmBafEDtnv_4d8FeV4/w400-h226/illustration.png" width="400"></a></p><p>The finale of James Cameron's epic "Aliens" (1986) features the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen) getting severed in half, but still functioning enough to save Newt (Carrie Henn) from getting sucked into the vacuum of space.

But in order to get that little bit of extra athletic stretch to grab Newt, Henriksen popped his body out of the hole a little too far, revealing the classic stage trick. However, I'd gather that 99% of the audience has never noticed this little reveal of stagecraft since our eyes are fixed on Newt on screen right, sliding toward the airlock, and not on the ground contact of Bishop's half-body, which had already been firmly established in the scene.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjU9LeqQEqiQZjf4bniZIvtLsXvLwZa6loSJneVo01NSsgsU60jw0nlF-YB-lQmdd3o-Uq1GOWb19_ctP1J5GMakIBHgCWrFCIlg2OQ1QS49k1ZIFyPaqOCOhpnfLCJCnWn3rWQ-QmSqboHlgpw6WxJPAy-OnoK0rnsMiPOX5SqBjT9fLJOQRc/s1045/circled.png"><img data-original-height="568" data-original-width="1045" height="217" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjU9LeqQEqiQZjf4bniZIvtLsXvLwZa6loSJneVo01NSsgsU60jw0nlF-YB-lQmdd3o-Uq1GOWb19_ctP1J5GMakIBHgCWrFCIlg2OQ1QS49k1ZIFyPaqOCOhpnfLCJCnWn3rWQ-QmSqboHlgpw6WxJPAy-OnoK0rnsMiPOX5SqBjT9fLJOQRc/w400-h217/circled.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Avoiding reflections of the crew appearing to camera is a constant struggle for filmmakers. In Steven Spielberg's first masterpiece "Duel" (1971), David (Dennis Weaver) gets into a phone booth to make a call, with the front glass face of the booth aimed directly at the camera, and if the audience's gaze drifted off of Weaver's face, they could catch a glimpse of the crew:</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF2nMOIJJcigCUwmwYiNCUFK3LSPyqR98CGn7XdriPNtxl1cJ-wHIb11RxPjm3u9LVV8LmypcMzbLLQl8DTTNwrp5eGMx6rs-PPazN7hPp2PihyphenhyphenZrkldyEB49amd3N0gr4tlT-KCokNOIhysaS60VIYxoVWxvTWUoNJR6QUAzH99MOtfshAHY/s442/duel_short.gif"><img data-original-height="249" data-original-width="442" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF2nMOIJJcigCUwmwYiNCUFK3LSPyqR98CGn7XdriPNtxl1cJ-wHIb11RxPjm3u9LVV8LmypcMzbLLQl8DTTNwrp5eGMx6rs-PPazN7hPp2PihyphenhyphenZrkldyEB49amd3N0gr4tlT-KCokNOIhysaS60VIYxoVWxvTWUoNJR6QUAzH99MOtfshAHY/w400-h225/duel_short.gif" width="400"></a></p><p><i><span>"Duel" (1971)</span></i></p><p>In the reflection, we see a few crew members on screen left, the camera itself, and director Spielberg on the right (he's the one shuffling left and right, who lowers his head in the middle of the take). Again, like all the examples I'm providing in this article, hardly anyone would ever notice these moments. When a viewer catches these brief moments, the illusion of the movie is briefly broken, but for fans of the filmmaking process, it's a joyful reminder of the overall magic trick. The most intimate movie scene with only two characters in a desolate, isolated environment actually was created by dozens and dozens of crew members standing slightly out of frame.</p><p>Look for another accidental 'crew caught on camera' moment in the reflection in a car window in the 'leave the gun, take the cannoli' scene from "The Godfather" (1972), one that very few people ever notice.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgASHi1vEZJq9xexlwe6N6XnaKUFAH4aOLXmHKCv9BVNxVMiPwJ_Pj_nEabuKrD-nJqZDhITBBmRoNdyYmO3jKQEgLzkHPChAr50lpMRd5yJYt6whAJlaIVY7wOBLK18qVEOOpCbj4b7YeAIAjvItvDNC0tKFlLCk2P8s3NtQRy7Ahvy9kMCe8/s1920/duel_circle.png"><img data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1920" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgASHi1vEZJq9xexlwe6N6XnaKUFAH4aOLXmHKCv9BVNxVMiPwJ_Pj_nEabuKrD-nJqZDhITBBmRoNdyYmO3jKQEgLzkHPChAr50lpMRd5yJYt6whAJlaIVY7wOBLK18qVEOOpCbj4b7YeAIAjvItvDNC0tKFlLCk2P8s3NtQRy7Ahvy9kMCe8/w400-h225/duel_circle.png" width="400"></a></p><p>Here's a super quick revealing mistake from "The Dark Knight" (2008) that is a true "you'll never see this in real time" moment:</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg914mIcnatARLUxXQIIv3YV-sMpkCbW5HIt6fqjlMW70OT5z6_Rn39zeenC42Sq_UYQk-eFX6DwW4aAUj9td-cqk0pzWhx0utnQOq8yuzxDn2hSJ2ptXYxhfydZaTz-F8Dho6lDeOgrdNuegiP2B0cHQe8UuDjRSX4EhWDSoU_HilsML5NXIA/s526/darkknight_crew_BRIGHTfull.2025-04-17%2012_56_27.gif"><img data-original-height="219" data-original-width="526" height="166" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg914mIcnatARLUxXQIIv3YV-sMpkCbW5HIt6fqjlMW70OT5z6_Rn39zeenC42Sq_UYQk-eFX6DwW4aAUj9td-cqk0pzWhx0utnQOq8yuzxDn2hSJ2ptXYxhfydZaTz-F8Dho6lDeOgrdNuegiP2B0cHQe8UuDjRSX4EhWDSoU_HilsML5NXIA/w400-h166/darkknight_crew_BRIGHTfull.2025-04-17%2012_56_27.gif" width="400"></a></p><p><i><span>"The Dark Knight" (2008)</span></i></p></div><p>Although "The Dark Knight" example gives the audience a much clearer look at the camera operator, the focus puller(?) and the camera itself reflected in the interrogation room’s mirrors, the shot is a lot harder to see the crew members and equipment in real time due to the chaotic and energetic camera movement, as opposed to the locked off nature of the "Duel" example.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0YNfNS0gG-xlaqmH-9KJDvwwpsHkIMycqul7SW8X2hE-LNZf0RHBM3LIXuQRlqQo0xD4sj5xzUW_Cu-A2gMXeBUmN55gZwHMlDuBL3nuxqCt0rJDDSGM2hTUzrkuWXxuxIg73mSaclQudBt75y_w_X8YsuWQRFC7iPc5NDSb6dQnQ2D3JxAQ/s1918/darkknight_compare.png"><img data-original-height="800" data-original-width="1918" height="166" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0YNfNS0gG-xlaqmH-9KJDvwwpsHkIMycqul7SW8X2hE-LNZf0RHBM3LIXuQRlqQo0xD4sj5xzUW_Cu-A2gMXeBUmN55gZwHMlDuBL3nuxqCt0rJDDSGM2hTUzrkuWXxuxIg73mSaclQudBt75y_w_X8YsuWQRFC7iPc5NDSb6dQnQ2D3JxAQ/w400-h166/darkknight_compare.png" width="400"></a></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibaiynJTHf2-1u0HH7_do8IU4-CU7kzWOzAUP4syOn9_7YRAVLSowGvKwEPI52YA3rk4xAUpd4BzXJbBpfnADRmYZoijN4Vkim_OHVJjFrp1S1e8p2AokM1GJDAPSojCoRP4DgcbKlGzmjGpRLrPrZoADLBab4haCQzNsrzxSHo7ThaySW63w/s500/abyss_wipe.gif"><img data-original-height="281" data-original-width="500" height="225" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEibaiynJTHf2-1u0HH7_do8IU4-CU7kzWOzAUP4syOn9_7YRAVLSowGvKwEPI52YA3rk4xAUpd4BzXJbBpfnADRmYZoijN4Vkim_OHVJjFrp1S1e8p2AokM1GJDAPSojCoRP4DgcbKlGzmjGpRLrPrZoADLBab4haCQzNsrzxSHo7ThaySW63w/w400-h225/abyss_wipe.gif" width="400"></a></p><p><i><span>"The Abyss" (1989)</span></i></p><p>Amazingly, many folks who watch that clip from the dramatic drowning sequence cannot consciously see the bit of filmmaking that literally blocks the actors in an intimate moment.

Cinema is worse off when over-aggressive restorations alter the action within the frame. To me, this is equivalent to swapping out an actor's performance with a different take, or changing the music score during an action sequence, or replacing a puppet creature with a computer graphics version of the same creature decades after release. But I digress.</p><p>• &nbsp;• &nbsp;• &nbsp;•</p><p>Like I said at the start, movies are handmade, and that's true even in today's landscape where digital visual effects are a prominent part of filmmaking. In the same way that physical crews use physical tools to build sets, construct costumes and craft props, visual effects artists use digital tools to craft an image. And with the hand-made nature of any art form, the lack of clinical accuracy lends to its charm and sometimes offers an accidental peek behind the scenes of how the art was constructed.</p><p>Every few years, a "Star Wars" revealing mistake bubbles up on the internet, one from the Mustafar sequence from Episode III, "Revenge of the Sith" (2005).

A massive undertaking, "Sith" required a herculean effort from hundreds of artists and technicians at ILM, crafting 367 computer- generated models, hundreds of 3D and 2D environments, 47 practical miniature setups, and 13,000,000 renders and composites across 2,151 effects shots.</span></p><p><span>Out of all of the effects sequences in the picture, perhaps none was more challenging than the operatic duel between Darth Vader (Hayden Christensen) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) on the volcanic planet of Mustafar. The battle starts within the Klegger Corp Mining Facility situated high on the rocky banks of a vast lava river, and progresses through the facility onto a heat-collection arm stretching over a fast- moving river of boiling magma, and then onto a pair of lava skiffs and panning droids. The battle finally ends on a bank with Vader severely burned and maimed.</span></p><p><span>For the Mustafar sequence, ILM’s team of compositors, led by Compositing Supervisor Pat Tubach and Sequence Supervisor Michael Conte, were faced with the daunting challenge of seamlessly blending all of these live-action plates, computer-generated imagery, and miniature effects, into one cohesive sequence. But with so many individual elements, mistakes happen, and in the case of Revenge of the Sith, a peculiar anomaly slipped through the cracks at precisely 1 hour, 59 minutes, and 2 seconds into the film.</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9Y3af6L5NqwRyByVmK5V-h8fEwV8KjiN0r1UbtqwggsMCVMTciUmSBPrJO9YHUushdOESEJ2UsYi4113wq3UGQo2_Q1LRMccUwyI3_lR7dpLbGn3D0EQoVvELQYDjg8yHCrD9b6mN-evcA8cmvodXq1CS13glDu4Yw_rgxKZMR53P3gDJHGc/s500/finalsequence.gif"><span><img data-original-height="213" data-original-width="500" height="170" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj9Y3af6L5NqwRyByVmK5V-h8fEwV8KjiN0r1UbtqwggsMCVMTciUmSBPrJO9YHUushdOESEJ2UsYi4113wq3UGQo2_Q1LRMccUwyI3_lR7dpLbGn3D0EQoVvELQYDjg8yHCrD9b6mN-evcA8cmvodXq1CS13glDu4Yw_rgxKZMR53P3gDJHGc/w400-h170/finalsequence.gif" width="400"></span></a></p><p><span>The internet, ever vigilant, began to take notice of this curious artifact around 2015 – a blink-and-you’ll-miss- it moment of a ghostly-robed figure with dark hair that appears behind Anakin Skywalker for only a frame or two just as he leaps from the panning droid to meet Obi-Wan on the lava skiff. The strange figure sparked countless theories and speculation. Was it a “Force ghost”? An easter egg from a mischievous ILM artist?</span></p><p><span>Todd Vaziri, a seasoned veteran at ILM who also worked on the film as a compositor, was intrigued by the mystery. “Just before the release of The Force Awakens, I started to see this ‘easter egg’ bubble up on social media from time to time of what appears to be a Force ghost on Mustafar,” Vaziri says. “The discourse would really get going. Somebody would spot the artifact and go, ‘What the heck was this?’ And another would say, ‘What do you mean? I don’t see anything.’ And only when you step through the scene, frame-by-frame, do you see what looks like a ghostly face behind Anakin in the shot where he jumps up from the panning droid to continue the lightsaber duel on the lava skiff. And honestly, in-motion, nobody can spot this.”</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYvOBxrHhHq0CiZlSavot6K1cDeaDHKK-OxHOqGpiSBTKMahcyR_4sUwab0y8EJscd2r8mJQ75Diy1xT2gfg4jxRGa6TTmg6dmtG7WUF2u08Se3LSXIRzPUQBE9ItefL8dKzv8yAISsj9fjyVb3VtciyuWcKQDtQpefp2SocuSAFUSMAxeL_M/s500/animation.gif"><span><img data-original-height="213" data-original-width="500" height="170" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYvOBxrHhHq0CiZlSavot6K1cDeaDHKK-OxHOqGpiSBTKMahcyR_4sUwab0y8EJscd2r8mJQ75Diy1xT2gfg4jxRGa6TTmg6dmtG7WUF2u08Se3LSXIRzPUQBE9ItefL8dKzv8yAISsj9fjyVb3VtciyuWcKQDtQpefp2SocuSAFUSMAxeL_M/w400-h170/animation.gif" width="400"></span></a></p><p><span>Getting to the bottom of the mystery would prove difficult. ILM works on dozens of motion pictures and television shows per year, and as older projects are moved offline into their archives, the steps to bring them back to the servers are involved. Revenge of the Sith was no exception. It would require scavenging through terabytes of unaltered greenscreen photography that hasn’t been touched in years. So Vaziri put it behind him – for a time. But in 2024 when the discourse regarding the “Force ghost” roared alive again on social media, Vaziri decided that enough was enough. But in order to locate the anomaly, he would need to spelunk into the film’s digital archives at ILM which had since gone dark.</span></p><p><span>“I think it took 24 hours to unearth the footage and put it back on our servers. I was so excited, my heart was pounding out of my chest. No one had seen the original greenscreen footage for nearly twenty years,” Vaziri says. “The problem was I didn’t remember exactly what these plates looked like, both because it wasn’t my shot, and it was two decades prior. So I dug, and I dug, and finally I found the plate photography. I couldn’t believe it. There on set was a man—likely a stunt rigger—wearing not a robe, but a peculiar shirt that resembled one, standing behind Hayden, manually puppeteering the greenscreen lava skiff that he and Ewan were fighting on. His face and the “Force ghost” matched up frame-for-frame.” During this excavation process, Vaziri was also able to uncover a variety of in-progress versions of the shot composited with very basic layering. In those early takes, the robed man was not present. This meant one thing: the compositor had done some articulates to remove the mystery man, but the green screen extraction wasn’t quite done yet.</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxmX6_02BHHum6AiA3Hz9X3NDxDsyzBCfeyj6Rs-rmTDZoZEw78OEj1hvTlxbHn1-G1R-Ur0Qdy7G2vhbuy_AP1tza0uAlHr216oz-MXNbrp0WWbLEGNjVDALO9UZJG8WYd1jKz2yv5HAic4dNDS4SpXNTxr1dWCdI4rmtyb8VLFBnqDvRw74/s1175/greenscreen_compare.png"><span><img data-original-height="1175" data-original-width="1024" height="400" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxmX6_02BHHum6AiA3Hz9X3NDxDsyzBCfeyj6Rs-rmTDZoZEw78OEj1hvTlxbHn1-G1R-Ur0Qdy7G2vhbuy_AP1tza0uAlHr216oz-MXNbrp0WWbLEGNjVDALO9UZJG8WYd1jKz2yv5HAic4dNDS4SpXNTxr1dWCdI4rmtyb8VLFBnqDvRw74/w349-h400/greenscreen_compare.png" width="349"></span></a></p><p><span>“We have to do frame-by-frame tweaking by hand, which means creating new garbage mattes in order to paint details into the motion- blurred edges,” Vaziri explains. “At some point during the process of refining the edges of the green screen extraction—which required new garbage mattes—the stunt rigger’s head was inadvertently revealed again in that paint process—but because you can’t see it unless you are stepping through it frame-by-frame— it was deemed finished by the artist, by the compositing supervisor, by the visual effects supervisor, by the editors, and by George Lucas himself. Nobody that was part of this process ever caught that and that’s how it made it in the movie. But in a way, I think it’s really wonderful. Plenty of my shots have mistakes in them, and as the saying goes: perfect is the enemy of good. We want our shots to be as perfect as they can be, but we can’t hit everything. In the last 20 years, we have evolved what we call the “Final Check” process, which is our way of scrutinizing shots before they leave ILM. An extra step of quality control, if you will. The bottom line is that we put human hands on every single one of the thousands of shots that you see in Star Wars. This world is handmade, and little things like this become part of ILM history.”</span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTXZ4c7qoZ-d8aejJQ29QoqgvIpqihCiRAzFobTxRC5Wd_fJxQThJNkviLOd6L1Af4jhMZrRBRq4ZqoqelEiwSrtaeucjjLlMbdIxhRj_JY9uZccfDtynD7uPPTj-leY98QlCpz2uyy8cFBtkyQiBRHMF2a7EsFY6sfBlL6gDr9XFN2VCBI7E/s1593/greenscreen_singleframeBCROP.jpeg"><span><img data-original-height="783" data-original-width="1593" height="196" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTXZ4c7qoZ-d8aejJQ29QoqgvIpqihCiRAzFobTxRC5Wd_fJxQThJNkviLOd6L1Af4jhMZrRBRq4ZqoqelEiwSrtaeucjjLlMbdIxhRj_JY9uZccfDtynD7uPPTj-leY98QlCpz2uyy8cFBtkyQiBRHMF2a7EsFY6sfBlL6gDr9XFN2VCBI7E/w400-h196/greenscreen_singleframeBCROP.jpeg" width="400"></span></a></p><p><span><span><i>detail of the original greenscreen footage</i></span></span></p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMNJa-NicVw7dMWKVk8mXjvd0wilCDs1xhqFR8-_L8uo2WD7_q9AcNWKUmY6eO8KNuHB1RflBg_z2UnTAJV-EB4BUJJrkEqzWcr4SrauZGkSAK2TqA9LHHvNJ1-6oiNdIYZVlsaVrE4AV4l4uIqArxzA8HfgyNJkzXgHnPHUvWw2eBUa0SJzg/s1918/finalshot_singleframeB.jpg"><span><img data-original-height="816" data-original-width="1918" height="170" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiMNJa-NicVw7dMWKVk8mXjvd0wilCDs1xhqFR8-_L8uo2WD7_q9AcNWKUmY6eO8KNuHB1RflBg_z2UnTAJV-EB4BUJJrkEqzWcr4SrauZGkSAK2TqA9LHHvNJ1-6oiNdIYZVlsaVrE4AV4l4uIqArxzA8HfgyNJkzXgHnPHUvWw2eBUa0SJzg/w400-h170/finalshot_singleframeB.jpg" width="400"></span></a></p><p><span><span><i>the final shot as it appears in the film</i></span></span></p><p><span>So there you have it, readers.

<p>At Revision 2025, we released "Signal Carnival" (<a href="https://csdb.dk/release/?id=252090">csdb</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/_Orvsms7Ils">YouTube</a>). This demo asks you to
switch the audio and video cable of your C64:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.quiss.org/signal_carnival/cross_small.png" alt="Diagram of audio and video crossed" title="">
(<strong>Diagram by Felidae</strong>)</p>

<p>Technically, "misplugging" those cables is not a completely new idea. In the
90s, it was a common thing to connect audio to both speaker and video,
to get screen flickering timed with the music beats.</p>

<p>However, "Signal Carnival" is the first production to switch both these
cables, while still being able to play meaningful audio and video.</p>

<h2>How to drive audio using a video signal</h2>

<p>The C64's VIC chip operates at a frequency of 7.9Mhz, and new values can be
written to it by the 6502 at a rate of up to 246kHz. Since even high
quality audio rarely exceeds 44kHz, this is easily a high enough frequency
to generate music.</p>

<p>Inspired by the music routine from freespin, we combined two timers to
get an interesting waveform, which is adjusted once per frame. This is
the code that drives audio:</p>

<pre><code>lda $dc06
ora $dd06
eor $02
sta $d020
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>$dc06</code> and <code>$dd06</code> are the lower bytes of the B timers of CIA #1 and #2,
respectively. They're in turn increased every time their A timers
overflow. And those are set to a new value for every new note.</p>

<p>Eor-ing with the value at zeropage <code>$02</code> allows to slightly tweak the waveform (and volume!),
and then the result is written to <code>$d020</code>, which is the screen color.
Only the brightness of said color matters (chrominance is encoded at the
PAL color carrier frequency, which is outside of the human hearing
range). There's no obvious relationship between the brightness of the C64 color
and its number, but that's fine - it actually makes the
waveforms more interesting.</p>

<p>Of course, the above uses up all four timers the C64 CIAs have, which means there
are no timers left for e.g. video stabilization, which is instead done
through the lightpen circuitry. (Finally! A use case for <code>$d013</code>. :))</p>

<p>Music is just one voice, but the song switches between voices (and
waveforms) often enough to sound mildly polyphonic.</p>

<h2>How to drive video using an audio signal</h2>

<p>The SID chip of the C64 internally operates (for PAL) at 9.85Mhz, and,
like the VIC, can be fed with new values at a rate of up to 246kHz.</p>

<p>The SID has a number of audio features. It can generate three voices
using multiple waveforms, it has an ADSR envelope generator, can sync
between voices, and apply filters.
Unfortunately, all this circuitry works at a (for video)
glacial pace: The highest frequency the chip can output is 3906Hz, which
is the equivalent of changing the video output every four rasterlines.
Similar with ADSR, for which the smallest possible configurable attack
time is 2 ms, so about 32 rasterlines.</p>

<p>But thankfully, there's also circuitry that is wired more directly and
and gives instant output: the volume register ($d418)!
This has been used in the past to generate samples at high frequencies
(16+ khz), and is a good choice for generating video, as well.</p>

<p>However, the C64 mainboard also, vexingly, passes the SID signal through
a analogue bandpass filter. And this always happens, regardless of
whether filtering is on or not.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.quiss.org/signal_carnival/filter.png" alt="Subsection of C64 mainboard circuit diagram" title=""></p>

<p>This means that the pixels we work with are very wide, and also horizontally
blurred. Here's one "pixel", displayed on my 1084 monitor:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.quiss.org/signal_carnival/onepixel_cropped.png" alt="Photo of 1084 display, with a blurry horizontal &quot;pixel&quot;" title=""></p>

<p>This blurryness poses an interesting constraint on effects. While technically,
you do have some degree of horizontal resolution, the blurriness makes it
unenticing to use it for scrollers. Here are a few letters, for illustration:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.quiss.org/signal_carnival/end.jpg" alt="Photo of three letters, heavily blurred" title=""></p>

<p>Signal Carnival makes heavy use of both axis,
but to cope with the bluriyness, the x axis is used for graphics elements that
are fine to blur, like e.g. textures.</p>

<p>Other than that, driving the video is just your normal vanilla video
bitbanging. Due to the bandpass filter, horizontal syncs (i.e., pulling
the signal line to ground) need to be precisely timed, so they get
recognized, but not mistaken for vertical syncs. (which differ from
horizontal syncs only in that the signal is pulled to ground a
little bit longer)</p>

<p>Video sync generation is happening at the same refresh frequency that
the VIC would have produced (so we can use raster interrupts and query
the lightpen), but we use a different horizontal frequency (64 cycles
per line instead of 63), since having that extra cycle proved useful
in a lot of effects. And besides, if you're generating your own
video signal, you might as well make your own rules!</p>

<h2>Loading</h2>

<p>I've written a new loader for probably every demo I've ever released on the C64,
and this one is no exception. Since a lot of the effects are quite
memory-hungry (we even play a sample at the end), loading breaks are
long enough that we can't just
<a href="http://www.quiss.org/freespin/loading.html">pause audio while they happen</a>.</p>

<p>Hence, we have to bitbang audio the entire time. Also while transferring
data from the drive to the C64. Also during decrunching. (The
decruncher actually unrolls all copy loops, also for that reason)</p>

<p>The loader has a few gimmicks, like doing on-the-fly GCR decoding that
allows to write to any page (not just stack), and it buffers (stashes) a
full kilobyte. <em>But</em> it's also a one-off, so it's missing tons of
features seen in fully-fledged C64 loaders. It doesn't even support
loading from tracks 18 and above yet (the demo uses 1-10.)
Also no checksumming. (So remember, kids, dust off your 1541 drives, or
Signal Carnival might not work!)</p>

<p>Talking about GCR decoding, I found it tedious to handcode the decoding
tables, so we instead wrote a solver that generates them given the code
that uses the tables, and the desired input/output. Very useful tool,
hopefully to be released soon.</p>

          Zig’s comptime feature is most famous for what it can do: generics!,
          <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-comptime-conditional-disable">conditional compilation</a>!,
          <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-comptime-tagged-union-subset">subtyping</a>!, serialization!,
          <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2025/03/19/comptime-zig-orm.html">ORM</a>! That’s fascinating, but, to be fair, there’s a bunch of
          languages with quite powerful compile time evaluation capabilities
          that can do equivalent things. What I find more interesting is that
          Zig comptime is actually quite restrictive, by design, and won’t do
          many things! It manages to be very expressive <em>despite</em> being
          pretty limited. Let’s see!

          <p>
            When you execute code at compile time, on which machine does it
            execute? The natural answer is “on your machine”, but it is wrong!
            The code might not run on your machine, it can be cross compiled!
            For overall development sanity, it is important that <code>comptime</code> code observes the same behavior as the runtime
            code, and doesn’t leak details about the host on which the code is
            compiled. Zig doesn’t give comptime code access to host architecture
            (host — machine on which you compile code). Consider this Zig

            My understanding is that Jai, for example, doesn’t do this, and runs

            Rust’s declarative macros and const-fn don’t observe host

          <p>
            Many powerful compile-time meta programming systems work by allowing
            you to inject arbitrary strings into compilation, sort of like <code>#include</code> whose argument is a shell-script that generates the
            text to include dynamically. For example, D mixins work that way:
            <a href="https://dlang.org/articles/mixin.html">https://dlang.org/articles/mixin.html</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            And Rust macros, while technically producing a token-tree rather
            than a string, are more or less the same. In contrast, there’s
            absolutely no facility for dynamic source code generation in Zig.
            You just can’t do that, the feature isn’t!
          </p>
          <p>
            Zig has a completely different feature, partial
            evaluation/specialization, which, none the less, is enough to cover
            most of use-cases for dynamic code generation. Let’s see an
            artificial example:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>fn</span><span> f</span>(x: <span>u32</span>, y: <span>u32</span>) <span>u32</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>if</span> (x <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) <span>return</span> y <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;</span>
<span>    <span>if</span> (x <span>==</span> <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> y <span>*</span> <span>2</span>;</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> y;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This is a normal function that dispatches on the first argument to
            select an operation to apply to the second argument. Nothing fancy!
            Now, the single feature that Zig has is marking the first argument
            with <code>comptime</code>
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>fn</span><span> f</span>(<span>comptime</span> x: <span>u32</span>, y: <span>u32</span>) <span>u32</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>if</span> (x <span>==</span> <span>0</span>) <span>return</span> y <span>+</span> <span>1</span>;</span>
<span>    <span>if</span> (x <span>==</span> <span>1</span>) <span>return</span> y <span>*</span> <span>2</span>;</span>
<span>    <span>return</span> y;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The restriction here is that now, of course, when you call <code>f</code>, the first argument must be comptime-known. You can <span><code>f(92, user_input())</code>,</span> but you can’t
            <span><code>f(user_input(), 92)</code>.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The carrot you’ll get in exchange is a guarantee that, for each
            specific call with a particular value of <code>x</code>, the
            compiler will partially evaluate <code>f</code>, so only one branch
            will be left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Zig is an imperative language. Not everything is a function, there’s
            also control flow expressions, and they include partially-evaluated
            variations. For example, <code>for(xs)</code> is a normal runtime
            for loop over a slice, <code>comptime for(xs)</code> evaluates the
            entire loop at compile time, requiring that <code>xs</code> is
            comptime-known, and <code>inline for(xs)</code> requires that just
            the length of <code>xs</code> is known at comptime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s apply specialization to the classic problem solved by
            code-generation — printing. You can imagine a proc-macro style
            solution that prints a struct by reflecting on which fields it has
            and emitting the code to print each field.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Zig, the same is achieved by specializing a recursive <code>print</code> function on the value of type:
          </p>

          <p>
            Our <code>print</code> is set up exactly as our <code>f</code>
            before — the first argument is a comptime-known dispatch parameter.
            If <code>T</code> is an int or a string, the compiler calls <code>print_u32</code> or <code>print_string</code> directly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third case is more complicated. First, we use <code>@typeInfo</code> to get a comptime value describing our type, and,
            in particular, the list of fields it has. Then, we iterate this list
            and recursively print each field. Note that although the list of
            fields is known in its entirety, we can’t <code>comptime for</code>
            it, we need <code>inline for</code>. This is because the <em>body</em> of our loop depends on the runtime
            <code>value</code>, and can’t be fully evaluated at compile time.
            This might be easier to see if you think in terms of functions. The
            <code>for</code> loop is essentially a map:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span>map :: [a] -&gt; (a -&gt; b) -&gt; [b]</span>
<span>map xs f = ...</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            If both <code>xs</code> and <code>f</code> are comptime-known, you
            can evaluate the entire loop at compile time. But in our case <code>f</code> actually closes over a runtime value, so we can’t evaluate
            everything. Still, we can specialize on the first argument, which
            <em>is</em> known at compile time. This is precisely the difference
            between <code>comptime</code> and <code>inline</code>
            <code>for</code>.

            Many meta programming systems, like macros in Lisp or Rust, not only
            <em>produce</em> arbitrary code, but also take arbitrary custom
            syntax as input, as long as parentheses are matched:
          </p>

            Zig doesn’t have any extension points for custom syntax. Indeed, you
            can’t pass Zig <em>syntax</em> (code) to comptime functions at all!
            Everything operates on Zig values. That being said, Zig is very
            lightweight when it comes to describing free-form data, so this
            isn’t much of a hindrance. <em>And</em>
            in any case, you can always pass your custom syntax as a comptime
            string. This is exactly how “printf” works:
          </p>

          </h2>
          <p>
            Zig printing code looks suspiciously close to how you’d do this sort
            of thing in a dynamic language like Python. In fact, it is <em>precisely</em> that same code, except that it is specialized over
            runtime type information Python has to enable this sort of thing.
            Furthermore, Zig actually <em>requires</em> that all type meta
            programming is specialized away. Types as values <em>only</em> exist
            at compile time. Still, looking at our print, we might be concerned
            over code size — we are effectively generating a fresh copy of <code>print</code> for any data structure. Our code will be smaller, and
            will compile faster if there’s just a single <code>print</code> that
            takes an opaque pointer and runtime parameter describing the type of
            the value (its fields and offsets). So let’s roll our own runtime
            type information. For our example, we support ints, strings, and
            structs with fields. For fields, our RTTI should include their names
            and offsets:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>const</span> RTTI = <span>union</span>(<span>enum</span>) {</span>

          </figure>
          <p>
            The printing itself is not particularly illuminating, we just need
            to cast an opaque pointer according to RTTI:

            The call site is illustrative: we need <code>comptime</code> to <em>compute</em> the type information, but then we reify it as some
            real bytes in the binary, and use it as runtime value when calling
            <code>print_dyn</code>.

          </h2>
          <p>
            You can use Zig comptime to create new types. That’s how a <a href="https://matklad.github.io/2025/03/19/comptime-zig-orm.html">Zig ORM</a> can work. However, it is impossible to add methods to
            generated types, they must be inert bundles of fields. In Rust, when
            you use a derive macro, it can arbitrarily extend type’s public API,
            and you need to read proc macro docs (or look at the generated code)
            to figure out what’s available. In Zig, types’s API is always hand
            written, but it can use comptime reflection internally.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, if you are building a JSON serialization library in Zig, you
            can’t add <code>.to_json</code> method to user-types. You’ll
            necessarily have to supply a normal top-level function like
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>fn</span><span> to_json</span>(<span>comptime</span> T: <span>type</span>, value: T, writer: Writer) <span>!</span><span>void</span> {</span>
<span>    ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            If you want to make sure that types explicitly opt-in JSON
            serialization, you need to ask the user to mark types specially:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <pre><code><span><span>const</span> Person = <span>struct</span> {</span>
<span>    first_name: []<span>const</span> <span>u8</span>,</span>
<span>    last_name: []<span>const</span> <span>u8</span>,</span>
<span></span>
<span>    <span>pub</span> <span>const</span> JSONOptions = .{</span>
<span>        .style = .camelCase,</span>
<span>    };</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
          </figure>
          <p>
            With this setup, <code>to_json</code> can only allow primitives and
            types with <code>JSONOptions</code>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="No-IO">
          <h2>
            <a href="#No-IO">No IO </a>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Last but not least, Zig comptime does not allow any kind of input
            output. There isn’t even any kind of sandbox, as there are no IO
            facilities in the first place. So, while compiling the code, you
            can’t talk to your database to generate the schema. In exchange,
            compile time evaluation is hermetic, reproducible, safe, and
            cacheable.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you do need to talk to the database at build time, you can still
            do that, just through the build system! Zig’s <code>build.zig</code>
            is a general purpose build system, which easily supports the
            use-case of running an arbitrary Zig program to generate arbitrary
            Zig code which can then be normally
            <code>@import</code>ed.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="El-Disco">
          <h2>
            <a href="#El-Disco">El Disco </a>
          </h2>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.tedinski.com/2018/01/30/the-one-ring-problem-abstraction-and-power.html">Any abstraction has two sides</a>. Powerful abstractions are useful
            because they are more expressive. But the flip-side is that
            abstraction-using code becomes harder to reason about, because the
            space of what it can possibly do is so vast. This dependency is not
            zero sum. A good abstraction can be simultaneously more powerful and
            easier to reason about than a bad one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meta programming is one of the more powerful abstractions. It is
            very capable in Zig, and comes at a significant cost — Zig doesn’t
            have declaration-site type checking of comptime code. That being
            said, I personally find Zig’s approach to be uniquely tidy, elegant,
            and neat! It does much less than alternative systems, but ends
            extremely ergonomic in practice, and <em>relatively</em> easy to
            wrap ones head around.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.carette.xyz/posts/focus_will_be_the_skill_of_the_future/">https://www.carette.xyz/posts/focus_will_be_the_skill_of_the_future/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744394">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>If you frequent Hacker News regurlarly, you have likely noticed the buzz around engineers using AI
(specifically Large Language Models, or LLMs) to tackle Computer Science problems.</p>
<p>I want to be clear: <strong>I’m not against LLMs</strong>.<br>
LLMs are incredibly powerful tools, and <strong>can</strong> be a huge boon to engineers.
They can automate repetitive tasks, generate code snippets, help with brainstorming, assist in debugging, …
and this can frees up engineers’ time and mental energy, which could be channeled into more complex, creative problem-solving.<br>
But, like any tool, LLMs should be used <strong>wisely</strong>.<br>
LLMs can hallucinate, exhibit inconsistencies (especially with self-reflection models), and harbor biases. These limitations mean that LLM outputs require careful review before they can be trusted.</p>
<p>A key concern with LLMs lies in their training data.<br>
The data can be biased, contradictory sometimes, but those data contain solutions to known problems.<br>
If an engineer wants to “reinvent the wheel,” an LLM might offer a solution (good or bad, depending on the prompt). But when faced with truly <em>novel</em> problems, LLMs often provide unreliable responses, placing the burden of error detection squarely on the engineer.</p>
<p>This reliance on readily available solutions, particularly for familiar problems, creates a real risk: engineers may inadvertently atrophy their own problem-solving skills, hindering their ability to tackle truly novel challenges.<br>
The solution lies is <strong>balance</strong>, and a focus on the “why”, not just the “what”.<br>
Engineers should strive to understand the <em>reasoning</em> behind LLM-generated solutions, not simply accept them blindly.  Blind acceptance shifts the focus from <em>solving</em> problems to merely <em>obtaining</em> a solution.  Crucially, solving complex problems often depends on mastering simpler and foundational skills, which the engineer might lose quickly.</p>
<p>This idea summarizes why I disagree with those who equate the LLM revolution to the rise of search engines, like Google in the 90s.
Search enginers offer a good choice between <em>Exploration</em> (crawl through the list and pages of results) and
<em>Exploitation</em> (click on the top result).<br>
LLMs, however, do not give this choice, and tend to encourage immediate exploitation instead.
Users may explore if the first solution <strong>does not work</strong>, but the first
choice is <strong>always</strong> to exploit.<br>
<em>Exploitation</em> and <em>exploration</em> are complementary. Remove the exploration and you will introduce more and more instability into the exploitation process.</p>
<p>Computer Science emerged because Humans needed <strong>tools</strong> to solve problems faster and wanted to <strong>focus</strong> on the real problems, not repetitive tasks.
Humans built machines to accelerate problem-solving, but engineers remained the masters of the algorithms.<br>
I fear we’re losing our grip on this mastery.
Not because engineers are becoming less and less intelligent, but because the pressure to deliver solutions quickly is paramount.<br>
In embracing these “fast-paced solutions”, we risk losing a fundamental skill: <em>focus</em>. Because focus, like any skill, requires practice.</p>
<p>This is a worrying trend. If engineers become less adept at solving complex problems, what does the future hold?
Will our ability to tackle complex challenges rest solely on self-reflecting AIs, rather than human ingenuity?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Amid today’s AI boom, it’s disconcerting that we still don’t know how to measure how smart, creative, or empathetic these systems are. Our tests for these traits, never great in the first place, were made for humans, not AI. </span><a href="https://ai-analytics.wharton.upenn.edu/generative-ai-labs/research-and-technical-reports/tech-report-prompt-engineering-is-complicated-and-contingent/" rel="">Plus, our recent paper testing prompting techniques</a><span> finds that AI test scores can change dramatically based simply on how questions are phrased. Even famous challenges like the Turing Test, where humans try to differentiate between an AI and another person in a text conversation, were designed as thought experiments at a time when such tasks seemed impossible. But now that </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23674" rel="">a new paper shows that AI passes the Turing Test</a><span>, we need to admit that we really don’t know what that actually means. </span></p><p><span>So, it should come as little surprise that one of the most important milestones in AI development, Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, is badly defined and much debated. Everyone agrees that it has something to do with the ability of AIs to perform human-level tasks, though no one agrees whether this means expert or average human performance, or how many tasks and which kinds an AI would need to master to qualify. Given the definitional morass surrounding AGI, illustrating its nuances and history from its precursors to its initial coining by Shane Legg, Ben Goertzel and Peter Voss to today is challenging. As an experiment in both substance and form (and speaking of potentially intelligent machines) I delegated the work entirely to AI. I had Google Deep Research put together a </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJ-OzBRJUChgUB0L0--dbdNjU2e-14PXnoTqNFYgXNQ/edit?tab=t.0" rel="">really solid 26 page summary on the topic</a><span>. I then had HeyGen turn it into a video podcast discussion between a twitchy AI-generated version of me and an AI-generated host. It’s not actually a bad discussion (though I don’t fully agree with AI-me), but every part of it, from the research to the video to the voices is 100% AI generated.</span></p><p><span>Given all this, it was interesting to see </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/04/o3-and-agi-is-april-16th-agi-day.html" rel="">this post </a><span>by influential economist and close AI observer Tyler Cowen declaring that o3 is AGI.

Why does the AI come up with this incorrect answer? Because that is the answer to the classic version of the riddle, meant to expose unconscious bias: </span><em>“A father and son are in a car crash, the father dies, and the son is rushed to the hospital. The surgeon says, 'I can't operate, that boy is my son,' who is the surgeon?”</em><span> The AI has “seen” this riddle in its training data so much that even the smart o3 model fails to generalize to the new problem, at least initially. And this is just one example of the kinds of issues and hallucinations that even advanced AIs can fall prey to, showing how jagged the frontier can be.</span></p><p><span>But the fact that the AI often messes up on this particular brainteaser does not take away from the fact that it can </span><a href="https://scale.com/leaderboard/enigma_eval" rel="">solve much harder brainteasers</a><span>, or that it can do the other impressive feats I have demonstrated above. That is the nature of the Jagged Frontier. In some tasks, AI is unreliable. In others, it is superhuman. You could, of course, say the same thing about calculators, but it is also clear that AI is different. It is already demonstrating general capabilities and performing a wide range of intellectual tasks, including those that it is not specifically trained on. Does that mean that o3 and Gemini 2.5 are AGI? Given the definitional problems, I really don’t know, but I do think they can be credibly seen as a form of “Jagged AGI” - superhuman in enough areas to result in real changes to how we work and live, but also unreliable enough that human expertise is often needed to figure out where AI works and where it doesn’t. Of course, models are likely to become smarter, and a good enough Jagged AGI may still beat humans at every task, including in ones the AI is weak in.</span></p><p><span>Returning to Tyler’s post, you will notice that, despite thinking we have achieved AGI, he doesn’t think that threshold </span><a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/why-i-think-ai-take-off-is-relatively-slow.html" rel="">matters much to our lives in the near term</a><span>. That is because, as many people have pointed out, technologies do not instantly change the world, no matter how compelling or powerful they are. Social and organizational structures change much more slowly than technology, and technology itself takes time to diffuse. Even if we have AGI today, we have years of trying to figure out how to integrate it into our existing human world.</span></p><p><span>Of course, that assumes that AI acts like </span><a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/ai-as-normal-technology" rel="">a normal technology</a><span>, and one whose jaggedness will never be completely solved. There is the possibility that this may not be true. The agentic capabilities we're seeing in models like o3, like the ability to decompose complex goals, use tools, and execute multi-step plans independently, might actually accelerate diffusion dramatically compared to previous technologies. If and when AI can effectively navigate human systems on its own, rather than requiring integration, we might hit adoption thresholds much faster than historical precedent would suggest.</span></p><p>And there's a deeper uncertainty here: are there capability thresholds that, once crossed, fundamentally change how these systems integrate into society? Or is it all just gradual improvement? Or will models stop improving in the future as LLMs hit a wall? The honest answer is we don't know.</p><p><span>What's clear is that we continue to be in uncharted territory. The latest models represent something qualitatively different from what came before, whether or not we call it AGI. Their agentic properties, combined with their jagged capabilities, create a genuinely novel situation with few clear analogues. It may be that history continues to be the best guide, and that figuring out how to successfully apply AI in a way that shows up in the economic statistics may be a process measured in decades. Or it might be that we are on the edge of some sort of </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/03/technology/ai-futures-project-ai-2027.html" rel="">faster take-off</a><span>, where AI-driven change sweeps our world suddenly. Either way, those who learn to navigate this jagged landscape now will be best positioned for what comes next… whatever that is.</span></p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-jagged-agi-o3-gemini-25-and-everything?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/on-jagged-agi-o3-gemini-25-and-everything?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png" width="349" height="219.13953488372093" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/afdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:864,&quot;width&quot;:1376,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:349,&quot;bytes&quot;:2622025,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.oneusefulthing.org/i/161512556?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fafdef6bb-e268-4abe-a2ed-53ae3a68d4f1_1376x864.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>
