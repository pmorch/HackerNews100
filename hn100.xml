Pilots who examined the picture said this would be enough for just five or six minutes of flying.</p><p>Analysis of the log suggests the plane left Pisa with reserve fuel, as commercial flights are required to do.</p><p>A spokesperson for the airline said: “Ryanair reported this to the relevant authorities on Friday [3 October]. As this is now subject of an ongoing investigation, which we are co-operating fully with, we are unable to comment.”</p><p>The Air Accidents Investigation Branch confirmed on Thursday it had opened an investigation after being notified by Ryanair.</p><p>A spokesperson said: “The AAIB has commenced an investigation into a serious incident involving an aircraft which was diverted from Prestwick to Manchester Airport on Friday 3 October. AAIB inspectors have begun making inquiries and gathering evidence.”</p><p>The Boeing 737-800 can carry up to 189 passengers.

  <time datetime="2025-10-10 00:00:00 +0000 UTC">Oct 10, 2025</time>
  <br>By
  Eric Selin - Founder, statichost.eu
</header>
  <blockquote>
<p>For approximately six hours on 25.9.2025, the entire statichost.eu domain
was flagged as deceptive by Google Safe Search. This meant that anyone using
Google Safe Search was shown a very aggressive warning or outright blocked
when trying to access any site on the <code>statichost.eu</code> domain. In some cases
even custom domains hosted on the statichost.eu platform were affected. This
post is part incident report and part privacy (and monopoly) rant.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post sparked some discussion <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45538760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Hacker
News</a>, which is of course
great. I’d like to clarify that I do not hate Google, nor do I think that they
did anything particularly wrong by flagging malicious content (albeit with a
pretty wide net). I’m simply saying that Google is pretty darn big, and that I
personally think they are <em>too</em> big.</p>
<p>Google has too much power over the Internet. Or in the most objective way
possible: Google controls and/or monitors a substantial part of every single
interaction on the Internet. You may think that this is fine, and that is your
right, although I very much disagree. Especially since <strong>Google blocked all of
statichost.eu for “over five billion” devices for several hours</strong>. Here is how
it went down:</p>
<p>I woke up to some pretty bad news on Monday a couple of weeks ago. A few users
had started reporting that <code>statichost.eu</code> is unavailable due to a security
warning. This is not great, I think to myself, and go into incident response
mode. Immediately, I check <a href="https://www.statichost.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.statichost.eu</a>, and see that it’s working.
No TLS issues or other technical problems - maybe a browser issue or network
problem?</p>
<p>Ok, so I start investigating. The affected users all mention Google, so I
start there. I use Chromium for Google-specific things (only), so I open it up
and fire up a Google search. I actually cannot see <code>statichost.eu</code> on Google
now, which is weird - it should be the top-ranked result for my keywords (e.g.
“europen static hosting”). While I wait for Google Search Console to load, I
check <a href="https://www.statichost.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.statichost.eu</a> again in Chromium, just in case.</p>
<p>


<img src="https://www.statichost.eu/deceptive-site.png" alt="Google Safe Browsing deceptive site warning"></p>
<p><strong>And BOOM! There it is. Now I start panicing.</strong> Google is blocking me from
my own website! It apparently thinks I might be deceived - I guess into doing
something I shouldn’t do or something I’ll regret later?</p>
<p>Back in the Search Console, which has now loaded all its JavaScript and whatnot,
I see a giant error message: “Security issues detected”. There seems to be a
problem with phishing on the statichost.eu domain. All sites on statichost.eu
get a <code>SITE-NAME.statichost.eu</code> domain, and during the weekend there was an
influx of phishing sites. As a result of that, <code>statichost.eu</code> ended up on the
<a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Safe Browsing</a> list of “dangerous”
sites. Luckily, Google provided me with a helpful list of the offending sites,
which I could then promptly delete.</p>
<p>It is of course impossible to talk to anyone at Google in order to fix this,
but there is a “request review” button. After writing up an explanation and
requesting a review, all I could do was wait. I prepared for the worst, but
within a few hours, the block was lifted and an automatically generated response
of the same appeared as a notification in Search Console. Not even an email
was sent. <strong>Nonetheless: incident over</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to Google.</p>
<p>The stated goal of <a href="https://safebrowsing.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Safe Browsing</a>
is “Making the world’s information safely accessible.”. Yikes! But what does
it mean? It is basically a giant blacklist of sites that Google has deemed
unworthy. This list is then used by major browsers and anyone who wants to “make
information safely accessible” or whatever. According to Google, this protects
“over five billion devices”. That of course means that you really don’t want to
end up on this list!</p>
<p>And do you know how Google builds this list? By doing what they
do best: by monitoring absolutely everything. One tool for this
is Google Chrome - a “free” browser created by Google for its
business purposes. It of course <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/14746339" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sends the URLs of pages you visit
back to Google</a> -
I very much assume by default. And with “enhanced security
protection” turned on, <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it even sends some of the page content to
Google</a>. That is a very
neat way to monitor the comings and goings of <a href="https://backlinko.com/browser-market-share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">something like four billion
people</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair, many or even most sites on the Google Safe Browsing blacklist are
probably unworthy. But I’m pretty sure this was not the first false positive.
And I’m not sure this is the best way to tackle phishing. E.g. what happens
on the countless phishing sites that are not on this list? Be that as it may,
do not rely on Google to tell you who to trust. Use your own judgement and
hard-earned Internet street smarts.</p>
<p><strong>There are lots of problems on the Internet, but I for one don’t trust Google
to be our savior.</strong> There was a time when Google was different, but do not
mistake their friendly branding and legacy goodwill for something it is not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In order to limit the impact of similar issues in the future, all
sites on statichost.eu are now created with a <code>statichost.page</code>
domain instead. This domain is pending addition to the <a href="https://publicsuffix.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Suffix
List</a> in order to further increase resilience and
security.</p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 12:21:02 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.igalia.com/2025/10/09/Igalia,-Servo,-and-the-Sovereign-Tech-Fund.html">https://www.igalia.com/2025/10/09/Igalia,-Servo,-and-the-Sovereign-Tech-Fund.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45538137">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Igalia is excited to announce a new commission from the <a href="http://www.sovereign.tech/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> to advance the <a href="https://servo.org/">Servo web engine</a>. As stewards of Servo, Igalia is honored to receive support for a multi-pronged effort focused on public interest, developer usability, and long-term sustainability.</p>

<p>Servo is a modern, parallelized web engine written in Rust, a Linux Foundation Europe project which Igalia has been actively maintaining since 2023, Servo represents a bold rethinking of browser architecture. Its modular design has made it a valuable resource across the Rust ecosystem. But like many promising open source technologies, Servo needs sustained investment to reach its full potential.</p>

<p>Thanks to investment from the Sovereign Tech Fund, Igalia will focus some important work in the next year in three key areas:</p>

<h3 id="-initial-accessibility-support">🧭 Initial Accessibility Support</h3>
<p>As Servo adoption grows, so does the need for inclusive design. Today, Servo lacks the foundational accessibility features required to support screen readers and other assistive technologies. This limits its usability in many real-world scenarios, and doesn’t match our values.  Despite its importance, accessibility is often one of a few things that is difficult to find funding for.  We’re grateful that thanks to this investment, we’ll be able to implement initial accessibility support to ensure that Servo can serve all users. This work is essential to making Servo a viable engine for public-facing applications.</p>

<h3 id="-webview-api">🧩 WebView API</h3>
<p>Embedding Servo into applications requires a stable and complete WebView API. While early work exists, it’s not yet ready for general use. We’ll be finishing the WebView API to make Servo embeddable in desktop and mobile apps, unlocking new use cases and enabling broader adoption. A robust embedding layer is critical to Servo’s eventual success as a general-purpose engine.</p>

<h3 id="-project-maintenance">🔧 Project Maintenance</h3>
<p>Servo is more than a browser engine—it’s a collection of crates used widely across the Rust ecosystem. Maintaining these libraries benefits not just Servo, but the broader web platform. The project and the community have been growing a lot since we’ve taken over stewardship.  This funding will allow our work will include more issue triage, pull request review, version releases, and governance support. All of this helps ensure that Servo remains active, responsive, and well-maintained for developers and users alike.</p>

<p>Igalia has long championed open source innovation in the browser space, from our work on Chromium, WebKit, and Gecko to our leadership in standards bodies and developer tooling. We believe Servo has a unique role to play in the future of web engines, and we’re thrilled to help guide its next chapter.</p>

<p>Many thanks to the Sovereign Tech Fund for recognizing the importance of this work. We look forward to sharing progress as we go.</p>

  <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  We introduce a novel generative model, the Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN), that approximates data distribution using hierarchical discrete distributions. We posit that since the features within a network inherently capture distributional information, enabling the network to generate multiple samples simultaneously, rather than a single output, may offer an effective way to represent distributions. Therefore, DDN fits the target distribution, including continuous ones, by generating multiple discrete sample points. To capture finer details of the target data, DDN selects the output that is closest to the Ground Truth (GT) from the coarse results generated in the first layer. This selected output is then fed back into the network as a condition for the second layer, thereby generating new outputs more similar to the GT. As the number of DDN layers increases, the representational space of the outputs expands exponentially, and the generated samples become increasingly similar to the GT. This hierarchical output pattern of discrete distributions endows DDN with unique properties: more general zero-shot conditional generation and 1D latent representation. We demonstrate the efficacy of DDN and its intriguing properties through experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.

  (a) The data flow during the training phase of DDN is shown at the top. As the network depth increases, the generated images become increasingly similar to the training images. Within each Discrete Distribution Layer (DDL),  samples are generated, and the one closest to the training sample is selected as the generated image for loss computation. These  output nodes are optimized using Adam with the Split-and-Prune method. The right two figures demonstrate the two model paradigms supported by DDN. (b) Single Shot Generator Paradigm: Each neural network layer and DDL has independent weights. (c) Recurrence Iteration Paradigm: All neural network layers and DDLs share weights. For inference, replacing the Guided Sampler in the DDL with a random choice enables the generation of new images.</p></div>

  <h2 id="future-research-directions"><a name="future-research-directions" href="#future-research-directions"><span></span></a>Future Research Directions</h2>
  <p>Based on the current state of DDN (May 2025), I speculate on several possible future research directions. These include improvements to DDN itself and tasks suitable for the current version of DDN. Due to my limited perspective, some of these speculations might not be accurate:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Improving DDN through hyperparameter tuning, exploratory experiments, and theoretical analysis:</strong><br>The total time spent developing DDN was less than three months, mostly by a single person. Therefore, experiments were rough, and there was limited time for detailed analysis and tuning. There is significant room for improvement.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Scaling up to ImageNet-level complexity:</strong><br>Building a practical generative model with Zero-Shot Conditional Generation as a key feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Applying DDN to domains with relatively small generation spaces:</strong>  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Conditional training tasks where the condition provides rich information, such as image colorization and super-resolution.</li>
  <li>Generative models for discriminative tasks, such as depth estimation, optical flow estimation, and pose estimation.</li>
  <li>Robotics applications, where DDN could replace diffusion models in <a href="https://anuragajay.github.io/decision-diffuser/">Diffusion Policy</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15657">Decision Diffuser</a> frameworks.</li>
  <li>In these domains, DDN has advantages over diffusion models:<ul>
  <li>Single forward pass to obtain results, no iterative denoising required.</li>
  <li>If multiple samples are needed (e.g., for uncertainty estimation), DDN can directly produce multiple outputs in one forward pass.</li>
  <li>Easy to impose constraints during generation due to DDN's Zero-Shot Conditional Generation capability.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Applying DDN to non-generative tasks:</strong>  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>DDN naturally supports unsupervised clustering. And its unique latent representation could be useful in data compression, similarity retrieval, and other areas.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Using DDN's design ideas to improve existing generative models:</strong>  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>For example, the first paper citing DDN, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01189">DDCM</a>, applied DDN's idea of constructing a 1D discrete latent to diffusion models.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><strong>Applying DDN to language modeling tasks:</strong>  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>I made an initial attempt to combine <a href="https://github.com/Discrete-Distribution-Networks/Discrete-Distribution-Networks.github.io/issues/1">DDN with GPT</a>, aiming to remove tokenizers and let LLMs directly model binary strings. In each forward pass, the model adaptively adjusts the byte length of generated content based on generation difficulty (naturally supporting speculative sampling).</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="common-questions-about-ddn"><a name="common-questions-about-ddn" href="#common-questions-about-ddn"><span></span></a>Common Questions About DDN</h2>
  <p>Q1: Will DDN require a lot of GPU memory?</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>DDN's GPU memory requirements are slightly higher than same architecture of conventional GAN generator, but the difference is negligible.</p>
  <p>During training, generating  samples is only to identify the one closest to the ground truth, and the  unchosen samples do not retain gradients, so they are immediately discarded after sampling at the current layer, freeing up memory.</p>
  <p>In the generation phase, we randomly sample one number from range() as an index and only generate the sample at the chosen index, avoiding the need to generate the other  samples, thus not occupying additional memory or computation.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Q2: Will there be a mode collapse issue?</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>No. DDN selects the output most similar to the current GT and then uses the L2 loss to make it even more similar to the GT. This operation naturally has a diverse tendency, which can "expand" the entire generation space.</p>
  <p>Additionally, DDN supports reconstruction. Figure 14 in the original paper shows that DDN has good reconstruction performance on the test set, meaning that DDN can fully cover the target distribution.</p>
  <p>The real issue with DDN is not mode collapse but attempting to cover a high-dimensional target distribution that exceeds its own complexity, leading to the generation of blurry samples.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="prologue"><span>1</span> Prologue</h2><p>A while ago, I took a flight from Canada back to Hong Kong - about 12 hours in total with Air Canada.</p><p>Interestingly, the plane actually had WiFi:</p><figure>
<label for="zoomCheck-a931d"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ramsayleung.github.io/ox-hugo/acwifi-connect-2.png"></label></figure><p>However, the WiFi had restrictions. For Aeroplan members who hadn’t paid, it only offered <a href="https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/fly/onboard/in-flight-entertainment-and-connectivity.html#/">Free Texting</a>, meaning you could only use messaging apps like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and WeChat to send text messages, but couldn’t access other websites.</p><p>If you wanted unlimited access to other websites, it would cost CAD $30.75:</p><figure>
<label for="zoomCheck-1118f"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ramsayleung.github.io/ox-hugo/acwifi.jpg"></label></figure><p>And if you wanted to watch videos on the plane, that would be CAD $39:</p><figure>
<label for="zoomCheck-47db4"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ramsayleung.github.io/ox-hugo/acwifi_plan.jpg"></label></figure><p>I started wondering: for the Free Texting service, could I bypass the messaging app restriction and access other websites freely?</p><p>Essentially, could I enjoy the benefits of the $30.75 paid service without actually paying the fee? After all, with such a long journey ahead, I needed something interesting to pass the 12 hours.</p><p>Since I could use WeChat in flight, I could also call for help from the sky.</p><p>Coincidentally, my roommate happens to be a security and networking expert who was on vacation at home. When I mentioned this idea, he thought it sounded fun and immediately agreed to collaborate. So we started working on it together across the Pacific.</p><h2 id="the-process"><span>2</span> The Process</h2><p>After selecting the only available WiFi network <code>acwifi.com</code> on the plane, just like other login-required WiFi networks, it popped up a webpage from <code>acwifi.com</code> asking me to verify my Aeroplan membership. Once verified, I could access the internet.</p><figure>
<label for="zoomCheck-4b541"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ramsayleung.github.io/ox-hugo/onboard_success.jpg"></label></figure><p>There’s a classic software development interview question: what happens after you type a URL into the browser and press enter?</p><p>For example, if you type <code>https://acwifi.com</code> and only focus on the network request part, the general process is: DNS query -&gt; TCP connection -&gt; TLS handshake -&gt; HTTP request and response.</p><figure>
<label for="zoomCheck-9a5c6"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ramsayleung.github.io/ox-hugo/network_request_sequence_en.png"></label></figure><p>Let’s consider <code>github.com</code> as our target website we want to access. Now let’s see how we can break through the network restrictions and successfully access <code>github.com</code>.</p><h2 id="approach-1-disguise-domain"><span>3</span> Approach 1: Disguise Domain</h2><p>Since <code>acwifi.com</code> is accessible but <code>github.com</code> is not, is it possible that the network has imposed restrictions on the DNS server, only resolving domain names within a whitelist (such as instant messaging domains)?</p><p>If this is the case, can I modify <code>/etc/hosts</code> to disguise my server as <code>acwifi.com</code>, so that all request traffic passes through my server before reaching the target website (github.com)? For example:</p><figure>
<label for="zoomCheck-646db"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ramsayleung.github.io/ox-hugo/self-sign-certificate-en.png"></label></figure><p>The general idea is that I modify the DNS record to bind our proxy server’s IP <code>137.184.231.87</code> to <code>acwifi.com</code>. Since the local <code>/etc/hosts</code> file takes precedence over the DNS server, I can then use a self-signed certificate to tell the browser that this IP is bound to this domain and that it should trust it.</p><p>Let me first test this idea:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre tabindex="0"><code><span> 1

      <p data-block-key="s17b6">In 2022, David Guillot delivered an <a href="https://djangotv.com/videos/djangocon-europe/2022/djangocon-2022-from-react-to-htmx-on-a-real-world-saas-product-we-did-it-and-its-awesome/">inspiring DjangoCon Europe talk</a>, showcasing a web app that looked and felt as dynamic as a React app. Yet he and his team had done something bold. They converted it <i>from</i> React <i>to</i> <span>HTMX</span>, cutting their codebase by almost 70% while significantly improving its&nbsp;capabilities.</p><p data-block-key="31qki">Since then, teams everywhere have discovered the same thing: turning a single-page app into a multi-page hypermedia app often slashes lines of code by 60% or more while improving both developer and user&nbsp;experience.</p><p data-block-key="6buao">I saw similar results when I switched my projects from <span>HTMX</span> to Datastar. It was exciting to reduce my code while building real-time, multi-user applications without needing WebSockets or complex frontend state&nbsp;management.</p>

      </h2>
    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="8hqu3">While preparing <a href="http://pyvideo.org/flaskcon-2025/death-to-the-spinner-event-sourcing-for-reactive-web-apps.html">my FlaskCon 2025 talk</a>, I hit a wall. I was juggling <span>HTMX</span> and AlpineJS to keep pieces of my <span>UI</span> in sync, but they fell out of step. I lost hours debugging why my component wasn’t updating. Neither library communicates with the other. Since they are different libraries created by different developers, you are the one responsible for helping them work&nbsp;together.</p><p data-block-key="59dih">Managing the dance to initialize components at various times and orchestrating events was causing me to write more code than I wanted to and spend more time than I could spare to complete&nbsp;tasks.</p><p data-block-key="a6n9s">Knowing that Datastar had the capability of both libraries with a smaller download, I thought I’d give it a try. It handled it without breaking a sweat, and the resulting code was much easier to&nbsp;understand.</p><p data-block-key="bs4ft">I appreciate that there’s less code to download and maintain. Having a library handle all of this in under 11 <span>KB</span> is great for improving page load performance, especially for users on mobile devices. The less you need to download, the better off you&nbsp;are.</p><p data-block-key="bm6tk">But that’s just the starting&nbsp;point.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="better-api">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/why-i-switched-from-htmx-to-datastar/#better-api">Better API</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="fn731">As I incorporated Datastar into my project at work, I began to appreciate Datastar’s <span>API</span>. It feels significantly lighter than <span>HTMX</span>. I find that I need to add fewer attributes to achieve the desired&nbsp;results.</p><p data-block-key="c33tr">For example, most interactions with <span>HTMX</span> require you to create an attribute to define the <span>URL</span> to hit, what element to target with the response, and then you might need to add more to customize how <span>HTMX</span> behaves, like&nbsp;this:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;span hx-target="#rebuild-bundle-status-button"
      hx-select="#rebuild-bundle-status-button"
      hx-swap="outerHTML"
      hx-trigger="click"
      hx-get="/rebuild/status-button"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="7odg3">One doesn’t always need all of these, but I find it common to have two or three attributes every time<label for="2"></label><span>And then there are the times I need to remember to look up the ancestry chain to see if any attribute changes the way I’m expecting things to work. Those are confusing bugs when they happen!</span>&nbsp;.</p><p data-block-key="auct3">With Datastar, I regularly use just one attribute, like&nbsp;this:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;span data-on-click="@get('/rebuild/status-button')"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="6vp3b">This gives me less to think about when I return months later and need to recall how this&nbsp;works.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="how-to-update-page-elements">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/why-i-switched-from-htmx-to-datastar/#how-to-update-page-elements">How to update page elements</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="bl2en">The primary difference between <span>HTMX</span> and Datastar is that <span>HTMX</span> is a front-end library that advances the <span>HTML</span> specification. DataStar is a server-side-driven library that aims to create high-performance, web-native, live-updating web&nbsp;applications.</p><p data-block-key="9g7pj">In <span>HTMX</span>, you describe its behavior by adding attributes to the element that <i>triggers</i> the request, even if it updates something far away on the page. That’s powerful, but it means your logic is scattered across multiple layers. Datastar flips that: the server decides what should change, keeping all your update logic in one&nbsp;place.</p><p data-block-key="a4mai">To cite an example from <span>HTMX</span>’s&nbsp;documentation:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div id="alert"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button hx-get="/info" 
            hx-select="#info-details" 
            hx-swap="outerHTML"
            hx-select-oob="#alert"&gt;
        Get Info!
    &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="48rr">When the button is pressed, it sends a <span>GET</span> request to  <code>/info</code> , replaces the button with the element in the response that has the <span>ID</span> 'info-details', and then retrieves the element in the response with the <span>ID</span> 'alert', replacing the element with the same <span>ID</span> on the&nbsp;page.</p><p data-block-key="2goa1">This is a lot for that button element to know. To author this code, you need to know what information you’re going to return from the server, which is done outside of editing the <span>HTML</span>. This is when <span>HTMX</span> loses the ”locality of behavior” I like so&nbsp;much.</p><p data-block-key="cc4f8">Datastar, on the other hand, expects the server to define the behavior, and it works&nbsp;better.</p><p data-block-key="dt5pc">To replicate the behavior above, you have options. The first option keeps the <span>HTML</span> similar to&nbsp;above:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div id="alert"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;button id="info-details"
     data-on-click="@get('/info')"&gt;
        Get Info!
    &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="9mr7p">In this case, the server can return an <span>HTML</span> string with two root elements that have the same IDs as the elements they’re&nbsp;updating:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;p id="info-details"&gt;These are the details you are looking for…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="alert"&gt;Alert! This is a test.&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="e1hat">I love this option because it’s simple and&nbsp;performant.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="think-at-the-component-level">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/why-i-switched-from-htmx-to-datastar/#think-at-the-component-level">Think at the component level</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="8qlvg">A better option would change the <span>HTML</span> to treat it as a&nbsp;component.</p><p data-block-key="9q03t">What is this component? It appears to be a way for the user to get more information about a specific&nbsp;item.</p><p data-block-key="2cvu5">What happens when the user clicks the button? It seems like either the information appears or there is no information to appear, and instead we render an error. Either way, the component becomes&nbsp;static.</p><p data-block-key="e63lk">Maybe we could split the component into each state, first, the&nbsp;placeholder:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;!-- info-component-placeholder.html --&gt;
&lt;div id="info-component"&gt;
    &lt;button data-on-click="@get('/product/{{product.id}}/info')"&gt;
        Get Info!
    &lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="60pqr">Then the server could render the information the user&nbsp;requests…</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;!-- info-component-get.html --&gt;
&lt;div id="info-component"&gt;
    {% if alert %}&lt;div id="alert"&gt;{{ alert }}&lt;/div&gt;{% endif %}
    &lt;p&gt;{{product.additional_information}}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="675ge">…and Datastar will update the page to reflect the&nbsp;changes.</p><p data-block-key="7sgvu">This particular example is a little wonky, but I hope you get the idea. Thinking at a component level is better as it prevents you from entering an invalid state or losing track of the user’s&nbsp;state.</p>


    
  
    
      <h2 id="or-more-than-one-component">
        <a href="https://everydaysuperpowers.dev/articles/why-i-switched-from-htmx-to-datastar/#or-more-than-one-component">…or more than one component</a>
      </h2>
    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="f1bmo">One of the amazing things from David Guillot’s talk is how his app updated the count of favored items even though that element was very far away from the component that changed the&nbsp;count.</p><p data-block-key="3q4t8">David’s team accomplished that by having <span>HTMX</span> trigger a JavaScript event, which in turn triggered the remote component to issue a <span>GET</span> request to update itself with the most up-to-date&nbsp;count.</p><p data-block-key="jr2n">With Datastar, you can update multiple components at once, even in a synchronous&nbsp;function.</p><p data-block-key="d2ffu">If we have a component that allows someone to add an item to a shopping&nbsp;cart:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;form id="purchase-item"
      data-on-submit="@post('/add-item', {contentType: 'form'})"&gt;"
&gt;
  &lt;input type=hidden name="cart-id" value="{{cart.id}}"&gt;
  &lt;input type=hidden name="item-id" value="{{item.id}}"&gt;
  &lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;button data-on-click="$quantity -= 1"&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Quantity
      &lt;input name=quantity type=number data-bind-quantity value=1&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;button data-on-click="$quantity += 1"&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;
  &lt;button type=submit&gt;Add to cart&lt;/button&gt;
  {% if msg %}
    &lt;p class=message&gt;{{msg}}&lt;/p&gt;
  {% endif %}
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="frero">And another one that shows the current count of items in the&nbsp;cart:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">&lt;div id="cart-count"&gt;
    &lt;svg viewBox="0 0 10 10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
        &lt;use href="#shoppingCart"&gt;
    &lt;/svg&gt;
    {{count}}
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

    
  
    
      <p data-block-key="24m7f">Then a developer can update them both in the same request. This is one way it could look in&nbsp;Django:</p>


    
  
    
      
<pre><code id="target-element-current">from datastar_py.consts import ElementPatchMode
from datastar_py.django import (

When something changes, such as a user adding a comment or a status change, the server can immediately update browsers with minimal additional&nbsp;code.</p><p data-block-key="1dfjj">You can now build live dashboards, admin panels, and collaborative tools without crafting custom JavaScript.

      <p data-block-key="ek8qm">Being a part of the Datastar community on Discord has helped me appreciate the Datastar vision of making web apps. They aim to have push-based <span>UI</span> updates, reduce complexity, and leverage tools like web components to handle more complex situations locally. It’s common for the community to help newcomers by helping them realize they’re overcomplicating&nbsp;things.</p><p data-block-key="697ei">Here are some of the tips I’ve picked&nbsp;up:</p><p data-block-key="ch5ak">- Don’t be afraid to re-render the whole component and send it down the pipe. It’s easier, it probably won’t affect performance too much, you get better compression ratios, and it’s incredibly fast for the browser to parse <span>HTML</span>&nbsp;strings.</p><p data-block-key="4lbku">- The server is the state of truth and is more powerful than the browser. Let it handle the majority of the state. You probably don’t need the reactive signals as much as you think you&nbsp;do.</p><p data-block-key="72snf">- Web components are great for encapsulating logic into a custom element with high locality of behavior. A great example of this is the star field animation in the header of <a href="https://data-star.dev/">the Datastar website</a>. The  <code>&lt;ds-starfield&gt;</code>  element encapsulates all the code to animate the star field and exposes three attributes to change its internal state. Datastar drives the attributes whenever the range input changes or the mouse moves over the&nbsp;element.</p>

      <p data-block-key="d1ihu">But what I’m most excited about are the possibilities that Datastar enables. The community is routinely creating projects that push well beyond the limits experienced by developers using other&nbsp;tools.</p><p data-block-key="avlu">The examples page includes a <a href="https://data-star.dev/examples/dbmon">database monitoring demo</a> that leverages Hypermedia to significantly improve the speed and memory footprint of a demo presented at a JavaScript&nbsp;conference.</p><p data-block-key="8d52m">The one million checkbox experiment was too much for the server it started on. Anders Murphy used Datastar to create <a href="https://checkboxes.andersmurphy.com/">one billion checkboxes</a> on an inexpensive&nbsp;server.</p><p data-block-key="17rb2">But the one that most inspired me was a web app that displayed data from every radar station in the United States. When a blip changed on a radar, the corresponding dot in the <span>UI</span> would change within 100 milliseconds. This means that *over 800,000 points are being updated per second*. Additionally, the user could scrub back in time for up to an hour (with under a 700 millisecond delay). Can you imagine this as a Hypermedia app? This is what Datastar&nbsp;enables.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects">https://mitchellh.com/writing/building-large-technical-projects</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45535202">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Whether it's building a new project from scratch, implementing a big feature,
or beginning a large refactor, it can be difficult to stay motivated and
complete large technical projects. A method that works really well for me
is to continuously see real results and to order my work based on that.</p>
<p>We've all experienced that feeling of excitement starting a new project.
The first few weeks you can't wait to get on the computer to work. Then
slowly over time you get distracted or make up excuses and work on it less.
If this is for real work, you forcibly slog your way to the finish line but
every day is painful. If this is for fun, you look back years from now and
remember what could've been.</p>
<p>I've learned that when I break down my large tasks in chunks that result
in seeing tangible forward progress, I tend to finish my work and retain
my excitement throughout the project. People are all motivated and driven
in different ways, so this may not work for you, but as a broad generalization
I've not found an engineer who doesn't get excited by a good demo. And the
goal is to always give yourself a good demo.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming that anything I say in this post is novel. It definitely
shares various aspects of well-known software engineering or management
practices. I'm just sharing the way I approach the larger technical work
that I do and why I do it this way.</p>
<p>I'll use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1662217955424493570">my terminal emulator project</a>
as an example throughout this post so that there is realistic, concrete
experience I can share. There's plenty of other projects I could've used but
I'll choose this one since it's not related to my professional work and
it is recent enough to be fresh in my mind.</p>
<div><p>I want to be crystal clear that I am not shaming anyone for not completing
projects. As long as you're having fun and feel accomplished (or simply don't
care), good for you and more power to you. This blog post is aimed
at people who <em>want to finish projects more</em> or simply want to learn how
I strive to finish projects more.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-starting-line">The Starting Line</h2>
<p>Initially, you have some large project and you have to figure <em>how to start</em>.
For me, this is the hardest part and I can spend hours
-- sometimes days -- waffling over the right starting point.</p>
<p>For my terminal emulator, there were a number of large components that
I knew would have to exist if I ever intended to finish this project:
terminal parsing, running and managing a shell process, font rendering,
grid rendering, input handling (keyboard/mouse), etc. There are hundreds
of relatively large sub-projects on the path to "done."</p>
<p>If my initial goal was to see a launchable terminal that could run Neovim,
I'd be in big trouble. Even with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_unknown_unknowns">unknown unknowns</a>,
this goal just <em>sounds too big</em>. I can intuitively realize that
there are a lot of components on that path: rendering a GUI, process launching,
terminal parsing and state management. This is a bad goal, it's too big and
I'd probably lose interest a month or two in.</p>
<p>Instead, I try to think what a <em>realistic</em> project is where I can
<em>see results as soon as possible</em>. Once you apply that filter, the number
of viable sub-projects shrinks dramatically. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>VT Parsing - parsing the terminal escape sequences</li>
<li>Blank window rendering - open a window and draw a blank canvas</li>
<li>Child process lanching - launch a child shell such as bash, zsh, fish,
setup the TTY and be able to read output from it (i.e. the initial
shell prompt)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't try to enumerate all the big sub-projects at this stage. I just
kind of get an idea of the <em>rough shape</em> the project will take and find
one that I can build in isolation and also physically see some sort of
real results.</p>
<div><p>This is the phase where experience helps the most. Engineers with
more experience are usually able to more effectively paint the picture
of the rough shape a project will take. They can identify various
subcomponents with more accuracy and see how they pieces fit together.
With less experience, or in a domain I'm unfamiliar with, I just take
a best guess and expect there is a higher likelihood I'll throw my work
away at some point.</p></div>
<hr>
<h2 id="early-results">Early Results</h2>
<p>Early work tends to not be very <em>visible</em> and that makes seeing
tangible results seem difficult. For example, if I chose to work on
VT parsing for my terminal, I can't <em>see</em> it work without also hooking up
a UI of some sort. Or for some other project if I chose to work on a
database schema and minimal API, I similarly can't see that work without
writing a client along with a CLI or GUI.</p>
<p>If the initial subproject you choose to work on is a UI, then you can
quickly see some results of course! For various reasons, I rarely start
frontend first and usually start backend first. And in any situation, you'll
eventually get to the backend and reach a similar challenge.</p>
<p>The best tool to get past this phase is automated testing (usually unit
testing at this stage). Automated tests let you actually run some code and
see it is working and also has the benefit of being good hygiene.</p>
<p>This gives you another guiding point for picking out your first few tasks:
if it isn't graphical, you want to pick something that is testable without
too much fuss so you can see some results.</p>
<p>For my terminal, I decided to start with VT parsing first, because it
was a part of a terminal at the time that I didn't know too much about and
it felt like something that I could very easily test: give it some example
input as a string, expect some parsed action or event as output.</p>
<p>Seeing the progression of "1 test passed", "4 tests passed," "13 tests passed"
and so on is super exciting to me. I'm running some code I wrote <em>and it's
working</em>. And I know that I'm progressing on some critical sub-component of
a larger project.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="sprint-to-demos">Sprint to Demos</h2>
<p>My goal with the early sub-projects isn't to build a <em>finished sub-component</em>,
it is to build a <em>good enough sub-component</em> so I can move on to the next
thing on the path to a <em>demo</em>. ✨</p>
<p>This tradeoff isn't just manifested in functionality. It may be manifested
in algorithmic or design considerations. For example, you may know that
in the future, you'll need to use something like a real database or a fancy
data structure or support streaming data. But for the initial set of work,
you can just use in-memory contents, built-in data structures such as
dictionaries, and require all your inputs/outputs up front.</p>
<p>I think this is an important tradeoff so I will repeat it: <strong>do not let
perfection be an enemy of progress.</strong> Going further, do not let future
improvements you <em>know you'll have to make</em> stop you from moving on to
the next thing. The goal is to get to a demo.</p>
<p>No matter what I'm working on, I try to build one or two demos per week
intermixed with automated test feedback as explained in the previous section.</p>
<p>Building a demo also provides you with invaluable product feedback. You
can quickly intuit whether something <em>feels good</em>, even if it isn't fully
functional. These aren't "minimum viable products", because they really aren't
viable, but they're good enough to provide an engineer some valuable
self-reflection.</p>
<div><p>This is an area where I think experience actually hurts. I've seen senior
engineers get bogged down building the perfect thing and by the time
they get a demo, they realize <em>it sucks</em>. The implementation doesn't suck,
but the product or feature itself actually sucks.</p></div>
<p>Recall that for the terminal the first task I chose was VT parsing. In
the early stages, I only saw automated tests work. To get to my first demo,
I built a shell script that would run some command, capture its output,
feed it to my VT parser, and output everything it parsed (or couldn't).
Over time, I iterated on this CLI as my first "UI" -- I would render
the terminal grid using ASCII.</p>
<p>This gave me immense satisfaction since I could run simple programs like
<code>man</code> or <code>ls</code> or more complex programs like <code>vim</code> and see my parser work (or break,
which is equally exciting in its own way).</p>
<p>In this scenario, the CLI I was writing was relatively useless long term
(I ended up throwing it away rather quickly). But the day or two I spent
building it as a demo provided me with an important feeling of progress and
<em>seeing</em> something work helped keep me motivated.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="build-for-yourself">Build for Yourself</h2>
<p>This section will apply more to personal projects than to work-assigned
projects. Even if you aspire to release some software for others, build
<em>only what you need as you need it</em> and <em>adopt your software as quickly
as possible</em>.</p>
<p>I'm always more motivated working on a problem I'm experiencing myself<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>.
And if a product designed for you doesn't work for you, it's very likely
not going to work well for others, either.
Therefore, my path from demos to an actual real-world usable product is
to find the shortest path to building only the functionality I think I need.</p>
<p>For my terminal, that meant first being able to load my shell configuration
(fish) and from there being able to launch and use Neovim. So I beelined
all my work to only the functionality needed for that: only the escape
sequences those programs used, only rendering the font I use daily, etc.
Examples of features I initially omitted: scrolling, mouse selection,
search, tabs/splits, etc.</p>
<p>Then I started using my terminal as a daily driver. This step usually
has a few false starts; you realize you actually need some feature
you omitted or forgot. In my initial runs of my terminal, I realized my
arrow keys didn't do anything, there were subtle (but workflow-breaking)
rendering bugs, etc. So I'd go abandon using it, but it gave me tangible
tasks to work on next.</p>
<p>Additionally, I always feel a lot of pride using software with code
that I wrote and that usually helps keep me motivated to continue
working on it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="packaging-it-up">Packaging it Up</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decompose a large problem into smaller problems. Importantly,
each small problem must have some clear way you can see the results
of your work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only solve the smaller problem enough to progress on a demo-aspect
of the larger problem, then move on to the next small problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only solve enough small problems to be able to begin building
runnable demos of your software, then continue to iterate on more
functionality. Make demos as frequently as you can.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prioritize functionality that enables you to adopt your own software,
if applicable (a personal project, a work project solving a problem
you actually have, etc.). Then continue to solve your own problems first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go back and iterate on each component as needed for future improvements,
repeating this process as needed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>And that's pretty much it. I've followed this general pattern on personal
projects, group projects, work projects, school projects, etc. and it's
how I keep myself motivated<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Note that I didn't mention a lot of things! I don't talk about shipping.
I know a lot of people find shipping motivational. I don't think you need
to ship a project for it to be successful. And for me, I find shipping
too big of an event to motivate me long-term. I don't talk about tooling
(Git workflows, CI, etc.). I've used my process across multiple jobs and fit
it into whatever process is established. And so on.</p>
<p>I think that helps show how much of a <em>personal process</em> this is. Everyone
I think needs to find some process to reinforce their motivation in a healthy
way. I realized seeing results motivates me really strongly, I've
built my work style around that, and it has worked well for me thus far.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>09 Oct 2025</p><p>Ruby Central posted an extremely concerning “<a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/rubygems-org-aws-root-access-event-september-2025/">Incident Response Timeline</a>” today, in which they make a number of exaggerated or purely misleading claims. Here’s my effort to set the record straight.</p><p>First, and most importantly: <strong>I was a primary operator of RubyGems.org, securely and successfully, for over ten years. Ruby Central does not accuse me of any harms or damages in their post, in fact stating “we have no evidence to indicate that any RubyGems.org data was copied or retained by unauthorized parties, including Mr. Arko.”</strong></p><p>The actions I took during a time of great confusion and uncertainty (created by Ruby Central!) were careful, specific, and aimed to defend both Ruby Central the organization and RubyGems.org the service from potential threats.</p><p>The majority of the team, including developers in the middle of paid full-time work for Ruby Central, had just had all of their permissions on GitHub revoked. And then restored six days later. And then revoked again the next day. Even after the second mass-deletion of team permissions, Marty Haught sent an email to the team within minutes, at 12:47pm PDT, saying he was (direct quote) “terribly sorry” and “I messed up”. <small><strong>Update</strong>: Added email timestamp.</small></p><p>The erratic and contradictory communication supplied by Marty Haught, and the complete silence from Shan and the board, made it impossible to tell exactly who had been authorized to take what actions. As this situation occurred, I was the primary on-call. My contractual, paid responsibility to Ruby Central was to defend the RubyGems.org service against potential threats.&nbsp;</p><p>Marty’s final email clearly stated “I’ll follow up more on this and engage with the governance rfc in good faith.”. Just a few minutes after that email, at 1:01pm PDT, Marty also posted <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rfcs/pull/61#issuecomment-3309461815">a public GitHub comment</a>, where he agreed to participate in the proposed governance process and stated “I’m committed to find the right governance model that works for us all. More to come.” <small><strong>Update</strong>: screenshot of comment removed and replaced with link, since the comment appears to still be visible (at least to logged out users) on GitHub.</small></p><p>Given Marty’s claims, the sudden permission deletions made no sense. Worried about the possibility of hacked accounts or some sort of social engineering, I took action as the primary on-call engineer to lock down the AWS account and prevent any actions by possible attackers. I did not change the email addresses on any accounts, leaving them all owned by a team-shared email at rubycentral.org, to ensure the organization retained overall control of the accounts, even if individuals were somehow taking unauthorized actions.</p><p>Within a couple of days, Ruby Central made an (unsigned) public statement, and various board members agreed to talk directly to maintainers. At that point, I realized that what I thought might have been a malicious takeover was both legitimate and deliberate, and Marty would never “fix the permissions structure”, or “follow up more” as he said.</p><p>Once I understood the situation, I backed off to let Ruby Central take care of their “security audit”. I left all accounts in a state where they could recover access. I did not alter, or try to alter, anything in the Ruby Central systems or GitHub repository after that. I was confident, at the time, that Ruby Central’s security experts would quickly remove all outside access.</p><p>My confidence was sorely misplaced.</p><p>Almost two weeks later, someone asked if I still had access and I discovered (to my great alarm), that Ruby Central’s “security audit” had failed. Ruby Central also had not removed me as an “owner” of the Ruby Central GitHub Organization. They also had not rotated any of the credentials shared across the operational team using the RubyGems 1Password account.</p><p>I believe Ruby Central confused themselves into thinking the “Ruby Central” 1Password account was used by operators, and they did revoke my access there. However, that 1Password account was not used by the open source team of RubyGems.org service operators. Instead, we used the “RubyGems” 1Password account, which was full of operational credentials. Ruby Central did not remove me from the “RubyGems” 1Password account, even as of today.</p><p>Aware that I needed to disclose this surprising access, but also aware that it was impossible for anyone except former operators to exploit this security failure, I immediately wrote an email to Ruby Central to disclose the problem.</p><p>Here is a copy of my disclosure email, in full.</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>From: André Arko &lt;andre@arko.net&gt;

Hi Marty,

It has come to my attention that despite the statements in [your] email, I have had uninterrupted access to RubyGems.org production environments from September 18 until today, September 30, via the root credentials of the Ruby Central AWS account, as well as continued and ongoing access to the full feed of production alerts and logs in DataDog.

It seems that the only permissions I have had removed are from the GitHub organization named "rubygems", which as you know is unrelated to the RubyGems.org production access you mention in your email.

I have also noticed I am still, as of September 30, the owner of the GitHub organizations named "rubycentral" and "rubytogether".

I am unable to transfer the HelpScout or PagerDuty accounts, as you have disabled my andre@rubygems.org Google account.

Please advise as to your desired resolution of this situation.

Thank you,
André Arko

Please confirm that you cannot access the Ruby Central AWS root account credentials, either through the console or by access keys.

In addition, please confirm whether you are in possession of any RubyGems.org production data, &nbsp;including, but not limited to, server logs, access logs, PII, or other organizational data.

Thank you,
Marty
</code></pre><p>In addition to ignoring the (huge) question of how Ruby Central failed to secure their AWS Root credentials for almost two weeks, and <strong>appearing to only be aware of it because I reported it to them</strong>, their reply also failed to ask whether any other shared credentials might still be valid.

Hi Marty,

Thanks for letting me know you got my email disclosing my unintended access. I’m concerned that security must not be a very high priority for Ruby Central since no one acknowledged my disclosure for more than three days, but I appreciate the confirmation.

As far as I can tell, I can no longer access the Ruby Central AWS root account either through the console or via access keys.

I confirm I did not download or save any production data after your email of September 18, including server logs, access logs, PII, or other organizational data.

However, while checking AWS credentials in order to write this email, I discovered that several other service credentials have not been rotated, and are still valid for production AWS access. That means both myself and the other former operators all still have access to AWS via those previously-shared credentials.

I would appreciate it if you could answer the request from my first email, and reply with your desired resolution for this remaining unintended production access, as well as the GitHub organization ownership.

Thanks,
André

<p dir="auto">The Spock extension provides multi-master replication for PostgreSQL versions 15 and later.  Take the following requirements into consideration as you design your cluster:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">You will need to install the <code>Spock</code> extension on each node in your cluster.  If you're performing a major version upgrade, the old node can be running a recent version of pgLogical2 before upgrading it to become a Spock node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">On each node in your cluster, tables must have the same name and reside in the same schema. To check the table name and schema name of an existing table, you can connect to the database with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/app-psql.html" rel="nofollow">psql</a> and use the <code>\d</code> meta-command:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><code>SELECT schemaname, tablename FROM pg_tables ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;</code></p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>

<p dir="auto">You will need to build the Spock extension on a patched PostgreSQL source tree to which you have applied version-specific <code>.diff</code> files from the <code>spock/patches/Postgres-version</code> directory. The high-level steps to build Postgres and the spock extension are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Get the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-getsource.html" rel="nofollow">Postgres source</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Copy the patch files to the base repository; the patches for each Postgres version are in a version-specific subdirectory of the <a href="https://github.com/pgEdge/spock/tree/main/patches">spock repo</a>.  Then, apply each patch, use the command:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>patch -p1 &lt; path_to_patch/patch_name</code></p>
<p dir="auto">Note that you must apply the patches in the numerical order designated by their prefixes in the <code>spock</code> repository (for example, <code>pg16-015-patch-name</code>, then <code>pg16-020-patch-name</code>, then <code>pg16-025-patch-name</code>).</p>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><code>configure</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>make install</code> the Postgres server as described in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-make.html" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL documentation</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When the build completes, add the location of your <code>pg_config</code> file to your <code>PATH</code> variable:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><code>export PATH=path_to_pg_config_file</code></p>
<ol start="5" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Then, clone the <code>pgedge/spock</code> repository:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>git clone https://github.com/pgEdge/spock.git</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Next, <code>make</code> and then <code>make-install</code> spock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Then, update your Postgres <code>postgresql.conf</code> file, setting:</p>

track_commit_timestamp = on <span><span>#</span> needed for conflict resolution</span></pre></div>
</li>

<p dir="auto">Before configuring a replication cluster, you will need to perform the following steps on each node of the cluster:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>build Postgres and Spock, and create the Spock extension.</li>
<li>initialize identical databases.</li>
<li>modify the <code>postgresql.conf</code> file to support logical decoding automatic DDL replication.</li>
<li>modify the <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file and any firewalls to ensure you have connectivity between nodes.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Configuration Settings</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Modify the <code>postgresql.conf</code> file, adding:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="wal_level = 'logical'

max_wal_senders = 10        # one per node needed on provider node
shared_preload_libraries = 'spock'
track_commit_timestamp = on # needed for conflict resolution"><pre><code>wal_level = 'logical'

max_replication_slots = 10  # one per node needed on provider node
max_wal_senders = 10        # one per node needed on provider node
shared_preload_libraries = 'spock'
track_commit_timestamp = on # needed for conflict resolution
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You'll also want to enable automatic ddl replication on each node; add these GUCs to the <code>postgresql.conf</code> file as well:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="spock.enable_ddl_replication=on
spock.include_ddl_repset=on"><pre><code>spock.enable_ddl_replication=on
spock.include_ddl_repset=on
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">You also need to configure your <code>pg_hba.conf</code> file to allow connections between your nodes and ensure that firewalls do not block access. Logical replication connections are treated by <code>pg_hba.conf</code> as regular connections to the provider database.</p>
<p dir="auto">After modifying the configuration files, restart the Postgres server; for example:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>pg_ctl -D /path/to/data_directory restart</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Configuring Replication</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">First, we'll invoke the <code>spock.node_create</code> command on each node in the cluster.  For example, the following command creates a node named <code>n1</code> that can be accessed via the connection string specified with the <code>dsn</code> variable:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="SELECT spock.node_create(
    node_name := 'n1',
    dsn := 'host=10.0.0.5 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);"><pre><code>SELECT spock.node_create(
    node_name := 'n1',
    dsn := 'host=10.0.0.5 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Use the following command to create a node named n2:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="SELECT spock.node_create(
    node_name := 'n2',
    dsn := 'host=10.0.0.7 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);"><pre><code>SELECT spock.node_create(
    node_name := 'n2',
    dsn := 'host=10.0.0.7 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Next, create the subscriptions between the nodes. Since this is multi-master replication, each node acts as both a subscriber and provider. The first command creates a subscription between <code>n1</code> and <code>n2</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="SELECT spock.sub_create(
    subscription_name := 'sub_n1n2',
    provider_dsn := 'host=10.0.0.7 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);"><pre><code>SELECT spock.sub_create(
    subscription_name := 'sub_n1n2',
    provider_dsn := 'host=10.0.0.7 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">The command invoked on <code>n1</code> specifies the subscription name (<code>sub_n1n2</code>) and the connection string for the node it is subscribing to (<code>n2</code>).  Next, create a subscription on <code>n2</code> that connects to <code>n1</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="SELECT spock.sub_create(
    subscription_name := 'sub_n2n1',
    provider_dsn := 'host=10.0.0.5 port=5432 dbname=acctg'

    provider_dsn := 'host=10.0.0.5 port=5432 dbname=acctg'
);
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To start replication, we'll add tables with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html" rel="nofollow">pgbench</a>; since we enabled automatic ddl replication, we'll add the tables on <code>n1</code>, and they'll automatically propagate to <code>n2</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/path to pgbench/pgbench -i -s 10 acctg"><pre><code>/path to pgbench/pgbench -i -s 10 acctg

              J. Nicholas Betley has led collaborative research seeking the neural basis of long-term sustained pain and finds that a critical hub in the brainstem holds a mechanism for stopping pain signals from reaching the rest of the brain. Their findings could help clinicians better understand chronic pain and lead to new, more efficacious treatments.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><h3>The Burrows-Wheeler Transform</h3> <p>By <a href="https://robert.bio/" target="_blank">Robert Aboukhalil</a></p> <p><small>October 9, 2025</small></p> <p>In this interactive article, we explore the borderline-magical algorithm known as the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). It
		powers data compression in <code>bzip2</code>, and is used by sequence alignment tools like <code>bowtie</code> and <code>bwa</code>, both of which were named after the algorithm.</p> <p>The BWT has 2 key properties:</p> <ol><li>It shuffles strings such that <strong>identical letters tend to be grouped together</strong>, e.g. the BWT of <code>coconut</code> is <code>tooccun</code>.</li> <li>The transform <strong>can be reversed</strong> to get the original string back, which is what makes it useful.</li></ol> <p>Before we dive in, you should know that the BWT has a <strong>third, unofficial property: it is not intuitive</strong>. Many
		of the steps in the algorithm will seem arbitrary and it might not be clear why you're even doing them. I'm hoping this
		article helps you build some intuition around the BWT.</p> <!----><h4 id="encode"><a href="#encode"><i></i><!----></a> The BWT algorithm<!----></h4><!----><!----> <p>To apply the BWT on a string like <!--[!--><!--]--><!---->, there are 3 steps to follow:</p><!----></div><div><!----><!----><h5 id="intuition"><a href="#intuition"><i></i><!----></a> What's the dollar sign for?<!----></h5><!----><!----> <p>The <code>$</code> marks the end of the string, and is needed to make the BWT reversible. Without that marker, you could still
		regenerate the matrix in Step <i></i><!---->, but you wouldn't know which row contains the original string. If it's
		an English word, you might guess it's <code>banana</code> and not <code>nabana</code>, but that's harder to do with DNA because most rotations will look reasonable.</p> <!----><h5 id="intuition"><a href="#intuition"><i></i><!----></a> Intuition behind the BWT<!----></h5><!----><!----> <p>In Step <i></i><!---->, the sorting causes rows that start the same to be more likely to be grouped together. As a
		result, the character that comes right before (i.e. the character in the last column) is also likely to be similar, based on
		repeated patterns in the English language, and also in DNA sequences!</p> <p>For example, in the BWT of <!--[!--><!--]--><!---->,
		the letter <code>c</code> is grouped because it's always followed by an <code>o</code>. Although <code>o</code> is followed by
		either <code>c</code> or <code>n</code>, it still clusters in the BWT because its corresponding rows end up being sorted next
		to each other.</p> <p>If there was a row in Step <i></i><!----> that started with a letter in between <code>c</code> and <code>n</code>, the <code>o</code>'s would no longer cluster. For example, what happens to the <code>o</code>'s if you add an <code>i</code> to <code>coconut</code>: <!--[!--><!--]--><!---->. Would the <code>o</code>'s
		cluster if you tried <!--[!--><!--]--><!---->?</p> <p>Now it's your turn: try encoding your name or a repetitive string. Which characters can you add or remove to make the BWT
		cluster more or less?</p> <!----> <!----><h4 id="decode"><a href="#decode"><i></i><!----></a> Decoding the BWT<!----></h4><!----><!----> <p>Given the encoded string, we can reconstruct the matrix from Step <i></i><!----> as follows: Start with an empty matrix,
		prepend the BWT string, sort the strings, and repeat until the matrix is filled. Keep clicking <i>Next</i> below until you reconstruct
		the matrix; the matrix on the right shows the final answer we're working towards.</p><!----></div><div><!----><p>Once the matrix is filled, we can read off the string from any of the rows since we have the <code>$</code> marker.</p> <!----><h5 id="intuition-decoding"><a href="#intuition-decoding"><i></i><!----></a> Intuition behind the decoding algorithm<!----></h5><!----><!----> <p>Starting from an empty matrix, note that adding the BWT column and sorting gives you the <strong>first column</strong> of the
		expected BWT matrix. If you then prepend and sort a second time, you now have the <strong>first two columns</strong> of the BWT
		matrix. You can keep going to recreate the whole matrix.</p> <p>To understand why this works, let's consider a scenario where I give you the first 2 columns of the BWT matrix and ask you to
		figure out the rest. Remember that the BWT is the last column of the matrix, i.e. the characters that come right before the
		first column. So by prepending the BWT to the first column, we're still preserving the relationships between the substrings we
		reconstructed so far (you can imagine the BWT matrix rotates on itself to connect the first and last column together). Then,
		sorting the current set of substrings gives us the first 3 columns of the BWT matrix.</p> <!----> <!----><h4 id="alignment"><a href="#alignment"><i></i><!----></a> How to use BWT for sequence alignment<!----></h4><!----><!----> <p>So far, we've seen how to use the Burrows-Wheeler Transform to encode and decode strings. That's nice and all, but how can we
		use the BWT for sequence alignment, i.e. looking for a small string in a much larger string?</p> <p>To do that, I first need to introduce yet another magical property of the BWT: <i>Last-to-first Mapping</i>.</p> <!----><h5 id="lf-mapping"><a href="#lf-mapping"><i></i><!----></a> Last-to-first Mapping property<!----></h5><!----><!----> <p>This property states that the <strong>order in which you see a letter in the first column is the same order in which you see it in the last column</strong>!</p> <p>Let's consider the word <code>banana</code>: if we annotate each letter with the number of times it occurs in the string
		before creating the BWT matrix, the letter <code>a</code> appears in the same order in both the first and last column: a<sub>2</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>0</sub>!</p> <div><!--[--><!--[--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--[--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--[--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--[--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--[--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--[--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--[--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>n<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[--><p><span>$<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>b<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--[!--><p><span>a<!----><sub>undefined</sub><!----></span></p><!--]--><!--]--><!----> <br><!--]--></div> <!----><h5 id="substring"><a href="#substring"><i></i><!----></a> Find a substring<!----></h5><!----><!----> <p>With that in mind, let's find all occurences of the pattern <code>an</code> within <code>banana</code>, using only the first

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>When I'm searching for docs, 95% of the time a single example would suffice. Yet, 95% of the time I can't find one in any official source.</p>
<p>It seems that by default formal technical documentation is targeted towards someone who's deeply immersed in the ecosystem. But many developers have to juggle a lot of "worlds" in their heads daily. When jumping between projects, languages and frameworks, it takes a considerable amount of mental energy to restore the context and understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Consider this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max">example</a> from the Python 3 docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>max(iterable, /, *, key=None)</code>
Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.... <em>[followed by 5 short paragraphs]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to know quite a bit about Python in order to understand this:</p>
<ul>
<li>What <code>*</code> means in the function definition.</li>
<li>What <code>/</code> means in the function definition.</li>
<li>What's a "positional-only parameter separator"</li>
<li>What's an iterable.</li>
<li>What are keyword-only arguments.</li>
<li>What <code>key</code> usually means.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you have to read some text in order to understand what values you can pass and how to actually call the function.</p>
<p>Granted, these are important details that can't be omitted for brevity. But I bet a lot of developers looked at that page simply because they needed to quickly find out how to pass a custom sorting function. This example would've quickly helped them:</p>
<pre><code><span>max</span>(<span>4</span>, <span>6</span>) <span># → 6</span>

<span>max</span>([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]) <span># → 3</span>

<span>max</span>([<span>'x'</span>, <span>'y'</span>, <span>'abc'</span>],  key=<span>len</span>) <span># → 'abc'</span>

<span>max</span>([]) <span># ValueError: max() arg is an empty sequence</span>

<span>max</span>([], default=<span>5</span>) <span># → 5</span>
</code></pre><p>Easy, right?</p>
<p>One popular community-based project in the Clojure world is <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/">clojuredocs.org</a>, a site where people contribute examples for built in functions. It's fantastic and, in my experience, indispensable in day-to-day coding. For example, check out the pages about <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/into">into</a> or <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/spit">spit</a> or <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map">map</a>. Note that examples often include related functions, not only those in question. This increases the real-world usefulness and practicality.</p>
<p>Since even major software projects rarely offer <a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">4 distinct kinds of documentation</a>, I am often hesitant to click on a "Documentation" link. Chances are, it's a terse, difficult to read, automatically generated API reference. I often choose to find a tutorial, not because I need a walk-through, but because I need examples.</p>

A minor episode in the long history of non-Anglo immigrants changing their names after moving to America.</p>

  <p data-word-count="135" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp2o5v001b3b79iuoxw29p@published">If your family immigrated to the United States in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and/or you took middle-school social studies in the States, you’ve probably heard&nbsp;that officials at Ellis Island often changed newcomers’ names, either because they couldn’t spell them or because they wanted to make them sound more American. In fact, authorities in New York never actually wrote down anyone’s name, they just checked each immigrant against the ship’s passenger list, which would have been compiled by employees of the steamship companies. That means that your grandpa Szymańczyk turned into Simmons before he even set foot on the boat. My case, though, is less about forced reinvention than about bureaucratic drift. Names are bearers of our identity, history, and culture, but a lot can happen when they are run through the machinery of another culture’s bureaucracy.</p>

  

  <p data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp2o5x001c3b79pg6nnt6e@published">I was born in Mexico City, and my parents named me Leonel Giovanni García Fenech. It might sound a little baroque to Americans, but having four names is standard in Spanish-speaking countries. And it can be surprisingly useful if one of your last names happens to be García, the most common surname in Spain and the second most common in Mexico. Or if you were my former co-worker, who shared a name with someone convicted of running over a child while drunk. That was the first thing anyone saw if they Googled her, so an extra name or two could have spared her countless awkward explanations during job interviews.</p>

  <p data-word-count="59" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp37wt001i3b7934jccnu0@published">As the firstborn, I was named after both of my grandfathers: Leonel hints at my father’s Spanish Jewish ancestry; diaspora families with the name Yehuda<em> </em>often used variations of the translation for <em>lion</em>, the traditional symbol for the Tribe of Yehuda. Giovanni, on the other hand, came from my Sicilian grandfather, and is just the Italian version of John.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3b0k001o3b79cl4aibzb@published">Same with my last names: García is my father’s, Fenech my mother’s. I didn’t find out until I was an adult that Fenech is not actually Italian, as my family always assumed. It’s Maltese, it means <em>rabbit</em>, and it’s one of Malta’s most common surnames. Furthermore, it turns out my family has been mispronouncing it all along—it’s FE-neck, not fe-NECH. Famous people named Fenech include the ’70s soft-porn actress Edwige Fenech and, more recently, Yorgen Fenech, a Maltese businessman currently facing criminal charges for corruption, money laundering, and the murder of a journalist.</p>

  <p data-word-count="76" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3drp001u3b796m3dcn30@published">In Mexico, everyone called me Giovanni, never Leonel. (I only recently learned it was because my dad couldn’t stand his own father.) When we moved to the U.S. I always introduced myself as Giovanni. I never understood why Americans were embarrassed by their middle names—except for that time when President Barack Obama joked that he envied Willard Mitt Romney being able to go by his middle name. The punchline being, of course, that Obama’s is Hussein.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3idv00203b79tspzfnuq@published">When I was sworn in as a U.S. citizen, the clerk surprised me when he announced I could now change my name to whatever<em> </em>I wanted. “Even Ronald Reagan!” he joked. (Not quite as weird as it sounds, as Reagan was still in office.) I almost said, “OK, let’s do that!” but thought better of it. Caught off guard, I simply asked him to drop Leonel. Four names only seemed to confuse Americans, and I never used it anyway, so why not make life easier? That’s how I became an American named Giovanni Garcia Fenech.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3mmx00263b79ad6f0lb3@published">But the cut didn’t solve any problems. Everyone I met still called me “Gio” without asking. My girlfriend’s grandmother went with Geronimo. I also often received mail addressed to Giovanni Garcia French.</p>

When I got my driver’s license, the DMV insisted on cramming everything into a “first, middle, last” format and turned me into Giovanni F Garcia (sans acute accent). The passport office, trying slightly harder to keep the order of my names correct, made Garcia my middle name (again, no acute accent) and Fenech my last. In typical Gen X fashion, I was apathetic about the mess. Oh well, whatever, never mind. I just started hyphenating my last name to Garcia-Fenech and left it at that. Nobody seemed to care. The bank cashed my checks.</p>

  


  <p data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3tw3002i3b79tiu3s64f@published">But there were other things happening in the world. In response to 9/11, Congress had passed <a href="https://slate.com/business/2025/05/real-id-delayed-again-why.html">the REAL ID Act</a>, requiring a new type of identification to board domestic flights (because nothing terrifies a terrorist like having to spend a day at the DMV). However, since the feds didn’t fund it, nothing happened, and I didn’t even hear about it until 2019, when the government announced that, this time for real, you’d need Real ID to fly. Like a sucker, I believed them and decided it was time to fix my documents. (It’s been postponed twice since then. The new deadline is now 2027, wink wink.)</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="136" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3w6n002o3b79smo9zlx9@published">I could have used this as an opportunity to change my driver’s license to match my passport, but convenience won out. Every important document I had—Social Security, bank accounts, marriage certificate, school records—listed me as <em>Giovanni F. Garcia</em>, and the thought of having to change all of that made me dizzy. Thankfully, the passport office didn’t object.<br>In November 2024, my wife and I decided to <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/04/living-abroad-downsides-trump-america.html">move to Spain (you can guess why)</a>. We could do this because she’s German, and as an EU citizen she’s allowed to take her spouse along. As we researched our move, I discovered that Latin Americans can apply for Spanish citizenship after just two years of residency, instead of the usual 10 for others. Only catch: I needed a Mexican passport, and didn’t have one—or any Mexican documents, for that matter.</p>

  


  


  <p data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp3zuj002u3b79aesoa0gt@published">The consulate in New York happily issued me a birth certificate, but balked at a passport. They explained that my birth certificate listed me as Leonel Giovanni García Fenech but my American ID said my name was Giovanni F. Garcia. Never mind that they were the ones that had just given me the certificate. And so, to Spain I went, with my wife, my butchered name, and my American passport.</p>

  <p data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp42h100303b79r7v48c4x@published">We’d been warned about Spanish bureaucracy, and I pictured Dickensian clerks with sleeve garters and green eyeshades demanding documents in triplicate. But what we encountered in Seville wasn’t that different from the American equivalent: bad websites, confusing instructions, long lines. They did enjoy stamping documents, but they were no better with names. My new foreigner’s ID listed me as Giovanni F García—acute accent restored!—but when I opened a bank account, I discovered my first name had become “Giovanni F.” Not Giovanni, not Giovanni plus middle initial. Giovanni F. Still, better than “Gio.”</p>

  


  

  <p data-word-count="248" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp44j400363b79grnwl2ec@published">Not ready to give up on an expedited European passport, I decided to visit Madrid to try my luck at the Mexican consulate there. If I couldn’t get a Mexican passport with my full name, I’d at least get to visit some world-class museums. The good news first: The museums were fantastic. As for the consulate, after a couple of hours of waiting, they called out my <em>full</em> name: “Leonel Giovanni García Fenech!” The official didn’t give me a chance to speak. “Look into here,” he said, pointing to some goggle-like device. “We need to photograph your irises for biometric identification.” Oh wow, this was actually going to work. “Now stand there for your photograph.” I grinned. The joy didn’t last long. “This is provisional, good for one year,” the official explained. “We can’t give you a regular passport until you bring us documentation with your full name. See here?” He ran his finger over the name on my naturalization document. “It just says Giovanni Garcia Fenech. And your U.S. passport is even worse—they’ve changed Fenech to just a single F! Have them fix it and then we can proceed.” I tried to explain that if not even Starbucks can get my name right, what were the chances the American government would? But he wasn’t interested, and there was a long line of people with dependable names waiting to get their irises scanned. Dejected, I went back to Seville with my ever-growing folder of documents under different names.</p>

  


  


  


  


  <p data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmggp47nb003c3b79n2us490t@published">I spent a few days at home weighing my options. Could my parents find other Mexican documents with my original name? Could I legally change it back in the U.S., or would that just tangle my paperwork in Spain? How much more Kafkaesque could this get? Then something happened that made me reconsider everything. I was standing in line at the local <em>bazar</em> (the Spanish version of a dollar store) when an elderly woman ahead of me asked the Chinese owner her name. “Lola,” she said. “<em>Lola!</em> And how did you get that name?” the woman pressed. The owner shrugged. “People kept coming in asking for a Lola who used to work here, so eventually I just started saying that was <span>me.”</span></p>

<p>Apple removed an app for preserving TikToks, Instagram reels, news reports, and videos documenting abuses by ICE, 404 Media has learned. The app, called Eyes Up, differs from other banned apps such as ICEBlock which were designed to report sightings of ICE officials in real-time to warn local communities. Eyes Up, meanwhile, was more of an aggregation service pooling together information to preserve evidence in case the material is needed in the future in court.</p><p>The news shows <a href="https://www.404media.co/iceblock-owner-after-apple-removes-app-we-are-determined-to-fight-this/"><u>that Apple</u></a> <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-calls-ice-agents-a-vulnerable-group-removes-ice-spotting-app-red-dot/"><u>and Google’s</u></a> crackdown on ICE-spotting apps, which started after pressure from the Department of Justice against Apple, is broader in scope than apps that report sightings of ICE officials. It has also impacted at least one app that was more about creating a historical record of ICE’s activity during its mass deportation effort.</p><p>“Our goal is government accountability, we aren’t even doing real-time tracking,” the administrator of Eyes Up, who said their name was Mark, told 404 Media. Mark asked 404 Media to only use his first name to protect him from retaliation. “I think the [Trump] admin is just embarrassed by how many incriminating videos we have.”</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you work at Apple or Google and know anything else about these app removals? I would love to hear from you. Using a non-work device, you can message me securely on Signal at joseph.404 or send me an email at joseph@404media.co.</strong></b></p></div><p>Mark said the app was removed on October 3. At the time of writing, the Apple App Store says “This app is currently not available in your country or region” when trying to download Eyes Up.</p>

    <p>As part of standard incident-response practice, Ruby Central is publishing the following post-incident review to the public. This document summarizes the September 2025 AWS root-access event, what occurred, what we verified, and the actions we’ve taken to strengthen our security processes<strong>.</strong></p><p>On September 30th, a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250930213611id_/https://joel.drapper.me/p/ruby-central-security-measures/"><u>blog post</u></a> raised concerns that a former maintainer continued to have access to the RubyGems.org production environment after administrative access was removed from several accounts earlier that month. We want to share the outcome of our investigation including: what happened, the extent of what we verified, what we got wrong, and the actions we have taken to strengthen our security processes going forward.</p><p>When this situation came to light, our immediate concern was the integrity and safety of the RubyGems.org service and its data. We take seriously our responsibility to steward the open-source infrastructure that millions of developers rely on each day. While we have found no evidence that user data or production operations were harmed, we recognize that the existence of an unrevoked shared credential and unclear communication created understandable alarm and frustration. For that, we are sincerely sorry.</p><h2 id="incident-response-timeline">Incident Response Timeline</h2><h4 id="september-30-2025">September 30 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>17:23 UTC:</strong> A former maintainer, André Arko, emails the Director of Open Source at Ruby Central stating that he still has access to the RubyGems.org production environment and associated monitoring tools.<br><em><strong>Note:</strong> This is the first and only disclosure to Ruby Central about this access by Mr. Arko.</em></li><li><strong>17:30 UTC:</strong> Joel Drapper (unaffiliated with Ruby Central) publishes a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250930213611id_/https://joel.drapper.me/p/ruby-central-security-measures/"><u>public blog post</u></a> within minutes describing this access with screenshots taken earlier that day showing root account access.</li><li><strong>17:51 UTC: </strong>Ruby Central engages its board members and OSS staff to verify the veracity of the report, assembles an incident team, and enumerates all services and credentials to assess exposure scope and ensure complete remediation.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>18:20 UTC:</strong> Ruby Central begins its emergency review and learns that the existing credentials for the AWS root account in our password vault are no longer valid.</li><li><strong>18:24 UTC:</strong> Ruby Central initiates an AWS password-reset procedure, validates multi-factor authentication, and regains control of the AWS root account.</li><li><strong>18:30 UTC</strong>: Ruby Central downloads a “Credentials Report” from the AWS console to understand why we could not access the root account, and learns that the root account password was changed by an unauthorized party on September 19th at 04:35 UTC.</li><li><strong>20:45 UTC:</strong> After an examination of AWS CloudTrail logs, DataDog alerts, and IAM configurations, Ruby Central identifies and revokes all associated sub-accounts and legacy credentials, issues new MFA tokens to the remaining accounts, and migrates the new root access credentials into a secure vault under Ruby Central’s sole control.</li></ul><h2 id="analysis-of-events">Analysis of Events</h2><p>By way of background, Ruby Central’s infrastructure runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The root account credentials, essentially the highest level of administrative control, are stored in a shared enterprise password manager in a shared vault to which only three individuals had access: two current Ruby Central staff members and one former maintainer, André Arko.</p><h4 id="september-18-2025">September 18 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>18:40 UTC:</strong> Ruby Central notifies Mr. Arko, via email, of the board’s decision to remove his RubyGems.org production access, and the termination of his on-call services. During that transition, our teams remove the AWS security credentials belonging to Mr. Arko for accessing the production systems, but we fail to rotate the AWS root account password in tandem.</li></ul><h4 id="september-19-2025">September 19, 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>04:34 UTC:</strong> An unauthorized actor originating from a San Francisco, California IP address starts a root account session on the AWS Rubygems.org AWS account.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>04:35 UTC:</strong> The unauthorized actor changes the root account password. <br><em><strong>Note: </strong>After this point, and until the AWS root credentials were reset by Ruby Central on Sept 30th, all subsequent actions taken on the AWS root account originate from the unauthorized actor.&nbsp;</em></li><li><strong>04:37 UTC:</strong> The unauthorized actor removes authorized users from groups and detaches access policies which reduces the privileges of authorized Rubygems.org AWS account holders.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>04:39 UTC: </strong>The unauthorized actor rapidly enumerates the IAM posture of the entire AWS account.&nbsp;</li></ul><h4 id="september-28th-2025">September 28th, 2025</h4><ul><li><strong>05:49 UTC: </strong>An unauthorized actor originating from a Tokyo, Japan IP address starts a&nbsp; root account session and uses IAM introspection API calls to check users’ group membership, last usage date, and last usage date of associated access tokens and policies.<br><em><strong>Note:</strong> This unauthorized access occurs adjacent to the </em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250929050252id_/https://kaigionrails.org/2025/"><em><u>Kaigi on Rails conference</u></em></a><em> also in Tokyo, Japan from Sept 26th - 27th.

In addition:</p><ul><li>RubyGems.org remained fully operational throughout.</li><li>No personally identifiable information (PII) of RubyGems.org users nor Ruby Central financial data was accessed or transferred.</li><li>The production database, S3 buckets, and CI/CD pipeline were unaffected.</li></ul><p>Nonetheless, the existence of unrotated credentials and the public disclosure of continued access constitute a serious procedural failure, and we are treating it as such.</p><h2 id="how-was-the-incident-resolved">How Was The Incident Resolved?</h2><p>After regaining control of the AWS account, Ruby Central:</p><ol><li><strong>Revoked all existing root and IAM credentials</strong>, created new MFA-protected access, and moved them to a restricted vault with per-user audit logs.</li><li><strong>Rotated all related secrets and tokens</strong>, including DataDog, GitHub Actions, and other external system integrations.</li><li><strong>Enabled AWS CloudTrail, GuardDuty, and DataDog alerting</strong> for any root login, password change, or IAM modification.</li><li><strong>Reviewed all IAM roles and policies</strong> to ensure least-privilege access and removed legacy permissions.</li><li><strong>Began a full end-to-end security audit</strong> with external advisors, covering infrastructure, credential storage, and incident-response procedures.</li><li><strong>Updated the Ruby Central Security Runbook</strong> to include immediate password and key rotation upon personnel or role changes, quarterly credential reviews, and coordinated communication steps for any future incident.</li></ol><h2 id="root-cause-analysis">Root Cause Analysis</h2><p>After a post-mortem review, the root cause of the security incident was two-fold: </p><ol><li>While Ruby Central correctly removed access to shared credentials through its enterprise password manager prior to the incident, our staff did not consider the possibility that this credential may have been copied or exfiltrated to other password managers outside of Ruby Central’s visibility or control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Ruby Central failed to rotate the AWS root account credentials (password and MFA) after the departure of personnel with access to the shared vault.</li></ol><p>Both of these events enabled the unauthorized actor to access RubyGems.org production infrastructure where they attempted unsuccessfully to lock out authorized personnel and frustrate recovery efforts.</p><h2 id="what-we-are-doing-to-prevent-future-incidents">What We Are Doing to Prevent Future Incidents?</h2><p>RubyGems.org is a critical service that the entire Ruby community depends on, and we take that responsibility seriously. For RubyGems.org to succeed, it must not only maintain near-perfect operational uptime but also earn the community’s trust that it is operated professionally, that its operators can attest to the integrity of both the data and the code it serves to millions of Ruby applications worldwide, and that the privacy of the data we hold remains intact.</p><p>To that end, we commit to the following improvements:</p><ol><li>Update our access revocation procedures and checklists to ensure access is also revoked to the Ruby Central enterprise password manager.</li><li>Update our access revocation procedures to ensure any non-federated credentials (particularly shared credentials) are rotated quickly after a personnel separation.&nbsp;</li><li>Commission <strong>an independent security audit</strong> of Ruby Central’s systems and access.</li><li>Finalize formal Operator and Contributor Agreements to clearly define who may hold production access and under what conditions</li></ol><h2 id="why-did-ruby-central-treat-this-event-as-a-security-incident">Why Did Ruby Central Treat This Event as a Security Incident?</h2><p><a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/our-stewardship-where-we-are-whats-changing-and-how-well-engage/"><u>As part of our recent actions</u></a>, we determined that many RubyGems.org systems were controlled by a single individual; an untenable situation for a service of this importance.</p><p>To provide additional context to the community about our decision to formalize production access through Operator and Contributor Agreements, and to explain why we treated this incident as a genuine security event, we are sharing context from conversations between Mr. Arko and Ruby Central personnel leading up to the September 18th access changes.</p><p>In early August 2025, Ruby Central began reviewing its open source contractor budget, which totaled approximately $762,000 in 2024. On-call coverage is critical for a service like RubyGems.org and allows us to ensure operational continuity and rapid response to production incidents. Every on-call shift has a primary who is directly responsible for responding to incidents, and a secondary who is there to serve as a back up and an escalation point, if and when needed.</p><p>For RubyGems.org, the secondary on-call rotation, which serves as a backup layer, was rarely activated. Ruby Central’s long-term goal was to transition this limited paid function into a distributed network of volunteer operators who could share those responsibilities without additional cost, ensuring both operational continuity and financial sustainability.</p><p>Following these budget adjustments, Mr. Arko’s consultancy, which had been receiving approximately $50,000 per year for providing the secondary on-call service, submitted a proposal offering to provide secondary on-call services at no cost in exchange for access to production HTTP access logs, containing IP addresses and other personally identifiable information (PII). The offer would have given Mr. Arko’s consultancy access to that data, so that they could monetize it by analyzing access patterns and potentially sharing it with unrelated third-parties.</p><figure><img src="https://rubycentral.org/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1027" srcset="https://rubycentral.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png 600w, https://rubycentral.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png 1000w, https://rubycentral.org/content/images/2025/10/data-src-image-74018b71-3432-478c-8aea-7186f3d4ab11.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The board and leadership team determined that this proposal crossed important ethical and legal boundaries, introducing privacy, conflict-of-interest, and governance concerns inconsistent with Ruby Central’s responsibilities as stewards of the ecosystem. These concerns set in motion Ruby Central’s decision to adopt the new operating model and governance structure detailed <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/our-stewardship-where-we-are-whats-changing-and-how-well-engage/"><u>in this blog post</u></a>.&nbsp; With this context in mind, when we discovered that Mr. Arko had retained access to production systems containing PII, it prompted us to consider it as a security incident and to respond immediately.</p><p>Based on our preliminary investigation, as of the publication of this post, we have no evidence to indicate that any RubyGems.org data was copied or retained by unauthorized parties, including Mr. Arko.</p><p>We recognize that these events have raised valid questions within the community and tested confidence in how Ruby Central fulfills its stewardship role. Our intent in sharing this level of detail is to be transparent about what occurred, what we have learned, and what we are doing to prevent it from happening again. We are hopeful that this openness marks a meaningful step toward rebuilding trust in our stewardship and demonstrating that accountability and collaboration remain central to how we serve the Ruby ecosystem.</p><p>We are deeply grateful to the community for holding us accountable and for the patience and professionalism shown during this process. Ruby Central remains committed to transparent, responsible stewardship of the RubyGems infrastructure and to maintaining the security and trust that the Ruby ecosystem depends on.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Shan Cureton<br>Executive Director</p>

------
Query:  &quot;machine learning&quot;
Corpus: 1000 documents, average length 150 words
Target: Document 1 (200 words)
        - &quot;machine&quot; appears 3 times (df=100 docs have &quot;machine&quot;)
        - &quot;learning&quot; appears 2 times (df=50 docs have &quot;learning&quot;)

Parameters: k1=1.5, b=0.75


STEP 1: Calculate IDF for each term
----------------------------------------

IDF(machine):
    N = 1000, df = 100

    IDF = log((1000 - 100 + 0.5) / (100 + 0.5) + 1)
        = log(900.5 / 100.5 + 1)
        = log(8.96 + 1)
        = log(9.96)
        ≈ 2.30

IDF(learning):
    N = 1000, df = 50

    IDF = log((1000 - 50 + 0.5) / (50 + 0.5) + 1)
        = log(950.5 / 50.5 + 1)
        = log(18.82 + 1)
        = log(19.82)
        ≈ 2.99

    Note: &quot;learning&quot; is rarer (df=50) than &quot;machine&quot; (df=100)
          so it gets a higher IDF weight


STEP 2: Calculate normalized TF for &quot;machine&quot;

TF = 3 (appears 3 times)
docLen = 200
avgdl = 150

Numerator   = TF × (k1 + 1)
            = 3 × (1.5 + 1)
            = 3 × 2.5
            = 7.5

Denominator = TF + k1 × (1 - b + b × (docLen / avgdl))

            = 3 + 1.5 × 1.25
            = 3 + 1.875
            = 4.875

Normalized TF = 7.5 / 4.875 ≈ 1.54

Contribution = IDF × Normalized TF
             = 2.30 × 1.54

TF = 2 (appears 2 times)

Contribution = IDF × Normalized TF
             = 2.99 × 1.29

<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Skip Lists over Balanced Trees</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Rationale:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Simpler implementation (no rotation logic)</li>
<li>Better cache locality</li>
<li>Easier to make concurrent</li>
<li>Comparable performance (O(log n))</li>
<li>Used in production systems (Redis, LevelDB)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Benefits:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Enables phrase search (check consecutive positions)</li>
<li>Enables proximity ranking (measure distances)</li>
<li>Enables snippet generation (extract relevant parts)</li>
<li>More precise search results</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Trade-offs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Larger index size (~2-3x more data)</li>
<li>More complex algorithms (but still O(log n))</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3. Binary Serialization</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Custom binary format instead of JSON:</p>
<p dir="auto">Advantages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>60% smaller file size</li>
<li>3x faster parsing</li>
<li>Preserves skip list structure</li>
<li>Suitable for large indexes</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>4. Configurable Text Analysis</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Pluggable analyzer configuration:</p>
<p dir="auto">Benefits:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Adapt to different use cases</li>
<li>Trade-off precision vs recall</li>
<li>Support multiple languages (future)</li>
<li>Domain-specific customization</li>
