<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Summary:</strong> A major brick-and-mortar store sold an Apple Gift Card that Apple seemingly took offence to, and locked out my entire Apple ID, effectively bricking my devices and my iCloud Account, Apple Developer ID, and everything associated with it, and I have no recourse. Can you help? Email paris AT paris.id.au (and read on for the details). ❤️</p><p>Here’s how Apple “Permanently” locked my Apple ID.</p><p>I am writing this as a desperate measure. After nearly 30 years as a loyal customer, <a href="https://hey.paris/books-and-events/books/#books">authoring technical books on Apple’s own programming languages (Objective-C and Swift)</a>, and spending tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of dollars on devices, apps, conferences, and services, I have been locked out of my personal and professional digital life with no explanation and no recourse.</p><h2 id="the-situation">The Situation</h2><p>My Apple ID, which I have held for around 25 years (it was originally a username, before they had to be email addresses; it’s from the iTools era), has been permanently disabled. This isn’t just an email address; it is my core digital identity. It holds terabytes of family photos, my entire message history, and is the key to syncing my work across the ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://hey.paris/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/cardfail.png#center" alt=""></a></p><ul><li><strong>The Trigger:</strong> The only recent activity on my account was a recent attempt to redeem a $500 Apple Gift Card to pay for my 6TB iCloud+ storage plan. The code failed. The vendor suggested that the card number was likely compromised and agreed to reissue it. Shortly after, my account was locked.<ul><li>An Apple Support representative suggested that this was the cause of the issue: indicating that something was likely untoward about this card.</li><li>The card was purchased from a major brick-and-mortar retailer (Australians, think Woolworths scale; Americans, think Walmart scale), so if I cannot rely on the provenance of that, and have no recourse, what am I meant to do? We have even sent the receipt, indicating the card’s serial number and purchase location to Apple.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href="https://hey.paris/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/apple-account-locked.png#center" alt=""></a></p><ul><li><strong>The Consequence:</strong> My account is flagged as “closed in accordance with the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions”.</li><li><strong>The Damage:</strong> I effectively have over $30,000 worth of previously-active “bricked" hardware. My iPhone, iPad, Watch, and Macs cannot sync, update, or function properly. I have lost access to thousands of dollars in purchased software and media.<ul><li>Apple representatives claim that only the “Media and Services” side of my account is blocked, but now my devices have signed me out of iMessage (and I can’t sign back in), and I can’t even sign out of the blocked iCloud account because… it’s barred from the sign-out API, as far as I can tell.</li><li>I can’t even login to the “Secure File Transfer” system Apple uses to exchange information, because it relies on an Apple ID. Most of the ways Apple has suggested seeking help from them involve signing in to an Apple service to upload something, or communicate with them. This doesn’t work as the account is locked.</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href="https://hey.paris/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/accountfail.png#center" alt=""></a></p><ul><li>I can’t even download my iCloud Photos, as:<ol><li>There are repeated auth-errors on my account, so I can’t make Photos work;</li><li>I don’t have a 6TB device to sync them to, even if I could.</li></ol></li></ul><p><a href="https://hey.paris/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/imessage.png#center" alt=""></a></p><h2 id="the-support-nightmare">The Support Nightmare</h2><p>I contacted Apple Support immediately (Case ID: 102774292094). The experience was terrifyingly dismissive:</p><ol><li><strong>No Information:</strong> Support staff refused to tell me <em>why</em> the account was banned or provide specific details on the decision.</li><li><strong>No Escalation:</strong> When I begged for an escalation to Executive Customer Relations (ECR), noting that I would lose the ability to do my job and that my devices were useless, I was told that “an additional escalation won’t lead to a different outcome”.<ul><li>Many of the reps I’ve spoken to have suggested strange things, one of the strangest was telling me that I could physically go to Apple’s Australian HQ at Level 3, 20 Martin Place, Sydney, and plead my case. They even put me on hold for 5 minutes while they looked up the address.</li></ul></li></ol><p><a href="https://hey.paris/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://hey.paris/chat.png#center" alt=""></a></p><h2 id="the-new-account-trap">The “New Account” Trap</h2><p>Most insultingly, the official advice from the Senior Advisor was to “create a new Apple account… and update the payment information”.</p><p>This advice is technically disastrous:</p><ul><li><strong>The Legal Catch:</strong> Apple’s Terms and Conditions rely on “Termination of Access.” By closing my account, they have revoked my license to use their services.</li><li><strong>The Technical Trap:</strong> If I follow their advice and create a new account on my current devices (which are likely hardware-flagged due to the gift card error), the new account will likely be linked to the banned one and disabled for circumventing security measures.</li><li><strong>The Developer Risk:</strong> As a professional Apple Developer, attempting to “dodge” a ban by creating a new ID could lead to my Developer Program membership being permanently blacklisted, amongst other things.</li></ul><h2 id="who-i-am">Who I Am</h2><p>I am not a casual user. I have <a href="https://hey.paris/books-and-events/books/#books">literally written the book on Apple development (taking over the <em>Learning Cocoa with Objective-C</em> series, which Apple themselves used to write, for O’Reilly Media, and then 20+ books following that)</a>. I help run the longest-running Apple developer event not run by Apple themselves, <a href="https://devworld.au/index.php">/dev/world</a>. I have effectively been an evangelist for this company’s technology for my entire professional life. We had an app on the App Store on Day 1 in every sense of the world.</p><h2 id="my-plea">My Plea</h2><p>I am asking for a human at Apple to review this case. I suspect an automated fraud flag regarding the bad gift card triggered a nuclear response that frontline support cannot override. I have escalated this through my many friends in WWDR and SRE at Apple, with no success.</p><p>I am desperate to resolve this and restore my digital life. If you can help, please email paris AT paris.id.au</p></div></div>]]></description>

                    Google has removed dozens of new Sci-Hub domain names from its search results in the United States. Unlike typical DMCA takedowns, the removals were triggered by a dated court order that was not enforced for several years. This appears to be one of the first times Google has deindexed an entire pirate site in the U.S. based on a 'site blocking' style injunction.
        </p>
      </div><div>
        <p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/scilogo.jpg" alt="Sci-Hub" width="222" height="222">In 2017, American Chemical Society (ACS), a leading source of academic publications in the field of chemistry, won a lawsuit against Sci-Hub and its operator, Alexandra Elbakyan.</p>
<p>The ‘Pirate Bay of Science’ had failed to appear at a Virginia federal court, resulting in an easy win for the publisher and a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/">$4.8 million default judgment</a> award for damages. </p>
<h2>A Broad Anti-Piracy Injunction (2018)</h2>
<p>More important, perhaps, was the broad permanent injunction that the Virginia federal court <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/us-court-grants-isps-and-search-engine-blockade-of-sci-hub-171106/">signed off on in 2017</a>. This order effectively gave ACS free rein to take down <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/publisher-gets-carte-blanche-to-seize-new-sci-hub-domains-180410/">existing and newly registered</a> Sci-Hub domain names.</p>
<p>The injunction also required all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to “cease facilitating access” to these domain names, including search engines, hosting providers, ISPs, and domain name registrars, the order clarified. </p>
<center><em>From the 2018 injunction</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1.png.webp 1207w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1-300x173.png.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1.png" alt="acs sci-hub injunction" width="600" height="346" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1.png 1207w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1-300x173.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1-600x346.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/injunction-1-150x87.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">

</center>
<p>On paper, this injunction enabled ACS to request American ISPs and search engines to ‘block’ existing and future Sci-Hub domains. However, there was no sign that the publisher was doing so. Aside from a few suspended domains, Sci-Hub remained widely accessible. </p>
<p>Whether ACS did not feel the need to enforce the order against search engines and other intermediaries or if these companies actively objected to the requested actions was unknown. And as time passed, the injunction became a distant memory, at least for a few years. </p>
<h2>Google Complies with Zombie Injunction? (2025)</h2>
<p>Earlier this week we spotted a unique request in the <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/">Lumen Database</a>, where the 2018 injunction was cited. The <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/75235506?access_token=TSMrXHv4nc0SEKQxC5fmxg">notice in question</a> asks Google to deindex 34 (sub)domains linked to Sci-Hub. </p>
<p>None of these domains were referenced in the 2018 injunction but are indeed linked to Sci-Hub. Many of the partially redacted domains appear to be domain variations of the scihubtw.tw mirror network, such as edu.scihubtw.tw and freeus.scihubtw.tw.</p>
<center><em>Court order notice</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc.png.webp 1608w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc-300x243.png.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc.png" alt="lumen sci" width="600" height="487" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc.png 1608w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc-300x243.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc-600x487.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc-150x122.png 150w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/lumensc-1536x1246.png 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>It’s surprising to see this type of enforcement seven years after the injunction was issued, but the request is legitimate. Google is certainly taking it seriously and has deindexed these domains from its search results in America. In other countries, the same domains remain accessible.  </p>
<h2>First “US-Only” Sci-Hub Removals</h2>
<p>The December 2 notice was sent by <a href="https://www.wiggin.co.uk/">UK law firm Wiggin LLP</a>, which sent a similar request in September this year, targeting a few dozen other Sci-Hub domains. In total, we spotted seven notices, with the earliest dating back to 2022. </p>
<p>The results of these removals are also clearly visible in Google search. Those who search for Sci-Hub in the U.S. will see the following notice at the bottom of the results. </p>
<center><em>Removed by legal request</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">
<source type="image/webp" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed.png.webp 1240w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed-300x207.png.webp 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed.png" alt="removed" width="600" height="414" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed.png 1240w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed-300x207.png 300w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed-600x414.png 600w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-removed-150x104.png 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">
</picture>
</center>
<p>It’s not clear why it took five years before ACS urged Google to take action in response to the injunction. However, these removals are similar to Google’s <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/google-removed-blocked-pirate-sites-from-uk-search-results-220209/">removal of pirate site domains</a> in other countries in response to ISP-blocking orders. Voluntary cooperation by Google was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/google-removes-pirate-bay-domains-from-search-results-citing-dutch-court-order-211130/">uncovered</a> shortly before ACS first notified the search engine.</p>
<h2>“In Active Concert”?</h2>
<p>Google’s voluntary cooperation with ISP blocking orders in Australia, the Netherlands, France, the UK, and elsewhere also brings up an important question. Is Google cooperating with the permanent injunction in the U.S. because it feels legally compelled to do so, or is that a voluntary gesture too?</p>
<p>The 2018 injunction requires all parties “in active concert or participation” with Sci-Hub to take action. While search engines are mentioned as an example, Google and other tech companies have <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/tech-giants-oppose-broad-anti-piracy-injunctions-150702/">previously argued</a> that neutral third-party services are not necessarily “in active concert or participation”.</p>
<p>It is likely that Google maintains this stance, opting to voluntarily comply with orders targeting other third parties. That would mirror its response to site-blocking orders elsewhere.</p>
<p>We contacted Google hoping to hear answers to these questions, but the company did not respond to our request for comment.</p>

<p>12th December 2025</p>



<p>One of the things that most excited me about <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Anthropic’s new Skills mechanism</a> back in October is how easy it looked for other platforms to implement. A skill is just a folder with a Markdown file and some optional extra resources and scripts, so any LLM tool with the ability to navigate and read from a filesystem should be capable of using them. It turns out OpenAI are doing exactly that, with skills support quietly showing up in both their Codex CLI tool and now also in ChatGPT itself.</p>
<h4 id="skills-in-chatgpt">Skills in ChatGPT</h4>
<p>I learned about this <a href="https://x.com/elias_judin/status/1999491647563006171">from Elias Judin</a> this morning. It turns out the Code Interpreter feature of ChatGPT now has a new <code>/home/oai/skills</code> folder which you can access simply by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/693c9645-caa4-8006-9302-0a9226ea7599">tried that myself</a> and got back <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/skills.zip">this zip file</a>. Here’s <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/zip-wheel-explorer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.simonwillison.net%2Fstatic%2Fcors-allow%2F2025%2Fskills.zip">a UI for exploring its content</a> (<a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/colophon#zip-wheel-explorer.html">more about that tool</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills-explore.jpg" alt="Screenshot of file explorer. Files skills/docs/render_docsx.py and skills/docs/skill.md and skills/pdfs/ and skills/pdfs/skill.md - that last one is expanded and reads: # PDF reading, creation, and review guidance  ## Reading PDFs - Use pdftoppm -png $OUTDIR/$BASENAME.pdf $OUTDIR/$BASENAME to convert PDFs to PNGs. - Then open the PNGs and read the images. - pdfplumber is also installed and can be used to read PDFs. It can be used as a complementary tool to pdftoppm but not replacing it. - Only do python printing as a last resort because you will miss important details with text extraction (e.g. figures, tables, diagrams).  ## Primary tooling for creating PDFs - Generate PDFs programmatically with reportlab as the primary tool. In most cases, you should use reportlab to create PDFs. - If there are other packages you think are necessary for the task (eg. pypdf, pyMuPDF), you can use them but you may need topip install them first. - After each meaningful update—content additions, layout adjustments, or style changes—render the PDF to images to check layout fidelity:   - pdftoppm -png $INPUT_PDF $OUTPUT_PREFIX - Inspect every exported PNG before continuing work. If anything looks off, fix the source and re-run the render → inspect loop until the pages are clean.  ## Quality expectations - Maintain a polished, intentional visual design: consistent typography, spacing, margins, color palette, and clear section breaks across all pages. - Avoid major rendering issues—no clipped text, overlapping elements, black squares, broken tables, or unreadable glyphs. The rendered pages should look like a curated document, not raw template output. - Charts, tables, diagrams, and images must be sharp, well-aligned, and properly labeled in the PNGs. Legends and axes should be readable without excessive zoom. - Text must be readable at normal viewing size; avoid walls of filler text or dense, unstructured bullet lists. Use whitespace to separate ideas. - Never use the U+2011 non-breaking hyphen or other unicode dashes as they will not be"></p>
<p>So far they cover spreadsheets, docx and PDFs. Interestingly their chosen approach for PDFs and documents is to convert them to rendered per-page PNGs and then pass those through their vision-enabled GPT models, presumably to maintain information from layout and graphics that would be lost if they just ran text extraction.</p>
<p>Elias <a href="https://github.com/eliasjudin/oai-skills">shared copies in a GitHub repo</a>. They look very similar to Anthropic’s implementation of the same kind of idea, currently published in their <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills">anthropics/skills</a> repository.</p>
<p>I tried it out by prompting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a PDF with a summary of the rimu tree situation right now and what it means for kakapo breeding season</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, GPT-5.2 Thinking started with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Searching rimu mast and Kākāpō 2025 breeding status</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It took <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/693ca54b-f770-8006-904b-9f31a585180a">just over eleven minutes</a> to produce <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/cors-allow/2025/rimu_kakapo_breeding_brief.pdf">this PDF</a>, which was long enough that I had Claude Code for web <a href="https://github.com/simonw/tools/pull/155">build me a custom PDF viewing tool</a> while I waited.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/view-pdf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.simonwillison.net%2Fstatic%2Fcors-allow%2F2025%2Frimu_kakapo_breeding_brief.pdf">Here’s ChatGPT’s PDF in that tool</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/rimu.jpg" alt="Screenshot of my tool. There is a URL at the top, a Load PDF button and pagination controls. Then the PDF itself is shown, which reads: Rimu mast status and what it means for the kākāpō breeding season Summary as of 12 December 2025 (Pacific/Auckland context) Kākāpō breeding is tightly linked to rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) mast events: when rimu trees set and ripen large amounts of fruit, female kākāpō are much more likely to nest, and more chicks can be successfully raised. Current monitoring indicates an unusually strong rimu fruiting signal heading into the 2025/26 season, which sets the stage for a potentially large breeding year in 2026.^1,2 Key numbers at a glance Kākāpō population (official DOC count) 237 birds alive Breeding trigger (rimu fruiting)>10% of rimu branch tips bearing fruit Forecast rimu fruiting for 2026 (DOC monitoring) Around 50–60% fruiting across breeding islands¹Breeding-age females (DOC 2025 planning figure)About 87 females (potentially nearly all could nest)"></p>
<p>(I am <strong>very excited</strong> about <a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2025/12/03/bumper-breeding-season-for-kakapo-on-the-cards.html">Kākāpō breeding season this year</a>.)</p>
<p>The reason it took so long is that it was fastidious about looking at and tweaking its own work. I appreciated that at one point it tried rendering the PDF and noticed that the macrons in kākāpō were not supported by the chosen font, so it switched to something else:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/skills-macrons.jpg" alt="ChatGPT screenshot. Analyzed image. There's an image of a page of PDF with obvious black blocks on some of the letters in the heading. It then says: Fixing font issues with macrons. The page is showing black squares for words like &quot;kākāpō,&quot; probably because Helvetica can't handle macrons. I'll switch to a font that supports them, such as DejaVu Sans or Noto Sans. I'll register both regular and bold fonts, then apply them to the document. I'll update the footer to note the issue with Helvetica. Time to rebuild the PDF!"></p>
<h4 id="skills-in-codex-cli">Skills in Codex CLI</h4>
<p>Meanwhile, two weeks ago OpenAI’s open source Codex CLI tool landed a PR titled <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/pull/7412">feat: experimental support for skills.md</a>. The most recent docs for that are in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/skills.md">docs/skills.md</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation suggests that any folder in <code>~/.codex/skills</code> will be treated as a skill.</p>
<p>I dug around and found the code that generates the prompt that drives the skill system in <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/ad7b9d63c326d5c92049abd16f9f5fb64a573a69/codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs#L20-L38">codex-rs/core/src/skills/render.rs</a>—here’s a Gist with <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/25f2c3a9e350274bc2b76a79bc8ae8b2">a more readable version of that prompt</a>.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://claude.ai/share/0a9b369b-f868-4065-91d1-fd646c5db3f4">used Claude Opus 4.5’s skill authoring skill</a> to create <a href="https://github.com/datasette/skill">this skill for creating Datasette plugins</a>, then installed it into my Codex CLI skills folder like this:</p>
<div><pre>git clone https://github.com/datasette/skill \
  <span>~</span>/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin</pre></div>
<p>You have to run Codex with the <code>--enable skills</code> option. I ran this:</p>
<div><pre><span>cd</span> /tmp
mkdir datasette-cowsay
<span>cd</span> datasette-cowsay
codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2</pre></div>
<p>Then prompted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>list skills</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Codex replied:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>- datasette-plugins — Writing Datasette plugins using Python + pluggy (file: /Users/simon/.codex/skills/datasette-plugin/SKILL.md)</code><br>
<code>- Discovery — How to find/identify available skills (no SKILL.md path provided in the list)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Write a Datasette plugin in this folder adding a /-/cowsay?text=hello page that displays a pre with cowsay from PyPI saying that text</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It worked perfectly! Here’s <a href="https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay">the plugin code it wrote</a> and here’s <a href="http://gistpreview.github.io/?96ee928370b18eabc2e0fad9aaa46d4b">a copy of the full Codex CLI transcript</a>, generated with my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/23/claude-code-for-web-video/">terminal-to-html tool</a>.</p>
<p>You can try that out yourself if you have <code>uvx</code> installed like this:</p>
<div><pre>uvx --with https://github.com/simonw/datasette-cowsay/archive/refs/heads/main.zip \
  datasette</pre></div>
<p>Then visit:</p>
<pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:8001/-/cowsay?text=This+is+pretty+fun
</code></pre>

<h4 id="skills-are-a-keeper">Skills are a keeper</h4>
<p>When I first wrote about skills in October I said <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/">Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP</a>. The fact that it’s just turned December and OpenAI have already leaned into them in a big way reinforces to me that I called that one correctly.</p>
<p>Skills are based on a <em>very</em> light specification, if you could even call it that, but I still think it would be good for these to be formally documented somewhere. This could be a good initiative for the new <a href="https://aaif.io/">Agentic AI Foundation</a> (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/9/agentic-ai-foundation/">previously</a>) to take on.</p>

<p>Crackpots ranging from billionaire Peter Thiel to random YouTube influencers claim that science has been stagnating for the past 50 years. They admit that computing is an exception: they don’t pretend that my personal 32GB laptop is not an advance over the 16MB mainframe that served the whole Caltech community when I was there. Instead they claim that advances in computing were driven solely by industrial research, quite overlooking the role of academia 
and government funding
in pushing the VLSI revolution, RISC processor design, networking, hypertext, virtual memory and indeed computers themselves. As for the industrial research,
most of it came from just two “blue sky” institutes – <a href="https://sites.stat.columbia.edu/gelman/research/published/bell.pdf">Bell Labs</a> 
and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc">Xerox PARC</a> – that closed a long time ago. 
LCF-style proof assistants are a world away from mainstream computing,
so let’s look at 50 years of progress there.</p>

<h3 id="19751985-edinburgh-lcf">1975–1985: Edinburgh LCF</h3>

<p>The first instance of LCF was Stanford LCF, developed by Robin Milner in 1972, but it was <strong>not</strong> an LCF-style proof assistant! LCF meant “Logic for Computable Functions”, a quirky formalism based on Scott domains and intended for reasoning about small functional programs. But “LCF-style proof assistant” means one that, like Edinburgh LCF, was coded in some form of 
the ML programming language and provided a proof kernel, 
encapsulated in an abstract type definition, to ensure that a theorem could only be generated 
by applying inference rules to axioms or other theorems:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the ML type discipline is used… so that—whatever complex procedures are defined—all values of type <code>thm</code> must be theorems, as only inferences can compute such values…. This security releases us from the need to preserve whole proofs… — an important practical gain since large proofs tended to clog up the working space… [<em>Edinburgh LCF</em>, page IV]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Edinburgh LCF was first announced in 1975, which conveniently is exactly 50 years ago, 
at the almost mythical conference on <em>Proving and Improving Programs</em> held at Arc-et-Senans. 
The <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/3-540-09724-4">user manual</a>, published in the Springer lecture notes series, came out in 1979.
Edinburgh LCF introduced some other principles that people still adhere to today:</p>

<ul>
  <li>inference rules in the <em>natural deduction</em> style, with a dynamic set of assumptions</li>
  <li>a <em>goal-directed</em> proof style, where you start with the theorem statement and work backwards</li>
  <li>a structured system of <em>theories</em> to organise groups of definitions</li>
</ul>

<p>Edinburgh LCF had its own version of the ML language.
It supported a fragment of first-order logic containing
the logical symbols $\forall$, $\land$ and $\to$ along with
the relation symbols $\equiv$ and $\sqsubseteq$.
It introduced proof tactics and also <em>tacticals</em>:
operators for combining tactics.
Tactics supported goal-directed proof,
but Edinburgh LCF had no notion of the current goal or anything to help the user manage the tree of subgoals.
Its user interface was simply the ML top level and the various theorem-proving primitives were simply ML functions.
ML stood for <em>metalanguage</em>, since managing the process of proof was its exact job.</p>

<p>Avra Cohn and Robin Milner wrote a <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-20.html">report</a> 
on proving the correctness of a parsing algorithm 
using Edinburgh LCF. 
The proof consists of one single induction followed by 
a little simplification and other reasoning.
The report includes a succinct description of Edinburgh LCF.
It is a nice snapshot of the state of the art in 1982,
when I arrived in Cambridge to join a project run by Robin Milner and Mike Gordon.
Full of youthful enthusiasm, I told Mike that it would be great 
if one day we could formalise the Prime Number Theorem.
I hardly knew what the theorem was about or how to prove it, 
but my college roommate had told me it was really deep.</p>

<p>Disappointed to discover that we only had $\forall$, $\land$ and $\to$,
I set out to fix that, to support full first-order logic. 
I ended up changing so much 
(backwards compatibility is overrated) that people eventually shamed me into writing my own <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/gb/universitypress/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/logic-and-computation-interactive-proof-cambridge-lcf">user manual</a>.
Cambridge LCF never caught on because, well, 
nobody liked the LCF formalism.
But I used it for a development that seemed big at the time: to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0167-6423(85)90009-7">verify the unification algorithm</a>.
This development was later <a href="https://isabelle.in.tum.de/dist/library/HOL/HOL-ex/Unification.html">ported to Isabelle</a>.
It contains 36 inductions, so we were making progress.
And this takes us to 1985, exactly 40 years ago;
see also <a href="https://doi.org/10.48456/tr-54">this survey</a> of the state of play.
But there was almost no mathematics: no negative numbers and no decimal notation, so you could not even write 2+2=4.
As far as the broader computer science community was concerned, we were a joke.</p>

<h3 id="19851995-cambridge-lcf-and-hol">1985–1995: Cambridge LCF and HOL</h3>

<p>Cambridge LCF was in itself a dead end, but because it included a much faster ML compiler,
it ended up <a href="https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2022/09/28/Cambridge_LCF.html">being incorporated</a> into a lot of other proof assistants, notably Mike’s <a href="https://github.com/theoremprover-museum/HOL88">HOL88</a>. 
And just like that, <a href="https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2023/01/04/Hardware_Verification.html">hardware verification</a> became a reality. 
Although software verification seemed stuck in the doldrums,
a couple of production-ready chip designs were verified!
Mike’s explanation was that hardware verification was simply easier.</p>

<p>Also in 1985, we got a new <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3386336">standard for the ML language</a>
and, soon, two compilers for it.
So then I started working on experiments that would 
<a href="https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2022/07/13/Isabelle_influences.html">lead to Isabelle</a>.
It would be like LCF but would support constructive type theory, 
crucially allowing both unification and backtracking, like in Prolog.
But there was no working system yet, just a grant application. 
And that was the state of play 40 years ago.</p>

<p>Funding secured, Isabelle development started in earnest in 1986.
It was coded in <a href="https://www.lfcs.inf.ed.ac.uk/software/ML/">Standard ML</a> from the start, while HOL88 was ported from the Cambridge LCF version of ML 
to Standard ML, emerging as HOL90.
Mike acquired a bevy of energetic PhD students, 
who engaged in verification projects or built extensions for HOL.
Versions of HOL were being used in institutes around the world.</p>

<p>Stepping aside from HOL for a moment, other proof assistants had made great progress 
by the mid 1990s.
The addition of inductive definitions to the calculus of constructions
gave us the <a href="https://rdcu.be/eR7e8">calculus of inductive constructions</a>,
which in essence is the formalism used today by Rocq and Lean.
The very first release of Isabelle/HOL <a href="https://rdcu.be/eR7gl">happened in 1991</a>, 
primarily the work of Tobias Nipkow, though I was soon to
<a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/holisa.html">join in</a>.
Isabelle/ZF, which was my pet project, formalised axiomatic set theory 
to some <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9612104">quite deep results</a>.</p>

<p>But I am still not certain whether negative numbers were supported (can somebody help me?).
Our weak support for arithmetic may seem odd 
when our research community was aware that the real numbers 
had been <a href="https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2022/06/22/Why-formalise.html">formalised in AUTOMATH</a>, 
but we didn’t seem to want them. 
To many, we were still a joke. This was about to change.</p>

<h3 id="19952005-proof-assistants-come-of-age">1995–2005: Proof assistants come of age</h3>

<p>In 1994, came the Pentium with its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/processors/pentium-fdiv-the-processor-bug-that-shook-the-world-1270773">FDIV bug</a>: 
a probably insignificant but detectable error in floating-point division.
The subsequent product recall cost Intel nearly half a billion dollars.
John Harrison, a student of Mike’s, decided to devote his PhD research
to the verification of floating-point arithmetic.
By June 1996 he had submitted an extraordinary <a href="https://doi.org/10.48456/tr-408">thesis</a>, 
<em>Theorem Proving with the Real Numbers</em>,
which described a formidable series of achievements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a formalisation of the real member system in HOL</li>
  <li>formalised analysis including metric spaces, sequences and series, limits, continuity and differentiation, power series and transcendental functions, integration</li>
  <li>proper numerals represented internally by symbolic binary, and calculations on them</li>
  <li>computer algebra techniques including a decision procedure for real algebra</li>
  <li>tools and techniques for floating-point verification by reference to the IEEE standard</li>
</ul>

<p>This thesis, which I had the privilege to examine, won a Distinguished Dissertation Award
and was <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-1591-5">published as a book</a> by Springer.
So by the middle of the 1990s, which was 30 years ago, 
we had gone from almost no arithmetic to a decent chunk of formalised real analysis
that was good enough to verify actual floating-point algorithms.</p>

<p>This period also saw something of an arms race in automation.
My earlier, Prolog-inspired vision of backtracking search
had led to some <a href="https://doi.org/10.48456/tr-396">fairly general automation</a> that was effective not just in standard predicate logic 
but with any theorems were expressed in a form suitable for forward or backward chaining.
I had also done experiments with classical automatic techniques such as model elimination, which, although pathetic compared with automatic provers of that era, 
was good enough to troll users on the <code>hol-info</code> mailing list.
Soon I had provoked John Harrison to build a superior version of ME for HOL Light.
Later, Joe Hurd built his <code>metis</code> superposition prover, which found its way into HOL4.
Not to be outdone, Tobias made Isabelle’s simplifier the best in its class incorporating a number of sophisticated refinements, including some great ideas from Nqthm.</p>

<p>Twenty years from the start of this chronology we now had 
several reasonably mature and powerful systems, including Isabelle/ZF, Isabelle/HOL, 
multiple versions of the HOL system, and Coq (now Rocq).<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Many of them used <a href="https://proofgeneral.github.io/">Proof General</a>, 
a common user interface for tactic-based proof assistants
based on the Emacs editor.
And we had 100MHz machines, some with 64MB of memory!
We were ready to do big things.</p>

<p>During this period, I did a lot of work on the 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JCS-1998-61-205">verification of cryptographic protocols</a>, 
also <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2105.06319">here</a>.
These secure Internet connections and other network communications;
they are valuable when you need to know who is on the other end 
and need to keep messaging secure from eavesdropping and tampering.
Among the protocols investigated were the ubiquitous TLS
and the late, unlamented SET protocol.
These proofs were not at the level of code or bits;
buggy implementations could and did emerge.</p>

<p>In 2005, the big thing that caught everyone’s eye
was <a href="https://rdcu.be/eSgTy">George Gonthier’s formalisation</a> (in Coq) 
of the Four Colour Theorem.
Most educated people had heard of the theorem already, 
and its history is fascinating:
numerous proofs had been attempted and rejected since the mid 19th century.
The 1977 proof by Appel and Haken was questioned 
because it relied on a lot of ad-hoc computer code.
Suddenly, despite the still unwelcome involvement of computers, 
no one could doubt the theorem anymore.</p>

<p>At the opposite extreme was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1112/S1461157000000449">my own formalisation</a> of Gödel’s proof of the relative consistency of the axiom of choice in Isabelle/ZF.
This was the apex of my ZF work, technically difficult but incomprehensible to most people.
My early dream of having a formalisation of the Prime Number Theorem came true in 2005
when Jeremy Avigad <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0509025">formalised</a> the theorem in Isabelle.
Somewhat later, John Harrison <a href="https://rdcu.be/eShga">formalised a different proof</a> in HOL Light.
And there was much more. Without any doubt, our systems were capable of serious mathematics.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most consequential achievement of this period was Mike Gordon’s collaboration 
with Graham Birtwistle and Anthony Fox to <a href="https://rdcu.be/eShzn">verify the ARM6 processor</a>.
Graham, at Leeds, formally specified the instruction set architecture of the processor 
(i.e. the assembly language level), while Mike and Anthony at Cambridge verified the implementation of that architecture in terms of lower level hardware components.
Eventually a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3290384">number of other processors</a> were similarly specified, 
and some verified.
Without any doubt, our systems were capable of serious verification.</p>

<p>Despite of the focus on applications in this section, 
system development continued in the run-up to 2005.
I am only familiar with Isabelle development, but they were tremendous:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>Isar language</em> for structured, legible proofs (a break with the LCF idea that the top level must be a programming language, i.e. ML)</li>
  <li><em>axiomatic type classes</em>, providing principled overloading</li>
  <li><em>counterexample finders</em>: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SEFM.2004.1347524">Quickcheck</a> and Refute (now Nitpick)</li>
  <li><em>code generation</em> from the executable fragment of higher-order logic, and reflection</li>
  <li><em>sledgehammer</em> was under active development, but only ready a couple of years later.</li>
</ul>

<p>With so much going on, it’s not surprising that our community started doing big things, 
and other people were starting to notice.</p>

<h3 id="20052015-the-first-landmarks">2005–2015: The first landmarks</h3>

<p>I am not used to phone calls from journalists:
for most of my career, formal verification has been seen as (at best) niche.
But the journalist on the end of the line was asking for information about
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/1629575.1629596">seL4</a>, 
the first operating system kernel ever to be formally verified.
Tools for extended static checking were by then able to detect a lot of program faults, but the seL4 verification claimed to cover <em>full functional correctness</em>: 
the code did exactly what it was supposed to do.
There is now an <a href="https://sel4.systems/">entire ecosystem</a> around seL4, 
backed by a million lines of Isabelle/HOL proofs.</p>

<p>People have wanted to verify compilers 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-10886-6">since forever</a>.
The task of fully specifying a programming language, target machine 
and compiler already seemed impossible, let alone providing the actual proof.
With <a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-01238879v1">CompCert</a>, that task was finally fulfilled, for a large subset of the C language:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What sets CompCert apart from any other production
compiler, is that it is formally verified, using machine-
assisted mathematical proofs, to be exempt from mis-
compilation issues. In other words, the executable code
it produces is proved to behave exactly as specified by
the semantics of the source C program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A seemingly intractable problem with compiler verification 
was how to translate your verified compiler into machine code.
For example, CompCert is mostly written in Rocq, 
which is then extracted to OCaml code. 
The OCaml compiler had never been verified, 
so how do we know that its compiled code is correct?</p>

<p><a href="https://cakeml.org/">CakeML</a> squares this circle through <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3437992.3439915">bootstrapping</a>.
CakeML translates from its source language (a dialect of ML) 
to assembly language, accompanied by a proof that the two pieces of code are equivalent.
This work was an outgrowth of the ARM6 project mentioned earlier.
<a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~myreen/">Magnus Myreen</a> 
had <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-765.html">developed techniques</a> for
automatically and verifiably translating between assembly language 
and recursive functions in higher-order logic, in both directions.
At the start of the bootstrapping process, 
a tiny compiler was written in pure logic and proved correct.
It was now safe to run this compiler 
and use its tiny language to implement a bigger language.
This process ultimately produced a verified compiler in both source form 
and assembly language form, with a proof of their equivalence, 
as well as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2364527.2364545">verified extraction</a> from higher-order logic to ML.</p>

<p>The end of the decade also saw impressive results in the formalisation of mathematics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://rdcu.be/eSZwv">Gödel second incompleteness theorem</a>, by yours truly, in Isabelle/HOL</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7012">Central Limit Theorem</a>, by Avigad et al., ditto</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://github.com/flyspeck/flyspeck">Flyspeck</a> project, by Hales et al., in Isabelle/HOL and HOL Light</li>
  <li>the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2480359.2429071">odd order theorem</a>, in Rocq</li>
</ul>

<p>Without going into details here, each of these was an ambitious proof, combining in various ways deep mathematics, intricate technicalities and sheer bulk.
Our community was proud of our achievements.
We were no longer a joke, but what exactly we were good for?</p>

<h3 id="20152025-breaking-through">2015–2025: Breaking through</h3>

<p>This period brought something astonishing: 
acceptance of proof assistants by many mainstream mathematicians.
I mostly recall mathematicians regardeding computers 
with something close to contempt. 
Even some logicians regarded formalised mathematics as impossible, 
somehow fixating on Gödel’s incompleteness or that notorious proof of 1+1=2 on page 360.
Regarding my work formalising big chunks of ZF theory, 
someone commented “only for finite sets obviously”.</p>

<p>My EU-funded <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/Grants/Alexandria/">ALEXANDRIA</a> project started in 2017. 
My team formalised more advanced and deep mathematics 
than I ever imagined to be possible, using Isabelle/HOL.
(I have told this story in an <a href="https://lawrencecpaulson.github.io/2023/08/31/ALEXANDRIA_finished.html">earlier blogpost</a>.)
But ALEXANDRIA alone would not have had much of an impact on mathematical practice.
What made a difference was <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/what-is-the-xena-project/">Kevin Buzzard</a> and his enthusiastic, tireless promotion of the idea of formalising mathematics 
in <a href="https://lean-lang.org/">Lean</a>.
He recruited a veritable army.
I got the idea of blogging from him, but my blog has not had the same impact. Where are you guys?</p>

<p>In 2022, for the first time ever, machine assistance 
was <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/lte-final/">used to confirm</a> 
brand-new mathematics that a Fields Medallist had concerns about.
Mathematicians will for the most part continue to work the way they always have done, 
but proof assistants are getting better and better, 
and they will encroach more and more on the everyday practice of mathematics.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Isabelle continued to be useful for verification.
I was amazed to hear that that the systems group here in the Computer Lab 
had completed a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3133933">major verification</a> using Isabelle/HOL.
The tradition is for systems people to despise verification tools 
for sweeping aside ugly things like overflow and floating point errors, even though they no longer do.
Besides, a research tool like Isabelle is only used by its own developer and his students.
Times were changing.</p>

<p>Isabelle is also one of the several proof assistants involved 
with <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/">CHERI</a>, a large-scale project
reviving the old idea of <em>capabilities</em> to ensure security at the hardware level.
CHERI has produced numerous publications, some of which 
(for example <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-99336-8_7">this one</a> 
and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SP40000.2020.00055">that one</a>) describe very large proofs.
These concern the design and implementation of novel computer architectures 
with fine-grained memory protection, 
and a design process with formal verification at its heart.</p>

<p>Isabelle has also contributed to the design of <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>, 
a relatively new platform for web applications.
By subjecting the WebAssembly specification to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3167082">formal scrutiny</a>, 
Conrad Watt was able to identify a number of issues in time for them to be fixed.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to mention this announcement (4 December 2025) by Dominic Mulligan of Amazon Web Services (AWS):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over three years, lots of hard work, and 260,000 lines of Isabelle/HOL code later, the Nitro Isolation Engine (NIE) <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-graviton-5-cpu-amazon-ec2">is finally announced</a> alongside Graviton5.</p>

  <p>Working with our colleagues in EC2, Annapurna, and AWS AppSec, we have been working to rearchitect the Nitro system for Graviton5+ instances around a small, trusted separation kernel. Written from scratch in Rust, we have additionally specified the behaviour of a core subset of the Nitro Isolation Engine kernel, verified that the implementation meets this specification, and additionally proved deep security properties—confidentiality and integrity—of the implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am biased, since I’ve been working with AWS on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqqKi3E-oG8">this exact project</a>, but it’s a big deal.
AWS has been using formal verification tools for a considerable time.
A notable earlier accomplishment was verify tricky but efficient algorithms using HOL Light,
<a href="https://www.amazon.science/blog/formal-verification-makes-rsa-faster-and-faster-to-deploy">speeding up</a>
RSA encryption by a massive factor.</p>

<h3 id="20252035-becoming-ordinary">2025–2035 Becoming ordinary</h3>

<p>A couple of months ago, Apple announced new models in their iPhone range,
but no crowds formed around Apple Stores.
They once did: the iPhone was once regarded as revolutionary.
Now, smartphones are a commodity, which is the final stage of a new technology.
Formal verification is not ordinary yet. 
But it’s coming: more and more software will be seen as too important to develop any other way, 
as is already the case for hardware.</p>

<h3 id="postscript">Postscript</h3>

<p>I am well aware that there is much outstanding work adjacent to that
described here, e.g. using other interactive tools, such as Nqthm and ACL2,
PVS and Agda, and much else using Rocq. There have been amazing advances 
in the broader theorem proving world, also in model checking,
SAT/SMT solving and their applications to extended static checking of software.
I have related what I personally know.
And remember, the point of this post is not (simply) to boast 
but to demonstrate the progress of our research community, 
so the more achievements the better. Feel free to add some in the comments!</p>

<p>This post does not prove anything about other fields of science, 
such as solid-state physics, molecular biology or mathematics.
But it’s fair to assume that such fields have not been idle either. 
People have proved Fermat’s Last Theorem and the Poincaré conjecture, 
and settled more obscure questions such as the projective plane of order 10.
People have located the remains of King Richard III, who died in 1485, 
excavating and positively identifying the body by its DNA.
People have linked a piece of bloody cloth to Adolf Hitler and diagnosed  that he had a specific genetic condition.
The immensely complex James Webb Space Telescope
was successfully deployed;
it is now revealing secrets about the early Universe.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder about the motives of those who claim that science is moribund. 
Do they have political aims, or just unrealistic expectations?
Were they expecting time travel or some sort of warp drive?
People need to remember that movies are fiction.</p>

      GNU Unifont is part of the GNU Project.
      <span>This page contains the latest release of
      GNU Unifont, with glyphs for every printable code point
      in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP).</span>
      The BMP occupies the first 65,536 code points of the Unicode space,
      denoted as U+0000..U+FFFF. There is also growing coverage of the
      Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), in the range U+010000..U+01FFFF,
      and of Michael Everson's ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) with
      Rebecca Bettencourt's Under-CSUR additions.
    </p>
    <h3>Commercial Use</h3>
    <p>
      A user has asked if GNU Unifont can be used with commercial
      (non-free) software.  The answer is yes.  The GNU Font Embedding
      Exception and the SIL OFL allow for that.  See the next section
      for details.  The main purpose of the licensing is to require
      derivative fonts that others create to be released to the public
      under the same licensing terms, not to prohibit the use of those
      fonts with certain software.  Thus, preserving the license terms
      in derivative fonts provides a public benefit.  The licenses also
      provide acknowledgement of previous Unifont contributors for their
      volunteer work.
    </p>
    <h3>Copyright, Derivative Works, and License</h3>
    <p>
      Thousands of Unifont glyphs are creations of individual Unifont
      contributors; those glyphs enjoy copyright protections of various
      degrees.  Some of those contributions are letter forms of established
      alphabets while others are icon (symbol) designs such as the many
      animal icons which, as artistic designs, have even stronger
      international protections.  See for example this memorandum of
      applicable laws of Berne Union member country Germany (where
      Unifont was created):
      <a href="https://unifoundry.com/210205_Unifoundry_Memorandum.pdf" target="_blank">
      Unifont Copyright Protections</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Derivative variants of Unifont are permitted under the terms of
      the dual license: GNU GPLv2+ with the GNU Font Embedding Exception
      and the SIL Open Font License version 1.1.  These are free licenses.
      The remainder of this section provides details.
    </p>
    <p>
      These font files are licensed under the GNU General Public License,
      either Version 2 or (at your option) a later version, with the exception
      that embedding the font in a document does not in itself constitute a
      violation of the GNU GPL.  The full terms of the license are in
      <a href="https://unifoundry.com/LICENSE.txt" target="_blank"> LICENSE.txt</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As of Unifont version 13.0.04, the fonts are dual-licensed under
      the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1 and the GNU GPL 2+ with
      the GNU font embedding exception.  The SIL OFL is available at
      <a href="https://unifoundry.com/OFL-1.1.txt" target="_blank"> OFL-1.1.txt</a>.

    <p>
      On Windows or Mac OS X, unzip the .ttf.zip file or download the
      uncompressed .ttf file and copy the font to your Fonts folder.
      On Microsoft Windows, this folder is located under the Windows
      folder on your main disk.
      On a Mac, this is located under the Library folder on your main disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For best appearance on a Mac in a Terminal window, select Terminal from
      the menu, then Preferences.  A Settings window will appear.  Make sure
      that you're on the Text tab in that window.  Then make sure that the
      "Antialias text" box is checked.  The OpenType version of the font should
      then look fine at point sizes of 12pt and larger.  The font won't look
      very legible in a Mac Terminal window unless you select this antialias option.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Note:</b> BDF, PCF, and OpenType files contain dimension and spacing
      information for each glyph in a font. Some font rendering engines ignore
      this glyph information that the font file provides. This is especially
      true of rendering engines designed to handle monospace fonts.
      Unifont will not display all glyphs correctly with such software.
      The BDF font follows BDF version 2.1 (not version 2.2) because the
      the X Window System standardized on version&nbsp;2.1.
      The PSF&nbsp;1 version of Unifont <i>is</i> a monospace font but is
      limited to 512 glyphs, and is only of use with font rendering engines
      that support more than 256 glyphs in a console frame buffer font.

    </p>
    <h3>Unifont Limitations</h3>
    <p>
      Unifont only stores one glyph per printable Unicode code point.
      This means that complex scripts with special forms for letter
      combinations including consonant combinations and floating vowel
      marks such as with Indic scripts (Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil, etc.)
      or letters that change shape depending upon their position in a word
      (Indic and Arabic scripts) will not render well in Unifont.
      In those cases, Unifont is only suitable as a font of last resort.
      Users wishing to properly render such complex scripts should
      use full OpenType fonts that faithfully display such alternate
      forms.
    </p>
    <h3>Drawing New Glyphs</h3>
    <p>
      If you would like to contribute glyphs, please email unifoundry at
      gmail in advance (not spelled out because of spammers).  Several
      contributors are working on new glyphs, and it would be unfortunate
      to have multiple persons drawing the same glyphs.

    </h3>
    <p>
      The People's Republic of China (PRC) has a set of 15-by-16 pixel
      Chinese glyphs for Unicode Plane&nbsp;2 and Plane&nbsp;3.  However,
      those glyphs are copyrighted and licensed for sale by the Government
      of the PRC, <i>and thus they cannot be used in a free font.</i>
      If you happen to have any of those copyrighted 15-by-16 pixel glyphs,
      please do not send them for inclusion.  Unifont includes many glyphs
      in this range, drawn by Chinese and Japanese volunteers.
      More are planned for the future.

    <h3>Release Notes</h3>
    <p>
      This latest release is part of the GNU Project.  You can view the

    </p>
    <p>
      The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the
      Unicode Plane&nbsp;0 range is 65,536 code points
      minus the 2,048 surrogate pair code points,
      minus the 6,400 Private Use Area code points,
      minus the two noncharacters (U+FFFE and U+FFFF).
      This amounts to 57,086 assignable code points
      apart from the Private Use Area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theoretical maximum number of printable glyphs in the
      higher Unicode planes is 65,534; the last two code points
      in each plane are reserved as noncharacters.

            Following a suggestion by Ho-Seok Ee, the
            <code>hangul-base.hex</code> file that contains the
            Johab 6/3/1 glyphs for Hangul syllable formation now begins
            at code point U+E000.  This allows building a Unifont variant
            with that entire Hangul johab glyph set in the Uniode Plane&nbsp;0
            Private Use Area (PUA)  using the command
            "<code>make PUA=plane00/hangul/hangul-base.hex</code>".
            in the font directory.  Unifont builds have traditionally
            left the PUA available for CSUR/UCSUR glyphs, which is still
            the default; see below for a discussion of the CSUR/UCSUR glyphs.

    <h3>Contributing Glyphs</h3>
    <p>
      <img width="35" height="35" src="https://unifoundry.com/unifont/16-by-16-grid.png" alt="16 by 16 pixel sample grid">
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like to contribute glyphs to the GNU Unifont effort,
      you can download the associated PNG file from the tables above
      (SMP and CSUR need additions). Then draw new glyphs in the 16-by-16
      pixel area that is inside the inner box you see in the image on
      the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      When done, erase the surrounding inner box and ruler lines around the
      inner box.  You can then save the file as a monochrome bitmap image.
      Then convert the .png file into a .hex file with the unipng2hex utility
      in the source tarball. Or you can just email the .png file to me as
      a contribution to this effort and I will do the conversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Why is the outer grid so much larger than the 16-by-16 pixel
      inner box?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Because in a future version, unipng2hex, unihex2png, and other
      utilities should be able to handle larger glyphs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table below shows the current state of completion of the Supplementary
      Multilingual Plane (Plane 1). Any range in the table that doesn't have
      a green background has missing glyphs. To see which scripts are in a
      particular range, consult the "Supplementary Multilingual Plane" list
      in the Current Coverage section below.  The more red a range appears
      in the table below, the more glyphs are missing from that range.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Coverage</h3>
    <p>Links in this section reference the first block of 256 glyphs
       where a script begins.</p>
    <p>
      The list below shows the scripts that are in the Unicode

      *Note: Scripts such as Cuneiform, Egyptian
      Hieroglyphs, and Bamum Supplement will not be drawn on a 16-by-16
      pixel grid. There are plans to draw these scripts on a 32-by-32
      pixel grid in the future.
    </p>

      Plane 14 has two scripts, both of which Unifont covers:

    Initially I just posted my additions to <b>Roman Czyborra's</b> original
    unifont.hex file.  Then in mid-January 2008, his website went down.
    So I started posting font updates here. Roman has encouraged me to continue
    with my additions.
    </p>
    <p>
    Roman's website is now back online, and you can read his
    Unifont description and motivation for its creation on his website,
    along with his archive of Unifont's changes:
    <a href="http://czyborra.com/unifont" target="_blank">

    <h3>TrueType Font Generation</h3>
    <p>
    <b>Luis Alejandro González Miranda</b> wrote a cool combination of scripts to
    convert GNU Unifont from .hex format into FontForge .sfd format, then to
    have FontForge convert this to a TrueType outline font (see the Unicode
    Utilities web page on this site for more information).  Pixels are drawn
    as outlined squares, so they scale to all point sizes.  This works well with
    GNOME; I haven't tried it with any other Unix windowing environment.
    I've removed the OpenType SBIT font link from this page because the outline
    font is much more flexible.
    </p>
    <p>
    Luis has given me permission to modify his scripts to convert the latest
    GNU Unifont versions to TrueType.  I've modified his original scripts to
    handle Unicode combining characters.
    </p>

    <h3>JIS X 0213 Kanji</h3>
    <h4>Jiskan16</h4>
    <p>
    Unifont 12.1.02 added Japanese BDF and TrueType versions,
    <code>unifont_jp</code>.  This replaced over 10,000 ideographs
    in the default Unifont font with Japanese kanji from the 16 × 16
    pixel Jiskan 16 font.  The font is available in two files,
    corresponding to the two planes in JIS X 0213.  Both files are
    in the public domain.
    </p>
    <p>
    The comments in the BDF source font files (downloadable from the
    <a href="https://unifoundry.com/japanese/index.html" target="_blank">Japanese Fonts</a>
    page) credit the following contributors (in order): Toshiyuki Imamura,
    HANATAKA Shinya, Taichi Kawabata, Koichi Yasuoka, TOYOSHIMA Masayuki,
    Kazuo Koike, and SATO Yasunao.
    </p>
    <p>
    For the Unifont release, the glyphs from the two JIS X 0213 planes
    were converted into Unifont .hex files and mapped to code points
    in Unicode's Plane&nbsp;0 and Plane&nbsp;2 for Unifont.  The result
    provides complete representation of the kanji in JIS X 0213 in a free
    Unicode font.
    </p>
    <h4>Izumi16</h4>
    <p>
    Unifont 12.1.03 replaced the Jiskan16 glyphs with the public domain
    Izumi16 glyphs.  These provide improvements on the earlier Jiskan16
    glyphs.
    </p>

    <h3>Wen Quan Yi: Spring of Letters
    (文泉驛 / 文泉驿)</h3>
    <p>
    The original Unifont CJK glyphs were replaced by new CJK glyphs from
    version 1.1 of <b>Qianqian Fang's</b> Unibit font. The Unibit font
    began as a combination of the original GNU Unifont glyphs and a basic
    CJK bitmap font placed in the public domain by the People's Republic
    of China.  It adopted GNU Unifont's scheme of 8x16 and 16x16
    glyphs.  Qianqian Fang and many others then added about 10,000
    more glyphs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Qianqian states in the Unibit distribution:
    <i>"The entire CJK Unified Ideographics (U4E00-U9FA5) and CJK Unified
    Ideographics Extension A(U3400-U4DB5) blocks were replaced by
    high-quality glyphs from China National Standard GB19966-2005
    (public domain)."</i>  Wen Quan Yi volunteeers then edited thousands
    of these characters.  Qianqian also drew the new 22 CJK ideographs
    in the range U+9FA6..U+9FBB that appear in GNU Unifont.
    </p>
    <p>Wen Quan Yi (WQY) means "spring of letters," as in a spring of water.
    This is an interesting choice of words, as the British spelling of
    "font" is "fount" (but still pronounced "font"). See his website for
    more details:
    <a href="http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi" target="_blank">
    http://wqy.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/enindex.cgi</a>, or in Chinese at
    <a href="http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi" target="_blank">
    http://wenq.org/wqy2/index.cgi</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The following code points in the latest unifont.hex file are
    taken from the WQY Unibit font (with my additions to complete the
    U+3000..U+33FF range, particularly the missing Hiragana, Katakana,
    and Kanji), including glyphs updated by the Wen Quan Yi volunteers
    and other modifications as part of the Unifont font:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>U+2E80..U+2EFF: CJK Radicals Supplement</li>
      <li>U+2F00..U+2FDF: Kangxi Radicals</li>
      <li>U+2FF0..U+2FFF: Ideographic Description Characters</li>
      <li>U+3000..U+303F: CJK Symbols and Punctuation</li>
      <li>U+31C0..U+31EF: CJK Strokes</li>
      <li>U+3200..U+32FF: Enclosed CJK Letters and Months</li>
      <li>U+3300..U+33FF: CJK Compatibility</li>
      <li>U+3400..U+4DBF: CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A</li>
      <li>U+4E00..U+9FBF: CJK Unified Ideographs</li>
      <li>U+F900..U+FAFF: CJK Compatibility Ideographs</li>
      <li>U+FF00..U+FF60: Fullwidth Forms of Roman Letters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Qianqian has given his okay to add these CJK glyphs from the
    Wen Quan Yi project into GNU Unifont.  Likewise, I've told him
    to incorporate any glyphs he wants from my contributions to GNU
    Unifont into his Unibit font.  In October 2020, Qianqian Fang also
    granted permission to apply the SIL Open Font License version 1.1
    to Wen Quan Yi glyphs in Unifont as a dual license.
    </p>

    <h3>What's Next?</h3>
    <p>
      All of the glyphs in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane that could
      easily be drawn in a 16-by-16 pixel grid have been drawn as of the
      Unifont 9.0.01 release.  There are no plans to draw Tangut.
      A number of ConScript Unicode Registry (CSUR) scripts remain to be drawn.
      If you are interested in contributing glyphs to this
      effort, please contact me. All new contributions must be licensed under
      the same license as the rest of Unifont (in a nutshell, GPL 2+ with the
      GNU font embedding exception and the SIL OFL 1.1).
    </p>
    <p>
      With the great work done by contributors in providing ConScript Unicode
      Registry (CSUR) glyphs, they are available in font files that have
      "_csur" in their name.

        <section id="intro">
            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>We built a complete VR setup from scratch to let rats play DOOM. The system includes a motion-tracked treadmill ball, a panoramic headset, an input trigger, and a reward circuit. All hardware and software components are open sourced, including 3D-printable designs, circuit diagrams, firmware, and control software.</p>
            <p>The first version (v1) was built in New York by <a href="#team">Viktor</a>, who trained rats to walk through a corridor in DOOM using a simpler rig. That version was featured on Vice and PC Gamer. After moving back home, the project was paused. Public interest reignited development, leading to v2, a more advanced and modular version built in collaboration with electrical engineer <a href="#team">Sándor Makra</a>. <a href="#team">Akos Blaschek</a> later assisted significantly in documenting the project for open-sourcing, aiming to enable others to replicate and build upon this work. Key metallic components were designed and sourced in collaboration with <a href="https://szurwinkft.hu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SZURWIN KFT</a>.</p>

            <h3>V1</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>We reached the point of rat habituation but didn’t start training. Our rats (Todd, Kojima, Gabe) aged out before full testing. The setup works, but behavioral validation is pending.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="hardware">
            <h2>Hardware</h2>
            <p>The hardware is a comprehensive VR rig designed for rodents. It consists of a motion-tracked sphere that captures the rat's movements, a custom-built trigger for in-game actions, a curved panoramic screen for visual immersion, and an automated reward system that dispenses sugar water to reinforce behavior. All these components are mounted on a modular aluminum frame, creating a complete, self-contained environment for the rat to interact with the game.</p>

            <article>
                <h3>Visual Interface</h3>
                <p>The headset wraps around the rat’s head with a foldable AMOLED screen. It maximizes immersion without obstructing whisker space. The screen supports Full HD resolution.</p>
                <p>The headset frame also integrates several sensory components: two small air nozzles are positioned near the left and right whiskers, capable of delivering targeted air puffs on command (e.g., signaling wall collisions in-game). The frame provides a secure mounting point for the reward system's dispenser tube, placing it near the rat's mouth. Additionally, the design includes placeholders for miniature speakers near each ear, intended for future implementation of stereo audio cues.</p>

                <h3>Locomotion</h3>
                <p>Movement is captured via a free-spinning ball under the rat. Rotary sensors track displacement and convert it into game motion. The ball can also be driven by motors.</p>
                <p>These motors are used during training to roll the ball and simulate movement paths before a reward. This guides the rat on where to go, helping form movement-action associations. Like the trigger, this allows for programmatic training sequences with minimal initial input from the animal.</p>

                <h3>Trigger Input</h3>
                <p>The shooting input is a custom-built hand-operated lever. Rats pull it with their paws to fire. The lever is held in place by small springs, encased in a 3D-printed housing. It includes a rotary encoder to detect motion and a stepper motor to actuate it.</p>
                <p>The motor allows programmatic control—pulling the lever to demonstrate shooting. This enables training by pairing visual cues with mechanical motion, reinforcing the association before the rat initiates the action on its own.</p>

                <h3>Reward System</h3>
                <p>Positive in-game actions trigger a liquid reward: sugar water delivered through a precise dispensing mechanism. The system consists of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mixer: Continuously stirs the sugar solution to maintain even concentration</li>
                    <li>Pump + Pressure Sensor: Keeps the line under constant pressure</li>
                    <li>Solenoid Valve: Magnetic valve that opens to release exact 10 µL doses</li>
                    <li>Dispenser: Positioned near the mouth for easy access</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This setup ensures accurate, repeatable reward delivery with minimal delay. The reward is synchronized with game events to reinforce desired behaviors.</p>
                <figure>

            </article>

            <article>
                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>The current system assumes basic rat mobility and grooming behavior. Fine-tuning might be needed for rats of different sizes or temperaments. Trigger placement and reward tube flow may need calibration per subject.</p>
            </article>
        </section>

        <section id="software">
            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>The setup is controlled through a modular Python system. The main entry point is <code>arena_scenario.py</code>, which runs the full control loop.</p>
            <p>The system includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Motion capture: Reads movement from optical flow sensors mounted around the treadmill ball.</li>
                <li>Locomotion control: Drives the ball motors to guide the rat during training.</li>
                <li>Trigger input: Reads lever pulls, detects voluntary shooting actions.</li>
                <li>Reward delivery: Dispenses precise 10 μL sugar water rewards via a controlled solenoid valve and maintains constant line pressure.</li>
                <li>DOOM integration: Interfaces with a modified ViZDoom environment for real-time closed-loop behavior.</li>
                <li>Training logic: Enforces demonstrations and delivers rewards based on game state and rat behavior.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/csiki/rat_vr2" target="_blank">View the Project on GitHub</a></p>
            <p>The software runs on a PC and communicates with a Raspberry Pi via TCP sockets. The Pi handles real-time sensor reading, ball actuation, and reward control; the PC processes the sensor data, runs the game, and sends high-level commands to the Pi.</p>
            <p>All major components—movement tracking, ball driving, trigger detection, and reward control—can be operated manually or in closed-loop mode. All control parameters (e.g., motor speeds, reward volumes) are set in Python code.</p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>There’s no in-built calibration suite. Users must validate sensor alignment and reward timing manually. Some microcontroller firmwares might require tuning based on hardware tolerances.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The rats successfully learned to navigate the virtual environment and trigger the shooting mechanism. Habituation took approximately two weeks per rat. While advanced training wasn't completed due to time constraints, initial data showed promising engagement with the system.</p>
            <figure>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>Full behavioral validation requires longer training periods. Cross-subject variability wasn't extensively studied. The impact of prolonged VR exposure on rat well-being needs further research.</p>

I'll let Virginia tell the rest of the story:</p><p><em>As I recall there were 16 colors: white, black, gray, RGB, CMY, and the dark versions of those colors—so dark red, dark green, dark blue, dark cyan, dark magenta, dark yellow, dark gray. (Normal people might call some of these colors teal, navy, burgundy, etc.) Much of the user interface was black lines on a white background and used 2 shades of gray to create 3-D buttons: 'affordances.'</em></p><p><em>We designed a long list of themes using those 16 colors. No one today seems interested in 'Bordeaux' or 'Tweed' or 'Arizona.' We were covering all the bases, hoping to come up with color schemes that would appeal to a broad range of people. 'Hot Dog Stand' used bright yellow and red.</em></p><p><em>I have been mystified about why that particular theme causes so much comment in the media. Maybe it's partly the catchy name. (Never underestimate the power of a good brand name!)</em></p><p><em>I do remember some discussion about whether we should include it, and some snarky laughter. But it was not intended as a joke. It was not inspired by any hot dog stands, and it was not included as an example of a bad interface—although it was one. It was just a garish choice, in case somebody out there liked ugly bright red and yellow.</em></p><p><em>The 'Fluorescent' theme was also pretty ugly, but it didn't have a catchy name, so I've never heard anything about it.</em></p><p><em>I'm really glad that 'Hot Dog Stand' has entertained so many people for so many years.</em></p><p><em>With regards to design historians everywhere,</em></p><p><em>Virginia Howlett</em></p><p>As delightfully garish as Hot Dog Stand is, Howlett is right that it's far from the only eye searing theme in the Windows 3.1 collection.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">A security researcher said Home Depot exposed access to its internal systems for a year after one of its employees published a private access token online, likely by mistake. The researcher found the exposed token and tried to privately alert Home Depot to its security lapse but was ignored for several weeks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exposure is now fixed after TechCrunch contacted company representatives last week.</p>







<p>Security researcher <a rel="nofollow" href="https://benzimmermann.dev/">Ben Zimmermann</a> told TechCrunch that, in early November, he found a published GitHub access token belonging to a Home Depot employee, which was exposed sometime in early 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When he tested the token, Zimmermann said that it granted access to hundreds of private Home Depot source code repositories hosted on GitHub and allowed the ability to modify their contents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The researcher said the keys allowed access to Home Depot’s cloud infrastructure, including its order fulfillment and inventory management systems, and code development pipelines, among other systems. Home Depot has hosted much of its developer and engineering infrastructure on GitHub since 2015, according to a <a href="https://github.com/customer-stories/homedepot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">customer profile on GitHub’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Zimmermann said he sent several emails to Home Depot but didn’t hear back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nor did he get a response from Home Depot’s chief information security officer, Chris Lanzilotta, after sending a message over LinkedIn.</p>

<p>Zimmermann told TechCrunch that he has disclosed several similar exposures in recent months to companies, which have thanked him for his findings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Home Depot is the only company that ignored me,” he said.</p>

<p>Given that Home Depot does not have a way to report security flaws, such as a vulnerability disclosure or bug bounty program, Zimmermann contacted TechCrunch in an effort to get the exposure fixed.</p>







<p>When reached by TechCrunch on December 5, Home Depot spokesperson George Lane acknowledged receipt of our email but did not respond to follow-up emails asking for comment. The exposed token is no longer online, and the researcher said the token’s access was revoked soon after our outreach.</p>

<p>We also asked Lane if Home Depot has the technical means, such as logs, to determine if anyone else used the token during the months it was left online to access any of Home Depot’s internal systems. We did not hear back.</p>

The organisation have announced that a group of 165 id workers have just voted to unionise, adding to the ranks of the 300 ZeniMax quality assurance staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">unionised back in 2023</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the CWA's press release, Microsoft have already recognised this latest union - which is made up of "developers, artists, programmers, and more" - in accordance with the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/">labour neutrality agreement</a> the two parties agreed in 2022.</p>
<p>"The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives," said id Software producer and CWA organising committee member Andrew Willis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, id lead services programmer and CWA committee member Chris Hays specifically cited remote staff not being dragged into the office as a reason behind the push for representation. "Remote work isn’t a perk," he said. "It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being."</p><p>The CWA release also cited "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass industry layoffs</a>, sudden periods of crunch time, and unfair pay" as part of the impetus behind a wider push towards unionisation among devs across the industry this year, adding that the total of unionised workers across Microsoft's fiefdom is now "nearly 4,000" strong.</p>
<p>CWA president Ron Swaggerty added that the union "look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication these workers bring to every project."</p>

<p>Solidarity to these id Software workers.</p>

</div>


<p><strong>Google has made its ‘next generation brand typeface’, <em>Google Sans Flex</em>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Google+Sans+Flex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available for download </a>— under an open source <b>license</b>, which is welcome news.</strong></p>



<p>A modern sans serif font purpose-designed for use on screens and OSes, Google Sans Flex is a ground-up, multi-axis rebuild of the proprietary Google Sans font, by typographer David Berlow (of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_Bureau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Font Bureau</a> fame). </p>



<p>The “flex” in GS Flex is because it’s a variable font that is <em>“extremely flexible [with]&nbsp;variable axes&nbsp;for&nbsp;weight,&nbsp;width, optical size, slant, as well as an axis for rounded terminals” (as in terminals in letters, not command-line apps).”</em></p>



<p>Android and web developers will find the varied variable axes on offer a creative boon for “expressive” design work.</p>



<p>Changing system font is a simple way to give Ubuntu (or any other Linux) desktop a subtle new vibe without having to futz around with themes, icon packs or other eye-candy extras which substantially alter the stock experience: </p>


<div>
<figure><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?ssl=1"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="750" height="422" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?resize=750%2C422&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?resize=840%2C473&amp;ssl=1 840w, https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.omgubuntu.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/google-sans-flex-font-ubuntu.jpg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a><figcaption>Google Sans Flex as UI font on Ubuntu 25.10</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>However, Linux desktop environments don’t yet support doing anything <em>fancy</em> with variable fonts, beyond the basics. </p>



<p>Ergo, unlike on modern Android, you can’t toggle Dark Mode in GNOME or KDE with this font enabled to make it automatically adjust its GRAD axis to compensate for the optical thinning that typically occurs when white text is rendered against darker backgrounds.</p>



<p>It’s not a major drawback, and GS Flex works great as a competent, classy system UI font on Linux, especially on HiDPI displays with fractional scaling. For my tastes, Google Sans Flex has (like GNOME’s default Adwaita Sans font) more presence than the Ubuntu font. </p>



<p>Want to try it out? Google has released the font under the<strong> SIL Open Font License (OFL)</strong>, meaning you can modify, redistribute and use it in your own projects.</p>



<p>To get it: </p>



<ol start="1">
<li>Go to Google Fonts</li>



<li>Search for ‘Google Sans Flex’</li>



<li>Hit “Get Font” &gt; “Download All”</li>



<li>Extract the ZIP</li>



<li>Find the .ttf file inside and either:
<ul>
<li>Move it to <code>~/.local/share/fonts</code>; or</li>



<li>Install via your desktop’s font manager GUI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>Once installed it’ll be available to use/select in other apps, settings and so on. </p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2016/03/how-to-change-ubuntu-desktop-font">change UI font on Ubuntu</a> you can install the <em>GNOME Tweaks</em> tool and then open it, go to Appearance and set the UI font to <em>Google Sans Flex</em>. Although you may see variable options listed to pick from, GNOME will always render the ‘regular’ version. </p>

            <div><p><strong>The EESC has adopted an opinion pointing out that nuclear energy is an essential component of the clean energy mix which is needed to phase out fossil fuels. The Committee calls on the European Commission to include key regulatory and financial enablers in order to make the planned investment possible, and to enhance transparent dialogue with civil society.</strong></p><p>Nuclear energy plays and will continue to play a crucial role in decarbonising the European Union, says the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) in an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eesc.europa.eu/en/our-work/opinions-information-reports/opinions/nuclear-illustrative-programme-1">opinion</a> adopted at the December plenary session. This is particularly true given the fact that the EU needs to consolidate its strategic autonomy in the fields of energy and technology.</p><p>The EESC opinion, drawn up by rapporteur <strong>Dumitru Fornea</strong> and co-rapporteur <strong>Alena Mastantuono</strong>, assesses the European Commission’s 8th <em>Nuclear Illustrative Programme</em> (PINC), published in June 2025.</p><p>According to the Committee, nuclear energy is a key element in diversifying the EU’s energy supply because it delivers safe, reliable, low-carbon electricity. This ensures that the grid remains stable most of the time, regardless of the weather or time of day, with less pressure on systemic costs.</p><p>Nuclear energy can therefore play an important role in supporting the EU’s overall industrial transition as it bolsters resilience against supply disruptions while complementing renewables and reducing dependence on imported fuels. Against this backdrop, existing EU industries (such as steel, cement and chemicals) as well as new industries (data centres) can enjoy a constant stream of decarbonised electricity.</p><p>‘The European nuclear industry sustains more than 1.1 million jobs in the EU and is a significant economic sector with a major footprint in terms of jobs, supply chain capacity and advanced R&amp;D. It is a net-zero value chain based almost entirely in the EU,’ said <strong>Mr Fornea</strong>. ‘If we want to effectively move away from coal, we need accessible clean energy and funding for nuclear.’</p><h2><strong>Moving ahead with planned investment</strong></h2><p>In the opinion, the EESC regrets that the PINC does not propose any specific enablers, nor a real action plan, for the planned investment and urges the European Commission to include regulatory and financial measures. The goal is to enable investment in the sector, promote the development of innovative fuel cycle facilities and propose specific figures on the investment required by the nuclear fuel cycle.</p><p>‘We call on the Commission to put forward concrete measures to make the investment planned under the PINC possible,’ said <strong>Ms Mastantuono</strong>. ‘This is more necessary than ever given the geopolitical turmoil which is forcing the Union to develop EU-based capacities. For this reason, the nuclear value chain should be supported in terms of skills, research and the fuel supply chain.’</p><p>More specifically, the Committee recommends speeding up investment through specific measures such as a streamlined State aid process, access to EU cohesion funds, sustainable financing, licensing processes and faster decisions at EU and national level.</p><p>In addition, the EESC advises applying the same facilities to investment in nuclear energy as for renewables. These two energy sources are complementary and Member States are free to choose their own energy mix.</p><h2><strong>Keeping transparent dialogue open with civil society</strong></h2><p>Dialogue with civil society remains pivotal in building trust, ownership and societal acceptance, and could be more prominently addressed in the PINC. Moreover, there is no dedicated funding available for meaningful civil society participation.</p><p>On this matter, the EESC’s view is that decisions on new projects in the nuclear sector, including the development of new technologies, should be taken following the outcome of a broad and transparent dialogue with civil society on the technical, economic, social and environmental aspects.</p><p>Public engagement is essential to ensure that energy strategies reflect societal priorities (such as sustainability, reliability, land-use and responsibility for long-term waste management) and the early involvement of civil society through dialogue strengthens trust and legitimacy for both nuclear energy and other low-carbon technologies.</p><h2><strong>Background</strong> - <em><strong>Nuclear Illustrative Programme</strong></em><strong> (PINC)</strong></h2><p>According to article 40 of the Euratom Treaty, the European Commission is required to periodically publish a&nbsp;<a href="https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/nuclear-energy/nuclear-investment-needs_en"><em>Nuclear Illustrative Programme</em> (PINC)</a> and consult the EESC.&nbsp;The Commission Communication on the PINC issued in June&nbsp;2025&nbsp;has therefore been presented&nbsp;under this article for the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee.</p><p>The PINC provides a comprehensive overview of investment needs in nuclear energy, both fission and fusion, and encompasses all stages of the nuclear lifecycle. It also feeds into the debate on the role of nuclear energy in achieving carbon neutrality in the EU by 2050. In line with the highest level of nuclear safety, the PINC supports EU competitiveness, energy security and affordable energy prices.</p><p>In the 8th PINC, the Commission points out that nuclear energy requires significant investment, of around EUR 241 billion until 2050, both for lifetime extensions of existing reactors and the construction of new large-scale reactors. The Commission also says that additional investment is needed for Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), Advanced Modular Reactors (AMRs) and microreactors and in fusion for the longer-term future.</p></div>

                  <p>A new Japanese law is going into effect that could loosen the dominance of tech giants over smartphone services. It aims to bring users greater choice for app stores and more.</p>
        
                    
                  <p>Starting December 18, firms like Apple and Google will be prohibited from blocking third party app stores on iPhone and Android devices.</p>
        
                    
                  <p>The law also aims to loosen their grip on web browsers and search. The firms will now be required to give first-time users multiple choices for default services. This also applies when people update their operating system.</p>
        
                    
                  <p>The Fair Trade Commission says the changes will improve convenience by encouraging new market entrants.</p>
        
                    
                  <p>But some public comments released by the commission expressed concern that the legislation could undermine user security.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>curl experimented with using pthread_cancel to timeout async DNS requests and <a href="https://eissing.org/icing/posts/rip_pthread_cancel/">it blew up</a>. What else can we do?</p><p>Out of curiosity, I decided to review some alternatives and see how they work. My personal priorities are control over events; no background threads or signals or secret mechanisms.</p><h3 id="getaddrinfo">getaddrinfo</h3><p>The tried and true classic technique is to call <i>getaddrinfo</i> in a thread. Probably with more than one thread so you don’t get stuck behind a single slow request, but probably not boundless either. You can also use a separate process if you don’t use threads.</p><p>This is probably good enough for many uses.</p><h3 id="getaddrinfo-a">getaddrinfo_a</h3><p>glibc provides <i>getaddrinfo_a</i> which basically does the thread dance for you. Some of it. It comes with some caveats, and it’s distinctly non portable, and probably doesn’t mesh with your idea of an event loop. Passing.</p><h3 id="c-ares">c-ares</h3><p><a href="https://c-ares.org/">c-ares</a> is a standalone DNS library. It supports async queries via a threaded backend or an event driven system. I think the thread backend has the same issues, in that it uses a callback and then you need to push the results back into your application.</p><p>Alas, the event system uses lots of callbacks as well. This also includes some dire warnings in the documentation. “When the associated callback is called, it is called with a channel lock so care must be taken to ensure any processing is minimal to prevent DNS channel stalls.” Everyone knows the ideal callback just sets a flag, etc., but also everyone is inevitably tempted to do just one more thing, and hey look, it works fine, wait, why did it break. And thus I have a strong preference for library interfaces where you call into it, get some results, but any time you’re in your own code, you’re free to do what you want.</p><p>But worth a try. Based on the <a href="https://c-ares.org/docs.html">sample code</a> I wrote the quickest dirtiest demo I could.</p><details><summary>c-ares code</summary><pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

As in, there’s a getaddrinfo sample, but it incorporates a lot of other code that doesn’t seem to be public. The public header doesn’t actually expose a means to interface with an event loop. The code is meant to be integrated into a project, which is understandable and even advantageous, but it means no demo today.</p><h3 id="asr">asr</h3><p>The asr code was written for smtpd in OpenBSD. It doesn’t use threads and requires the caller to push events. Unfortunately, a portable version currently only exists in the <a href="https://github.com/OpenSMTPD/OpenSMTPD">OpenSMTPD</a> repo. On the plus side, it’s used as the basis for the libc resolver in OpenBSD, which means the “sample” code to replace <i>getaddrinfo</i> literally is getaddrinfo.c.</p><p>I rewrote the c-ares demo to use asr.

<p>At a time when many young people are using AI for personal and learning purposes, schools are trying to figure out what to teach about AI and how (find out more in this <a href="https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/young-people-and-teachers-use-of-generative-ai-to-support-literacy-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summer 2025 data about young people’s usage of AI in the UK</a>). One aspect of this is how technical we should get in explaining how AI works, particularly if we want to debunk naive views of the capabilities of the technology, such as that AI tools ‘think’. In this month’s research seminar, we found out how AI contexts can be added to current classroom maths to make maths more interesting and relevant while teaching the core concepts of AI.</p>





<p>At our <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/research-impact/research/seminars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computing education research seminar</a> in July, a group of researchers from the <a href="https://www.cammp.online/english/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAMMP</a> (Computational and Mathematical Modeling Program) research project shared their work:</p>



<ul>
<li>Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/martin.frank.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Frank</a>, Founder of CAMMP (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany).</li>



<li>Assistant Prof. Dr. <a href="https://www.plus.ac.at/mathematik/fachbereich/team/schoenbrodt-sarah/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Schönbrodt</a> (University of Salzburg, Austria)</li>



<li>Research Associate <a href="https://www.scc.kit.edu/en/staff/stephan.kindler.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephan Kindler</a> (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Germany)</li>
</ul>



<p>They talked about how maths already taught in secondary schools can be used to demystify AI. At first glance, this seems difficult to do, as it is often assumed that school-aged learners will not be able to understand how these systems work. This is especially the case for artificial neural networks, which are usually seen as a black box technology — they may be relatively easy to use, but it’s not as easy to understand how they work. Despite this, the Austrian and German team have developed a clear way to explain some of the fundamental elements of AI using school-based maths.</p>



<p>Sarah Schönbrodt started by challenging us to consider that learning maths is an essential part in developing AI skills, as:&nbsp;</p>



<ol>
<li>AI systems using machine learning are data-driven and are based on mathematics, especially statistics and data</li>



<li>Authentic machine learning techniques can be used to bring to life existing classroom maths concepts</li>



<li>Real and relevant problems and associated data are available for teachers to use</li>
</ol>



<h2><strong>A set of workshops for secondary maths classrooms</strong></h2>



<p>Sarah explained how the CAMMP team have developed a range of teaching and learning materials on AI (and beyond) with an overall goal to “allow students to solve authentic, real and relevant problems using mathematical modeling and computers”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She reflected that much of school maths is set in contexts that are abstract, and may not be very interesting or relevant to students. Therefore, introducing AI-based contexts, which are having a huge impact on society and students’ lives, is both an opportunity to make maths more engaging and also a way to demystify AI.</p>

Those same concepts could be taught using real-world AI contexts. (Slide from the researchers’ presentation.)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Workshops designed and researched by the team include contexts such as privacy in social networks to learn about decision trees, personalised Netflix recommendations to learn about k-nearest neighbour, word predictions to learn about N-Grams, and predicting life expectancy to learn about regression and neural networks.</p>



<h2><strong>Learning about classification models: traffic lights and the support vector machine</strong></h2>



<p>For the seminar, Sarah walked through the steps to learn about support vector machines. This is an upper secondary workshop for students aged 17 to 18 years old. The context of the lesson is an image problem — specifically, classifying the data representing the colours of a simplified traffic light system (two lights to start with) to work out if a traffic light is red or green.</p>



<p>She walked through each of the steps of the maths workshop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Plotting data points of two classes, the representation of green and red traffic lights</li>



<li>Finding a line that best separates the data points of both classes</li>



<li>Figuring out what best is</li>



<li>Classifying the data points in relation to the chosen (separating) line</li>



<li>Validating the model statistically to see if it is useful in classifying new data points, including using test data and creating a contingency table (also called a confusion matrix)</li>



<li>Discussing limitations, including social and ethical issues</li>



<li>Explaining how three traffic lights can be expressed as three-dimensional data by using planes</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the presentation, Sarah pointed out where the maths taught was linked to the Austrian and German mathematics curriculum.</p>

<h2><strong>Learning about social and ethical issues</strong></h2>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1232" height="682" src="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7.png 1232w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-300x166.png 300w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-500x277.png 500w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-768x425.png 768w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-800x443.png 800w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-450x249.png 450w, https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2025/12/image7-900x498.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 1232px) 100vw, 1232px"><figcaption>Learning about the social and ethical issues in data-driven systems. (Slide from the researchers’ presentation.)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As well as learning about lines, planes, distances, dot product and statistical measures, learners are also engaged in discussing the social and ethical issues of the approach taken. They are encouraged to think about bias, data diversity, privacy, and the impact of errors on people. For example, if the model wrongly predicts a light as green when it is red, then an autonomous car would run through a red traffic light. This would likely be a bigger consequence than stopping at a green traffic light that was mis-predicted as red. So should the best line reduce this kind of error?</p>



<p>To teach the workshops, Sarah explained they have developed interactive Jupyter notebooks, where no programming skills are needed. Students fill in the gaps of example code, explore simulations, and write their ideas for discussion for the whole class. No software needs to be installed, feedback is direct, and there are in-depth tasks and staggered hints.</p>



<h2><strong>Learning about regression models: Weather forecasting and the toy artificial neural network</strong></h2>



<p>Stephan went on to introduce artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are the basis of generative AI applications like chatbots and image generation systems. He focused on regression models, such as those used in weather forecasting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ANNs are very complex. Therefore, to start to understand the fundamentals of this technology, he introduced a ‘toy ANN’ with one input, three nodes, and one output. A function is performed on the input data at each node. With the toy network, the team wants to tackle a major and common misconception: that students think that ANN systems learn, recognise, see, and understand, when really it’s all just maths.</p>

<p>The learning activity starts by looking at one node with one input and one output, and can be described as a mathematical function, with a concatenation of two functions (in this case a linear and activation function). Stephan shared an <a href="https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/kpjk8qb6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online simulator</a> that visualises how the toy neural network can be explored as students change two parameters (in this case, weight and bias of the functions). Students then look at the overall network, and the way that the output from the three nodes is combined. Again, they can explore this in the simulator. Students compare simple data about weather prediction to the model, and discover they need more functions — more nodes to better fit the data. The activity helps students learn that ANN systems are just highly adjustable mathematical functions that, by adding nodes, can approximate relationships in a given data set. But the approximation only works in the bounds (intervals) in which data points are given, showing that ANNs do not ‘understand’ or ’know’ — it’s just maths.</p>



<p>Stephen finished by explaining the mutual benefits of AI education and maths education. He suggested maths will enable a deeper understanding of AI, and give students a way to realistically assess the opportunities and risks of AI tools and show them the role that humans have in designing AI systems. He also explained that classroom maths education can benefit from incorporating AI contexts. This approach highlights how maths underpins the design and understanding of everyday systems, supports more effective teaching, and promotes an interdisciplinary way of learning across subjects.</p>



<h2><strong>Some personal reflections — which may not be quite right!</strong></h2>



<p>I have been researching the teaching of AI and machine learning for around five years now, since before ChatGPT and other similar tools burst on the scene. Since then, I have seen an increasing number of resources to teach about the social and ethical issues of the topic, and there are a bewildering number of learning activities and tools for students to train simple models. There are frameworks for the data lifecycle, and an emerging set of activities to follow to prepare data, compare model types, and deploy simple applications. However, I felt the need to understand and to teach about, at a very simple level, the basic building blocks of data-driven technologies. When I heard the CAMMP team present their work at the <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AIDEA/2025/Symposium#tab-keynote-presentation-45-minutes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AIDEA conference in February 2025</a>, I was entirely amazed and I asked them to present here at our research seminar series. This was a piece of the puzzle that I had been searching for — a way to explain the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/ai-education-resources-what-to-teach-seame-framework/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘bottom of the technical stack of fundamental concepts’</a>. The team is taking very complex ideas and reducing them to such an extent that we can use secondary classroom maths to show that AI is not magic and AI systems do not think. It’s just maths. The maths is still hard, and teachers will still need the skills to carefully guide students step by step so they can build a useful mental model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think we can simplify these ideas further, and create unplugged activities, simulations, and ways for students to explore these basic building blocks of data representation, as well as classification and representing approximations of complex patterns and prediction. I can sense the beginnings of new ideas in computational thinking, though they’re still taking shape. We’re researching these further and will keep you updated.</p>

        <p>
            Years ago, an audacious Fields medalist outlined a sweeping program that, he claimed, could be used to resolve a major problem in algebraic geometry. Other mathematicians had their doubts. Now he says he has a proof.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p><span>I</span>n August, a team of mathematicians posted a paper claiming to solve a major problem in algebraic geometry — using entirely alien techniques. It instantly captivated the field, stoking excitement in some mathematicians and skepticism in others.</p>
<p>The result deals with polynomial equations, which combine variables raised to powers (like <em>y </em>= <em>x</em> or <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − 3<em>xy</em> = <em>z</em><sup>2</sup>). These equations are some of the simplest and most ubiquitous in mathematics, and today, they’re fundamental to lots of different areas of study. As a result, mathematicians want to study their solutions, which can be represented as geometric shapes like curves, surfaces and higher-dimensional objects <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/what-is-a-manifold-20251103/">called manifolds</a>.</p>
<p>There are infinitely many types of polynomial equations that mathematicians want to tame. But they all fall into one of two basic categories — equations whose solutions can be computed by following a simple recipe, and equations whose solutions have a richer, more complicated structure. The second category is where the mathematical juice is: It’s where mathematicians want to focus their attention to make major advances.</p>
<p>But after sorting just a few types of polynomials into the “easy” and “hard” piles, mathematicians got stuck. For the past half-century, even relatively simple-looking polynomials have resisted classification.</p>
<p>Then this summer, the new proof appeared. It claimed to end the stalemate, offering up a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05105">tantalizing vision for how to classify</a> lots of other types of polynomials that have until now seemed completely out of reach.</p>
<p>The problem is that no one in the world of algebraic geometry understands it. At least, not yet. The proof relies on ideas imported from the world of string theory. Its techniques are wholly unfamiliar to the mathematicians who have dedicated their careers to classifying polynomials.</p>
<p>Some researchers trust the reputation of one of the paper’s authors, a Fields medalist named <a href="https://www.ihes.fr/~maxim/">Maxim Kontsevich</a>. But Kontsevich also has a penchant for making audacious claims, giving others pause. Reading groups have sprung up in math departments across the world to decipher the groundbreaking result and relieve the tension.</p>
<p>This review may take years. But it’s also revived hope for an area of study that had stalled. And it marks an early victory for a broader mathematical program that Kontsevich has championed for decades — one that he hopes will build bridges between algebra, geometry and physics.</p>
<p>“The general perception,” said <a href="https://sites.unimi.it/stellari/">Paolo Stellari</a>, a mathematician at the University of Milan who was not involved in the work, “is that we might be looking at a piece of the mathematics of the future.”</p>
<h2><strong><span>The Rational Approach</span></strong></h2>
<p>The effort to classify all polynomials deals with the oldest kind of math: solving equations. To solve the simple polynomial <em>y </em>= 2<em>x</em>, for instance, you just need to find values of <em>x</em> and <em>y </em>that satisfy the equation. There are infinitely many solutions to this equation, such as <em>x</em> = 1, <em>y</em> = 2. When you graph all the solutions in the coordinate plane, you get a line.</p>
<p>Other polynomials are harder to solve directly, and their solutions cut out more complicated, higher-dimensional shapes in space.</p>
<p>But for some of these equations, it turns out, there’s a really simple way to find every possible solution. Instead of separately plugging different numbers into each variable, you can get all the solutions at once by rewriting the variables in terms of a new variable, <em>t</em>.</p>
<p>Consider the polynomial <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 1, which defines a circle. Now set <em>x </em>equal to 2<em>t</em>/(1 + <em>t</em><sup>2</sup>), and <em>y </em>equal to (1 − <em>t</em><sup>2</sup>)/(1 + <em>t</em><sup>2</sup>). When you plug these new formulas back into your original equation, you get 1 = 1, a statement that’s always true, no matter what<em> t</em> is. This means that by choosing any real-number value for <em>t</em>, you’ll instantly get a solution to the original polynomial. For instance, when you set <em>t</em> equal to 1, you get <em>x </em>= 2(1)/(1 + (1)<sup>2</sup>) = 1, and <em>y</em> = 0. And indeed, <em>x</em> = 1, <em>y</em> = 0 is a solution to the original equation: (1)<sup>2</sup> + (0)<sup>2</sup> = 1.</p>
<p>This straightforward way of framing all your solutions is called a rational parameterization. It’s equivalent to mapping every point on the graph of your original polynomial — in this case, a circle — to a unique point on a straight line.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Any degree-1 polynomial equation — that is, any polynomial whose terms are raised to a power of at most 1 — can be parameterized like this. It doesn’t matter how many variables the equation has: It might have two variables, or 200. Once you go beyond two variables, the solutions to your polynomial equation will form complicated higher-dimensional shapes. But because the polynomial can still be parameterized, there’s a way to map every point in your high-dimensional shape to points on a particularly simple space in the same number of dimensions (like the line). This, in turn, gives you a straightforward way to compute all the polynomial’s solutions.</p>
<p>Similarly, any degree-2 polynomial (whose terms are raised to a power of at most 2) has a rational parameterization.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>But if an equation’s degree is 3 or more, it can’t always be parameterized. It depends on how many variables the equation has.</p>
<p>Take a typical kind of degree-3 polynomial: elliptic curves, like <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>3</sup> + 1, which have only two variables. “Elliptic curves are glorious, they’re wonderful, but you can’t possibly parameterize them,” said <a href="https://www.math.brown.edu/bhassett/">Brendan Hassett</a> of Brown University. There’s no simple formula for <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that gives you all of an elliptic curve’s solutions, so there’s no way to map the curve to a straight line. “If you could, they would not be so much fun,” Hassett said.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Instead, the solutions to an elliptic curve have a far richer structure — one that’s played a vital role in number theory for centuries, and that cryptographers have taken advantage of to encode secret messages.</p>
<p>What about degree-3 equations with more variables, then? Are they parameterizable, or is the structure of their solutions more fun, the way it is for elliptic curves?</p>
<p>In 1866, the German mathematician Alfred Clebsch showed that degree-3 equations with three variables — whose solutions form two-dimensional surfaces — are usually parameterizable. More than a century later, Herbert Clemens and Phillip Griffiths published a monumental proof in which they showed that the opposite is true for most degree-3 equations with four variables. These equations, which form three-dimensional manifolds called three-folds, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970801?">are not parameterizable</a>: Their solutions can’t be mapped to a simple 3D space.</p>
<p>Many mathematicians suspected that the next polynomial to be classified — degree-3 equations with five variables (forming four-dimensional manifolds known as four-folds) — wouldn’t usually be parameterizable either. In fact, they figured that polynomials should never be parameterizable past a certain point. But Clemens and Griffiths’ techniques didn’t work for four-folds.</p>
<p>And so for decades, the classification effort lay dormant.</p>
<h2><strong><span>Converting a Prophet</span></strong></h2>
<p>Mathematicians were surprised when, at a conference in Moscow in the summer of 2019, Maxim Kontsevich got up to speak about classifying four-folds.</p>
<p>For one thing, Kontsevich is known for taking a high-level approach to mathematics, preferring to pose ambitious conjectures and sketch out broad programs, often leaving the subtler details and formal proof-writing to others. He’s described himself as something between a prophet and a daydreamer.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>For the past three decades, he’s been focused on developing a program called homological mirror symmetry, which has its roots in string theory. In the 1980s, string theorists wanted to count the number of curves on high-dimensional manifolds to answer questions about how the building blocks of the universe might behave. To count the curves on a given manifold, they considered its “mirror image” — another manifold that, though very different from the original, had related properties. In particular, they found that an algebraic object associated to the mirror image, called a Hodge structure, could reveal the number of curves on the original manifold. The reverse was also true: If you count the curves on the mirror image, you’ll get information about the original manifold’s Hodge structure.</p>
<p>In 1994, Kontsevich sketched out a program to explain the underlying reason for this correspondence. His program also predicted that the correspondence extended to all kinds of manifolds beyond those relevant to string theory.</p>

<p>For now, no one knows how to prove Kontsevich’s mirror symmetry program. “It will be next-century mathematics,” he said. But over the years, he’s made partial progress toward a proof — while also exploring the program’s potential consequences.</p>
<p>In 2002, one of Kontsevich’s friends, <a href="https://people.miami.edu/profile/285d74bf51ccc978f527c1386e82d0d4">Ludmil Katzarkov</a> of the University of Miami, hypothesized one such consequence: that the program might be relevant to the classification of polynomial equations.</p>
<p>Katzarkov was familiar with Clemens and Griffiths’ 1972 proof that three-folds aren’t parameterizable. In that work, the pair looked at a given three-fold’s Hodge structure directly. They then used it to show that the three-fold couldn’t be mapped to a simple 3D space. But the Hodge structures associated with four-folds were too complicated to analyze using the same tools.</p>
<p>Katzarkov’s idea was to access the four-fold’s Hodge structure indirectly — by counting how many curves of a particular type lived on its mirror image. Typically, mathematicians studying the Hodge structures of four-folds don’t think about curve counts like these: They only come up in seemingly unrelated areas of math, like string theory. But if the mirror symmetry program is true, then the number of curves on the mirror image should illuminate features of the original four-fold’s Hodge structure.</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>In particular, Katzarkov wanted to break the mirror image’s curve count into pieces, then use the mirror symmetry program to show that there was a corresponding way to break up the four-fold’s Hodge structure. He could then work with these pieces of the Hodge structure, rather than the whole thing, to show that four-folds can’t be parameterized. If any one of the pieces couldn’t be mapped to a simple 4D space, he’d have his proof.</p>
<p>But this line of reasoning depended on the assumption that Kontsevich’s mirror symmetry program was true for four-folds. “It was clear that it should be true, but I didn’t have the technical ability to see how to do it,” Katzarkov said.</p>
<p>He knew someone who did have that ability, though: Kontsevich himself.</p>
<p>But his friend wasn’t interested.</p>
<h2><strong><span>Digging In</span></strong></h2>
<p>For years, Katzarkov tried to convince Kontsevich to apply his research on mirror symmetry to the classification of polynomials — to no avail. Kontsevich wanted to focus on the whole program, not this particular problem. Then in 2018, the pair, along with <a href="https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~tpantev/">Tony Pantev</a> of the University of Pennsylvania, worked on another problem that involved breaking Hodge structures and curve counts into pieces. It convinced Kontsevich to hear Katzarkov out.</p>
<p>Katzarkov walked him through his idea again. Immediately, Kontsevich discovered an alternative path that Katzarkov had long sought but never found: a way to draw inspiration from mirror symmetry without actually relying on it. “After you’ve spent years thinking about this, you see it happening in seconds,” Katzarkov said. “That’s a spectacular moment.”</p>

<p>Kontsevich argued that it should be possible to use the four-fold’s own curve counts — rather than those of its mirror image — to break up the Hodge structure. They just had to figure out how to relate the two in a way that gave them the pieces they needed. Then they’d be able to focus on each piece (or “atom,” as they called it) of the Hodge structure separately.</p>
<p>This was the plan Kontsevich laid out for his audience at the 2019 conference in Moscow. To some mathematicians, it sounded as though a rigorous proof was just around the corner. Mathematicians are a conservative bunch and often wait for absolute certainty to present new ideas. But Kontsevich has always been a little bolder. “He’s very open with his ideas, and very forward-thinking,” said <a href="https://www.danielpomerleano.com/">Daniel Pomerleano</a>, a mathematician at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who studies mirror symmetry.</p>
<p>There was a major ingredient they still had no idea how to address, Kontsevich warned: a formula for how each atom would change as mathematicians tried to map the four-fold to new spaces. Only with such a formula in hand could they prove that some atom would never reach a state corresponding to a properly “simplified” four-fold. This would imply that four-folds weren’t parameterizable, and that their solutions were rich and complicated. “But people somehow got the impression that he said it was done,” Pomerleano said, and they expected a proof soon.</p>
<p>When that didn’t come to pass, some mathematicians began to doubt that he had a real solution. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.pma.caltech.edu/people/tony-yue-yu">Tony Yue Yu</a>, then at the French National Center for Scientific Research, joined the team. Yu’s fresh insights and meticulous style of proof, Kontsevich said, turned out to be crucial to the project.</p>

<p>When lockdowns began during the Covid pandemic, Yu visited Kontsevich at France’s nearby Institute for Advanced Scientific Studies. They relished the quiet of the deserted institute, spending hours in lecture halls where there were more blackboards, Yu recalled.</p>
<p>Meeting regularly with Pantev and Katzarkov over Zoom, they quickly completed the first part of their proof, figuring out precisely how to use the number of curves on a given four-fold to break its Hodge structure into atoms. But they struggled to find a formula to describe how the atoms could then be transformed.</p>
<p>What they didn’t know was that a mathematician who had attended Kontsevich’s lecture in Moscow — <a href="https://www.math.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~iritani/">Hiroshi Iritani</a> of Kyoto University — had also started pursuing such a formula. “He was enchanted by my conjecture,” Kontsevich said. “I didn’t know, but he started to work on it.”</p>
<p>In July 2023, Iritani <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13555">proved a formula</a> for how the atoms would change as four-folds were mapped to new spaces. It didn’t give quite as much information as Kontsevich and his colleagues needed, but over the next two years, they figured out how to hone it. They then used their new formula to show that four-folds would always have at least one atom that couldn’t be transformed to match simple 4D space. Four-folds weren’t parameterizable.</p>
<h2><strong><span>Still Processing</span></strong></h2>

<p>When the team posted their proof in August, many mathematicians were excited. It was the biggest advance in the classification project in decades, and hinted at a new way to tackle the classification of polynomial equations well beyond four-folds.</p>
<p>But other mathematicians weren’t so sure. Six years had passed since the lecture in Moscow. Had Kontsevich finally made good on his promise, or were there still details to fill in?</p>
<p>And how could they assuage their doubts, when the proof’s techniques were so completely foreign — the stuff of string theory, not polynomial classification? “They say, ‘This is black magic, what is this machinery?’” Kontsevich said.</p>
<p>“Suddenly they come with this completely new approach, using tools that were previously widely believed to have nothing to do with this subject,” said <a href="https://math.mit.edu/~shaoyunb/">Shaoyun Bai</a> of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “The people who know the problem don’t understand the tools.”</p>
<p>Bai is one of several mathematicians now trying to bridge this gap in understanding. Over the past few months, he has co-organized a “reading seminar” made up of graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and professors who hope to make sense of the new paper. Each week, a different mathematician digs into some aspect of the proof and presents it to the rest of the group.</p>
<p>But even now, after 11 of these 90-minute sessions, the participants still feel lost when it comes to major details of the proof. “The paper contains brilliant original ideas,” Bai said, which “require substantial time to absorb.”</p>
<p>Similar reading groups have been congregating in Paris, Beijing, South Korea and elsewhere. “People all over the globe are working on the same paper right now,” Stellari said. “That’s a special thing.”</p>
        
        
<p>Hassett likens it to Grigori Perelman’s 2003 proof of the Poincaré conjecture, which also used entirely new techniques to solve a famous problem. It was only after other mathematicians reproduced Perelman’s proof using more traditional tools that the community truly accepted it.</p>
<p>“There will be resistance,” Katzarkov said, “but we did the work, and I’m sure it’s correct.” He and Kontsevich also see it as a major win for the mirror symmetry program: While they’re not closer to proving it, the result provides further evidence that it’s true.</p>
<p>“I’m very old, and very tired,” Katzarkov said. “But I’m willing to develop this theory as long as I’m alive.”</p>
