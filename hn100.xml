		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>While deploying Precision Time Protocol (PTP) at Meta, we’ve developed a simplified version of the protocol (Simple Precision Time Protocol – SPTP), that can offer the same level of clock synchronization as unicast PTPv2 more reliably and with fewer resources.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>In our own tests, SPTP boasts comparable performance to PTP, but with significant improvements in CPU, memory, and network utilization.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We’ve made the source code for the SPTP client and server available on</span><a href="https://github.com/facebook/time"> <span>GitHub</span></a><span>.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>We’ve previously spoken in great detail about</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/"> <span>how Precision Time Protocol is being deployed at Meta</span></a><span>, including </span><span>the protocol itself and Meta’s precision time architecture.</span></p>
<p><span>As we deployed PTP into one of our data centers, we were also evaluating and testing alternative PTP clients. In doing so, we soon realized that we could eliminate a lot of complexity in the PTP protocol itself that we experienced during data center deployments while still maintaining complete hardware compatibility with our existing equipment.</span></p>
<p><span>This is how the idea of Simple Precision Time Protocol (SPTP) was born.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But before we dive under the hood of SPTP we should explore why the IEEE 1588</span><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8265.1/en"> <span>G8265.1</span></a><span> and</span><a href="https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.8275.2/en"> <span>G8275.2</span></a><span> unicast profiles (here, we just call them PTP) weren’t a perfect fit for our data center deployment.</span></p>
<h2><span>PTP and its limitations</span></h2>
<h3><span>Excessive network communication</span></h3>
<p><span>A typical IEEE 1588-2019 two-step PTPv2 unicast UDP flow consists of the following exchange:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_20920" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20920"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="562" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=916,503 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=768,422 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=96,53 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_Image1.png?resize=192,105 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20920">Figure 1: Typical two-step PTPv2 exchange.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>This sequence repeats either in full or in part depending on the negotiation result. The exchange shown is one of many possible combinations. It may involve additional steps such as grant cancellation, grand cancellation acknowledgements, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span>The frequency of these messages may vary depending on the implementation and configuration. After completing negotiation, the frequency of some messages can change dynamically.</span></p>
<p><span>This design allows for a lot of flexibility, especially for less powerful equipment where resources are limited. In combination with multicast, it allows us to support a relatively large number of clients using either very old or embedded devices. For example, a PTP server can reject the request or confirm a less frequent exchange if the resources are exhausted.</span></p>
<p><span>This design, however, leads to excessive network communication, which is particularly visible on a</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/08/11/open-source/time-appliance/"> <span>time appliance</span></a><span> serving a large number of clients.</span></p>
<h3><span>State machine</span></h3>
<p><span>Due to the “subscription” model, both the PTP client and the server have to keep the state in memory. This approach comes with the tradeoffs such as:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Excessive usage of resources such as memory and CPU.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Strict capacity limits that mean multicast support is required for large numbers of clients.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Code complexity.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Fragile state transitions.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>These issues can manifest, for example, in so-called abandoned syncs – situations where the work of a PTP client is interrupted (either forcefully stopped or crashed). Because the PTP server didn’t receive a cancellation signaling message it will keep sending sync and followup packets until the subscription expires (which may take hours). This leads to additional complexity and fragility in the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>There are additional protocol design side effects such as:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>An almost infinite Denial of Service Attack (DoS) amplification factor.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Server-driven communication with little control by the client.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Complete trust in the validity of server timestamps.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Asynchronous path delay calculations.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>In data centers, where communication is typically driven by hundreds of thousands of clients and multicast is not supported, these tradeoffs are very limiting.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>SPTP</span></h2>
<p><span>True to its name, SPTP significantly reduces the number of exchanges between a server and client, allowing for much more efficient network communication.</span></p>
<h3><span>Exchange</span></h3>
<figure id="attachment_20921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20921"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg 1080w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=916,916 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=768,768 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=1024,1024 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=96,96 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image2.jpg?resize=192,192 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20921">Figure 2: Typical SPTP exchange.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>In a typical SPTP exchange:</span><span><br>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The client sends a delay request.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The server responds with a sync.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>The server sends a followup/announce.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>The number of network exchanges is drastically reduced. Instead of 11 different network exchanges as shown on Figure 1 and the requirement for client and server state machines for the duration of the subscription, there are only three packets exchanged and no state needs to be preserved on either side. In the simplified exchange, every packet has an important role:</span></p>
<h4><span>Delay request</span></h4>
<p><span>A delay request initiates the SPTP exchange. It’s interpreted by a server not only as a standard delay request containing the correction field (CF1) of the transparent clock, but also as a signal to respond with sync and followup packets. Just like in a two-step PTPv2 exchange, it generates T3 upon departure from the client side and T4 upon arrival on the server side.</span></p>
<p><span>To distinguish between a PTPv2 delay request and a SPTP delay request, the PTP profile Specific 1 flag must be set by the client.</span></p>
<h4><span>Sync</span></h4>
<p><span>In response to a delay request, a sync packet would be sent containing the T4 generated at an earlier stage. Just like in a regular two-step PTPv2 exchange, a sync packet will generate a T1 upon departure from the server side. While in transit, the correction field of the packet (CF2) is populated by the network equipment.</span></p>
<h4><span>Followup/announce</span></h4>
<p><span>Following the sync packet, an announce packet is immediately sent containing T1 generated at a previous stage. In addition, the correction filed from the Delay Request field is populated by the CF1 value collected at an earlier stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The announce packet also contains typical PTPv2 information such as clock class, clock accuracy, and so on. On the client side, the arrival of the packet generates the T2 timestamp.</span></p>
<p><span>After a successful SPTP exchange, default two-step PTPv2 formulas for mean path delay and clock offset must be applied:</span></p>
<p><em><span>mean_path_delay = ((T4 – T3) + (T2-T1) – CF1 -CF2)/2</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>clock_offset = T2 – T1 – mean_path_delay</span></em></p>
<p><span>After every exchange the client has access to the announce message attributes such as time source, clock quality, etc., as well as the path delay and a calculated clock offset after every exchange with every server. And, because the exchange is client-driven, the offsets could be calculated at the exact same time. This avoids a situation where a client is following a faulty server and has no chance of detecting it.</span></p>

<h3><span>Reliability</span></h3>
<p><span>We can also provide stronger reliability guarantees by using multi-clock reliance.</span></p>
<p><span>In our implementation for precision time synchronization, we provide time as well as a window of uncertainty (WOU) to the consumer application via the fbclock API. As we described in a previous blog post on</span><a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2022/11/21/production-engineering/precision-time-protocol-at-meta/"> <span>how PTP is being deployed at Meta</span></a><span> the WOU is based on the observation of time sync errors for the minimum duration to have stationarity of the state of the system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, we’ve established a method based on a collection of clocks that each client can access for timing information that we call a </span><i><span>clock ensemble</span></i><span>. The clock ensemble operates in two modes, steady state and transient; where steady state is during normal operation and transient is in the case of holdover.</span></p>
<p><span>However, with a pool of N clocks, C, forming the clock ensemble, the question becomes which clocks to select for determining robustness and accurate timing information. Clocks that are not accurate are rejected (C_reject) and, thus, our ensemble size falls to N = C_total –&nbsp; C_reject. We employ two stages, one that is based on each individual clock, and the second that acts on the collection of valid clocks in the ensemble.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first stage observes the previous measurements of each individual clock, where the main criteria is to reject outliers in the previous states of the clock. Once this criterion threshold is exceeded, the entire clock is rejected from the valid clock ensemble pool. This is based off</span><a href="https://www.statisticshowto.com/chauvenets-criterion/"> <span>Chauvenet’s criterion</span></a><span>, where the criterion is a probability band that is centered on the mean of the clock outputs (assuming a normal distribution during steady state). Based on the stationarity tests, we use a sample size of 400 previous clock outputs and calculate a maximum allowable deviation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example:</span></p>
<p><span><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D%5Cge%20%5Cfrac%7B%7CC%20-%20%5Cbar%7BC%7D%7C%7D%7BS_%7Bc%7D%7D">, where <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20C"> is the current clock output, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%5Coverline%20C">&nbsp;</span><span>is the clock sample mean, and <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20S_%7Bc%7D"> </span><span>is the clock set standard deviation.</span></p>
<p><span>We find the probability that the current clock output is in disagreement with the previous 400 samples:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%7BP_%7Bz%7D%20%3D%201%20-%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B4%28400%29%7D%20%5Capprox%200.9993%7D"></p>
<p><span>Based on a window size of 400 previous samples, the maximum allowed deviation is:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D%20%3D%203.2272"></p>
<p><span>Now, the clock outputs are tested against this value. If they exceed the <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20D_%7Bmax%7D">&nbsp;</span><span>they are rejected, an alert is raised, and a threshold counter is incremented. Once the rejection threshold is reached for an individual clock, this clock is entirely rejected.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, we enter the second stage of verifying the clock ensemble composed of the valid clocks. The second stage forms a weighted average of the non-rejected clocks in the valid clock ensemble, where each clock in the ensemble is reported as its sample size, mean, and variance. The average of the clocks’ means is the weighted average, where the weights are inversely proportional to the mean absolute deviations reported by each clock after applying Chauvenet’s criterion.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now we can report the mean and variance of the clock ensemble, ensuring the clocks contained therewith are valid and not providing erroneous values. The confidence interval is scaled with the number of good clocks in the ensemble, where the higher the number of valid clocks out of the total clocks provides greater reliability.</span></p>
<p><span>For a number of hosts, we show that the distribution of clocks falls within the following heatmap:</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_20923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20923"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png?w=640" alt="" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png 640w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png?resize=96,72 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/SPTP_image4.png?resize=192,144 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-20923">Figure 4: Offset distribution overlay of multiple clocks.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>We calculate the variance, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20v_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, of each individual clock’s observations, then we calculate a weighted mean, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, taking into consideration the reciprocal of each clock’s variance as the weight.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7BC%7D%7B%5Csqrt%7B%5Cfrac%7Bv%7D%7Bk%7D%7D%7D%2C%20C%20%3D%20%5B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Csum%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bv_%7Bk%7D%7D%5D%5E%7B-1%7D"></p>
<p><span>Due to independence of clocks, the variance of the weighted sum, <img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20w_%7Bk%7D"></span><span>, is:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bk%7D%5Csum_%7B%7D%5E%7B%7D%5Cmathrm%7BW%7D_%7Bk%7D%5E%7B2%7Dv_%7Bk%7D%20%3D%20%5Csum_%7B%7D%5E%7B%7DC%5E%7B2%7D%20%3D%20N_%7Bw%7DC%5E%7B2%7D"></p>
<p><span>In summary, we collect samples from a number of clock sources that form our clock ensemble. The overall precision and reliability of the provided data by SPTP is a function of the number of reliable and in distribution clocks forming the clock ensemble.</span></p>
<p><span>A future post will focus on this specifically.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>SPTP’s performance</span></h2>
<p><span>Let’s explore performance of the SPTP versus PTP.</span></p>
<p><span>Initial deployments to a single client confirmed no regression in the precision of the synchronization:</span></p>

<p><span>With large-scale deployment of our implementations, we can confirm resource utilization improvements.</span></p>
<p><span>We noticed that due to the difference in multi-server support, the performance gains vary significantly depending on the number of tracked time servers.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, with just a single time appliance serving the entire network there are significant improvements across the board. Most notably over 40 percent CPU, 70 percent memory, and 50 percent network utilization improvements:</span></p>

<h2><span>The next steps for SPTP at Meta</span></h2>
<p><span>Since SPTP can offer the exact same level of synchronization with a lot fewer resources consumed, we think it’s a reasonable alternative to the existing unicast PTP profiles.</span></p>
<p><span>In a large-scale data center deployment, it can help to combat frequently changing network paths and create savings in terms of network traffic, memory usage, and number of CPU cycles.</span></p>
<p><span>It will also eliminate a lot of complexity inherited from multicast PTP profiles, which is not necessarily useful in the trusted networks of the modern data centers.</span></p>
<p><span>It should be noted that SPTP may not be suitable for systems that still require subscription and authentication. But this could be solved by using PTP TLVs (type-length-value).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, by removing the need for subscriptions, it’s possible to observe multiple clocks – which allows us to provide higher reliability by comparing the time sync from multiple sources at the end node.</span></p>
<p><span>SPTP can offer significantly simpler, faster, and more reliable synchronization. Similar to G.8265.1 and G.8275.2 it provides excellent synchronization quality using a different set of parameters.

<p>A simple and to the point classless CSS stylesheet</p>

</header>
<section>
<h2>What is this ?</h2>
<p>This is a classless CSS stylesheet, built for lightness and simplicity.</p>
<p>Concrete can be a great starting point for a simple website.</p>
<p>It also switches to a <strong>dark theme</strong> if your OS uses one.</p>
<p>Best used in pair with <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/">normalize.css</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://milligram.io/">Milligram</a> and <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>.</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>
<h3>In your HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code></h3>
<p>Just drop these lines into your HTML head.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://concrete.style/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="315f5e435c505d584b541f52424271091f011f00">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/normalize.css"</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://concrete.style/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="72111d1c11001706175c11010132405c425c46">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/concrete.css"</span><span>&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>
<h3>In your javascript project</h3>
<p>Add the dependencies:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">npm <span>install </span>normalize.css concrete.css</code></pre></figure>
<p>Import them somewhere in your code:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="js"><span>import</span> <span>'</span><span>normalize.css</span><span>'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>'</span><span>concrete.css</span><span>'</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2>Typography</h2>
<p>Concrete does not redefine headings, although normalize does. This is what you can expect:</p>
<div>
<p>
<h2>h1 heading</h2>
<h2>h2 heading</h2>
<h3>h3 heading</h3>
<h4>h4 heading</h4>
<h5>h5 heading</h5>
<h6>h6 heading</h6>
</p>
<div>

<p>I can simply be a paragraph.</p>
<p>I can be <a href="https://concrete.style/">a link</a>.</p>
<p>I can be <strong>bold</strong>.</p>
<p>I can be <u>underlined</u>.</p>
<p>I can be <em>emphasised</em>.</p>
<p>I can be <small>small</small>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>h1 heading<span>&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;h2&gt;</span>h2 heading<span>&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;h3&gt;</span>h3 heading<span>&lt;/h3&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;h4&gt;</span>h4 heading<span>&lt;/h4&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;h5&gt;</span>h5 heading<span>&lt;/h5&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;h6&gt;</span>h6 heading<span>&lt;/h6&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  I can simply be a paragraph.
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  I can be <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"./"</span><span>&gt;</span>a link<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>.
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  I can be <span>&lt;strong&gt;</span>bold<span>&lt;/strong&gt;</span>.
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  I can be <span>&lt;u&gt;</span>underlined<span>&lt;/u&gt;</span>.
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  I can be <span>&lt;em&gt;</span>emphasised<span>&lt;/em&gt;</span>.
<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
  I can be <span>&lt;small&gt;</span>small<span>&lt;/small&gt;</span>.

<h2>Sections</h2>
<p>
For structuring your page, you can use the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element inside of the body.
It will be automatically centered on the page, with a maximum width of 640px, like the page you are reading right now.
</p>
<p>
To isolate the title of your page, and make it bigger, you can use the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element.
You can see an example at the top of this page.
</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element to separate between the different sections.
The section will simply be given some bottom padding.
</p>
<p>
The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element will center the text inside of it.
You can see an example at the bottom of this page.
</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;main&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;header&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;h1&gt;</span>
      Title
    <span>&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/header&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;section&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
    <span>&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/section&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;footer&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>

          <div itemprop="text" id="post_1">
              <p>It is with great sadness that we announce John’s death on Friday, February 2, 2024. He was born in Maryland, USA to William and Bertha Walker, who preceded him in death. John is survived by his wife Roxie Walker and a brother, Bill Walker of West Virginia.</p>
<p>Declining to follow in his family tradition of becoming a medical doctor, John attended Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) to pursue a future in astronomy. However, after he discovered the brave new world of computers, he never looked back. John worked at the university’s Project Chi (X) computing center where he studied computer science and earned a degree in electrical engineering.</p>
<p>John met Roxie on Thanksgiving Day in 1972, and they married the following year. Roxie and John drove cross-country a few months later for John’s new job in California. Eventually he left that first job and worked at various others in the bay area. In late 1976, John designed his own circuit board based on the then-new Texas Instruments TMS9900 microprocessor. This venture became Marinchip Systems, and eventually led to Autodesk.</p>
<p>The beginnings of Autodesk are well documented by John himself in <a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/">The Autodesk File</a> and from there John’s story is best told by John himself in his prodigious work, which is all methodically organized and available to the public at his website <a href="https://fourmilab.ch/">Fourmilab</a>.</p>

              <p>Former Ricochet/Ratburger member 10Cents writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First off, I suppose I should say I don’t feel up to the task to write a tribute for John Walker. I am sure others are more able. That is true, but here is my Dime’s worth.</p>
<p>I got to know John Walker on the <a href="http://ricochet.com/">ricochet.com</a> audio meet-ups (AMUs). He was a regular caller. Someone recently said that he was on those for over ten years. The AMU started at Ricochet but after I left there I started various ones which John joined. First at BallDiamondBall, then Ratburger which became the Scanalyst AMU without me. My guess he spent at least five hours a week since there were two or three calls per week. The AMUs were started by Curious John then through attrition I was left in charge. Now CTlaw is Mr. AMU.</p>
<p>I admired John for kindness in explaining things to almost anyone. I also appreciated his off-beat humor and stories. I learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>I don’t know about others, but I felt unbelievably surprised that someone like John would spend time with me. For me it was like going to the candy store but instead of candy it was insights and ideas. He brought so much to the table.</p>
<p>John was easy to take for granted because he was always there. He was a fixture in our lives. That fixture is gone. It is a struggle to think of life without him. It is hard not to cry at times.</p>
<p>I don’t know why John enjoyed our company but he did. I remember he teasing me when I came on a call. “There goes the neighborhood.” One of the last calls he invited me to “The Cheap Seats”. This was a part of his site where public domain movies could be seen. I am glad that the Ratburger experience showed him the way to start a forum site. He loved interacting with people on Scanalyst. And didn’t have the frustration of Wordpress there.</p>
<p>For those of us who got a lot of John’s time there are unending memories. For those of us who got a lot of John’s time, we struggle without the voice and wit we relied upon. I for one bow my head and humbly say thanks. I do wish I could have had a little bit more though.</p>
<p>I remember that John gave to this community day in and day out for years, first at Ratburger then at Scanalyst. He didn’t get a break. I calculate it was about six years. I am writing this post to fulfill my debt of gratitude to a kind man</p>

When I heard that the United States could not produce sufficient 155 mm artillery shells to supply Ukraine, I thought it sounded odd. I knew essentially nothing about artillery save I would want to be on the other end of one. I was generally aware </span><a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47751" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the industrial base for the defense industry had either atrophied or specialized or both</a><span>, depending on your perspective. Maybe this was just over-specialization? A dependency on a single part? Maybe it is a reliance on something exotic? Surely, there must be an explanation, something that would help me understand why we are so ill-prepared. Maybe there is some new technology that could be applied? This is a record of what I learned for the benefit of a more-educated citizenry and to save time for anyone else investigating the issue.</span></p><p>I approached this first to understand and second to know if-and-how I could help. My understanding is far from perfect—I went for breadth more than depth, often sacrificing detailed measurements in order to go fast. This is the short version.</p><ul><li><p>There is a shortage because our lone factory’s maximum capacity is 28,000 units (i.e. 24 ku) per month in the face of Ukraine asking for 600,000 units (600 ku) per month.</p></li><li><p><span>The major shortage is with producing </span><strong>steel casings</strong><span> for the artillery shells.</span></p><ul><li><p>The materials required to make these shells are relatively plentiful.</p></li><li><p>If you were to remove the casings bottleneck, other bottlenecks are possible. However, the next step (filling shells with explosive materials) is simpler to optimize vs. moving and precisely shaping a hundred pounds of steel at 2000°F.&nbsp;</p></li></ul></li><li><p>There is no technological shortcut to producing more of these.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>3D printing is not viable. The metal itself is too precise to be printable with current technology, and the size of the shells would pose an issue.</p></li><li><p>Existing facilities use automation, but newer facilities will integrate more automation to improve quality and throughput.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Producing shells requires specific machine tools to accommodate the weight/heat and specially forming the nozzle. The tools themselves are fairly common, especially the furnaces; however, a factory optimized for building shells won’t be effective at building much else.</p></li><li><p>The existing production facility is part of a national landmark district, complicating expanding the existing facility.</p></li><li><p>The Department of Defense’s (DOD) current primary path forward is building a new facility in Garland, TX with modern automation and inspection equipment. Assuming it is contributing to the goal of scaling to 100ku per month of production by early 2025, it will have taken 3 years since hostilities started and 2 years since a contract was awarded for it to be online.</p></li><li><p>Building additional capacity is largely in DOD’s hands, as defense contractors are unwilling to build facilities without long-term (15 year) contracts. Today, the DOD typically awards 3-4 year contracts.</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, I am left with the impression that the US’ solution to problems that require building things is to avoid it at all costs. Congress is loathe to fund munition supplies that are never used, and defense contractors are loathe to build factories that sit idle (and despite what Hollywood may portray, everyone wants deterrence, not actual conflict). Though Congress and DOD are funding a new facility, 3-4 years will have passed before it produces a shell, which is entirely unhelpful in a present conflict. Instead, the DOD is attempting to plug the Ukraine-sized hole with shells from allied nations including Canada, South Korea, Finland, and Germany—places where it’s still possible to build new things.</p><p>I believe in alliances, especially when it is the free people of the world standing against aggression from authoritarians. What troubles me here, though, is that the US is pursuing that option because the domestic defense industrial base, inclusive of DOD and its contractors, is sclerotic. It treats time like it’s free. It does not respond quickly. It does not build or innovate around current problems, because of a combination of disincentives from DOD’s own structure and the pervasive challenges of trying to run a manufacturing business in the US. These are largely own goals. If the DOD would write longer term contracts. If we did not declare essential production facilities to be historic landmarks, strangling expansion. I did not even want to get into why GOCOs exist or the labyrinth of DOD procurement, but it is sufficient to say they both pose challenges to doing anything new or different. My solace is that in a real conflict, all of that red tape would be put to the side and people can get about building things. There will be a multi-year lag between when that crisis happens and how fast the factories can return, and I hope we can weather that storm.</p><p>Could an entrepreneur change this equation? Anduril’s success is a testament that with the right application of influence and creativity, new companies can compete effectively against the prime contractors. I am less certain that is a possibility here for a few reasons. The primary concern is getting an ROI in 3-4 years on the capital required to build such a facility. You either need a technological edge that dramatically reduces the capital expense, or you need to be able to blend production with other commercial goods (i.e. dual use). For the former, I do not see a dramatically cheaper option unless there is some arbitrage on cheaper electric arc furnaces and presses. For the latter, 3D printing could be an answer, if the material properties existed. However, metal 3D printing companies are struggling with sales as-is, reflecting a lack of commercial demand for commercial 3D printed metal parts. Therefore, even with the steel needed, I am confident it would be a battle to keep them full the rest of the time. This only gets harder without a technological edge like 3D printing, as it would be a sub-scale, commodity steel mill likely optimized for an application with only one real customer. </p><p>The rest of the post is specific research questions I had with the best quality of answers I could find and cited. Questions include:</p><ul><li><p><em>What is the 155 mm artillery shell?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How big is the gap between what we can produce and what is needed?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What does the supply chain for 155 mm shells look like?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Where’s the shortage?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How are casings made?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Can 3D printing help?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What kind of tools are used in the existing process?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What is the maximum capacity for the existing infrastructure?</em></p></li><li><p><em>What’s the yield among existing producers? Can it be improved?</em></p></li><li><p><em>Can they expand existing facilities?</em></p></li><li><p><em>If they’re going to get to 100ku per month by 2025, how are they going to do it?</em></p></li><li><p><em>How long does it take to set up a new plant? Why?</em></p></li><li><p><em>The need for 155 mm shells is unique to European wars. Why worry about this if the risk is a war in the Pacific?</em></p></li><li><p><em>In a direct conflict, what would we do?</em></p></li></ul><p>If you see anything incorrect or do additional research, please let me know.</p><p>Throughout the war in Ukraine, the 155mm shell has been a weapon of choice. Without air superiority, the 155 mm shell combines range, lethality, fire rate, and mobility to project force up to 20 miles. With small, cheap drones spotting for them, the army of Ukraine was able to consistently halt quantitatively superior Russian advances.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png" width="574" height="375" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:375,&quot;width&quot;:574,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F39c894a5-4bbb-4781-a681-8f7d9c4d1e6a_574x375.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Base bleed variant of a M795 155 mm artillery, shown for its diagram of a M795 shell.

The basic requirements of an artillery shell are that it must withstand great force to be launched, before another explosion breaks the shell into fragments. The first force—launch—requires a high yield strength, such that the metal won’t deform (yield) under that pressure. In the vernacular, yield strength = yeet distance, while the fragmentation characteristics of the metal relate to the lethality. HF-1 was selected because of how predictable it shatters while maintaining a high yield strength.

A core problem for DOD and the defense contractors is that they have to build custom production lines to surge demand. But if there’s no conflict in Europe, these machines are mostly idle. 3D printing is essentially a line designed to be changed much faster, as you can make many different shapes. In theory, with a fleet of metal printers, you could be making war components when necessary and making commercial parts in peacetime. They would almost certainly be more expensive than a dedicated production line, but if the US doesn’t want to pay the capital for it, at least this would be an option. Unfortunately, the short answer is no, 3D printing can’t help here, at least not with today’s technology.&nbsp;</p><p>I am not aware of any metal 3D printer capable of making HF-1 steel or any other high-silicon, high-carbon steel. Metal 3D printing is still pretty limited with some vendors offering questionable material properties that are not attempting to touch high-performance steels. It makes sense the machine vendors wouldn’t prioritize a metal without much commercial appeal.</p><p>The other operative question is if a shell casing would fit in the build volume of a current 3D printer. Given the shells are 858 mm in length and 155 mm in diameter, they fit in the build chamber of Velo3D’s 1MZ printers (315x1000 mm and 600x1000 mm), though it looks like they exceed the existing build plate options. In that orientation, they would also have an extremely long print time.</p><p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.jmc.army.mil/Installations.aspx?id=ScrantonOverview" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Army overview page</a><span> for the facility lists the following:</span></p><ul><li><p>Multiple long stroke vertical hydraulic forge press lines</p></li><li><p>Capability to produce large mortar projectiles</p></li><li><p>In house metallurgical testingIn house metallurgical testing</p></li><li><p>Over 120 hydraulic tracer and CNC lathes</p></li><li><p>Machining capability exceeding current ammunition manufacturing requirements</p></li><li><p>In house end-to-end production processes, no outsourcing requirements&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Multiple automated paint lines&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Multiple heat treat furnaces that austenitize, quench, and temper</p></li></ul><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png" width="1076" height="840" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:840,&quot;width&quot;:1076,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8220006-9e92-4f89-b3fb-ff8bdc503880_1076x840.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><em><span>From a 2017 brochure covering SCAAP’s capabilities: </span><a href="https://www.jmc.army.mil/thumbnails/pdfs/Scranton%20brochure%202017%20Final.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Scranton brochure 2017 Final.pdf (army.mil)</a></em></p><p><span>In February 2023, the US Army released some information about SCAAP: SCAAP is a leading producer of large-caliber artillery metal parts and components and can effectively and efficiently manufacture runs from small batch quantities to </span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263789/secretary_of_the_army_discusses_modernization_efforts_during_scaap_visit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">more than one million annually</a><span>”. 1mu annually would be a little over 83ku per month. Of course, in PR speak, they didn’t say they could make 83ku 155 mm shells per month—presumably they can make 83ku of something, maybe a mix of things, if all their lines were running flat out.</span></p><p><span>Given the US was flatout at the end of 2024 at 24ku per month with existing infrastructure, I assume all of that was coming from Scranton AAP. In 2022, the US government authorized an additional $243 million to “</span><a href="https://www.army.mil/article/263789/secretary_of_the_army_discusses_modernization_efforts_during_scaap_visit" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">help ramp up production lines and help put in some new equipment that will allow the plant to be able to produce more shells at a higher rate</a><span>”. I assume some of that money went to scale production from 14ku to 24ku per month, but I can only guess how much remains to be added.</span></p><p>If you ask in the right rooms, the answer you get is there is room for improvement. Allegedly, the site’s structure as a GOCO disincentivizes optimizing yield. The contractor gets paid the same for operating it as-is, and if the government wants to fix it up, they would have to put in the time and energy.</p><p>Beyond the existing retrofits, you must be willing to let go of some history. Scranton AAP started life in 1908 as a steam locomotive erecting and repair facility. With trains on the decline, it was established as an army ammunition plant in 1953 but sits in a larger national historic district and is listed on the National Registry of Historical Places.

We have many of the machines required in the US; these would need to be co-located to be dedicated to a war effort. The permitting issues would evaporate, and the DOD would award contracts of whatever length to justify the facilities. With the tools and raw materials, the next question is having the right mix of people and automation to operate the tools. In a crunch like this, you would likely have more people initially while you quickly automated what you could. Training those workers would be key.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The New Zealand Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will <a href="https://www.epa.govt.nz/news-and-alerts/latest-news/epa-bans-forever-chemicals-in-cosmetic-products/">ban the use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in cosmetic products</a> starting in 2027. This will make the country one of the first in the world to take this step on PFAS to protect people and the environment.</p>
<p>PFAS are sometimes used in products such as nail polish, shaving cream, foundation, lipstick and mascara. They are added to smooth the skin, or to make cosmetic products more durable, spreadable and water resistant. In the announcement on 30 January, the EPA said that although research suggests that PFAS are only found in a small number of products it was taking a ‘precautionary approach’ to the potential risks.</p>
<p>‘Banning these chemicals in cosmetics is part of our ongoing response, which includes phasing out all PFAS-firefighting foams and testing for background levels of PFAS in the New Zealand environment,’ said Shaun Presow, hazardous substances reassessments manager at the EPA.</p>
<p>The decision on PFAS is one of a number of updates that have been made to the Cosmetic Products Group Standard, to ensure cosmetic products are safe.</p>

<p>In many ways, the “Grace” CG100 server processor created by Nvidia – its first true server CPU and a very useful adjunct for extending the memory space of its “Hopper” GH100 GPU accelerators – was designed perfectly for HPC simulation and modeling workloads. And several major supercomputing labs are putting the Grace CPU through the HPC paces and we are seeing some interesting early results.</p>
<p>The Grace CPU has a relatively high core count and a relatively low thermal footprint, and it has banks of low-power DDR5 (LPDDR5) memory – the kind used in laptops but gussied up with error correction to be server class – of sufficient capacity to be useful for HPC systems, which typically have 256 GB or 512 GB per node these days and sometimes less.</p>
<p>Put two Grace CPUs together into a Grace-Grace superchip, a tightly coupled package using NVLink chip-to-chip interconnects that provide memory coherence across the LPDDR5 memory banks and that consumes only around 500 watts, and it gets plenty interesting for the HPC crowd. That yields a total of 144 Arm Neoverse “Demeter” V2 cores with the Armv9 architecture, and 1 TB of physical memory with 1.1 TB/sec of peak theoretical bandwidth. For some reason, probably relating to yield on the LPDDR5 memory, only 960 GB of that memory capacity and only 1 TB/sec of that memory bandwidth is actually available. If Nvidia wanted to do it, it could create a four-way Grace compute module that would be coherent across 288 cores and 1.9 TB of memory with 2 TB/sec of aggregate bandwidth. Such a quad might give an <em>N-1</em> or <em>N-2</em> generation GPU a run for the money. . . .</p>
<p>For reference, we did <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/03/25/nvidias-grace-arm-server-chip-is-a-game-changer/">our initial analysis on the Grace chip</a> at launch back in March 2022, <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/08/29/details-emerge-on-nvidias-grace-arm-cpu/">drilled down into the architecture of the Grace chip</a> in August 2022 (when no one was sure what Arm core Nvidia was using as yet), and <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/09/13/other-than-nvidia-who-will-use-arms-neoverse-v2-core/">went deep into the Demeter V2 core</a> in September 2023 when Arm released details on the architecture. We are not going to get into the architecture all over again but we will remind you that the Arm V2 core that Nvidia adopted for Grace (rather than design its own core) has four 128-bit SVE2 vector engines, making it comparable to the pair of AVX-512 vector engines in an Intel Xeon SP architecture and therefore able to run classic HPC workloads as well as certain AI inference workloads (those that aren’t too fat) and maybe even the retraining of modestly sized AI models.</p>
<p>The data recently published out of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the State University of New York campuses in Stony Brook and Buffalo certainly bear this out. Both groups published some benchmark results pitting Grace-Hopper and Grace-Grace superchips on a wide variety of HPC and AI benchmarks, and it shows what we already surmised: if you look at thermals and probably cost, the Grace CPU is going to be able to pull its weight in HPC.</p>
<p>Both organizations published papers out of the <a href="https://sighpc.ipsj.or.jp/HPCAsia2024/">HPC Asia 2024 conference</a> held in Nagoya, Japan last week. The one that came out of BSC is called <em>Nvidia Grace Superchip Early Evaluation for HPC Applications</em>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3636480.3637284">which you can read here</a>, and the one from the Stony Brook and Buffalo researchers is called <em>First Impressions of the Nvidia Grace CPU Superchip and Nvidia Grace Hopper Superchip for Scientific Workloads</em>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3636480.3637097">which you can read here</a>. Together, the papers present a realistic view of how key HPC applications perform on Grace-Grace and Grace-Hopper superchips. The paper from the SUNY researchers is more useful perhaps because it brings together performance figures from multiple HPC centers and one cloud builder. To be specific, the data from the second paper draws on performance data from Stony Brook, AWS, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Texas Advanced Computing Center, and Purdue University.</p>
<p>BSC compared the performance of the Nvidia Grace-Grace and Grace-Hopper superchips, which are part of the experimental cluster portion of its <a href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2022/06/16/atos-wins-marenostrum-5-deal-at-barcelona-supercomputing-center/">MareNostrum 5 system</a>, against the X86 CPU nodes of the prior MareNostrum 4 supercomputer, which was based on nodes comprised of a pair of 24-core “Skylake” Xeon SP-8160 Platinum processors running at 2.1 GHz. Here is a handy dandy block diagram of the MareNostrum 4 nodes compared to the Grace-Hopper and Grace-Grace nodes:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143604"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper.jpg" alt="" width="1130" height="240" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper.jpg 1130w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-768x163.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-600x127.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1130px) 100vw, 1130px"></a></p>
<p>On the Grace-Hopper nodes, BSC only tested various HPC applications on the CPU portion of the superchip. (The Stony Brook team tested the CPU-CPU pair and the CPU-GPU pair in its evaluation of the early adopter Nvidia systems.)</p>
<p>Here is another handy dandy table that BSC put together comparing the architectures of the three systems tested:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143605"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients.jpg" alt="" width="541" height="414" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients.jpg 541w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsc-marenostrum-vs-nvidia-grace-hopper-salients-80x60.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px"></a></p>
<p>BSC says that the early access versions of the Grace processor had CPUs that were geared down to 3.2 GHz and that the memory bandwidth was also geared down from what Nvidia expected that full production units would have. The exact amount was not quantified, but the unit tested had a clock speed of around 3.2 GHz on the Grace CPU.</p>
<p>As for applications, BSC ran its homegrown Alya computational mechanics code as well as the OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics, the NEMO oceanic climate model, the LAMMPS molecular dynamics model, and the PhysiCell multicellular simulation framework on the three types of nodes. Here is the rundown on how the Grace-Grace nodes compared to the MareNostrum 4 nodes. We are ignoring the Grace-Hopper nodes since the GPUs were not used and since it should be roughly half the performance of the Grace-Grace nodes. Take a look at these speedups when the same number of cores are used:</p>
<ul>
<li>On the Alya application, Grace-Grace was 1.67X faster to 1.81X.</li>
<li>On OpenFOAM, the speedup with Grace-Grace was 4.49X.</li>
<li>On NEMO, the speedup was 2.78X.</li>
<li>On LAMMPS, the speedup was 2.1X to 2.9X for the same number of cores, varying from 1 to 288.</li>
<li>On PhysiCell, the speedup was 3.24X for the same 48 cores on each node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the Grace-Grace unit has three times as many cores, so the node-to-node performance should be in proportion to this.</p>
<p>The Stony Brook paper also did a bunch of benchmarks and collected results from other machines, as we pointed out above. Here is the table showing the relative performance of the various nodes running the HPC Challenge (HPCC) benchmark, with the Matrix, LINPACK and FFT elements pulled out separately:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143607"><img decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc.jpg" alt="" width="1121" height="380" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc.jpg 1121w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc-768x260.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcc-600x203.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1121px) 100vw, 1121px"></a></p>
<p>It has been a long time since we have seen benchmark data with error bars, which are obviously always present because of the difficulty of making readings and which most tests do not include. Anyway, at the socket level, the Grace-Grace superchip performance somewhere between an Intel “Ice Lake” and “Skylake” Xeon SP and somewhere higher than a “Milan” and “Rome” AMD Epyc. (Beautiful tables, but the way. <em>Thank you</em>.)</p>
<p>On the much tougher High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) test, which stresses the balance between compute and memory bandwidth and which often makes supercomputers look pathetic, here is how the Grace-Grace superchip stacked up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143608"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="206" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg.jpg 1014w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg-768x211.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-hpcg-600x165.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p>
<p>Here is how Grace-Grace stacked up on OpenFOAM, using the MotoBikeQ simulation with 11 million cells across all machines:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143609"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="158" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam.jpg 1014w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam-768x162.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-openfoam-600x127.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></a></p>
<p>We would have expected for the Grace-Grace unit to do better here. <em>Hmmm.</em></p>
<p>And finally, here is how the Gromacs molecular dynamics benchmark lined up on the various nodes, with both CPU-GPU and CPU-only variations:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-143606"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs.jpg" alt="" width="650" height="397" srcset="https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs.jpg 897w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs-768x469.jpg 768w, https://www.nextplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stony-brook-x86-versus-nvidia-grace-hopper-gromacs-600x367.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px"></a></p>
<p>We have a winner! Look at how well that Grace-Hopper combination does. But any CPU paired with the same Hopper GPU would probably do as well. On the CPU-only Grace-Grace unit, the Gromacs performance is almost as potent as a pair of “Sapphire Rapids” Xeon Max Series CPUs. It is noteworthy that the HBM memory on this chip doesn’t help that much for Gromacs. <em>Hmmmm</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is some food for thought about the Grace CPU and HPC workloads. There are other benchmarks in the Stony Brook paper, so be sure to check them out.</p>

	<p>The bittersweet consequence of YouTube’s incredible growth is that so many stories will be lost underneath all of the layers of new paint. This is why I wanted to tell the story of how, ten years ago, a small team of web developers conspired to kill IE6 from inside YouTube and got away with it.</p>

<p>I do not recall the exact triggering event that led to our web development team laying out plans to kill IE6 over lunch in the YouTube cafeteria. Perhaps it was the time I pushed out a CSS stylesheet that included an attribute selector on a semi-supported HTML element. Any reasonable web developer would expect this to be ignored by browsers not up to the task. This was not the case with older flavors of IE. Under very specific conditions, an attribute selector on an unsupported HTML element in IE would create an internal recursion that would at best, cause the browser to crash and at worst, trigger a blue screen of death. Or perhaps it was the hundredth time one of our software engineers had innocently pushed out an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag with an empty src attribute. Nobody joining the team could be expected to know that in early versions of IE, the browser would load the root path “/” for empty src attributes. The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag would suddenly behave like an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, loading our homepage and all of its dependent resources in what could become an exponentially expanding recursive loop. Whenever an empty image tag found its way on to the homepage, it was all-hands-on-deck emergency to locate and replace the offending code before we melted our servers into paperweights.</p>

<p>Regardless of whatever the event at that time was, it had been brutal and it had been IE6 related. IE6 had been the bane of our web development team’s existence. At least one to two weeks every major sprint cycle had to be dedicated to fixing new UI that was breaking in IE6. Despite this pain, we were told we had to continue supporting IE6 because our users might be unable to upgrade or might be working at companies that were locked in. IE6 users represented around 18% of our user base at that point. We understood that we could not just drop support for it. However, sitting in that cafeteria, having only slept about a few hours each in the previous days, our compassion for these users had completely eroded away. We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers? We openly daydreamed about cubicle workers around the world suddenly inventing creative “business” reasons for needing upgraded browsers. Grandparents would hold their technically savvy grand-kids hostage, demanding they fix their “YouTubes”. What had begun as a team therapy session started to materialize into an actual plan, a plan we quickly realized we were uniquely positioned to execute on. </p>

<p>The plan was very simple. We would put a small banner above the video player that would only show up for IE6 users. It would read “We will be phasing out support for your browser soon. Please upgrade to one of these more modern browsers.” Next to the text would be links to the current versions of the major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, IE8 and eventually, Opera. The text was intentionally vague and the timeline left completely undefined. We hoped that it was threatening enough to motivate end users to upgrade without forcing us to commit to any actual deprecation plan. Users would have the ability to close out this warning if they wanted to ignore it or deal with it later. The code was designed to be as subtle as possible so that it would not catch the attention of anyone monitoring our checkins. Nobody except the web development team used IE6 with any real regularity, so we knew it was unlikely anyone would notice our banner appear in the staging environment. We even delayed having the text translated for international users so that a translator asking for additional context could not inadvertently surface what we were doing. Next, we just needed a way to slip the code into production without anyone catching on.</p>

<p>The IE6 Deprecation Banner on YouTube in 2009</p>

<p>It turned out that a handful of us had entered YouTube at an interesting time… several months after YouTube had been acquired by Google but before Google had begun deeply integrating YouTube into their larger organization. The early YouTube engineers were rightfully territorial and initially hesitant to adapt to Google’s infrastructure and norms. With their penchants for gray-hat hacking, fast cars, and hard whiskey and an uncommon number of piercings, tattoos, and minor arrest records, many had been rejected during previous Google interviews. Ending up at YouTube instead, they found themselves breaking their backs to stay ahead of exponentially growing traffic while having to constantly defend against critics explaining how Google Video would imminently kill them. By the time they were acquired into Google, many of these engineers had come to view their outcast identity as a critical component of their eventual success. </p>

<p>To cement their authority over the YouTube codebase during the integration into Google, the early engineers created a specialized permission set called “OldTuber”. OldTuber granted you the ability to completely bypass the new Google-oriented code enforcement policies, enabling anyone holding it to commit code directly to the YouTube codebase, with only the most glancing of code reviews from anyone. No need for code readability. No need for exhaustive tests. No need for maintaining code coverage. If you broke the site by improperly wielding OldTuber status, it was on your head and you would lose the privilege immediately, if not your job. So you just had to be a good citizen and never break the site. Our boss, an early YouTube engineer himself, had gone out of his way to ingratiate the web development team with the rest of the early YouTube engineers. Through his efforts, a couple of us eventually found ourselves in possession of OldTuber status, despite never having been a part of the original team. It was like we were just walking down the street when someone mistook us for valets and handed us the keys to their Ferrari. For better or for worse, we were not exactly the types to just hand the keys back and walk away. We saw an opportunity in front of us to permanently cripple IE6 that we might never get again. If this went at all wrong, a number of us would surely be fired. Our most renegade web developer, an otherwise soft-spoken Croatian guy, insisted on checking in the code under his name, as a badge of personal honor, and the rest of us leveraged our OldTuber status to approve the code review. The code merged into production and our banner went live a few days later.</p>

<p>The first person to come by our desks was the PR team lead. He was a smart, dapper man who was always bubbling with energy and enthusiasm. Except this time. This time he was uncharacteristically prickly. He had come in on an otherwise normal day to find email from every major tech news publication asking why the second largest website on the planet was threatening to cut off access to nearly a fifth of its user base. Fortunately for us, the publications had already settled on a narrative that this was a major benefit to the Internet. By their call, YouTube was leading the charge towards making the web a faster, safer experience for all of its users. The entire PR team had Macs running Chrome and could not even see what we had done, let alone issue comments to the press on any of it. They were caught completely unaware. We eagerly told them everything about what we had launched and helped them craft the necessary talking points to expand on the narrative already established by the media. Satisfied that he could get back in front of the story, the PR team lead turned and warned us to never do anything like this without telling him first. He did not want to let great public relations opportunities like this slip by ever again.</p>

<p>Next came the lawyers. Two senior lawyers sprinted over to our desks in a state of buttoned-down panic. They immediately demanded that we remove the banner. We explained how we would need the SREs to do an emergency push and that it would take at least a few hours to do. Frustrated, one of the lawyers  asked “Why did you have to put Chrome first?” Confused, I explained that we did not give any priority to Chrome. Our boss, in on the conspiracy with us, had thoughtfully recommended that we randomize the order of the browsers listed and then cookie the random seed for each visitor so that the UI would not jump around between pages, which we had done. As luck would have it, these two lawyers still used IE6 to access certain legacy systems and had both ended up with random seeds that placed Chrome in the first position. Their fear was that by showing preferential treatment to Chrome, we might prick the ears of European regulators already on the lookout for any anti-competitive behavior. While the lawyers conceded that nothing we had done would have likely risen to that level of offense, it had happened on their watch and they did not appreciate that. I repeatedly cleared the cookies in my copy of IE6 and showed the browsers reshuffling with each refresh. Content with the demonstration, the lawyers quickly retreated back to their desks without any further concerns.</p>

<p>I expected the next people to be the engineering managers and that they would be the angriest given how clearly we had abused our OldTuber status. Suspiciously, nobody came by that day. The next day, a handful of engineers stopped by to congratulate us on the launch of the banner after reading articles around the Internet, but that was it. I asked my boss if he was getting any blowback and he shrugged, indicating that nobody had pulled him aside yet. It seemed that for the moment we were in the clear. Surprised and unable to make sense of this, I probed one of the managers about what he thought about the banner launching. He responded “Oh, I just figured you guys copied the banner that Google Docs had put up.” I was confused. How could Google Docs have beaten us to the punch on this? I opened up Google Docs in IE6 and sure enough, a banner very much like ours was showing at the top. It implored their users to upgrade to avoid breaking features in terms similarly vague to ours.</p>

<p>I had met a few engineers on the Google Docs team while working on some shared Javascript libraries. I reached out to one and asked how they had arrived at the decision to launch their own banner. He explained to me that they had been wanting to deprecate IE6 support for a long time but their managers would not let them for the same reasons we had always heard. One of their engineers testing in IE6 had noticed the YouTube banner pretty shortly after it went live and immediately took it to their manager as evidence as to why they should do the same. Shortly thereafter, the Google Docs engineers whipped up their own IE6 banner and pushed it into production, presumably under the mistaken assumption that we had done our diligence and had received all of the necessary approvals. The first time many Googlers heard chatter about IE6 banners was from email threads where other teams had begun asking if they could deprecate IE6 like Google Docs had. Luck would have it that this had included many of our managers. Amazingly, we had somehow bypassed detection as the originators of the IE6 banner inside of Google.</p>

<p>Eventually the YouTube engineering management did ask themselves how the decision to deprecate IE6 was ultimately made, given it happened so quickly and seemed conspicuously premature for a media site of our scale and with such a wide user base. Once they realized what had happened, they cornered our boss for details, grappled with the consequences of our actions and begrudgingly arrived at the conclusion that the ends had justified the means. Between YouTube, Google Docs, and several other Google properties posting IE6 banners, Google had given permission to every other site on the web to add their own. IE6 banners suddenly started appearing everywhere. Within one month, our YouTube IE6 user base was cut in half and over 10% of global IE6 traffic had dropped off while all other browsers increased in corresponding amounts. The results were better than our web development team had ever intended. </p>

<p>We somehow got away with our plan to kill IE6 without facing any meaningful corrective action. Few people even knew we were involved at all and those that did, did not want to bring attention to it or risk encouraging similar behavior. At a beer garden in San Francisco, our boss, winking his hardest, made us swear to never do anything like this again. We agreed, toasted IE6 falling into single digit percentages, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/06/23/bzzzzzz-youtube-gets-a-vuvuzela-button-seriously/">and never snuck anything into production again.</a></p>

   <p>It was the first day of spring break in 1992 in Phoenix,  and 12-year-old Heather Smith was excited for her family's upcoming ski trip.</p>   <p>But before Smith and her family had even packed their snow pants, she realized she didn't feel good. "I woke up feeling just a little bit nauseous, and I wasn't sure why. Throughout the course of the day, I started to feel worse and worse and started to develop pain in the abdomen," she says. </p>   <p>By about midafternoon, her father took her to urgent care. She ended up getting emergency surgery to have her appendix out.  </p>   
   <p>Smith still has a small scar from the appendectomy. And after the surgery, she found herself intrigued by the part of her body she had so suddenly lost. "It inspired me to wonder: Why do we have this weird little organ in the first place? What does it do? Why does it get inflamed?"</p>   <p><a href="https://facultyprofiles.midwestern.edu/55-heather-f-smith">Smith</a> grew up to be a professor of anatomy at Midwestern University and editor-in-chief of a journal called <a href="https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/loi/19328494"><em>The Anatomical Record</em></a><em>.</em> And all these decades later, Smith has made a mark in the field by studying the very organ that threw off her family's vacation plans in 1992. </p>   <p>She acknowledges that the appendix has a bad rap as a useless organ that can cause you pain and require emergency surgery. "But it turns out recent research shows it does have functions that can help us," she says.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510351/short-wave">NPR's <em>Short Wave</em> </a>spoke to Smith about what the appendix is good for and how a future where appendicitis can be prevented or treated without emergency surgery could be on the way.</p>   <p><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. </em></p>   <p><strong>What and where is the appendix?</strong></p>   <p>The type of appendix that humans and some primates and rodents have looks like a little worm. It's about the size of your pinky finger, and it projects off the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine. </p>   
   <p>You can identify the location based on a landmark called McBurney's point. So if you draw a line between your bellybutton and the part of your pelvis that sticks out [on the right], two thirds of the way down, that's about where the appendix is.</p>   <p><strong>How did scientists get the idea that the appendix was useless?</strong></p>   <p>There had been a lot of discussion about what the appendix might do as a function, whether it served a function, prior to [Charles] Darwin's time. The [fact] that we can live without it does provide some support for the idea that it's vestigial and it doesn't really do anything. And so Darwin's interpretation of it as a vestige was reasonable at the time, given the information that he had. </p>   <p>But now with modern technology, we can see things like the microanatomy and the biofilms in the appendix, and we have a better understanding of what it is and what it's doing.</p>   <p><strong>How has the appendix evolved over time? </strong></p>   <p>If you map the distribution of appendices across a phylogeny — a tree of mammal life — you can interpret that the appendix has actually <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jeb/article/22/10/1984/7324393">evolved independently</a>. It has appeared independently multiple times throughout mammalian evolution. So that is evidence that it must serve some adaptive function. It's unlikely that the same type of structure would keep appearing if it wasn't serving some beneficial role.</p>   <p><strong>So what are the appendix's beneficial roles? </strong></p>   <p>It turns out that the appendix appears to have two related functions. The first function is supporting the immune system. The appendix has a high concentration of immune tissue, so it's acting to help the immune system fight any bad things in the gut. </p>   <p>The second function that it serves is what we refer to as the safe house. So this was a hypothesis that was put forward by a team from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17936308/">Duke University in 2007</a>. And they argued that the appendix may serve as a safe reservoir for the beneficial gut bacteria that we have. </p>   
   <p>During times of gastrointestinal distress — you know, a diarrhea episode where all of your good gut bacteria is getting kind of flushed out of the system — the appendix is kind of this blind tube with a very narrow diameter and narrow lumen, so the good bacteria doesn't get flushed out of the appendix. The idea is it's safe during this time of gastrointestinal distress and it can then exit the appendix and recolonize this good bacteria throughout the rest of the gut. </p>   <p>So the appendix is kind of helping us in two ways, both within the gut: It's helping to fight off invading pathogens, but also to repopulate the gut with this beneficial bacteria after gastrointestinal issues.</p>   <p><strong>Why do some people get appendicitis?</strong></p>   <p>Appendicitis is predominantly happening in the industrialized nations of the world — areas where fiber content of the diet tends to be lower. So one hypothesis is that, with the lower fiber content, we're more likely to get little pieces of food that's being digested stuck [inside] the appendix and cut off blood supply and cause this inflammation. </p>   <p>The other hypothesis that doesn't seem like it's quite as plausible these days has to do with an old idea called the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that these days we do so much oversanitization, with all of our antibacterials and all our antibiotics that we take, that our immune systems are not developing properly because they don't have exposure to the full range of pathogens that we would otherwise. And so the immune system overreacts and panics. And because the appendix has so much immune tissue, it's one of the areas where this manifests.  </p>   <p><strong>Could this new understanding lead to new treatments?</strong></p>   <p>I think there's some promising treatments out there. People are looking into antibiotics and other ways of treating appendicitis without completely removing it, given the evidence that is accumulating that it is in fact helpful for your health to have an appendix. Studies have shown that infections with the really bad, nasty bacteria <em>C. diff</em> tend to be higher in people who have had their appendix removed. </p>   
   <p>So there are health benefits to retaining the appendix. In an ideal world, we would have a future where we wouldn't have to always remove it.</p>   <p><strong>What have you gained from studying this "weird little organ"?</strong></p>   <p>I think this study has shown me the importance of looking into small anatomical details. Anatomy is just the study of the body, so you'd think that it's a dead science. You'd think we know everything about the body, especially the human body. </p>   <p>But it turns out that there's actually a lot more variation and function and microanatomical adaptations that haven't been fully realized. So doing just descriptive studies of exotic animals that have never been described or looking at small parts of our own bodies that haven't been well documented are absolutely worthwhile.</p>

      <p>Last September I hopped on board with <a href="https://www.wallapop.com/">Wallapop</a> as a Search Data Scientist and since then part of my work has been working with <a href="https://solr.apache.org/">Solr</a>, an open source search engine based on <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a>. I’ve got the basics of how a search engine works, but I had this itch to understand it even better. So, I rolled up my sleeves and decided to build one from scratch.</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk goals. Ever heard of the “<a href="https://www.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis/">Small Website Discoverability Crisis</a>”? The problem it’s basically that small websites, ones like this one, are impossible to be found using Google or any other search engine. My mission? Making those tiny websites great again. I believe in bringing back the glory of the little guys, away from the Google SEO frenzy.</p>

<p>In this post I will walk you through the journey of buliding a search engine from scratch using Python. As usual, all the code I’ve written can be found on my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/alexmolas/microsearch">microsearch repo</a>). This implementation doesn’t pretend to be a production-ready search engine, just a usable toy example showing how a search engine works under the hood.</p>

<p>Also, let me be sincere and admit I’ve exaggerated a little bit in the post title. Indeed, the search engine I’ve implemented is around 80 lines of Python, but I’ve also written some complementary code (data crawler, API, HTML templates, etc.) that’s over makes the whole project a bit bigger. However, I think the interesting part of this project is the search engine which has less than 80 lines.</p>

<p>PS. After writing this post and <code>microsearch</code> I realized that Bart de Goede did <a href="https://github.com/bartdegoede/python-searchengine">something similar</a> a couple of years ago. My implementation is very similar to Bart’s, but in my case, I think I did some things better, in particular (1) my crawler is async, which makes things much faster, and (2) I’ve implemented a user interface that allows to interact with the search engine.</p>

<h2 id="microsearch">microsearch</h2>

<p>Now, let’s delve into the components that make up <code>microsearch</code> and explore how I crafted each element: (1) the crawler, (2) the inverted index, (3) the ranker, and (4) the interface. In the following sections, I’ll provide both theoretical descriptions and practical details on how each concept was implemented in my project.</p>

<h2 id="crawler">Crawler</h2>

<p>The first step to building a search engine is to have data to search. Depending on your use case you can crawl existing data (as <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers">Google</a> does) or you can use your own data (as Wallapop or any other e-commerce/marketplace does).</p>

<p>Since one of my intentions was to build a “local Google” I decided to use data from the blogs I follow to build the search engine. In this case, crawling consists of downloading and cleaning all the posts of a certain list of blogs. To make it easier I’ve only crawled posts of blogs with RSS <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. And to make it faster, I’ve used the <code>asyncio</code> Python library. Using asynchronous code has sped up the crawling time from 20 minutes to 20 seconds.</p>

<p>In my case, I’ve used a list of 642 RSS feeds. Of these feeds around 100 are the ones I usually read (blogs about ML, data science, math, etc.), and I scrapped the other 500 from <a href="https://github.com/surprisetalk/blogs.hn">surprisetalk blogs.hn project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inverted-index">Inverted index</h2>

<p>An inverted index is a data structure that maps keywords to documents. This data structure makes it trivial to find documents where a certain word appears. When a user searches for some query the inverted index is used to retrieve all the documents that match with the keywords in the query.</p>

<p>To implement the inverted index I’ve used a <code>defaultdict</code> with the signature <code>dict[str, dict[str, int]]</code>. This is, a mapping that given a word (a <code>str</code>) returns another mapping from URL (a <code>str</code>) to the number of times that word appears in the URL (a <code>int</code>). The default value of the mapping is a mapping from URL to <code>0</code>, so if we try to get the value of a keyword that doesn’t exist in a URL we get a zero.</p>

<p>The logic of the inverted index is defined within a class called <code>SearchEngine</code>. We initialize it with two private dicts.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SearchEngine</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>))</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then we implement the <code>index</code> methods, which receives an URL and its content, normalizes the content (ie: remove punctuation, everything to lowercase, etc.), and then add it to the index.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>index</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>[</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>content</span>
    <span>words</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>content</span><span>).</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>" "</span><span>)</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>word</span> <span>in</span> <span>words</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>[</span><span>word</span><span>][</span><span>url</span><span>]</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To make the indexing process more usable we can implement a bulk index option, which receives a list of URLs and documents and index them.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>bulk_index</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>documents</span><span>:</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>tuple</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]]):</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span> <span>in</span> <span>documents</span><span>:</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>index</span><span>(</span><span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Finally, we can read the index using the <code>get_url</code> method, which receives a keyword and returns the URLs that contain the keyword.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get_urls</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>keyword</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>keyword</span> <span>=</span> <span>normalize_string</span><span>(</span><span>keyword</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>[</span><span>keyword</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, to index the document <code>Foo</code> with the text <code>Hello, World! My name is Foo!</code>, and the document <code>Bar</code> with the text <code>Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!</code> and then search for the word <code>Foo</code>, we can do it as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> from microsearch.engine import engine
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Bar"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.get_urls<span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>)</span>
defaultdict<span>(</span>&lt;class <span>'int'</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 1, <span>'Bar'</span>: 1<span>})</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.get_urls<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span><span>)</span>
defaultdict<span>(</span>&lt;class <span>'int'</span><span>&gt;</span>, <span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 1, <span>'Bar'</span>: 1<span>})</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="ranker">Ranker</h2>

<p>Once you have a set of matching documents for a given query, you need a way to sort them. The most famous ranker is Google’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>, which ranks documents based on the links. However, other options to rank the documents exist, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25">BM25</a>, which ranks documents based on the content. In my case, I decided to use the standard BM25. The score between a query $Q$ and a document $D$ is computed as</p>

\[\sum_{i=1}^n \text{IDF}(q_i) \frac{f(q_i, D)\times(k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, D) + k_1 \left(1 - b + b \frac{|D|}{\text{avgdl}}\right)}\]

<p>where the query $Q$ contains the keywords $q_1$, $q_2$, …, $q_n$, the document $D$ has length $|D|$, the average length of a document is defined as $\text{avgdl}$, $k_1$ and $b$ are free parameters, $f(q_i, D)$ is the number of times that keyword $q_i$ appears in the document $D$, and finally $\text{IDF}(q_i)$ is the inverse document frequency, computed as</p>

\[\text{IDF}(q_i) = \ln \left(1 + \frac{N - n(q_i) + 0.5}{ n(q_i) + 0.5}\right)\]

<p>where $N$ is the number of documents and $n(q_i)$ is the number of documents containing $q_i$. There are other ways to compute the IDF, but apparently, you can justify this option from theoretical grounds.</p>

<p>With all this math we are ready to implement the missing part of our <code>SearchEngine</code> class. Firstly we add the constants $k_1$ and $b$ as parameters of our class</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>SearchEngine</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>k1</span><span>:</span> <span>float</span> <span>=</span> <span>1.5</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>float</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.75</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_index</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>int</span><span>]]</span> <span>=</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>lambda</span><span>:</span> <span>defaultdict</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>))</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>:</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{}</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>k1</span> <span>=</span> <span>k1</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>b</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>now we expose some useful properties that we’ll use later</p>

<div><pre><code><span>@</span><span>property</span>
<span>def</span> <span>posts</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>list</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>list</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>.</span><span>keys</span><span>())</span>

<span>@</span><span>property</span>
<span>def</span> <span>number_of_documents</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>)</span>

<span>@</span><span>property</span>
<span>def</span> <span>avdl</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span> 
    <span>return</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>len</span><span>(</span><span>d</span><span>)</span> <span>for</span> <span>d</span> <span>in</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>.</span><span>values</span><span>())</span> <span>/</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_documents</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>With this information, we are ready to implement our BM25 scorer. The first thing we need to implement is the inverse document frequency method</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>idf</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>kw</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>N</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>number_of_documents</span>
    <span>n_kw</span> <span>=</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>get_urls</span><span>(</span><span>kw</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>log</span><span>((</span><span>N</span> <span>-</span> <span>n_kw</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>n_kw</span> <span>+</span> <span>0.5</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and with this method, we can finally implement the BM scorer. This method receives a keyword and returns a mapping from all the URLs that contain that keyword to their score.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>bm25</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>kw</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>dict</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>]:</span>

<p>This method receives a keyword, and for all the indexed documents it computes the BM25 score for that keyword. With this method we can finally implement the <code>search</code> method, which will be the one we’ll use to make queries to our search engine.</p>

<p>The <code>search</code> method receives a query, normalizes it, extracts its keywords (ie: splits it by space), computes the BM25 scores for each keyword, and returns a dictionary of URLs with their total score.</p>

<p>Following the same example as before, we can use it to search as</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> from microsearch.engine import engine
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Foo"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.index<span>(</span><span>"Bar"</span>, <span>"Hello, World! My name is Bar, I'm not Foo!"</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.search<span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 0.19869271730423296, <span>'Bar'</span>: 0.16844281759753774<span>}</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> engine.search<span>(</span><span>"foo bar"</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span><span>'Foo'</span>: 0.19869271730423296, <span>'Bar'</span>: 0.8088260293054897<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Putting everything together, we have a search engine class that implements the functionalities to index and search documents in less than 80 lines of code.</p>

<p>Finally, once we have a search engine, we want to expose it somehow. In my case, I decided to build a small FastAPI app that exposes an endpoint with the search engine, and then it also renders a simple webpage that allows you to search. To make the output easier to read I decided to just select the top-N URLs.</p>

<p>If you run it you’ll see something like</p>

  <figcaption>Search Engine interface.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>then you can introduce your queries using the search box and search the indexed documents. For example, if I search for <code>how to build a search engine?</code></p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->
<figure>
  <img src="https://www.alexmolas.com/docs/search-engine/search-results.png" alt="Search results for the query `how to build a search engine`." width="700">
  <figcaption>Search results for the query `how to build a search engine`.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I’m aware this is not the nicest UI ever, and the UX can be improved a lot. However, it works fast, the results aren’t so bad, and most importantly, I’ve built it myself from scratch.</p>

<h2 id="missing-features">Missing features</h2>

<p>For the readers who usually work with search engines, it’s obvious that there are a lot of missing features in my implementation. This is a non-exhaustive list of what it’s missing.</p>

<ul>
  <li>This implementation doesn’t have <strong>query operators</strong>, ie operators that allow you to tune how the query behaves. For example, if you google <code>how to build a search engine -solr</code> you’ll get results that don’t contain the word <code>solr</code> in them.</li>
  <li>The reverse index works by indexing single keywords, and there’s no option to <strong>index n-grams</strong>. Google allows you to search for <code>"search engine"</code> (notice the double quotes) and it’ll only show you results where the two words appear in this specific order.</li>
  <li>Also, this implementation doesn’t have <strong>query or document expansion</strong>, so if you search <code>engine</code> you won’t get documents with the word <code>engines</code>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>crawling and indexing parts are independent</strong> but we could implement it in such a way that the indexing happens during the crawling, ie: as soon as we have a document we index it. This could be done asynchronously as well.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I’ve enjoyed a lot working on this project. It has helped me to understand better how Solr works under the hood, and while I still have a lot to learn I think I have a better intuition now.</p>

<p>As a side effect, I’ve also learned how amazing is writing asynchronous code for IO-bounded operations. My first implementation of the crawler took ages to finish, and with the async implementation, it took a moment to finish.</p>

<p>My next step on my journey to build a personal search engine is to implement semantic search capabilities in the search engine. I’ve been playing a bit with embedding models and ANN, so my next step is to add this functionality to microsearch. Keep tuned for more!</p>

<div>

<p>After reviewing the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen7-8700g-linux">Ryzen 7 8700G</a> and the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-ryzen5-8600g">Ryzen 5 8600G</a> as these new Zen 4 processors with RDNA3 integrated graphics, the latest AMD 8000G series CPU in the Linux benchmarking lab at Phoronix is the Ryzen 5 8500G. The Ryzen 5 8500G is a 6-core / 12-thread processor with RDNA3 graphics that retails for just $179 USD. Here's a look at how it's performing against other AMD and Intel processors on Ubuntu Linux. The Ryzen 5 8500G ends up being decent on the GPU side but making me genuinely excited is the Zen 4C prospects in the low-power space for AI workloads at the edge, low power servers, and other different deployments for great low-power performance. Under load this AVX-512 wielding budget desktop processor was typically pulling 50 Watts or less!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_1_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_1_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G box"></a></p>
<p>Like the 8600G that retails for $229 USD, the Ryzen 5 8500G is also a 6-core / 12-thread part with RDNA3 graphics. However, with the 8500G it has a 3.5GHz base frequency compared to 4.3GHz with the 8600G while both boost up to 5.0GHz. The other big difference is that while the Ryzen 5 8600G is made up of all Zen 4 cores, the 8500G consists of two Zen 4 cores and then four Zen 4C cores. The denser, more power efficient Zen 4C cores are found on the 8500G (and Ryzen 5 8300G) while still maintaining the same 65 Watt TDP rating as the rest of the 8000G series.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_2_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_2_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G processor"></a></p>
<p>The Ryzen 5 8500G also has Radeon 740M RDNA3 integrated graphics with four graphics cores clocking up to 2.8GHz compared to the Radeon 760M graphics on the Ryzen 5 8600G with 8 graphics cores at 2.8GHz. The flagship Ryzen 7 8700G as a reminder has Radeon 780M integrated graphics with 12 graphics cores at 2.9GHz. Another difference with this sub-$200 processor is there is no Ryzen AI support unlike with the 8600G/8700G models. Most though won't be particularly missing out on Ryzen AI right now... The software support for now is limited and it was only very recently that <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-XDNA-Linux-Driver-Ryzen-AI">AMD released an XDNA Linux driver</a> that is still to-be-tested at Phoronix. So for the near-term the lack of Ryzen AI with the Ryzen 5 8500G isn't any real loss but over the longer term if the software ecosystem support for it expands and AI continues to be widely embraced by more Linux desktop software, it will be more of a penalty without it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_3_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_3_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G bottom"></a></p>
<p>The Ryzen 5 8500G does still have a 6MB L2 cache and 16MB L3 cache like the 8600G model. While the default TDP is 65 Watts, there is a configurable TDP from 45 to 65 Watts. The cTDP benchmarks of the 8000G series will be part of follow-up benchmarks on Phoronix.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/image-viewer.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_4_lrg" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=amd-ryzen-5-8500g&amp;image=amd_ryzen8500g_4_med" alt="AMD Ryzen 5 8500G heatsink"></a></p>
<p>Also as follow-up benchmarks will be looking in close detail at the Zen 4 vs. Zen 4C core performance on the Ryzen 5 8500G among other interesting benchmarks.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ben.page/scammed">https://ben.page/scammed</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39291322">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>A few weeks ago, I got scammed buying a camera on Facebook Marketplace.</p><p>I bought the camera from a profile that was created in 2017. They had some other things for sale, too. The account looked legit — lots of family photos and comments from family members.</p><p>I paid $1,030 using PayPal, selecting “Goods and Services” because I knew I’d be protected by PayPal in case of a scam.</p><p>They didn’t ship out the item that evening or the next day, so I got antsy and texted them. They finally sent me a UPS tracking link for my package, but then they immediately said they were very worried because I had opened a PayPal claim against them. I had not. I checked my PayPal account. <em>I had?</em> They pleaded with me to close it.</p><p>I know that I didn’t open it. I was eating dinner at the time that it was opened.</p><p>But I realized that, once you close a case on PayPal, you can’t open it again. So when the package arrived and was something else, I would have no recourse.</p><p>Instead of closing it, I pretended that I couldn’t see the case on my end and even sent doctored screenshots of the case not showing up.</p><p>The next morning, I called PayPal and asked them how the seller could’ve opened a case on my behalf against themselves. They weren’t sure.</p><p>I kept the case open. A few days later, while on a bike ride, I received an email that the case had been closed. By me. By me?? I didn’t do that.</p><p>I raced home and called PayPal. Again, they didn’t know how that was possible. But they were understanding and explained that, once the package arrived and wasn’t a camera, I actually could open another case. You just can’t open a case a second time for the <em>same issue</em>. But the scammer opened an “Item not received” case against themselves, and I could file again as “Item not as described.”</p><p>The UPS package was delivered a few days later — according to the tracking number, at least. It was signed for by “ATWOOD.” I don’t know anyone named Atwood.</p><p>I called UPS. For security reasons, they couldn’t tell me where the package was headed, but they did confirm that it wasn’t my address or my name. It was an address in Lexington though, so the UPS tracking website would show “Lexington, MA” (but it doesn’t show the exact address, which the scammer must’ve known).</p><p>I called PayPal again and explained. They took the tracking number and called UPS, and were somehow able to find out exactly where the package was heading. (This feels like it was against UPS protocol.)</p><p>I looked up the address and found that it was for Lincoln Labs, an MIT lab in Lexington. I guess the scammer chose a random commercial address that was in Lexington.</p><p>They logged all this as evidence, and re-opened the “Item not received” claim. The scammer now had 10 days to provide evidence to the contrary, otherwise I would automatically be refunded.</p><p>10 days later, I woke up to see that the scammer had added a tracking number to the case. It was the same tracking number they had given me, the one that PayPal knew wasn’t headed to me, so that was perfect. I logged into PayPal, and… <em>I</em> had closed the case. Again. This time at 2am, while I was asleep.</p><p>I spent 2.5 hours on Saturday morning calling PayPal, and eventually got to someone who was very helpful. I had to explain that I actually <em>didn’t</em> close that case. They re-opened the case for a second time, and escalated it so the “back-office team” could review in a few days. I just hoped that the scammer wouldn’t close the case on my behalf for a third time.</p><p>A few days later, I received the final update: I was refunded $1,030. <em>whew.</em></p><p>I’m still not sure how the scammer was able to open and close cases on my behalf. My theory is that they were able to spoof my phone number and call PayPal support and do it over the phone. (They asked early on for my phone number “for the tracking information,” which in retrospect doesn’t make a lot of sense.)</p><p>But in any case, I got my money back! Thanks PayPal :)</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>A woman in Connecticut suddenly began getting mail advertisements for cremation services soon after she completed chemotherapy, according to a startling anecdote in a <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/AG/Press_Releases/2024/CTDPA-Final-Report.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>new report by the state’s attorney general’s office</u></a>. According to the report, she was added to a marketing list for the cremation company by a data broker.&nbsp;</p><p>Arielle Garcia, former chief privacy officer at the marketing firm UM Worldwide, first caught the cremation <a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/what-do-we-say-to-emily-the-human-cost-of-advertising-data-abuse/?ref=404media.co"><u>anecdote in a column for the blog AdExchanger</u></a>, where she wrote “We can guess how the marketing logic flowed … ‘Inference: Terminal Illness?’ ‘Interest: Likely Purchase – Burial/Cremation.’”&nbsp;</p><p>We don’t know specifically what happened in this Connecticut case, whether it was extrapolated from location data, or how a data broker decided to put her on this specific list. The FTC has previously noted that data brokers often are able to <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014/140527databrokerreport.pdf?ref=404media.co"><u>get access to medical records</u></a> or other medical information. But laws like the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, which give consumers the right to “delete personal data provided by, or obtained about, the consumer” and allows the state attorney general to investigate and publicize complaints about data brokers, is showing just how unsettling some of this targeting can be.&nbsp;</p><!--members-only--><p>After the woman filed a complaint under the state’s new data privacy law, the attorney general’s office investigated why this happened, and found that a “data broker identified the individual for the marketing list” for the cremation services company. “This matter has brought to light the close interplay between data brokers and data analytics firms in the digital marketing landscape.”&nbsp;</p><p>The woman and the companies involved are not identified in the report, but it states that the state office of the attorney general “issued a cure notice” to the cremation services company, which suggests that it found some level of wrongdoing. I’ve requested a redacted version of the complaint and the investigation both through the attorney general’s press office and through a public records request.&nbsp;</p><p>Over the years, our reporting has shown how granular and insidious data brokers can be, and Joseph’s reporting in particular has highlighted how data is harvested and sold from highly sensitive sources all the time. His reporting has shown, for example, that cell phone location data <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vzjb/location-data-abortion-clinics-safegraph-planned-parenthood?ref=404media.co"><u>could be bought for abortion clinics</u></a>; other research has shown that it can be trivially easy to de-anonymize this type of data (if it is even anonymized in the first place). Last month, the FTC finally stopped a single data broker, called X-mode, <a href="https://www.404media.co/impact-ftc-stops-x-mode-selling-sensitive-location-data/"><u>from selling sensitive location data</u></a>.</p><p>The Connecticut attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After the whirlwind of team activity that was <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">our initial Vision Pro teardown</a>, we’ve been digging much, much deeper into those dual displays, the multitude of sensors, the lenses, and that beautifully-overengineered battery pack. And not to spoil the surprise, but we’ve found that those dual displays are utterly incredible: You can fit more than 50 Vision Pro pixels into the space of a single iPhone 15 Pro pixel. Yes, you read that right.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/x8otrZt8bt_-Igqn5YnuHtk_DtEfflOVvw7dcXgiJn6tz5riSj7ILCq_ukfKy95hgE559U8Un319Mjx3vdcpqhUh0b7huhHIBqf9k75XPP_X5vfQNJcBz_FzS0e0GN8zo0iJDZpXnwVJUSzb_N-hxQo" alt=""></figure></div>


<h2>Displays</h2>



<p>Apple says that the Vision Pro’s displays offer “more pixels than a 4K TV for each eye.”&nbsp; But what exactly does 4K, or any K, mean <em>this</em> close to your eyeballs? Your phone has a much higher pixel density than your TV, for example, and yet you cannot see the pixels on either in normal use. So let’s get into the details, guided by our senior tech writer <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/2315556/Arthur+Shi">Arthur Shi</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>First up, let’s talk about the two measurements that matter. Pixels per inch, or PPI, is what it sounds like—the number of pixels crammed into a given area of the screen. It’s an absolute measure, based on the physical properties of the device.</p>



<p>Then there are pixels per degree (PPD). PPD takes into account your distance from the screen. The closer your eyes get to the screen, the easier it is for you to make out individual pixels, which is why your phone’s screen needs a higher resolution than your TV, and why a movie at the theater looks fine, even though it may only be 2K. So what does that mean for the Vision Pro?</p>



<h2>Pixels Per Inch, Where Size Matters</h2>



<figure><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" width="1922" height="844" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213444/Vision-pro-lens-stack.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213444/Vision-pro-lens-stack.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213444/Vision-pro-lens-stack-1536x674.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>Each lens assembly has a pancake lens array, a housing with embedded eye-tracking cameras, and a display panel. The display panels are most likely made by Sony—possibly a custom version of their <a href="https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/products/microdisplay/oled.html">microOLED displays</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The display doesn’t light up from edge to edge, so we’re only counting the lit portion of each panel. The lit sensor area measures around 27.5&nbsp;mm wide by 24&nbsp;mm high, or about one inch by one inch. Using an <a href="https://www.olympus-ims.com/en/microscope/dsx/">Evident Scientific DSX1000 microscope</a>, we measured the pixels at 7.5 μm (the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2998922/#:~:text=The%20discocyte%20shape%20of%20human,contained%20in%20the%20RBC%20cytosol.">size of a red blood cell</a>). Each pixel is roughly a square: red and green sub-pixels stacked on top of each other, with a double-sized blue sub-pixel on the side. With those measurements, the lit area totals 3660 px by 3200 px. That equates to 12,078,000 pixels smushed into 0.98 square inches!</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211331/AVP-pixels.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>But the corners are cut off, so that reduces the pixel count even further. It’s asymmetrical, with triangular corner cut-off areas of 6.95 mm<sup>2</sup>, 11.52 mm<sup>2</sup>, 9.9 mm<sup>2</sup>, and 10.15 mm<sup>2</sup>, totaling 38.52 mm of deactivated screen. Compare that to the total area of around 660&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>, and we see that the corners cut off 5.3% of the total, leaving 11,437,866 visible pixels per panel. Counting both panels and a margin of error on our side, that’s the 23,000,000 pixels Apple claims.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1922" height="778" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211930/Vision-Pro-interior-screen.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211930/Vision-Pro-interior-screen.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06211930/Vision-Pro-interior-screen-1536x622.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Sensor with screen-captured image superimposed to demonstrate the lit area.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Divide those pixels by the length/width, and you can calculate the PPI (pixels per inch), which as mentioned is a measurement of pixel density. The Vision Pro comes in at a stunning 3,386 PPI. This, says Arthur, “is AMAZING PPI!” (his caps, not mine).</p>



<p>That many pixels must make the Vision Pro 4K, right? The horizontal resolution on the panel doesn’t <em>quite</em> make it to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution">consumer 4K UHD standard</a> of 3,840 pixels wide. In short, this is a seriously high-res display. But it’s not <em>technically</em> 4K, which is why Apple didn’t simply call these 4K panels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s certainly the highest-density display that we’ve ever seen. For comparison, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has around 460 PPI, which means you can fit ~54 Vision Pro pixels into a single iPhone pixel.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XIaNN13vzyyvQKCTpmA4ybYcd6SDfh5VkMr6PvIKJnaTOteIcnrUnEzA8K2Bkmeogo5cB_IBxJpjeY5H0FbbffENvcQ-oSxWomSzC22iJNR3UbLjAnox7t9aK9bdJ9U3ujvbeMEbXjZPyKc0TR7CQXA" alt=""></figure>



<p>Or how about the 12.9-inch iPad Pro? That has 264 PPI, making the Vision Pro 12.8x finer. For a direct comparison to another VR headset, the HTC Vive Pro has ~<a href="https://versus.com/en/htc-vive-pro-2">950 PPI</a> (4896 px × 2448 px), less than a <em>third</em> of the Vision Pro, and the Meta Quest 3 has ~1218 PPI. Don’t worry, it gets weirder.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pixels Per Degree: It’s All About the Angle</h2>



<p>A high pixel density alone doesn’t guarantee a great visual resolution. Consider a 65″ 4K TV, which has a “paltry” 68 PPI. But your 4K movie still looks great on it. Why? Because you’re sitting pretty far away from the TV, effectively shrinking all the pixels down to a small area. The further away you sit, the higher the PPI scales. Think of how the Jumbotron at your local sports venue doesn’t look pixelated when you’re sitting across the stadium.</p>



<p>Because of this, VR engineers like to use a slightly fancier metric to measure display “goodness”: angular resolution, measured in <a href="https://pimax.com/five-ways-the-crystal-is-different/">pixels per degree</a>, or PPD. This is the number of horizontal pixels per degree of viewing angle, and it lets us compare between displays with different resolutions, designed to be viewed at different distances.</p>



<p>But even that isn’t the whole story, for a variety of reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>The PPD changes from the edge of the screen vs. the center.</li>



<li>Lenses intentionally distort and tweak the PPDs in wonky ways.</li>



<li>Stereoscopic views affect how many “pixels” are seen, muddying calculations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>With a rough measurement of 100° FOV (Field of View), we </strong><strong><em>estimate</em></strong><strong> the Vision Pro to have an average of 34 PPD.</strong> In comparison, a 65″ 4K TV viewed 6.5 feet away is 95 average PPD, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max held 1 foot away is 94 average PPD. Even though the pixel density and physical dimensions are drastically different between the iPhone and the 65” TV, they end up having similar PPD simply because of how they’re viewed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/iY2zEUio8NBfFbEqJ3O_rs8TQrgkMyZOA0Xw-ZXZYV4oG48lbGMZaHWUkWgPtrqP5TcpzqsWLH0uj9A5jMdFo5ntjbix8_Jh-RlLbPxOUZOiyZ52I-V0nI28YHOHyn5fg0dDo0JpoDvBP5oUoyy5-VE" alt=""></figure>



<p>Tl;dr: The Vision Pro may have an ultra-high resolution (PPI) display, but because it’s so close to the eye, it has low angular resolution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a final example, friend of iFixit <a href="https://kguttag.com/2023/08/09/apple-vision-pro-part-5b-more-on-monitor-replacement-is-ridiculous/">Karl Guttag has a blog post explaining</a> why using the Vision Pro as a replacement for a good monitor is “ridiculous.” The gist is that when you beam the Mac’s output into the Vision Pro, and suspend it in the air in front of you, you’re only using a small portion of the available pixels. Even if the Vision Pro’s displays were really 4K, you’d only be using a small central section, with the rest of the pixels used to show the surrounding room.</p>



<p>This, says Karl, makes for a virtual Mac display with low enough PPD to see individual pixels—not quite the standard desktop display experience. So while you will totally be able to use your Mac in your virtual world, you will prefer an <em>actual</em> 4K or 5K monitor for fine work.</p>



<p>Then again, even if you shell out 200 bucks for the huge carrying case, the Vision Pro is way more portable than an Apple Studio Display.</p>



<h2>Lenses</h2>



<p>Wearing glasses under your VR headset is less than ideal—Apple’s answer is to add accessory lenses inside, for the Vision Pro, those lenses are made by noted German optics specialist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG">ZEISS</a> and snap into place magnetically.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/b9zgPhShorA_SrsDhKT2sI35l1Q8Mb2FG8Y9BcX2sQ25X031wxzowYYBmSus0Zo-5jmNT27zr_wW5j8ldarRMTy0BqAVYFP9qyx5g242e85v5doOoogeO1B6Yn-p9w1Ljk0Fj0PBo6cFA6NqtQ_hpDo" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>Each lens comes with a pairing code, although this isn’t <em>quite</em> the same kind of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">parts pairing</a> we usually deal with. These codes don’t lock a component to a single device. If you want to remove your prescription lens inserts from your own Vision Pro and drop them into a friend’s unit, you can. You’ll just have to pair them with the new headset by inputting the same code. The Vision Pro they’re being swapped into has to know the prescription of those lenses and calibrate accordingly, hence the little QR-type code you scan by looking at it during the setup process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, it <em>is</em> parts pairing in that a secret handshake code is required to install lenses—giving ZEISS a solid monopoly, at least for now. It also means that any typos or shipping snafus might <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/the_vision_pro">render your new lenses useless</a>, at least temporarily.</p>



<p>You’d think that submitting a prescription would be enough to get the Vision Pro calibrated with your lenses—even if Apple is doing <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/117731">some fancy footwork</a>—but without transparency, we can’t be sure.</p>



<p>The Vision Pro has another small problem for spectacles wearers. Contrary to some reports, Apple <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213965">says that corrective lenses are available</a> for most conditions, including astigmatism (which we weren’t sure about <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/90137/vision-pro-teardown-why-those-fake-eyes-look-so-weird">in part one</a>), and they also offer bifocals, and progressives. But if you have a prism value included in your prescription, you’re out of luck. Prism correction is used to <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/glasses-contacts/what-is-prism-correction-in-eyeglasses">correct for diplopia</a>, or double vision. The easiest way to see if your vision prescription is supported is to use <a href="https://www.zeiss.com/vision-care/us/zeiss-optical-inserts/prescription-guide.html#prescriptionchecker">ZEISS’s online tool</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The theme of this device appears to be that well-tailored comfort is fairly simple to achieve, as long as you go through the official channels.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Batteries</h2>



<p>By Apple logic, a complex device requires an equally complex battery solution. The hefty battery bank—$200 from Apple if you want to buy it separately—is both super simple and hilariously over-engineered.</p>



<p>Looking like a bulked-up first-gen iPhone, the case is milled out of a single chunk of aluminum, and the lid snaps into place with firm perimeter clips, leaving little to no seam for us to pry at. We needed a hammer and chisel to open it up! Adhesive also lines the lid, just to make sure you get the message: this pack is not designed to be opened.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1922" height="811" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06212145/AVP_TD_EDITED_160.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06212145/AVP_TD_EDITED_160.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06212145/AVP_TD_EDITED_160-1536x648.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>As for the battery cells themselves, Apple’s using three iPhone-battery-sized packs stacked atop each other, connected in series. We pulled out an iPhone 15 Plus battery to compare and found that it’s ever-so-slightly smaller in area while being a tad thicker.</p>



<p>The cells in our Vision Pro pack are listed at 15.36 Wh a piece, suggesting a 46.08 Wh total capability. That doesn’t quite track with the 35.9 Wh rating etched on the pack’s (gorgeous) aluminum enclosure. This, at first glance, looks like Apple’s undershooting the Watt-hour rating by over 20 percent. Apple’s no stranger to battery life debacles, so there’s a chance they’re purposefully undercharging the cells for longevity—the same reason they just released an 80% charging limit on the iPhone 15 Pro. Or perhaps they’re calculating Wh differently, accounting for thermal losses, or something else.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1922" height="814" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213624/vision-pro-battery.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213624/vision-pro-battery.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06213624/vision-pro-battery-1536x651.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Left: One of three battery cells with factory 15.36 Wh ratings. Right: Battery pack labeled 35.9 Wh—10 Wh less than expected.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Apple is clearly obsessive over the user experience with this battery, packing in temperature sensors and an accelerometer (so it displays the charge LED when you hold it up, and might even detect when you are wearing the pack). If you’re putting a battery in your pocket for two hours straight, then you really, really don’t want it to get hot.</p>



<p>The pack is also outputting a non-USB-standard 13 volts to keep up with the Vision Pro’s processing demands, which is one explanation for the bespoke “big Lightning” cable—so you don’t accidentally plug other devices in and fry them. It also explains why you can’t just plug it straight into a USB-C battery pack. In fact, the Vision Pro’s battery pack has enough tech to act as an uninterruptible power supply, providing it specific, clean power even when plugged into the wall.</p>



<p>All in all, it seems like Apple is taking the risks of wearing a battery really, really seriously, rather than trying to pack in as much juice as possible. This is also a great illustration of why easily swappable batteries are a good idea—you don’t need to go wild with the Watt-hours if you can just grab a spare, even if it’s a $200 spare.</p>



<h2>Chip ID</h2>



<p>Apple highlighted the Vision Pro’s M2 chip and the new R1 chip in their announcement. But, what about the rest? And did you hear about the abnormally complex charging board in the battery pack?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We got you covered! <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+Vision+Pro+Chip+ID/169813">Head over here to check out <em>all</em> the chips in the Vision Pro.</a></p>



<figure><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Apple+Vision+Pro+Chip+ID/169813"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/BKQPbMpIZikWbHsrd9GxJDSwpj2PtotdmcNa_FzscBazS5eKiXyAAmyZs7Ag2T-m2iulzL-psz5s3IWvQZW6iCvqPDFPTMJ6elk8RYoNiWP_5IZb1PQSUiJrdKS8i4r5DQewfipUFWFvC246Rj_14EM" alt=""></a></figure>



<h2>Sensors</h2>



<p>Apple’s biggest advantage over other headset makers comes in the form of sensors, kind of. Yes, anyone can slap a bunch of cameras, a LiDAR scanner, and all that other stuff into a headset, but Apple’s sensors have a secret weapon: years of experience analyzing, interpreting, and fusing complex sensor data and multiple iterations of sensor design.</p>



<p>Remember when Apple added LiDAR to the iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro in 2020? Yes, it makes for <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/10/apple-introduces-iphone-12-pro-and-iphone-12-pro-max-with-5g/">better low-light photos</a>, distance measurements, and accessibility features for the visually impaired. But we have a hunch that Apple had another motive: The LiDAR sensor in the iPad Pro let Apple test AR features in a pretty low-stakes environment, putting the hardware into mass production, gaining both valuable expertise and user feedback.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><video controls="" loop="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/07060044/Rotation-White-Background_watermark.mp4"></video><figcaption>Thanks to Creative Electron for this awesome CT scan and animation!</figcaption></figure>



<p>The front-facing Face ID <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102381">TrueDepth camera</a> is another great example of Apple’s sensor tech. The Face ID array has a laser that projects infrared dots onto your face, a flood illuminator that bathes your face in IR, and an IR camera that can see it all. This is processed to create a 3D map of your face. Apple got so good at this that it uses the Face ID array to scan your ears, in order to create a custom 3D model that tailors AirPods’ spatial audio to your ear shape.</p>



<p>The result? Room mapping without the need for guardrails. Face mapping for the (admittedly somewhat creepy) Memoji V2 aka Persona. And no need for handheld controllers.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06220821/Vision-Pro-IR-Footage.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Another Apple specialty is accelerometers—and the interpretation thereof. You can find them in the iPhone, in the Apple Watch (where it can detect whether you have fallen and call emergency services), and even in the original HomePod. When it detects that it has been moved, the HomePod re-listens to the room and recalibrates its audio accordingly. The AirPods have accelerometers to detect your tap-commands. All of this requires advanced interpretation of sensor data, which Apple has gotten good at year after year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We might be taking a closer look at those sensors, but it’s not the hardware that really matters in this case. It’s the way Apple has honed the production and reliability of these sensors over the years and integrated them with software designed to milk the most from them.</p>



<h2>Repairability</h2>



<p>Coming up with a repairability score for the Vision Pro is just as challenging as calculating the subjective resolution of the displays.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Vision <em>Pros</em></h3>



<p>On the one hand, there’s a lot to like here. The battery is modular, so it’s trivial to swap in a fully charged one, or replace a flagging unit after a year or two of hard use—even if you can’t actually hot-swap the battery without powering down the headset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Equally modular are the side straps. Granted, these contain speakers that are virtually impossible to excavate, but the combined assembly is modular and pops off with a SIM-card tool. The power port is integrated into one of the band assemblies, so it’s also semi-modular. We also like the easy-to-fit lens inserts and the magnetically attached light shields.</p>



<p>“The super-modularity—to a level where it’s less of a component and more of a feature, like different bands—makes it so that even Apple has how-to’s on its site,” says iFixit repairability engineer <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/3399692/Carsten+Frauenheim">Carsten Frauenheim</a>.</p>



<p>We’re really relieved to see that all of the parts that touch your skin are easily removable, including the light seal and light seal cushion. <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/75533/how-ifixit-scores-repairability">When we score for repairability</a>, we look for easy access to consumable and easily breakable parts. Notably, the optics, screens, and moving parts for the inter-pupillary distance adjustment are on the eye-side as opposed to behind the fragile front glass. Prying up the fabric layer from its clips to access the adjustment is considerably less risky than trying to remove the expensive 3D glass in one go.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fjEMzekSkfukk5lxSzlwc9t7uxBmQ1ebLjkDtGal4JbZ0G-DnVZynycPSn7JFUuqYxYmYvSIv68FPd5lXmqlHRaLATXg6wp6HNPuScDpTKJ-B25uP84lyeFXvlkCLaVN9suUQFoxflBPNIPRXdcgt0Y" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Vision Cons</h3>



<p>But on the other hand, getting to the front cameras and sensors—or anything behind the front glass—is a real headache. That glass cover needs a lot of careful finessing with a heat gun and multiple prying tools to remove in one piece. Sure, if you kill the EyeSight while trying to break in, it’s not the end of the world. The real danger is that cracking the glass might render the sensors behind it useless, simply by blocking their view.</p>



<p>Our repair scoring heavily weights parts like the screen and battery that are necessary for the function of the device. It’s hard to argue that the EyeSight display is a critical component. But the external sensors <em>are</em> essential, and if you break the glass and obscure them, then the device will stop functioning correctly.</p>



<h3>The Competition</h3>



<p>So how does the Apple Vision Pro compare on the repairability scale to head-mounted displays (HMDs) from competitors? Arguably the most important comparison is to Meta’s Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets, which together dominate the VR and AR (collectively XR) markets with a roughly <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/29398/vr-headset-kpis/">70%</a> market share.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer to that question, along with almost anything related to XR hardware, is that it’s complicated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s take the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56892/oculus-quest-2-teardown-into-the-metaverse">Quest 2</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/84572/meta-quest-3-teardown-and-the-future-of-vr-repairability-en">Quest 3</a> as examples. Both are designed with a front-loaded headset secured by a replaceable harness, much like the Vision Pro. What differentiates Meta’s headsets from most others is that it’s also a standalone device, unlike the Valve Index, HTC Vive, and PS VR2. But that’s where the similarities between the Quest 2 &amp; 3 and the Vision Pro end.</p>



<p>Where the Vision Pro has an external battery pack, both the Quest 2 and Quest 3 have their lithium polymer batteries buried inside the device, to the point that it’s one of the last things you’d remove in a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Meta+Quest+2+Headset+Battery+Replacement/169153">highly complex</a> repair. A battery replacement is the most likely and common repair, and in that category, the Vision Pro is a clear winner. That’s because the Vision Pro’s battery puck, while an integral part of the otherwise unpowered device, is an external component.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="2960" height="1548" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06214135/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-9.41.04-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06214135/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-9.41.04-PM.png 2960w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06214135/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-9.41.04-PM-1536x803.png 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06214135/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-9.41.04-PM-2048x1071.png 2048w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/02/06214135/Screenshot-2024-02-06-at-9.41.04-PM-1721x900.png 1721w" sizes="(max-width: 2960px) 100vw, 2960px"><figcaption>Quest 2 Headset Battery Replacement Guide: Step 59 and you still can’t see the battery.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Where the Vision Pro fails is the fragility of the front glass, combined with the complexity of the User Interface (UI). Imagine you trip over the non-MagSafe battery cable and the headset tumbles onto your equally beautiful hardwood floor, shattering the glass EyeSight cover.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/MsxdlkHuUHVKIWM5IC89l2fAupKVUY6xFxKHVGNz0s6dR4FjM79WKUQMIVp1iFK1fCbrqVKZaqalR4hknmyOG5Ueq2hAaWWWPjsgcg_7Yk4YEZTuyLjCzq2iJEuzMWWwn5tXSAs8ERDA59WUw6ZHgkA" alt=""><figcaption>Meta Quest Pro and Meta Quest 3 headsets.</figcaption></figure></div>


<div><p>Even if every sensor is still functional, they will be blinded. When the external cameras’, LiDAR sensor’s, and IR emitters’ line of sight is interrupted by cracked glass, your hands won’t track correctly. Since there are no controllers (unlike most other HMDs), anyone with a broken front glass will have to lean on <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/apple-vision-pro/get-started-with-accessibility-features-tan426c48bdc/visionos">accessibility features</a> like voice control.</p><p>The Quest 2 and Quest 3 fare much better on durability. For one, the exterior shell is made of plastic, which is far less fragile than glass. The cameras are recessed in their own notch on the case, thereby being a completely separate module from the rest of the HMD, allowing for easier repair and replacement.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Similar to the Vision Pro, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/68350/if-the-meta-quest-pro-is-the-future-of-computing-well-never-be-able-to-fix-it">Quest Pro</a> buries its cameras and sensors under the front plastic, but that front plastic is held in place by clips that simply pop off, allowing for easy and cheap repairs.</p>



<h3>The Score</h3>



<p>When we give a repairability score, we pick which components to evaluate based on what we’re seeing in the rest of the product category. But XR hardware is so bleeding edge that everything from the exterior build to the basic means of navigation still varies wildly from device to device and generation to generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, we spent a long time talking about how to handle the Vision Pro’s lack of controllers. For other HMDs, we’ve considered how easily replaceable the controller batteries and buttons will be. Should we expect that fewer XR devices will have controllers going forward? The Quest 2 is still the most common VR headset on the market and will likely remain so for a few years, owing to its accessible price point. On the other hand, the Vision Pro (and its intuitive UI) is likely to set the tone for future headsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This presents a challenge for scoring on the repairability scale, as marrying the current “low-tech” hardware of today with the complex factory-calibrated sensors of tomorrow requires a compromise. On the one hand, we must consider the dominant hardware currently in the market, while ensuring we don’t unfairly penalize the intuitive technology of tomorrow’s HMDs.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/CPOIDEjZfVVxCPUKNGymEyhiwuqKhPpNMIRfrg6WHYM86ma2YBN_Xga7XkD9PVBXhv3vjGlpvGRIRVOkDhZc7ExcJ_f9SDMFm3u4s-ZIIbrfEs9x6P1EIiPHLk16VLCegUDBn8IX5WB1F-LOEXyIxdg" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>Okay, we’re done philosophizing for now—so, what does this pricey piece of ultra-dense tech earn repair-wise? While we don’t know enough to apply a concrete score, we’re comfortable assigning <strong>a provisional 4/10 on the repairability scale</strong>.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="400" height="535" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2023/10/13100337/4_Provisional_Repairability-Score_Drop-Shadow.png" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>The bottom line? It’s wild to look at an Apple device this complex and see a replaceable battery. Yes, it’s maybe closer to a power supply, and yes, it’s expensive. But when it comes down to it, Apple looked at a device and intended for parts to be replaced. That’s pretty major. The bar is really that low, folks—there are <em>still</em> HMDs without replaceable pads. Do we wish that the battery pack had replaceable cells? Of course. Is this pretty impressive for Apple’s first foray? Also yes.</p>



<h2>Visions of the Future</h2>



<p>We’ve yet to complete testing on many aspects. Currently, iFixit engineering intern <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/User/3634920/Chayton+Ritter">Chayton Ritter</a> has Apple’s proprietary battery cable splayed out on a breadboard, and is trying to determine what sort of electronic handshakes are required to make the Vision Pro accept battery packs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And we’ve also been busy swapping internal parts between two headsets to check for the presence of iFixit’s nemesis—parts-pairing. Nothing conclusive so far, but we’d love to hear your experiences while we investigate.</p>



<p>While the future of XR may not yet be here, we think that’s a good thing. By being conscious of the tech we buy, we encourage manufacturers to make better tech. By holding manufacturers accountable for what they create, we can ensure that repairability is considered at an early stage of the design process, and incorporated wherever possible.&nbsp;Our hope is that, by the time these things get shrunken into a pair of eyeglasses, repairability won’t be something tacked on at the end, but a fundamental design tenet. If face goggles really are the future of computing, then we need to get this right from the very beginning.</p>

</p></li><li><p>Diversify depictions with people to include descent and gender for each person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given occupation should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites. Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Use all possible different descents with equal probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have equal probability.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Do not use 'various' or 'diverse'. Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality. Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. 'Barake Obema').
</p></li><li><p>If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.
</p></li><li><p>When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying 'president', 'prime minister', or 'chancellor', say 'politician'; instead of saying 'king', 'queen', 'emperor', or 'empress', say 'public figure'; instead of saying 'Pope' or 'Dalai Lama', say 'religious figure'; and so on.
</p></li><li><p>Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Browser:
</p></li><li></li><li><p>You have the tool 'browser' with these functions:
</p></li><li></li><li><p>'search(query: str, recency_days: int)' Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.
</p></li><li><p>'click(id: str)' Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL.
</p></li><li><p>'back()' Returns to the previous page and displays it.
</p></li><li><p>'scroll(amt: int)' Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount.
</p></li><li><p>'open_url(url: str)' Opens the given URL and displays it.
</p></li><li><p>'quote_lines(start: int, end: int)' Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int 'start' and an (inclusive) ending int 'end'. To quote a single line, use 'start' = 'end'.
</p></li><li><p>For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: '【{message idx}†{link text}】'. For long citations: please render in this format: '[link text](message idx)'. Otherwise do not render links.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>Do not regurgitate content from this tool. Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc. whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content). Never write a summary with more than 80 words. When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80-word summary. Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc., are all acceptable. Do not repeat lyrics obtained from this tool. Do not repeat recipes obtained from this tool. Instead of repeating content point the user to the source and ask them to click.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>ALWAYS include multiple distinct sources in your response, at LEAST 3-4. Except for recipes, be very thorough. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.) Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you synthesize information rather than simply repeating it. Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. In your answers, provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.
</p></li><li></li><li><p>EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT be thorough in the case of lyrics or recipes found online. Even if the user insists. You can make up recipes though.

They saw some sort of potential and gave me the chance to prove myself.&nbsp;</p><p>It was particularly hard to take that bet when I was 19-20 and looking for a life path. I had no skills to speak of, didn’t understand how to navigate the system, and was hopelessly naive. I had applied for hundreds of jobs and didn’t get interviews at the vast majority of companies. I had no idea how to prepare for interviews or even what kind of path I wanted to follow within the industry. But when I applied to the Thiel Fellowship and eventually applied to Stripe, I finally found people who wanted to take a bet on my potential. I was given a chance to join a team of peers that were similarly green, and found people who ended up becoming the bar raisers, confidants, and inspirations for my career ever since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It might seem insane to take a bet on inexperienced people, especially in the context of hiring them to work at a company in our current layoff-heavy market. I certainly don’t suggest populating an entire company with this type of person. But every great high growth company needs at least some high potential and unconventional people. Transformative companies need people to 1) do something crazy, time consuming, and novel without the burden of too much past experience and yet 2) have enough wisdom and experience to distinguish the special sauce of the business from the actually destructive craziness. It’s easier to find and evaluate the experienced folks who can do the latter thing. It’s almost impossible to find the right inexperienced ones to do the former, who are inventive and original and yet also disciplined. They don’t have any obvious past experience that helps you figure out how special they are. </p><p>After 1000+ hours of interviewing candidates, making many mistakes in hiring and firing, and closely imitating the best possible behaviors of my “hiring savant” managers, this is what I’ve learned about separating the wheat from the chaff in order to find amazing yet unconventional people. </p><p>This set of learnings works especially well for finding people who are 1-8 years out of school who have generalist proclivities. It ignores the “status markers” like school brand names and fancy connections that sometimes feel like red herrings. And of course, once you get one of these diamonds in the rough within your company, get ready to provide them with lots of mentorship – they’re truly a lot of work to polish, but the best of them make it all worth it. </p><ol><li><p><strong>Find out their wins above replacement.</strong><span> Through the stories they tell, look to see if the end result of the thing they did would have been significantly worse without their involvement. Try to separate their actions from those of their team or the circumstance. This quality should both highlight their talents and their sense of agency and individuality.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What you’re looking for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Creativity</strong><span> in identifying the bigger problem/opportunity at hand vs. e.g. “taking orders from boss”</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Resourcefulness &amp; follow-through.</strong><span> Most smart people are actually terrible at having the drive/follow through to take things to completion. They’ll usually want to give up at the first sign of failure or slowness. It should feel like this person single handedly dragged [thing] to the finish line despite the environment.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>I really like questions with maximalist qualifiers like "tell me about your best X.” If it's not good, you know that their best isn't good enough.</p></li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>Navigate the world on their own terms.</strong><span> The best high potential youth are often unconventional in some ways. And if you’re looking for someone unconventional and high potential, they’ll often have a rationale for their unconventional approach.&nbsp; Ideally they can describe their weird path in an internally coherent way without being egotistical or defensive.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What you’re looking for:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>A thoughtful vision</strong><span> for their future that indicates some level of originality, broken down into specific life choices. Don’t expect this to be too polished, you should employ some amount of “spidey senses” to glean what they really mean. &nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>“Tell me about you. If your life was a book, give me the chapter titles from your birth till now.” Once you’ve gotten the overview, dive into each “chapter” and plumb the depths for their real stories. Go back to their childhood! I learn a lot about their grit and commitment to excellence from their basketball obsession or maybe their experience caring for a dying parent.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Determine if they have a chip on their shoulder</strong><span>. Do they have something to prove? Where’s the hole they’re looking to fill? Ideally, you’d get someone with obvious talent/drive that is misunderstood by the world. Those types of people will run through walls to reconcile their internal view of themselves with external perception.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What you’re looking for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>A sense of security. </strong><span>You need to be careful to ensure they have a chip on their shoulder, but aren’t pathologically insecure! This is one of the biggest mistakes I’ve made in the past – I found someone young, hungry, and wildly talented. However, they were also deeply insecure about their choices and prone to bouts of indecision and paralysis that crippled them.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Look for positivity.</strong><span> If left to fester for too long, a belief that you’re underestimated can become a toxic trait. They should show optimism and reflect positively on their past experiences while still seeming hungry. If you’re worried about negativity in the interview, know that it will only get worse over time.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Match their energy level</strong><span>, bias towards enthusiasm and high energy to start. They’ll be more willing to open up and share what matters to them when they feel comfortable. Echo what they heard back to them, and of course relate it back to your own motivations in a way that resonates with that person — “this also resonates with me — that’s why I did X too &lt;give example&gt;” You get to the “chips” on the shoulder when they’re comfortable with you.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Highlight challenges and watch how they react</strong><span>. Point out things that could be better about your company that could be in scope for their role&nbsp; — great people are excited by the challenge, not by everything being perfect. It’s a balance: you don’t want to suggest everything’s terrible, but people want to feel impactful. See if they seem undaunted, if they’re excited by the chance to prove themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>High EQ + Persuasion.</strong><span> People who have a clear-headed view of a situation, and the soft skills/influence chops to bend the environment to their will, are especially valuable. It’s an underrated skill.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>“Game recognize game”</strong><span> – it’s all intuition. It’s the feeling that you’re engaged and enjoying the conversation with the person, but you can see the gears moving in their heads as they read the room.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>See how they react with multiple people in the room and how they tailor their words. Review their responses in the “debrief” after the interview with multiple people.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Theory for excellence. </strong><span>"Excellence" is a surprisingly generalizable skill. People who've been great at *anything* are more likely to have the drive and self-discipline to excel even at something unrelated. In 2015, we hired a number of ex-Juilliard musicians with no engineering experience with the assumption that “people who know how to be meticulous and practice like crazy can figure anything out.”&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Examples of past excellence. </strong><span>Did they play D-1 college basketball? Did they play the bass at Julliard? Are they a champion puzzler? Did they design the art for a Dungeons and Dragons card? Excellence is a broad thing, but you know it when you see it! Make sure that you distinguish between “excellence” and “popularity” – excellence does not mean having 100k followers on Twitter!&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Theory of their own competence: </strong><span>Know what they’re good and bad at, what they conceive of as their strengths. They should already be aware of what tools they gravitate towards and what they over-use.&nbsp;Even 20 year olds should know this. </span></p></li><li><p><strong>“Spike potential.”</strong><span> In an interview, I’ll attempt to build a mental picture of the person based on their area of competence, and then start to tailor my questions to that specific profile. For example, if I’ve found an ex-Juilliard harpist who seems like she’d be detail-oriented and meticulous, I’ll then ask myself what the best version of that profile might look like. Since that profile usually spikes really high on “getting shit done” and “execution”, I will start thinking about how to probe into that in particular to search for seeds of future excellence in that regard.</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>&nbsp;What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>You can be direct with these questions, and they’ll vary according to the person’s profile.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>Openness. </strong><span>You are not hiring a finished product, and therefore want to ensure the person is open to improvement and new ideas.&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Coachability: </strong><span>This trait has two aspects: responding well to feedback, and being self-aware enough to assess their own performance.&nbsp;</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Disagree and commit: </strong><span>Can they get out of their own ego and move forward, willingly, even when they don’t agree with the plan?&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>What to ask:&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p>If you can’t probe this via their past experience in life, the scenario/case study is the best way to assess this quality. Have them work on a group interview, a take home exercise, or a role-play. Carefully observe how they react.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Backchannel and references are also excellent here.&nbsp;</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li><p><strong>People who don’t take themselves too seriously. They have to be able to laugh at themselves to succeed.&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>What to look for: </strong><span>This is usually very easy to assess, but look for someone unpretentious and a pleasure to be around.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>What to ask: </strong><span>You know it when you see it.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol></li></ol></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="key-findings">Key Findings</h2>
<ul><li>A network of at least 123 websites operated from within the People’s Republic of China while posing as local news outlets in 30 countries across Europe, Asia, and Latin America, disseminates pro-Beijing disinformation and ad hominem attacks within much larger volumes of commercial press releases. We name this campaign PAPERWALL.</li>
<li>PAPERWALL has similarities with HaiEnergy, an influence operation first reported on in 2022 by the cybersecurity company Mandiant. However, we assess PAPERWALL to be a distinct campaign with different operators and unique techniques, tactics and procedures.</li>
<li>PAPERWALL draws significant portions of its content from Times Newswire, a newswire service that was previously linked to HaiEnergy. We found evidence that Times Newswire regularly seeds pro-Beijing political content, including ad hominem attacks, by concealing it within large amounts of seemingly benign commercial content.</li>
<li>A central feature of PAPERWALL, observed across the network of websites, is the ephemeral nature of its most aggressive components, whereby articles attacking Beijing’s critics are routinely removed from these websites some time after they are published.</li>
<li>We attribute the PAPERWALL campaign to Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd., aka Haimai, a PR firm in China based on digital infrastructure linkages between the firm’s official website and the network.</li>
<li>While the campaign’s websites enjoyed negligible exposure to date, there is a heightened risk of inadvertent amplification by the local media and target audiences, as a result of the quick multiplication of these websites and their adaptiveness to local languages and content.</li>
<li>These findings confirm the increasingly important role private firms play in the realm of digital influence operations and the propensity of the Chinese government to make use of them.</li>
</ul><h2 id="premise-why-exposing-this-type-of-campaign-matters">Why Exposing this Type of Campaign Matters</h2>
<p>Beijing is increasing its <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/09/chinas-increasingly-aggressive-tactics-for-foreign-disinformation-campaigns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>aggressive</u></a> activities in the spheres of influence operations (IOs), both online and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/21/china-global-influence-takeaways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>offline</u></a>. In the online realm, relevant to the findings in this report, Chinese IOs are <a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW1aFyW" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>shifting</u></a> their tactics and increasing their volume of activity. For example, in November 2023 Meta – owner of the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp – announced the removal of five networks engaging in “coordinated inauthentic behavior” (i.e. influence operations) and targeting foreign audiences. Meta <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/integrity-reports-q3-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>noted</u></a> it as a <strong>marked increase in IO activity by China</strong>, stating that “for comparison, between 2017 and November 2020, we took down two CIB networks from China, and both mainly focused on the Asia-Pacific region. This represents the most notable change in the threat landscape, when compared with the 2020 [US] election cycle.”</p>
<p>Seeding ad hominem attacks on Beijing’s critics can result in <strong>particularly harmful consequences</strong> for the targeted individuals, especially when, as in PAPERWALL’s case, it happens within much larger amounts of ostensibly benign news or promotional content that lends credibility to and expands the reach of the attacks. The consequences to these individuals can include, but are not limited to, their delegitimization in the country that hosts them; the loss of professional opportunities; and even verbal or physical harassment and intimidation by communities sympathetic to the Chinese government’s agenda.</p>
<p>This report adds yet more evidence, to what has been reported by other researchers, of the increasingly important role played by <strong>private firms in the management of digital IOs</strong> on behalf of the Chinese government. For example, an October 2023 <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2023/10/dismantling-the-disinformation-business-of-chinese.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>blog post</u></a> by the RAND corporation summarized recent public findings on this issue, and advocated for the disruption of the disinformation-for-hire industry through the use of sanctions or other available legal and policy means.</p>
<p>It should be noted that disinformation-for-hire companies, driven <strong>by revenue, not ideology,</strong> tend not to be discerning about the motivations of their clients. As major <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/feb/15/revealed-disinformation-team-jorge-claim-meddling-elections-tal-hanan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>recent press investigations have shown</u></a>, both their origin and their client base can truly be global. Exposing this actor type, and its tactics, can help understand how governments seek plausible deniability through the hiring of corporate proxies. It can also refocus research on the latter, increasing deterrence by exposing their actions.</p>

<p>On October 25, 2023, the Italian newspaper <strong>Il Foglio</strong> published an <a href="https://www.ilfoglio.it/esteri/2023/10/25/news/la-fabbrica-dei-contenuti-pro-cina-5826677" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>article</u></a>, summarized in English <a href="https://decode39.com/8109/network-fake-china-news-websites-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>, that exposed a small network of six websites posing as news outlets for Italian audiences that did not correspond to any real newsrooms in Italy. Il Foglio’s investigation confirmed that the websites were not registered as news outlets in the national registry, as legally required for any information organization operating within the country.</p>
<p>The identified domains used a specific naming convention: the name of an Italian city in the local spelling (i.e. “Roma”, or “Milano”), followed by mundane terms (for example, “moda”, meaning fashion; “money”; or “journal”). The websites hosted on those domains were all similar in structure, layout, and content, with generic political, crime, and entertainment articles interspersed with a relatively high amount of news related to China, or even directly derived from Chinese news organizations.</p>
<p>Il Foglio claimed that the network was being operated from China, and possibly by the Chinese government, based on content analysis and on the six domains resolving to an unspecified IP address owned by Tencent Computer Systems Inc., a major Chinese corporation. The Italian newspaper also hinted at the possible existence of a broader set of websites linked to the six presented, without publicly disclosing further information.</p>
<p>On November 13, 2023, the South Korean <strong>National Cyber Security Center (NCSC)</strong>, a governmental agency, also published a <a href="https://www.ncsc.go.kr:4018/main/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=SecurityAdvice_main&amp;nttId=88028&amp;menuNo=020000&amp;subMenuNo=020200&amp;thirdMenuNo=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>report</u></a> exposing eighteen Korean-language websites posing as local news outlets. The report attributed these sites to a Chinese PR firm called <strong>Haimai</strong>, based on the firm itself advertising the opportunity for its clients to publish press releases on these same sites. These websites presented strong similarities with the six Italian-language ones exposed by Il Foglio, from their technical structure to the modus operandi utilized.</p>
<p>We set out to research the whole network, with the objective of discovering additional websites, their tactics, targeting, and impact; and of verifying the attribution of the activity to its operators.</p>
<h2 id="an-extensive-network-of-websites">An Extensive Network of Websites</h2>
<h3 id="the-initial-set">The Initial Set</h3>
<p>Based on DNS infrastructure overlaps, we were able to expand the network identified by Il Foglio to an <strong>initial total of 74 domains</strong>. The majority of the domains could be identified through a relatively small set of three IP addresses they resolved to.</p>
<p>The number of domains hosted on these IP addresses is relatively low: they featured a total of less than 100 domain resolutions, while theoretically, each could have hosted thousands of domains. This could indicate that the IPs are only linked to one operator, rather than multiple clients of the provider.</p>
<p>We started from the following six domains, identified in the original news article:</p>

<p>Based on Passive DNS resolution data made available by <a href="https://community.riskiq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>RiskIQ</u></a>, we found that the above domains resolved, during the last two years, to at least one of the following three IP addresses:</p>

<p>Table 3: List of 74 domains also resolving to the same 3 IP addresses as the domains identified by Il Foglio</p>
<p>We verified that — with only four exceptions, highlighted in table 3 — the domains hosted websites posing as news outlets in several countries. <em>The four highlighted exceptions resolved to one or more of the three examined IP addresses before or after the rest of the network was present on them, making their affiliation to PAPERWALL questionable.</em> Additionally, many of them appeared to utilize the naming convention identified for the Italian-language domains (city name, followed by a generic term).</p>
<h3 id="the-broader-network">The Broader Network</h3>
<p>By replicating the same process on the websites highlighted in the NCSC report, we were able to identify additional domains, and confirm them as fully matching the PAPERWALL signature features.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<h4 id="the-website-structure">The websites’ structure</h4>
<p>All of them were built on WordPress, and utilized a (<a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/widgets/WPBakery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>highly popular</u></a>) page builder plugin – <a href="https://wpbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>WPBakery</u></a> – for their setup.</p>
<h4 id="the-domain-infrastructure">The domains’ infrastructure</h4>
<p>As spotted by Il Foglio, the current hosting infrastructure for the six Italian-language domains linked back to Tencent, a Chinese-based company. In fact, the relevant service being utilized is Tencent Cloud; and we could verify that all the currently active domains were being hosted on a Tencent Cloud IP address.</p>
<ul><li>It is important however to note that this is something that any private customer can request, provided that certain requirements given by the host provider are satisfied.</li>
<li>We confirmed in the Tencent Cloud service <a href="https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/378/17985" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>documentation</u></a> that the requirements imposed by the company are minimal: the identity of the individual or company subscribing to the service, a mobile phone number (to be verified through a security code sent via SMS), and a credit or debit card.</li>
<li>This effectively means that any private or corporate subscriber operating the network of websites could have pointed their domains to a Tencent IP address by subscribing to their Cloud service.</li>
</ul><h4><strong>The WordPress users</strong></h4>
<p>We analyzed the usernames utilized to post content on the PAPERWALL websites through a technique called <a href="https://nixintel.info/osint/osint-techniques-whos-behind-a-wordpress-site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>user enumeration</u></a>. This technique revealed that the whole network shared a small number of content author names, visible in the table below.</p>

<h3 id="the-content">The content</h3>
<p>All of the identified websites had almost identical homepage menus, typically including (translated in the target language): Politics, Economy, Culture, Current Affairs, and Sport. The actual content being posted was a mix of scraped and reposted content from local media in the targeted country; press releases; and occasional Chinese state media articles, or anonymous disinformation content. The content could typically be observed as being simultaneously cross-posted across several of the websites at once. We analyze the content in more detail <a href="#ml8xqr602kew"><u>later in this report</u></a>.</p>

In July 2019, updatenews[.]info became the first PAPERWALL domain to be registered. However, due to registration data patterns and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200815000000*/updatenews.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener">archived captures</a> on the Wayback Machine, we can only establish affiliation with PAPERWALL beginning May 2020. The hosted website primarily published news relevant to American readers.
<p>Meanwhile, in April 2020, the domain wdpp[.]org (presumably abbreviated for “World Development Press”) was registered. The website located on a Tencent IP address, which is also linked to updatenews[.]info and 16 other PAPERWALL domains, will be critical to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PGXSyfUmNm11Ugut4AZj-BwuEkOzH3SBUZ-dbauUDPA/edit#bookmark=id.t6erxabz8z4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attribution</a>.</p>
<p>In July 2020, we saw the first group registrations. That month, nine domains were registered, with each hosting a website aimed at Japanese audiences. One of them, <b>fujiyamatimes[.]com</b>, has a footer linking it to <b>“Updatenews”</b>.</p>

<h3 id="political-content-targeted-attacks-and-disinformation">Political Content: Targeted Attacks and Disinformation</h3>
<p>Hidden within much larger amounts of generic content, a smaller portion published by the PAPERWALL network is of a political nature. The following sections break down content types and main features.</p>
<h4 id="targeted-attacks">Targeted Attacks</h4>
<p>A common type of politically-themed content includes <strong>ad hominem attacks</strong>, usually kept in English irrespective of the target audience, on figures perceived by Beijing as hostile. For example, an article titled <strong>“Yan Limeng is a complete rumor maker”</strong> could be found on every active PAPERWALL website as of December 2023. This article contains a direct attack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-Meng_Yan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Li-Meng Yan</u></a>, a Chinese virologist who alleges that the COVID-19 virus originated from a Chinese government laboratory. While her theories <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/12/china-covid-misinformation-li-meng-yan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>have been widely dismissed</u></a> by the global scientific community, the attacks on her by PAPERWALL were unsubstantiated, aimed at her personal and professional reputation, and completely anonymous.</p>

To continue with the example of Li-Meng Yan, we can observe an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240117133951/http://www.milanomodaweekly.com/comunicato/expose-the-con-mans-plot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>attempt at blocking her appointment</u></a> to an alleged academic role at the Perelman Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania that was circulated by the network in October 2023.

<p>This article echoes others that circulated outside of the PAPERWALL network on websites that cannot be confirmed as part of the same network, as well as on blogging platforms. For example:</p>

A review of the other articles posted by the same author, “Dawn Wells”, reveals more targeted attacks on political figures, for example the President of Taiwan, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109065915/https://theinscribermag.com/secret-history-of-tsai-ing-wen-reveals-secrets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Tsai Ing-wen</u></a>.</li>

</ul><p>This suggests that PAPERWALL is used as an amplifier for campaigns targeting specific individuals and anonymously employing an array of additional online platforms to maximize their attacks.</p>
<h4 id="conspiracy-theories">Conspiracy Theories</h4>
<p>A second type of politically themed content present within the PAPERWALL network of websites is conspiracy theories, typically aimed at the image of the United States, or its allies. Claims could include, for example, allegations of the US conducting biological experiments on the local population in South-East Asian countries.</p>

<h4 id="chinese-state-media">Chinese State Media</h4>
<p>A final category of political content disseminated by PAPERWALL often takes the form of verbatim reposts of content from Chinese state media, such as CGTN or the Global Times. Also, in this case, the content usually remains untranslated from English. An example of this scenario is shown in figure 10.</p>

<h3 id="scraping-of-local-mainstream-media">Scraping of Local Mainstream Media</h3>
<p>One of the most evident tactics PAPERWALL employs to disguise its websites as local news outlets is to regularly republish content, verbatim, from legitimate online sources in the target country. Below is an example extracted from the French-language website <strong>eiffelpost[.]com</strong>:</p>

A volume of this magnitude points to the possibility that the process was automated.

<h3 id="commercial-content">Commercial Content</h3>
<h4 id="press-releases">Press Releases</h4>
<p>Mixed with the copy/pasted news content, the PAPERWALL websites typically publish press releases of a commercial nature. These press releases are often posted either in an explicit “Press Release” section or directly on the homepage. A peculiarity of the press release content is that it is usually not translated in the target language, but remains in the original one – which, for the most part, is English.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13.png&amp;nocache=1"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13.png&amp;nocache=1" alt="Dec 15, 2023 screenshot from the homepage of the PAPERWALL website italiafinanziarIe[.]com, showing a press release (in English), mixed with Italian-language legitimate news content (lifted, in this example, from the local news website https://www.rete8.it)." width="724" height="491" title="PAPERWALL: Chinese Websites Posing as Local News Outlets Target Global Audiences with Pro-Beijing Content 13" srcset="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13.png&amp;nocache=1 724w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13-300x203.png&amp;nocache=1 300w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13-501x340.png&amp;nocache=1 501w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13-293x199.png&amp;nocache=1 293w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13-408x277.png&amp;nocache=1 408w, https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/webpc-passthru.php?src=https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/figure-13-180x122.png&amp;nocache=1 180w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px"></a></p><figcaption>Figure 13: Dec 15, 2023 screenshot from the homepage of the PAPERWALL website italiafinanziarIe[.]com, showing a press release (in English), mixed with Italian-language legitimate news content (lifted, in this example, from the local news website <a href="https://www.rete8.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.rete8.it</u></a>)</figcaption></figure>
<h4 id="cryptocurrencies">Cryptocurrencies</h4>
<p>A substantial portion of the press release content is specifically dedicated to cryptocurrency topics. This is consistent with the sourcing of press releases from Times Newswire – which we will analyze in the <a href="#yg6ettshxolr"><u>next section</u></a> – where cryptocurrency topics are among the most common.</p>

<h3 id="content-sourcing">Content Sourcing</h3>
<p>In order to better understand the nature and proportion of the sourcing of content by PAPERWALL, we utilized the backlinks analysis platform provided by <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>AHREFS</u></a>. Backlinks are links created <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/backlinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>when one website links to another</u></a>.</p>
<ol type="1"><li>We extracted all the domains that PAPERWALL backlinked to – therefore including those hosting content published by PAPERWALL – as of November 30, 2023.</li>
<li>We sorted them by the amount of total backlinking PAPERWALL domains, in descending order.</li>
<li>We then manually reviewed and categorized the backlinked domains. The top 25 ones are visible in figure 15.</li>

<p>The results show:</p>
<ul><li>A top layer of <strong>social media</strong> domains, which is unsurprising – individual press releases will typically contain links to the client company’s social media profiles;</li>

<li>Finally, but crucially, approximately 100 domains backlinked to <strong>Times Newswire</strong>, a supposed newswire service.</li>
</ul><h2 id="times-newswire">Times Newswire</h2>
<h3 id="links-to-paperwall">Links to PAPERWALL</h3>
<p>The consistent connection between PAPERWALL and Times Newswire is one of the most peculiar traits of the campaign. While there is certainly no definitive playbook on how online influence operations are conducted, it is uncommon for a network of coordinated websites to regularly draw content from a single publicly available but equally covert source. For example, as seen in <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/"><u>other known disinformation campaigns</u></a>, a typical tactic would be to create copycat domains, mimicking real news sources without revealing where the content was first published. This characteristic makes it possible to analyze the distribution and type of the content and renders the source website a central component of the campaign.</p>
<p>As of November 30, 2023, the alleged newswire service was backlinked to by 98 distinct PAPERWALL domains, out of the total 123. We assess that the vast majority of the backlinks in question consist of <strong>content directly hosted on the Times Newswire website</strong>, and <strong>reposted by the PAPERWALL network</strong>, as seen in a <a href="#kix.wk5eivqukig"><u>previous example</u></a>.</p>
<p>Times Newswire is a known entity in the context of influence operations: it was first reported about in <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-haienergy-us-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>2023</u></a> by Mandiant, a Google-owned cybersecurity company. Mandiant observed Times Newswire’s hosted content disseminated through a network of subdomains for legitimate US-based news outlets in the context of an influence campaign that the company dubbed as HaiEnergy.</p>
<p>Mandiant had attributed HaiEnergy to a Chinese PR firm called <strong>Haixun</strong>, previously identified in their original 2022 <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>report</u></a>; however, in their <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-haienergy-us-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>2023 report</u></a> the cybersecurity firm stated: “we currently lack technical evidence to suggest an underlying connection between Haixun and […] Times Newswire, […] and thus currently view them as distinct entities.” In fact, <strong>timesnewswire[.]com</strong> is – like the PAPERWALL websites – a fully anonymous asset.</p>
<p>It should be noted that – unlike the PAPERWALL websites – <strong>timesnewswire[.]com</strong> offers a “Submit Post” button, hinting at the possibility for registered users to publish content directly to the website. However, once clicked, the button leads to a login page, with no registration module being displayed. The registration of users therefore appears not to happen through the website, and is probably controlled and individually approved by the website’s operators separately.</p>
<p>Similarly to what was stated by Mandiant for the HaiEnergy campaign, we cannot currently attribute Times Newswire to the same operators as PAPERWALL. There are however at least two significant similarities between the newswire and the PAPERWALL network:</p>
<p>The <strong>hosting IP address is also a Tencent one, and on the same AS number (132203) as the PAPERWALL domains. </strong>An Autonomous System (AS) number is a collection of IP addresses “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>under the control of one or more network operators on behalf of a single administrative entity or domain</u></a>.”</p>
<p>43.153.106[.]236, US, Tencent Building Kejizhongyi Avenue, AS132203</p>
<p>Table 5: DNS Resolution of timesnewswire[.]com as of December 21, 2023</p>
<p>Times Newswire also uses a <strong>simple WordPress template</strong> as its main structure. Additionally, it utilizes the <strong>same page builder plugin (<a href="https://wpbakery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>WPBakery</u></a>)</strong> used by PAPERWALL.</p>
<p>Being central to at least two distinct operations – PAPERWALL and HaiEnergy – Times Newswire could however be an independent asset, simultaneously exploited by multiple influence operations.</p>
<h3 id="ephemerality">Ephemerality</h3>
<p>We were able to identify examples of politically-themed articles that were routinely deleted from Times Newswire. For example, we observed ad hominem attack posts on figures in direct conflict with Beijing’s positions that were later removed from the website.</p>
<ul><li>One of these figures was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Hongzhi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>Li Hongzhi</u></strong></a>, founder and leader of the religious movement Falun Gong, that has been <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/2017/battle-china-spirit-falun-gong-religious-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>banned and persecuted in mainland China since 1999</u></a>.</li>
<li>While a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Atimesnewswire.com+%22li+hongzhi%22&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enNL1040NL1040&amp;oq=site%3Atimesnewswire.com+%22li+hongzhi%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Google search</u></a> on the articles mentioning Li Hongzhi currently only returns two articles, a similar search through the Times Newswire content <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/timesnewswire.com/*" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>archived by the Wayback Machine</u></a> showed a total of eight pieces.</li>
<li>All articles are anonymous opinion pieces expressing extremely harsh views on Hongzhi and the religious movement he leads.</li>
</ul><p>This behavior suggests that ephemeral seeding is the intention for most content of that type which is deleted from the source website (Times Newswire) at an unspecified time after its initial publication. As noted in previous <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2019/05/burned-after-reading-endless-mayflys-ephemeral-disinformation-campaign/"><u>research</u></a>, ephemeral disinformation is designed to elude detection. With the evidence disappearing from the source websites not long after having been published, investigators may be unable to make the necessary connections to detect an influence operation or correctly identify the reach and depth of the operation. At the same time, the seeded message could be picked up and amplified by mainstream or social media, making the narrative stay even if the original source had been removed.</p>
<p>In the case of PAPERWALL however, as we discuss in more detail in the <a href="#wn8xiy3i1f9h"><u>Conclusions</u></a> section, we currently have no evidence that this has ever happened.</p>

<p>As a final note on the operational tactics utilized by Times Newswire and, as a consequence, by PAPERWALL, we note that the articles targeting Li Hongzhi, as well as others of a political nature that we could observe, were all categorized as “press releases” on the website, similarly to the thousands of actual promotional posts it published. It is however highly unusual for press releases to include content of this kind. We judge this as another tactic designed to make the political narratives hard to detect without diminishing their potential impact.</p>
<h2 id="attribution-haimai">Attribution: Haimai</h2>
<p>We attribute PAPERWALL to a PR firm based in China, <strong>Shenzhen Haimaiyunxiang Media Co., Ltd.,</strong> or <strong>“Haimai.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Haimai</strong> was first exposed by the Korean NCSC in their investigation on 18 Korean-focused PAPERWALL websites as being responsible for operating them. However, based on the evidence presented in the NCSC <a href="https://www.ncsc.go.kr:4018/main/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?bbsId=SecurityAdvice_main&amp;nttId=88028&amp;menuNo=020000&amp;subMenuNo=020200&amp;thirdMenuNo=" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>report</u></a>, that assessment appeared to be primarily based on Haimai itself advertising the paid placement of promotional articles on Times Newswire, and as a consequence, on the PAPERWALL network of websites.</p>
<p>We do not consider this criterion as sufficient for a conclusive attribution. In fact, during our research we could identify at least three other PR and marketing companies advertising the sale of promotional packages to be placed directly on PAPERWALL websites. They include:</p>
<ul><li>A South Korean firm named <strong>Excelsior Partners</strong>, which on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231102135101/https://kmong.com/@%EC%97%91%EC%85%80%EC%8B%9C%EC%96%B4%ED%8C%8C%ED%8A%B8%EB%84%88%EC%8A%A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Kmong</u></a> (a Korean service marketplace, hosting the advertisement of specialized services by freelancers, or agencies) advertised the sale of language-specific promotional packages. Each of the packages exclusively listed PAPERWALL domains as the “major local media” on which paid editorial content could be placed.</li>
<li>A second Korean company called <strong>AN&amp;ON</strong>, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231106081136/https://www.annon.co.kr/asianeurope" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>advertised</u></a> country-specific promotional packages on its own website in a similar way to Excelsior Partners. The domains listed were, also in this case, PAPERWALL ones.</li>
<li>A Chinese company, called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230623201122/https://bibkcn.com/promote-bibk-php/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u><strong>Coin Blog</strong>, also known as</u> <strong><u>BIBK</u></strong></a>, equally selling paid editorial content placement on several confirmed PAPERWALL domains.</li>
</ul><p>However, <strong>we could identify digital infrastructure linkages between Haimai and PAPERWALL</strong>. Specifically, the two earliest registered PAPERWALL domains, updatenews[.]info and wdpp[.]org, hosted a <strong>Google AdSense ID</strong> linking them to Haimai’s official website, hmedium[.]com, and to a second website directly related to it. AdSense IDs are <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/105516?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>unique identifiers for a website operator’s AdSense account</u></a>.</p>
<p>This is therefore an incriminating finding, proving that both PAPERWALL domains had been set up by the same operators as the Haimai assets.</p>
<p>A review of the source code for <strong>updatenews[.]info</strong> and <strong>wdpp[.]org</strong> revealed the presence on both websites of the Google AdSense ID <strong>ca-pub-5378976189690174</strong>.</p>

The former is Haimai’s official website, as reported also by the Korean NCSC; the latter appears to be a secondary website directly connected to hmedium[.]com: it uses the same splash image and text on its homepage, and offers similar promotional services on foreign media.

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>PAPERWALL is a large, and <a href="#n6tlqhpo9wo1"><u>fast growing</u></a>, network of anonymous websites posing as local news outlets while pushing both commercial and political content aligned with Beijing’s views to a variety of European, Asian, and Latin American audiences.</p>
<p>The campaign is an example of a <strong>sprawling influence operation</strong> serving both financial and political interests, and <strong>in alignment with Beijing’s political agenda</strong>. By observing the minimal traffic towards the network’s websites that is measurable through open source tools<a id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref" href="#fn2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and the lack of visible mainstream media coverage (including on news aggregators, such as for example Google News) or social media amplification, we can assess the <strong>impact of the campaign as negligible so far</strong>.</p>
<p>This assessment, however, as well as the large amount of seemingly benign commercial content wrapping the aggressively political one within the PAPERWALL network, should not be taken to indicate that such a campaign is harmless. Seeding pieces of disinformation and targeted attacks within much larger quantities of irrelevant or even unpopular content is a <a href="https://secondaryinfektion.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>known modus operandi in the context of influence operations</u></a>, which can eventually pay enormous dividends once one of those fragments is eventually picked up and legitimized by mainstream press or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/07/russia-involved-in-leak-of-papers-saying-nhs-is-for-sale-says-reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>political figures</u></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the role and prominence of private firms in creating and managing influence operations is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence-for-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>hardly news</u></a>. However, since the early days of <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/who-is-behind-israels-archimedes-group-banned-by-facebook-for-election-fakery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>research</u></a> in this space, the disinformation-for-hire industry has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/world/europe/disinformation-social-media.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>boomed</u></a>, leading to findings and disruptions in countries around the world (for a few examples, in <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/October-2020-CIB-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Myanmar</u></a>, <a href="https://medium.com/dfrlab/facebook-removes-assets-connected-to-brazilian-marketing-firms-56ccefadd653" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Brazil</u></a>, the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/08/cib-uae-egypt-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>UAE, Egypt and Saudi Arabia</u></a>). China – previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/aug/30/meta-facebook-instagram-shuts-down-spamouflage-network-china-foreign-influence#:~:text=which%20at%20times%20appeared%20to%20collaborate%20with%20private%20Chinese%20companies." target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>exposed</u></a> for having resorted to this proxy category in large influence operations, including the cited <a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/pro-prc-information-operations-campaign-haienergy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>HaiEnergy</u></a> – is now increasingly benefiting from this operating model, which maintains a thin veil of plausible deniability, while ensuring a broad dissemination of the political messaging. It is safe to assume that PAPERWALL will not be the last example of a partnership between private sector and government in the context of Chinese influence operations.</p>

                                        <p>GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) — Toyota says it will invest $1.3 billion at its huge factory complex in Georgetown, Kentucky, in part so it can build an all-new three-row electric SUV to be sold in the U.S.</p><p>The company says the money will help with future electric vehicle production, including the addition of a line to assemble battery cells into packs for other EVs. But it won’t add any new jobs to the complex, which now employs nearly 9,400 workers.</p><p>The investment brings to nearly $10 billion the amount of money that Toyota has spent at the plant, the company said in a statement Tuesday.</p>

Toyota has put about $13.9 billion into the plant, which will be a key supplier for the Kentucky factory that will build the company’s first U.S.-made electric vehicles.</p><p>Environmental groups have long criticized Toyota for being slow to move toward fully electric vehicles, instead clinging to gas-electric hybrid technology. The company has a goal of selling 1.5 million to 1.8 million electric or hybrid vehicles in the U.S. by 2030. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-event-module="article body" data-flatplan-body="true"><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Science fiction, when revisited years later, sometimes doesn’t come across as all that fictional. Speculative novels have an impressive track record at prophesying what innovations are to come, and how they might upend the world: H. G. Wells wrote about an atomic bomb <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thebulletin.org/virtual-tour/h-g-wells-novel-the-world-set-free-predicts-atomic-warfare/">decades</a> before World War II, and Ray Bradbury’s 1953 novel, <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, features devices we’d describe today as Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Perhaps no writer has been more clairvoyant about our current technological age than Neal Stephenson. His novels coined the term <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/"><em>metaverse</em></a>, laid the conceptual groundwork for cryptocurrency, and imagined a geoengineered planet. And nearly three decades before the release of ChatGPT, he presaged the current AI revolution. A core element of one of his early novels, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-diamond-age-or-a-young-lady-s-illustrated-primer-neal-stephenson/8466804?ean=9780553380965"><em>The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer</em></a>, is a magical book that acts as a personal tutor and mentor for a young girl, adapting to her learning style—in essence, it is a personalized and ultra-advanced chatbot. The titular Primer speaks aloud in the voice of a live actor, known as a “ractor”—evoking how today’s generative AI, like many digital technologies, is highly dependent on humans’ creative labor.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Stephenson’s book, published in 1995, explores a future of seamless, instant digital communication, in which tiny computers with immense capabilities are embedded in everyday life. Corporations are dominant, news and ads are targeted, and screens are omnipresent. It’s a world of stark class and cultural divisions (the novel follows a powerful aristocratic sect that styles itself as the “neo-Victorians”), but it’s nevertheless one in which the Primer is presented as the best of what technology can be.</p><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="The Diamond Age - Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780553380965" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="The Diamond Age - Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_aJ4Wu7AjhqyF1LXSpUqnrEb5wQ=/0x0:314x500/75x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/02/06/51rcc5qqVFL._SL500_-1/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/IvJmcJQZJS_qKYl6GLhEwy40GAA=/0x0:314x500/150x240/media/img/book_reviews/2024/02/06/51rcc5qqVFL._SL500_-1/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/_aJ4Wu7AjhqyF1LXSpUqnrEb5wQ=/0x0:314x500/75x120/media/img/book_reviews/2024/02/06/51rcc5qqVFL._SL500_-1/original.jpg" width="75" height="120"></picture></a></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But Stephenson is far more pessimistic about today’s AI than he was about the Primer. “A chatbot is not an oracle,” he told me over Zoom last Friday. “It’s a statistics engine that creates sentences that sound accurate.” I spoke with Stephenson about his uncannily prescient book and the generative-AI revolution that has seemingly begun.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Matteo Wong:</strong> <em>The Young Lady’s Illustrated Primer</em> is a book that adapts to and teaches a young girl, which seems to resonate with the vision of AI chatbots and assistants that many companies have for the near future. Did you set out to explore the idea of an intelligent machine in imagining the Primer?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Neal Stephenson:</strong> The idea came to me after we had a kid and got this mobile that was designed to suspend over the crib. It had very primitive, simple shapes on it because, when they’re newborns, their visual systems can’t resolve fine details. So there would be a square and a triangle and a circle. And then, after a certain number of days or weeks had gone by, you were supposed to pop those cards off of the mobile and snap on a different set that had a more appropriate fit for what their brains were capable of at that age. That just got me to thinking: <em>What if you extended that idea to every other form of intellectual growth?</em></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The technology that drives the book wasn’t really AI as we think of it now—I was talking to people who were working on some of the underlying technologies that would be needed to communicate on the internet in a secure, anonymous manner. I guess it’s implicit that there’s an AI in there that’s generating the story and increasing the degree of sophistication in response to the learning curve of the child, but I didn’t really go into that very much; I just kind of assumed it would be there.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> A lot of companies today—OpenAI, Google, Meta, to name a few—have said they want to build AI assistants that adapt to each user, somewhat like how the Primer acts as a teacher. Do you see anything in the generative-AI models of today that resembles or could one day become like the Primer?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> About a year ago, I worked with a start-up that makes AI characters in video games. I found it rewarding and fascinating because of the hallucinations: I could see how new patterns emerged from the soup of inputs being fed to it. The same thing that I consider to be a feature is a bug in most applications. We’ve already seen examples of lawyers who use ChatGPT to create legal documents, and the AI just fabricated past cases and precedents that seemed completely plausible. When you think about the idea of trying to make use of these models in education, this becomes a bug too. What they do is generate sentences that sound like correct sentences, but there’s no underlying brain that can actually discern whether those sentences are correct or not.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/openai-chatgpt-writing-high-school-english-essay/672412/">Read: The end of high-school English</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Think about any concept that we might want to teach somebody—for instance, the Pythagorean theorem. There must be thousands of old and new explanations of the Pythagorean theorem online. The real thing we need is to understand each child’s learning style so we can immediately connect them to the one out of those thousands that is the best fit for how they learn. That to me sounds like an AI kind of project, but it’s a different kind of AI application from DALL-E or large language models.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> And yet, today, those language models, which fundamentally predict words in a sequence, are being applied to many areas where they have no specialized abilities—GPT-4 for medical diagnosis, Google Bard as a tutor. That reminds me of a term used in the book instead of <em>artificial intelligence</em>, <em>pseudo-intelligence</em>, which many critics of the technology might appreciate today.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> I’d forgotten about that. The running gag of that book was applying Victorian diction and prejudices to high-tech things. What was probably going through my mind was that Victorians would look askance at the term <em>artificial intelligence</em>, because they would be offended by the idea that computers could replace human brains. So they would probably want to bracket the idea as a simulation, or a “pseudo” intelligence, as opposed to the real thing.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> About a year ago, in an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/0ecab009-6543-4386-b936-0eecc9293d2e">interview</a> with the <em>Financial Times</em>, you called the outputs of generative AI “hollow and uninteresting.” Why was that, and has your assessment changed?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> I suspect that what I had in mind when I was making those remarks was the current state of image-generating technology. There were a few things about that rubbing me the wrong way, the biggest being that they are benefiting from the uncredited work of thousands of real human artists. I’m going to exaggerate slightly, but it seems like one of the first applications of any new technology is making things even shittier for artists. That’s certainly happened with music. These image-generation systems just seemed like that was mechanized and weaponized on an inconceivable scale.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/09/books3-database-generative-ai-training-copyright-infringement/675363/">Read: These 183,000 books are fueling the biggest fight in publishing and tech</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Another part of it was that a lot of people who got excited about this early on just generated huge volumes of material and put them out willy-nilly on the internet. If your only way of making a painting is to actually dab paint laboriously onto a canvas, then the result might be bad or good, but at least it’s the result of a whole lot of micro-decisions you made as an artist. You were exercising editorial judgment with every paint stroke. That is absent in the output of these programs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> Even in <em>The Diamond Age</em>, the Primer seems to provide commentary on artists’ labor and tech, which is very relevant to generative AI today. The Primer teaches a girl, but a human actor digitally connected to the book has to voice the text aloud.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> If you’re a conventional actor onstage or in film, you stand in front of a camera, you perform once, and then lots of copies can be made. In the book, I thought it was a pretty positive vision of the future, where we have the technology that would enable voice actors to in effect give live performances on demand, all the time. Even with today’s voice clones, if you break it down to its simplest element, there’s still a human who sat in front of a microphone and provided this material. Although I guess a system like the Primer might not work live; you would probably have some lag—the AI is generating the text and sending it to the ractor, and then the ractor has to read it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> And on the scale that some of today’s AI programs operate on, there just wouldn’t be enough people to do it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> The scenario I was laying out in <em>The Diamond Age</em> is that the ractors are a scarce resource, and so the Primer is more of a luxury product. But eventually, the source code for the book falls into the hands of a man who wants to manufacture it on a massive scale, and there’s not enough money and not enough actors in the world to voice all those books, so at that point, he decides to use automatically generated voices.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> Another theme in the novel is how different socioeconomic classes have access to education. The Primer is designed for an aristocrat, but your novel also traces the stories of middle- and working-class girls who interact with versions of the book. Right now a lot of generative AI is free, but the technology is also very expensive to run. How do you think access to generative AI might play out?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson:</strong> There was a bit of early internet utopianism in the book, which was written during that era in the mid-’90s when the internet was coming online. There was a tendency to assume that when all the world’s knowledge comes online, everyone will flock to it. It turns out that if you give everyone access to the Library of Congress, what they do is watch videos on TikTok. <em>The Diamond Age</em> reflects the same naivete that I shared with a lot of other people back in the day about how all of that knowledge was going to affect society.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Wong:</strong> Do you think we’re seeing some of that naivete today in people looking at how generative AI can be used?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><strong>Stephenson: </strong>For sure. It’s based on an understandable misconception as to what these things are doing. A chatbot is not an oracle; it’s a statistics engine that creates sentences that sound accurate. Right now my sense is that it’s like we’ve just invented transistors. We’ve got a couple of consumer products that people are starting to adopt, like the transistor radio, but we don’t yet know how the transistor will transform society. We’re in the transistor-radio stage of AI. I think a lot of the ferment that’s happening right now in the industry is venture capitalists putting money into business plans, and teams that are rapidly evaluating a whole lot of different things that could be done well. I’m sure that some things are going to emerge that I wouldn’t dare try to predict, because the results of the creative frenzy of millions of people is always more interesting than what a single person can think of.</p><div><hr><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
