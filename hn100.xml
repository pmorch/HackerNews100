    <p>Large generative models (e.g., large language models, diffusion models) have shown remarkable performance, but they require a massive amount of computational resources. To make them more accessible, it is crucial to improve their efficiency.</p>

<p>This course will introduce efficient AI computing techniques that enable powerful deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics include model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, data/model parallelism, gradient compression, and on-device fine-tuning. It also introduces application-specific acceleration techniques for large language models, diffusion models, video recognition, and point cloud. This course will also cover topics about quantum machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience deploying large language models (e.g., LLaMA 2) on a laptop.</p>

<p>The slides and lab assignments from the last semester are available for access <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0ftluqbd1afzqpy/AADqxwkYrt1FbGnSQ4KP3Kpva?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>croc</code> is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, <em>croc</em> is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>allows <strong>any two computers</strong> to transfer data (using a relay)</li>
<li>provides <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong> (using PAKE)</li>
<li>enables easy <strong>cross-platform</strong> transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)</li>
<li>allows <strong>multiple file</strong> transfers</li>
<li>allows <strong>resuming transfers</strong> that are interrupted</li>
<li>local server or port-forwarding <strong>not needed</strong></li>
<li><strong>ipv6-first</strong> with ipv4 fallback</li>
<li>can <strong>use proxy</strong>, like tor</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">On Android there is a 3rd party F-Droid app <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.howeyc.crocgui/" rel="nofollow">available to download</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-usage" dir="auto"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To send a file, simply do:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase"><pre><code>$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do</p>

<p dir="auto">The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement" rel="nofollow">PAKE</a>) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a number of configurable options (see <code>--help</code>). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using <code>--remember</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-custom-code-phrase" dir="auto"><a href="#custom-code-phrase">Custom code phrase</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters).</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]"><pre><code>croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-allow-overwriting-without-prompt" dir="auto"><a href="#allow-overwriting-without-prompt">Allow overwriting without prompt</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">By default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the <code>--overwrite</code> flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --yes --overwrite <code>"><pre><code>croc --yes --overwrite &lt;code&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-pipes---stdin-and-stdout" dir="auto"><a href="#use-pipes---stdin-and-stdout">Use pipes - stdin and stdout</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can pipe to <code>croc</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat [filename] | croc send"><pre><code>cat [filename] | croc send
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this case <code>croc</code> will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like "croc-stdin-123456789". To receive to <code>stdout</code> at you can always just use the <code>--yes</code>  will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --yes [code-phrase] > out"><pre><code>croc --yes [code-phrase] &gt; out
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">All of the other text printed to the console is going to <code>stderr</code> so it will not interfere with the message going to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-send-text" dir="auto"><a href="#send-text">Send text</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with <code>croc</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --text &quot;hello world&quot;"><pre><code>croc send --text "hello world"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will automatically tell the receiver to use <code>stdout</code> when they receive the text so it will be displayed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-a-proxy" dir="auto"><a href="#use-a-proxy">Use a proxy</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with <code>--socks5</code>. For example, you can send via a tor relay:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --socks5 &quot;127.0.0.1:9050&quot; send SOMEFILE"><pre><code>croc --socks5 "127.0.0.1:9050" send SOMEFILE
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-change-encryption-curve" dir="auto"><a href="#change-encryption-curve">Change encryption curve</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the <code>--curve</code> flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --curve p521 <codephrase>"><pre><code>croc --curve p521 &lt;codephrase&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Available curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-change-hash-algorithm" dir="auto"><a href="#change-hash-algorithm">Change hash algorithm</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the <code>xxhash</code> algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the <code>imohash</code> algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE"><pre><code>croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-self-host-relay" dir="auto"><a href="#self-host-relay">Self-host relay</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, <code>croc</code> uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay:</p>

<p dir="auto">By default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customized the ports (e.g. <code>croc relay --ports 1111,1112</code>), but you must have a minimum of <strong>2</strong> ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can send files using your relay by entering <code>--relay</code> to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --relay &quot;myrelay.example.com:9009&quot; send [filename]"><pre><code>croc --relay "myrelay.example.com:9009" send [filename]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-self-host-relay-docker" dir="auto"><a href="#self-host-relay-docker">Self-host relay (docker)</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">If it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc"><pre><code>docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Be sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay &quot;myreal.example.com:9009&quot; send [filename]"><pre><code>croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay "myreal.example.com:9009" send [filename]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note: when including <code>--pass YOURPASSWORD</code> you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. <code>--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">TG uses <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/POLYGON_INDEXING.md">entirely new</a> indexing structures that speed up <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-predicates">geometry predicates</a>. It can index more than 10GB per second of point data on modern hardware, while using less than 7% of additional memory, and can perform over 10 million point-in-polygon operations, even when using large polygons with over 10K points.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following benchmark provides an example of the point-in-polygon performance
of TG when using a large polygon. In this case of Brazil, which has 39K points.</p>

<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pure-functions" dir="auto"><a href="#pure-functions">Pure functions</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">TG library functions are thread-safe, reentrant, and (mostly) without side
effects.
The exception being with the use of malloc by some functions like
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-constructors">geometry constructors</a>.
In those cases, it's the programmer's responsibiilty to check the return value
before continuing.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom = tg_geom_new_point(-112, 33);
if (!geom) {
    // System is out of memory.
}"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_geom</span> <span>*</span><span>geom</span> <span>=</span> <span>tg_geom_new_point</span>(<span>-112</span>, <span>33</span>);
<span>if</span> (!<span>geom</span>) {
    <span>// System is out of memory.</span>
}</pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-fast-cloning" dir="auto"><a href="#fast-cloning">Fast cloning</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The cloning of geometries, as with <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_clone">tg_geom_clone()</a>, are
O(1) operations that use implicit sharing through an atomic reference counter.
Geometry constructors like <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_new_polygon">tg_geom_new_polygon()</a> will
use this method under the hood to maintain references of its inputs.</p>
<p dir="auto">While this may only be an implementation detail, it's important for the
programmer to understand how TG uses memory and object references.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom = tg_geom_new_polygon(exterior, holes, nholes);"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_geom</span> <span>*</span><span>geom</span> <span>=</span> <span>tg_geom_new_polygon</span>(<span>exterior</span>, <span>holes</span>, <span>nholes</span>);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Above, a new geometry "geom" was created and includes a cloned reference to the
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a> "exterior" and all of the holes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Providing <code>TG_NOATOMICS</code> to the compiler will disable the use of atomics and
instead use non-atomic reference counters.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cc -DTG_NOATOMICS tg.c ..."><pre><code>cc -DTG_NOATOMICS tg.c ...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_copy">tg_geom_copy()</a> method is available to perform a deep copy of the
geometry.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-avoid-memory-leaks" dir="auto"><a href="#avoid-memory-leaks">Avoid memory leaks</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">To avoid memory leaks, call <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_free">tg_geom_free()</a> on geometries
created from <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-constructors">geometry constructors</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-parsing">geometry parsers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_clone">tg_geom_clone()</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_copy">tg_geom_copy()</a></p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, for every <code>tg_geom_new_*()</code>, <code>tg_geom_parse_*()</code>,
<code>tg_geom_clone()</code>, and <code>tg_geom_copy()</code> there should be (eventually and exactly)
one <code>tg_geom_free()</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source, build it yourself, scaled down version of the 6 wheel rover design that JPL uses to explore the surface of Mars. The Open Source Rover is designed entirely out of consumer off the shelf (COTS) parts. This project is intended to be a teaching and learning experience for those who want to get involved in mechanical engineering, software, electronics, robotics but is also an excellent research platform for rugged terrain. No prior skills or knowledge is required.</p>

<p dir="auto">This rover is designed to function similarly to the 6 wheel rover designs on Mars and employs a few of the major driving mechanics that the mars rovers use to traverse rocky surfaces:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Rocker-Bogie:</strong> The Rocker-Bogie suspension system allows all 6 wheels to continually be in contact with the ground while climbing over obstacles</li>
<li><strong>Differential Pivot:</strong> Allows weight to be mechanically offloaded from one side of the rover to the other while climbing</li>
<li><strong>6-Wheel Ackerman Steering:</strong> Driving and steering/turning mechanism that governs where the wheels point and how fast each of them will move.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">A Raspberry Pi acts as the "brain" of this rover for its versatility, accessibility, simplicity, and ability to add and upgrade your own modifications. Any method with which you can communicate with a Raspberry Pi (bluetooth, WiFi, USB devices, etc) can be interfaced into the control system of the robot.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project has elements in mechanical assembly/fabrication, uses a host of electrical components, and has software that will run it all. In order to complete this project, you will need to have some experience in the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Fabrication/Machining:</strong> All parts are Consumer Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts and <strong>no metal machining should be required</strong> to complete the 'base' version of the rover. However for any optional expansions, it may be useful to have access to the following skills/tools:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Metal cutting using band saw/dremel</li>
<li>Drilling using drill press/hand drill</li>
<li>Filing and sanding for part cleanup</li>
<li>General Fabrication/Machining Safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Electronics:</strong> This project uses components like motors, motor controllers, and batteries. While prior experience with the following skills is not required, having access to someone who can help will save a lot of time:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Soldering</li>
<li>Electrical debugging</li>
<li>Wiring</li>
<li>Electrical Safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> The rover's brain is a Raspberry Pi. All code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code">osr-rover-code</a> repository along with step-by-step instructions to set it up.

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 1:</strong> <a href="#ordering-parts">Order parts</a>. You'll want to get started on this ASAP!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/electrical/wiring/README.md">Create the wiring</a>. The cables connect the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) in the body to each motor and integrate into the rocker-bogie and corner assemblies so they need to be built first.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 3:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/electrical/pcb/README.md">Make the electronics</a>: Soldering the PCB and installing into the rover along with peripheral connections. We'll also use the wiring to test your PCBs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 4:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/mechanical/README.md">Make the mechanical assemblies</a>: the body, the two rocker-bogies, the drive and corner motor assemblies. The instructions will guide you through how to do these step by step while integrating the cabling from Stage 2. You'll then attach them into something that will start to look like a rover!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Setting up and configuring the operating system rover code. The <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code">Rover Code repo</a>'s README files will walk you through all necessary steps for getting the rover software up and running on the Raspberry Pi. These steps can be completed at any point during the project, all the way up to when all the electronics and mechanical parts are completed and you are ready to start driving and controlling the robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What's next?</strong> Add your own upgrades! We chose Raspberry Pi as the brain of the project so that it should be easy to add, change, and upgrade to build exciting things on top of this already cool robot.  Some upgrade ideas to get you brainstorming: sonar for collision detection, IMU for orientation / closed-loop driving / obstacle mapping, camera for object identification and tracking, sensor packages (temperature, pressure, humidity), solar panels, or even a robotic arm!</p>

                <p data-block-key="ie0t5"><b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today announced it is beginning a rulemaking process to remove medical bills from Americans’ credit reports. The CFPB outlined proposals under consideration that would help families financially recover from medical crises, stop debt collectors from coercing people into paying bills they may not even owe, and ensure that creditors are not relying on data that is often plagued with inaccuracies and mistakes.</p><p data-block-key="8cm31">“Research shows that medical bills have little predictive value in credit decisions, yet tens of millions of American households are dealing with medical debt on their credit reports,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “When someone gets sick, they should be able to focus on getting better, rather than fighting debt collectors trying to extort them into paying bills they may not even owe.”</p><p data-block-key="7iks1">A <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">2022 report</a> found that roughly 20% of Americans report having medical debt, but <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-study-finds-medical-debt-overly-penalizes-consumer-credit-scores/">previous research</a> by the CFPB has shown that medical billing data on a credit report is less predictive of future repayment than reporting on traditional credit obligations. Mistakes and inaccuracies in medical billing are common and can be compounded by problems such as disputes over insurance payments or complex billing practices.</p><p data-block-key="83c6a">The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts creditors’ ability to use medical information in making credit decisions and places limits on the inclusion of medical information on credit reports. The FCRA also granted five financial regulators authority to create regulatory exemptions to the restriction on creditors’ use of medical information, and in 2005, those regulators created an exception to allow creditors to rely on medical data if it could be characterized as “financial information.”</p><p data-block-key="btipa">The document released today is an outline of proposals and alternatives under consideration for the CFPB’s medical debt rulemaking. If finalized, they would:</p><ul><li data-block-key="b8ha"><b>Remove medical bills from consumers’ credit reports:</b> Consumer reporting companies would be prohibited from including medical debts and collection information on consumer reports that creditors use in making underwriting decisions.</li><li data-block-key="7rv83"><b>Stop creditors from relying on medical bills for underwriting decisions:</b> The proposal would narrow the 2005 exception and prohibit creditors from using medical collections information when evaluating borrowers’ credit applications.</li><li data-block-key="51gc"><b>Stop coercive collection practices:</b> As unpaid medical bills would no longer appear on consumers’ credit reports used by creditors in making underwriting decisions, debt collectors would no longer be able to use the credit reporting system as leverage to pressure consumers into paying questionable debts.</li></ul><p data-block-key="9ht47">The proposal would not stop creditors from obtaining medical bill information for other purposes, such as verifying the need for medical forbearances, or evaluating loan applications to pay for medical services.</p><p data-block-key="539ph">In advance of beginning the rulemaking process, the CFPB has engaged with the public on this issue. In a <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/prepared-remarks-of-director-rohit-chopra-for-the-cfpb-hearing-on-medical-billing-and-collections/">public hearing</a> in July 2023, the CFPB met with and listened to people from across the country on the impact poor medical billing practices and coercive credit reporting have on patients and families.

      <p>You can extend the primary/standby architecture by adding a PgBouncer
connection pooler between your application and your PostgreSQL database.
Additionally, you can take advantage of replica clusters by creating one or

<p>In this episode of "Just Ship It," Evan You, the creator of Vue.js and Vite, discusses his journey to becoming an independent open-source developer. His dedication to Vue.js and (and now Vite) since 2016 has made him a prominent figure in the open-source community. This conversation highlights  Evan's transition to full-time open-source work, the growth of Vue.js, and his aspirations for the future.</p>
<p>Evan shares his journey toward becoming a full-time open-source developer and the challenges and factors that facilitated this shift. Evan attributes his success to a combination of luck and persistence. He elaborates on his experiences while developing Vue.js, emphasizing his passion for solving intriguing problems. He outlines his approach to API-driven development, where he designs how things should work before implementing them.</p>
<p>Evan explains that Vue.js initially attracted users through platforms like Hacker News and Chinese social networks, thanks to its bottom-up approach and user-friendly documentation. This is in stark contrast to larger frameworks like React and Angular, which often gain enterprise-level adoption due to corporate backing.</p>
<p>Evan reflects on Vue.js's evolution, highlighting the turning point when it gained prominence in the Laravel community, solidifying its reputation as a dependable framework for production projects. He discusses how Vue.js particularly appeals to back-end developers, as it seamlessly integrates with traditional back-end frameworks.</p>
<p>The conversation touches on Vue.js's adoption in different regions, particularly in Asia, attributing its success to Evan's active participation in Chinese social networks. Additionally, Evan underscores the importance of high-quality Chinese documentation.</p>
<p>The episode concludes with Evan sharing the pace and satisfaction he found in working on Vue.js during its early stages, contrasting it with the more complex decision-making processes required as the project grew.
Evan's work on Vue.js and Vite has had a significant impact on the web development landscape, and his commitment to fostering a thriving open-source community continues to shape the future of front-end development.</p></div><div><p><em>This Dot Labs is a development consultancy that is trusted by top industry companies, including Stripe, Xero, Wikimedia, Docusign, and Twilio.

<p>ARE American lives cheaper than those of the Chinese? It's a question raised by Ron Unz, publisher of <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/chinese-melamine-and-american-vioxx-a-comparison/%20" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/chinese-melamine-and-american-vioxx-a-comparison/%20">The American Conservative</a>, who has produced a compelling comparison between the way the Chinese dealt with one of their drug scandals – melamine in baby formula - and how the US handled the Vioxx aspirin-substitute disaster. The Chinese scandal surfaced in 2008, shortly before the Beijing Olympics. Crooked dairymen diluted their milk products, then added a plastic chemical compound called melamine to raise the apparent protein content back to normal levels. Nearly 300,000 babies across China suffered urinary problems, with many hundreds requiring lengthy hospitalisation for kidney stones. Six died.</p><p>Long prison sentences were handed down and a couple of the guiltiest culprits were tried and executed for their role. Throughout these events, American media coverage was extensive, with appropriate sneering about the Chinese leadership's indifference to human life. Four years earlier, in September 2004, Merck, one of America's largest pharmaceutical companies, issued a sudden recall of Vioxx, its anti-pain medication widely used to treat arthritis-related ailments.</p><p>The recall came just days after Merck discovered that a top medical journal was about to publish a study by an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) investigator indicating that the drug in question greatly increased the risk of fatal heart attacks and strokes and had probably been responsible for at least 55,000 American deaths during the five years it had been on the market. It soon turned out Merck had known of potential lethal side effects even before launching Vioxx in 1999, but had brushed all such disturbing tests under the rug.</p><div id="blueconic-article-theweek">

</div><p>With a TV ad budget averaging a hundred million dollars per year, Vioxx swiftly became one of Merck's bestsellers, generating over $2 billion in yearly revenue. Twenty-five million Americans were eventually prescribed Vioxx as an aspirin-substitute thought to produce fewer complications. There was a fair amount of news coverage after the recall, but pretty slim considering the alleged 55,000 death toll. A class-action lawsuit dragged its way through the courts for years, eventually being settled for $4.85 billion in 2007.</p><p>When the scandal first broke, Merck's stock price collapsed, and many believed that the company could not possibly survive, especially after evidence of a deliberate corporate conspiracy surfaced. Instead, Merck's stock price eventually reached new heights in 2008 and today it is just 15 per cent below where it stood before the disaster. The year after the scandal unfolded, Merck's long-time CEO resigned and was replaced by one of his top lieutenants. But he retained the $50 million in financial compensation he had received over the previous five years. Neither he nor any other Merck executives was charged with corporate malfeasance.</p><p>Senior FDA officials apologised for their lack of effective oversight and promised to do better in the future. The Vioxx scandal began to sink into the vast marsh of semi-forgotten international pharmaceutical scandals.</p><p>Then in 2005, as he now remembers it, Ron Unz "was reading my morning newspapers, as I always do, and noticed tiny items about an unprecedented drop in the American death rate. Hmm I said, I wonder if that might have anything to do with all those other stories about that deadly drug recently taken off the market and all the resulting lawsuits." The year after Vioxx was pulled from the market, the New York Times and other media outlets were running minor news items, usually down-column, noting that American death rates had undergone a striking and completely unexpected decline. These were what Unz, a dedicated news browser, was reading. Typical was the headline on a short article that ran in the 19 April 2005 edition of USA Today: 'USA Records Largest Drop in Annual Deaths in at Least 60 Years.' During that one year, American deaths fell by 50,000 despite the growth in both the size and the age of the nation's population. Government health experts were quoted as being greatly "surprised" and "scratching [their] heads" over this strange anomaly, which was led by a sharp drop in fatal heart attacks.</p><p>For his Chinese melamine/Vioxx comparison, Unz went back to those 2005 stories. Quick scrutiny of the most recent 15 years worth of national mortality data provided on the US Government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website offered Unz some useful clues.</p><p>"We find the largest rise in American mortality rates occurred in 1999, the year Vioxx was introduced, while the largest drop occurred in 2004, the year it was withdrawn," says Unz. "Vioxx was almost entirely marketed to the elderly, and these substantial changes in the national death-rate were completely concentrated within the 65-plus population.</p><p>"The FDA studies had proven that use of Vioxx led to deaths from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, and these were exactly the factors driving the changes in national mortality rates." The impact of these shifts, Unz points out, was not small. After a decade of remaining roughly constant, the overall American death rate began a substantial decline in 2004, soon falling by approximately five per cent, despite the continued ageing of the population. This drop corresponds to roughly 100,000 fewer deaths per year. The age-adjusted decline in death rates was considerably greater. "Patterns of cause and effect cannot easily be proven," Unz continues. "But if we hypothesise a direct connection between the recall of a class of very popular drugs proven to cause fatal heart attacks and other deadly illnesses with an immediate drop in the national rate of fatal heart attacks and other deadly illnesses, then the statistical implications are quite serious."</p><p>Unz makes the point that the users of Vioxx were almost all elderly, and it was not possible to determine whether a particular victim's heart attack had been caused by Vioxx or other factors. But he concludes: "<em>Perhaps 500,000 or more premature American deaths may have resulted from Vioxx</em> [my italics], a figure substantially larger than the 3,468 deaths of named individuals acknowledged by Merck during the settlement of its lawsuit. And almost no one among our political or media elites seems to know or care about this possibility." I remarked to Unz that it seemed truly incredible that a greater than expected death rate of this dimension should scarcely have caused a ripple. "I'm just as astonished," he said. "From 2004 onwards, huge numbers of America's toughest trial lawyers were suing Merck for billions based on Vioxx casualties - didn't they notice the dramatic drop in the national death rate?</p><p>"The inescapable conclusion is that in today's world and in the opinion of our own media, American lives are quite cheap, unlike those in China. "Besides," says Unz laughing, "it shows the stupidity of our political leaders that they didn't seize upon this great opportunity. They should have just renamed Vioxx the 'Save Social Security Drug,' and distributed it free in very large doses to everyone, starting on their 65th birthday. Maybe they should have even made it mandatory, three times per day. At sufficiently large levels of national consumption, Vioxx could have almost singlehandedly eliminated all our serious budget deficit problems. 'Vioxx - The Miracle Anti-Deficit Drug'."</p>

         }"><p data-block-key="z0lph">Last week Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in partnership with <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions">The Citizen Lab</a>, discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit chain for iPhones. Developed by the commercial surveillance vendor, Intellexa, this exploit chain is used to install its Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device.</p><p data-block-key="db5qn">In response, yesterday, Apple patched the bugs in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213927">iOS 16.7</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213926">iOS 17.0.1</a> as CVE-2023-41991, CVE-2023-41992, CVE-2023-41993. This quick patching from Apple helps to better protect users and we encourage all iOS users to install them as soon as possible.</p><h3 data-block-key="9mihu">Exploit delivery via man-in-the-middle (MITM)</h3><p data-block-key="3tkrk">The Intellexa exploit chain was delivered via a “man-in-the-middle” (MITM) attack, where an attacker is in between the target and the website they’re trying to reach. If the target is going to a website using ‘http’, then the attacker can intercept the traffic and send fake data back to the target to force them to a different website. Visiting a website using ‘https’ means that the traffic is encrypted, and it is easily verifiable that the received data came from the intended website using their certificate. That is not the case when using ‘http’.</p><p data-block-key="43ulj">In the case of this campaign, if the target went to any ‘http’ site, the attackers injected traffic to silently redirect them to an Intellexa site, c.betly[.]me. If the user was the expected targeted user, the site would then redirect the target to the exploit server, sec-flare[.]com. While there’s a spotlight on “0-click” vulnerabilities (bugs that don’t require user interaction) this MITM delivery also didn’t require the user to open any documents, click a specific link, or answer any phone calls.</p><h3 data-block-key="7bvmk">iOS Exploit Chain</h3><p data-block-key="3mmcg">As soon as the attacker redirected the target to their exploit server, the exploit chain began to execute. For iOS, this chain included three vulnerabilities:</p><ul><li data-block-key="9h3i5">CVE-2023-41993: Initial remote code execution (RCE) in Safari</li><li data-block-key="b9i2o">CVE-2023-41991: PAC bypass</li><li data-block-key="bchsp">CVE-2023-41992: Local privilege escalation (LPE) in the XNU Kernel</li></ul><p data-block-key="d9tj1">The chain then ran a small binary to decide whether or not to install the full Predator implant. However, TAG was unable to capture the full Predator implant.</p><p data-block-key="9beab">We plan to publish a technical deep dive on these exploits in line with the <a href="https://about.google/appsecurity/">Google vulnerability disclosure policy</a>.</p><h3 data-block-key="7qhpg">Android Exploit Chain</h3><p data-block-key="8ub7c">The attacker also had an exploit chain to install Predator on Android devices in Egypt. TAG observed these exploits delivered in two different ways: the MITM injection and via one-time links sent directly to the target. We were only able to obtain the initial renderer remote code execution vulnerability for Chrome, which was exploiting <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html">CVE-2023-4762</a>.</p><p data-block-key="1me89">This bug had already been separately reported to the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program by a security researcher and was patched on September 5th. We assess that Intellexa was also previously using this vulnerability as a 0-day.</p><h3 data-block-key="fp05">Chrome's work to protect against MITM</h3><p data-block-key="6d3d2">For years, Chrome has worked toward universal HTTPS adoption across the web. Additionally <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html">Chrome has an “HTTPS-First Mode”</a> that can reduce the likelihood of exploits being delivered via MITM network injection. "HTTPS-First Mode" will attempt to load all pages over HTTPS, and show a large warning before falling back to sending an HTTP request. This setting is currently on by default for users enrolled in the <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Advanced Protection Program</a> who are also signed into Chrome. We encourage all users <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10468685?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">to enable “HTTPS-First Mode”</a> to better protect themselves from MITM attacks.</p><h3 data-block-key="1gn1m">Conclusion</h3><p data-block-key="5b2rm">This campaign is yet another example of the abuses caused by the proliferation of commercial surveillance vendors and their serious risk to the safety of online users. TAG will continue to take action against, and publish research about, the commercial spyware industry, as well as work across the public and private sectors to push this work forward.</p><p data-block-key="1q972">We would like to acknowledge and thank The Citizen Lab for their collaboration and partnership in the capturing and analysis of these exploits, and Apple for deploying a timely patch for the safety of online users.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To our community:</p>
<p>I’m Marc Whitten, and I lead Unity Create which includes the Unity engine and editor teams.</p>
<p>I want to start with this: I am sorry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine.</p>
<p>You are what makes Unity great, and we know we need to listen, and work hard to earn your trust. We have heard your concerns, and we are making changes in the policy we announced to address them.</p>
<p>Our Unity Personal plan will remain free and there will be no Runtime Fee for games built on <strong>Unity Personal</strong>. We will be increasing the cap from $100,000 to $200,000 and we will remove the requirement to use the <em>Made with Unity</em> splash screen.</p>
<p>No game with less than $1 million in trailing 12-month revenue will be subject to the fee.</p>
<p>For those creators on <strong>Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise</strong>, we are also making changes based on your feedback.</p>
<p>The Runtime Fee policy will only apply <strong>beginning with the next LTS version of Unity</strong> shipping in 2024 and beyond. Your games that are currently shipped and the projects you are currently working on will not be included – unless you choose to upgrade them to this new version of Unity.</p>
<p><strong>We will make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity editor you are using </strong>– as long as you keep using that version.</p>
<p>For games that are subject to the runtime fee, we are giving you a choice of either a <strong>2.5% revenue share</strong> or the calculated amount based on the number of new people engaging with your game each month. Both of these numbers are <strong>self-reported</strong> from data you already have available. You will always be billed the lesser amount.</p>
<p>We want to continue to build the best engine for creators. We truly love this industry and you are the reason why.</p>
<p>I’d like to invite you to join me for a <a href="https://youtube.com/live/qyLcI5O9iUY" target="_blank">live fireside chat</a> hosted by Jason Weimann today at 4:00 pm ET/1:00 pm PT, where I will do my best to answer your questions. In the meantime, <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">here</a> are some more details.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p>Thank you for caring as deeply as you do, and thank you for giving us hard feedback.</p>

<h2>Apple fucked us on right to repair (again) (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/09/22/vin-locking/#thought-differently">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Right to repair has no cannier, more dedicated adversary than Apple, a company whose most innovative work is dreaming up new ways to sneakily sabotage electronics repair while claiming to be a caring environmental steward, a lie that covers up the mountains of e-waste that Apple dooms our descendants to wade through.</p>
<p>Why does Apple hate repair so much? It's not that they want to poison our water and bodies with microplastics; it's not that they want to hasten the day our coastal cities drown; it's not that they relish the human misery that accompanies every gram of conflict mineral. They aren't sadists. They're merely sociopathically greedy.</p>
<p>Tim Cook laid it out for his investors: when people can repair their devices, they don't buy new ones. When people don't buy new devices, Apple doesn't sell them new devices. It's that's simple:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/52189-tim-cook-says-apple-faces-2-key-problems-in-surprising-shareholder-letter">https://www.inverse.com/article/52189-tim-cook-says-apple-faces-2-key-problems-in-surprising-shareholder-letter</a></p>
<p>So Apple does everything it can to monopolize repair. Not just because this lets the company gouge you on routine service, but because it lets them decide when your phone is beyond repair, so they can offer you a trade-in, ensuring both that you buy a new device and that the device you buy is another Apple.</p>
<p>There are so many tactics Apple gets to use to sabotage repair. For example, Apple engraves microscopic Apple logos on the subassemblies in its devices. This allows the company to enlist US Customs to seize and destroy refurbished parts that are harvested from dead phones by workers in the Pacific Rim:</p>
<p><a href="https://repair.eu/news/apple-uses-trademark-law-to-strengthen-its-monopoly-on-repair/">https://repair.eu/news/apple-uses-trademark-law-to-strengthen-its-monopoly-on-repair/</a></p>
<p>Of course, the easiest way to prevent harvested components from entering the parts stream is to destroy as many old devices as possible. That's why Apple's so-called "recycling" program <em>shreds</em> any devices you turn over to them. When you trade in your old iPhone at an Apple Store, it is converted into immortal e-waste (no other major recycling program does this). The logic is straightforward: no parts, no repairs:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp73jw/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks">https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp73jw/apple-recycling-iphones-macbooks</a></p>
<p>Shredding parts and cooking up bogus trademark claims is just for starters, though. For Apple, the true anti-repair innovation comes from the most pernicious US tech law: Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).</p>
<p>DMCA 1201 is an "anti-circumvention" law. It bans the distribution of any tool that bypasses "an effective means of access control." That's all very abstract, but here's what it means: if a manufacturer sticks some Digital Rights Management (DRM) in its device, then anything you want to do that involves removing that DRM is now illegal – even if the thing itself is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>When Congress passed this stupid law in 1998, it had a very limited blast radius. Computers were still pretty expensive and DRM use was limited to a few narrow categories. In 1998, DMCA 1201 was mostly used to prevent you from de-regionalizing your DVD player to watch discs that had been released overseas but not in your own country.</p>
<p>But as we warned back then, computers were only going to get smaller and cheaper, and eventually, it would only cost manufacturers pennies to wrap their products – or even subassemblies in their products – in DRM. Congress was putting a gun on the mantelpiece in Act I, and it was bound to go off in Act III.</p>
<p>Welcome to Act III.</p>
<p>Today, it costs about a quarter to add a system-on-a-chip to even the tiniest parts. These SOCs can run DRM. Here's how that DRM works: when you put a new part in a device, the SOC and the device's main controller communicate with one another. They perform a cryptographic protocol: the part says, "Here's my serial number," and then the main controller prompts the user to enter a manufacturer-supplied secret code, and the master controller sends a signed version of this to the part, and the part and the system then recognize each other.</p>
<p>This process has many names, but because it was first used in the automotive sector, it's widely known as VIN-Locking (VIN stands for "vehicle identification number," the unique number given to every car by its manufacturer). VIN-locking is used by automakers to block independent mechanics from repairing your car; even if they use the manufacturer's own parts, the parts and the engine will refuse to work together until the manufacturer's rep keys in the unlock code:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon">https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/24/rent-to-pwn/#kitt-is-a-demon</a></p>
<p>VIN locking is everywhere. It's how John Deere stops farmers from fixing their own tractors – something farmers have done literally since tractors were invented:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/08/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/08/about-those-kill-switched-ukrainian-tractors/</a></p>
<p>It's in <em>ventilators</em>. Like mobile phones, ventilators are a grotesquely monopolized sector, controlled by a single company Medtronic, whose biggest claim to fame is effecting the world's largest tax inversion in order to manufacture the appearance that it is an Irish company and therefore largely untaxable. Medtronic used the resulting windfall to gobble up most of its competitors.</p>
<p>During lockdown, as hospitals scrambled to keep their desperately needed supply of ventilators running, Medtronic's VIN-locking became a lethal impediment. Med-techs who used donor parts from one ventilator to keep another running – say, transplanting a screen – couldn't get the device to recognize the part because all the world's civilian aircraft were grounded, meaning Medtronic's technicians couldn't swan into their hospitals to type in the unlock code and charge them hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>The saving grace was an anonymous, former Medtronic repair tech, who built pirate boxes to generate unlock codes, using any housing they could lay hands on to use as a case: guitar pedals, clock radios, etc. This tech shipped these gadgets around the world, observing strict anonymity, because Article 6 of the EUCD <em>also</em> bans circumvention:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again">https://pluralistic.net/2020/07/10/flintstone-delano-roosevelt/#medtronic-again</a></p>
<p>Of course, <em>Apple</em> is a <em>huge</em> fan of VIN-locking. In phones, VIN-locking is usually called "serializing" or "parts-pairing," but it's the same thing: a tiny subassembly gets its own microcontroller whose sole purpose is to prevent independent repair technicians from fixing your gadget. Parts-pairing lets Apple block repairs even when the technician uses new, Apple parts – but it also lets Apple block refurb parts and third party parts.</p>
<p>For many years, Apple was the senior partner and leading voice in blocking state Right to Repair bills, which it killed by the <em>dozen</em>, leading a coalition of monopolists, from Wahl (who boobytrap their hair-clippers with springs that cause their heads irreversibly decompose if you try to sharpen them at home) to John Deere (who reinvented tenant farming by making farmers tenants of their tractors, rather than their land).</p>
<p>But Apple's opposition to repair eventually became a problem for the company. It's bad optics, and both Apple customers and Apple employees are volubly displeased with the company's ecocidal conduct. But of course, Apple's <em>management</em> and <em>shareholders</em> hate repair and want to block it as much as possible.</p>
<p>But Apple knows how to Think Differently. It came up with a way to eat its cake and have it, too. The company embarked on a program of visibly support right to repair, while working behind the scenes to sabotage it.</p>
<p>Last year, Apple announced a repair program. It was <em>hilarious</em>. If you wanted to swap your phone's battery, all you had to do was let Apple put a $1200 hold on your credit card, and then wait while the company shipped you 80 pounds' worth of specialized tools, packed in two special Pelican cases:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/22/apples-cement-overshoes/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/05/22/apples-cement-overshoes/</a></p>
<p>Then, you swapped your battery, but you weren't done! After your battery was installed, you had to conference in an authorized Apple tech who would tell you what code to type into a laptop you tethered to the phone in order to pair it with your phone. Then all you had to do was lug those two 40-pound Pelican cases to a shipping depot and wait for Apple to take the hold off your card (less the $120 in parts and fees).</p>
<p>By contrast, independent repair outfits like iFixit will sell you all the tools you need to do your own battery swap – including the battery! for $32. The whole kit fits in a padded envelope:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/iphone-x-replacement-battery">https://www.ifixit.com/products/iphone-x-replacement-battery</a></p>
<p>But while Apple was able to make a showy announcement of its repair program and then hide the malicious compliance inside those giant Pelican cases, sabotaging right to repair legislation is a lot harder.</p>
<p>Not that they didn't try. When New York State passed the first general electronics right-to-repair bill in the country, <em>someone</em> convinced New York Governor Kathy Hochul to neuter it with last-minute modifications:</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/weakened-right-to-repair-bill-is-signed-into-law-by-new-yorks-governor/">https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/weakened-right-to-repair-bill-is-signed-into-law-by-new-yorks-governor/</a></p>
<p>But that kind of trick only works once. When California's right to repair bill was introduced, it was clear that it was gonna pass. Rather than get run over by that train, Apple got on board, supporting the legislation, which passed unanimously:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california</a></p>
<p>But Apple got the last laugh. Because while California's bill contains many useful clauses for the independent repair shops that keep your gadgets out of a landfill, it's a state law, and DMCA 1201 is federal. A state law can't simply legalize the conduct federal law prohibits. California's right to repair bill is a banger, but it has a weak spot: parts-pairing, the scourge of repair techs:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair">https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair</a></p>
<p><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" alt="An iFixit bar-chart showing the rising trend to parts-pairing in iPhones." src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Parts-Pairing-Bar-Chart_1922wide.png?w=840&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/craphound.com/images/Parts-Pairing-Bar-Chart_1922wide.png?w=840&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>Every generation of Apple devices does more parts-pairing than the previous one, and the current models are so infested with paired parts as to be effectively unrepairable, except by Apple. It's so bad that iFixit has dropped its repairability score for the iPhone 14 from a 7 ("recommend") to a <em>4</em> (do not recommend):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en">https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en</a></p>
<p>Parts-pairing is bullshit, and Apple are scum for using it, but they're hardly unique. Parts-pairing is at the core of the fuckery of inkjet printer companies, who use it to fence out third-party ink, so they can charge $9,600/gallon for ink that pennies to make:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/ink-stained-wretches-battle-soul-digital-freedom-taking-place-inside-your-printer</a></p>
<p>Parts-pairing is also rampant in powered wheelchairs, a heavily monopolized sector whose predatory conduct is jaw-droppingly depraved:</p>
<p><a href="https://uspirgedfund.org/reports/usp/stranded">https://uspirgedfund.org/reports/usp/stranded</a></p>
<p>But if turning phones into e-waste to eke out another billion-dollar stock buyback is indefensible, stranding people with disabilities for months at a time while they await repairs is so obviously wicked that the conscience recoils. That's why it was so great when Colorado passed the nation's first wheelchair right to repair bill last year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-drm-comes-your-wheelchair">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/06/when-drm-comes-your-wheelchair</a></p>
<p>California actually just passed <em>two</em> right to repair bills; the other one was SB-271, which mirrors Colorado's HB22-1031:</p>
<p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB271">https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB271</a></p>
<p>This is big! It's momentum! It's a start!</p>
<p>But it can't be the end. When Bill Clinton signed DMCA 1201 into law 25 years ago, he loaded a gun and put it on the nation's mantlepiece and now it's Act III and we're all getting sprayed with bullets. Everything from ovens to insulin pumps, thermostats to lightbulbs, has used DMCA 1201 to limit repair, modification and improvement.</p>
<p>Congress needs to rid us of this scourge, to let us bring back all the benefits of interoperability. I explain how this all came to be – and what we should do about it – in my new Verso Books title, <em>The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This is the third section of the third part of our our planned five part series (<a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/21/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-i-spqr/">I</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/07/27/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-ii-romans-assemble/">II</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/08/11/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-iiia-starting-down-the-path-of-honors/">IIIa</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/08/18/collections-how-to-roman-republic-101-part-iiib-imperium/">IIIb</a>, <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/08/25/collections-how-to-roman-republic-part-iiic-ten-tribunes-two-censors-and-twenty-six-guys/" data-type="link" data-id="https://acoup.blog/2023/08/25/collections-how-to-roman-republic-part-iiic-ten-tribunes-two-censors-and-twenty-six-guys/">IIIc</a>) on the structure of the Roman Republic during the third and second centuries, the ‘Middle’ Republic.’  Over the last few posts we looked at the role of Roman magistrates who carried out a range of executive functions for the republic.  This week, we’re looking at the Roman Senate, an institution so important that it is included alongside the people of Rome in the SPQR formulation that the Romans used to represent the republic, and yet also paradoxically it is an institution that lacks any kind of formal legal powers.</p>



<p>Despite that lack of formal powers, the Senate of the Roman Republic largely directed the overall actions of the republic, coordinating its strategic policy (both military and diplomatic), setting priorities for legislation, handling Rome’s finances and assigning and directing the actions of the various magistrates.  The Senate – <em>not the Pontifex Maximus</em><span id="easy-footnote-1-20956"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-20956" title="I stress this point because this is a common mistake: assuming that the <em>Pontifex Maximus</em> as Rome&amp;#8217;s highest priest was in some way the &amp;#8216;boss&amp;#8217; of all of Rome&amp;#8217;s other priests.  He was not; he was the presiding officer of the college of Pontiffs and the manager of the calendar (this was a very significant role), but the <em>Pontifex Maximus</em> was not the head of some priestly heirarchy and his power over the other <em>pontifices</em> was limited.  Moreover his power over other religious officials (the <em>augures</em>, <em>haruspices</em>, the <em>quindecimviri sacris faciundis</em> and so on) was very limited.  Instead, these figures report to the Senate, though the Senate will generally defer to the judgement of the <em>pontifices</em>."><sup>1</sup></a></span>  – was also the final authority for questions of religion.  The paradox exists because the Senate’s power is almost entirely based in its <em>auctoritas</em> and the strong set of political norms and cultural assumptions which push Romans to defer to that <em>auctoritas</em>.</p>



<p>And if you want to wield the <em>auctoritas</em> of the <em>ACOUP</em> Senate, you can support this project on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=20122096">Patreon at the <em>patres et matres conscripti</em></a> tier, to be able to submit questions and weigh in on what topics we should cover next (I promise the long-awaited Greek-and-Phoenician colonization treatment is coming!).

<h2>Membership</h2>



<p>We should start with who is in the Senate.  Now what you will generally hear in survey courses is this neat summary: the Senate had 300 members (600 after Sulla) and included all Romans who had obtained the office of the quaestorship or higher <em>and</em> its members were selected by the censors.  And for a basic summary, that actually serves pretty well, but thinking about it for a few minutes one quickly realizes that there must be quite a bit of uncertainty and complexity underneath those neat easy rules.  And indeed, there is!</p>



<p>First we can start with eligibility by holding office.  We know that in the Sullan constitution, holding the quaestorship entitled one into entrance into the Senate.  Lintott notes that the lex repetundarum of 123/4 lumped every office aedile-and-above together in a phrasing ‘anyone who has or shall have been in the Senate’ when setting eligibility for the juries for the repetundae courts (the aim being to exclude the magistrate class from judging itself on corruption charges), and so assumes that prior to Sulla, it was aediles and up (but not quaestors) who were entitled to be in the Senate.<span id="easy-footnote-2-20956"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-20956" title="With sitting tribunes able to attend meetings of the Senate, but not being granted lifelong membership."><sup>2</sup></a></span>  The problem immediately occurs: these higher offices don’t provide enough members to reach the frequently attested 300-Senator size of the Senate with any reasonable set of life expectancies.</p>



<p>By contrast, if we assume that the quaestors were enrolled in the Senate, as we know them to have been post-Sulla (Cicero is a senator for sure in 73, having been quaestor in 75), we have 8 quaestors a year elected around age 30 each with roughly 30 years of life expectancy<span id="easy-footnote-3-20956"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-20956" title="A touch higher than the 24 years a L3 Model West life table (what we generally use to simulate Roman populations) leads us to expect, but then these are elites who are likely to be well nourished and not in hazardous occupations, so they might live a bit longer."><sup>3</sup></a></span> we get a much more reasonable 240, to which we might add some holders of senior priesthoods who didn’t go into politics and the ten sitting tribunes and perhaps a few reputable scions of important families selected by the censors to reach 300 without too much difficulty.  The alternative is to assume the core membership of the Senate was aediles and up, which would provide only around 150 members, in which case the censors would have to supplement that number with important, reputable Romans.</p>



<p>To which we may then ask: who might they choose?  The obvious candidates would be…current and former quaestors and plebeian tribunes.  And so we end up with a six-of-one, half-dozen of the other situation, where it is possible that quaestors were not <em>automatically</em> enrolled before Sulla, but were customarily chosen by the censors to ‘fill out’ the Senate.  Notably, when Sulla wants to expand the Senate, he radically expands (to twenty) the number of quaestors, which in turn provides roughly enough Senators for his reported 600-person Senate.</p>



<p>That leads us to the roll of the censors: if holding a sufficiently high office (be it the quaestorship or aedileship) <em>entitles</em> one to membership for life in the Senate, what on earth is the role of the censors in selecting the Senate’s membership?  Here the answer is in the sources for us: we repeatedly see the formula that the meetings of the Senate were attended by two groups: the Senators themselves and “those who are permitted to state their opinion in the Senate.”  Presumably the distinction here is between men designated as senators by the censors and men not yet so designated who nevertheless, by virtue of office-holding, have a right to speak in the Senate.  It’s also plausible that men who were still <em>iuniores</em> might not yet be Senators (whose very name, after all, implies old age; <em>Senator</em> has at its root <em>senex</em>, “old man”) or perhaps men still under the <em>potestas </em>of a living father (who thus could hardly be one of the <em>patres conscripti</em>, a standard term for Senators) might be included in the latter group.</p>



<p>In any case, the censors seem to have three rolls here.  First, they confirm the membership in the Senate of individuals entitled to it by having held high office.  Second, they can fill out an incomplete Senate with additional Roman aristocrats so that it reaches the appropriate size.  Finally, they can <em>remove</em> a Senator for moral turpitude, though this is rare and it is clear that the conduct generally needed to be egregious.</p>



<p>In this way, we get a Senate that is as our sources describe: <em>roughly</em> 300 members at any given time (brought to the right number every five years by the censors), consisting mostly of former office holders (with some add-ons) who have held offices at or above the quaestorship and whose membership has been approved by the censors, though office holders might enter the Senate – provisionally, as it were – immediately pending censorial confirmation at a later date.  If it seems like I am giving short shrift to the ‘filling the rank’ add-ons the censors might provide, it is because – as we’ll see in a moment – Senate procedure combined with Roman cultural norms was likely to render them quite unimportant.  The role of <em>senior</em> ex-magistrates in the Senate was to speak, the role of junior ex-magistrates (and certainly of any senator who had not held high office!) was to <em>listen </em>and indicate concurrence with a previously expressed opinion, as we’re going to see when we get to procedure.</p>



<h2>Meetings</h2>



<p>Meetings of the Senate were formal affairs, but unlike modern legislatures the Senate did not stay in session over long periods.  Instead, it met in specific venues – they had to be inaugurated – when called by a magistrate with the power to do so.</p>



<p>We may begin with place: the Senate had no single fixed meeting spot, though the <em>curia</em> in the Forum was the most common location, however the place the Senate met had to be religiously prepared via inauguration (the taking of the auspices by the augurs) and by sacrifices in order to make sure the gods approved of the proceedings and its results.  Consequently, the Senate always met in a <em>templum</em> in the sense of a consecrated space, but also it tended to meet literally <em>in temples</em>, with meetings in the temples of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the temple of Fides, the temple of Concord, and so on.  Notably, two locations, the temple of Bellona and the temple of Apollo were also used and these sat <em>outside</em> the <em>pomerium</em>, enabling the Senate to meet with magistrates who, because of their active command of an army, could not cross the <em>pomerium</em>; they were also sometimes used to meet with foreign dignitaries the Senate did not wish to let into the city.  Later added to this number of sites outside the pomerium was Pompey’s theater, which included a temple of Venus Victrix and a <em>curia</em> as part of the overall complex.</p>

Still, this gives us a sense of what a meeting place for the Senate might be like, rather less spacious than most movies would have it, with 300 senators it would have been quite crowded (and the <em>curia Hostilia</em> was no larger in terms of footprint).</figcaption></figure>



<p>In order to meet, the Senate had to be called or more correctly ‘driven together’ (<em>cogere</em>, often translated adequately as ‘summoned,’ but as Lintott notes, it has an element of compulsion to it) by a magistrate.  There were a few standard dates on which this would effectively always happen, particularly the first day of the consular year, but beyond that it was expected that magistrates in Rome could call the Senate at any time to discuss any issue on relatively short notice.  There was initially no <em>requirement</em> that Senators live in the city of Rome, but it was clearly assumed.  Early on in the second century, we get regulations requiring Senators to stay close to Rome unless they had an official reason to be elsewhere, though Senators might be permitted to leave if they needed to fulfill a vow.  In the Late Republic it seems to have been common also for Senators to leave the city during the spring <em>res prolatae</em>, a sort of recess from public business (literally “the deferring of business”), but these informal breaks did not mean the Senate was truly ‘out of session’ and it could still be summoned by a magistrate.</p>

The large ‘SC’ on the reverse does in fact, stand for <em>senatus consulto</em>, because the weights and values of Roman bronze coinage was decreed by the Senate.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Generally, meetings of the Senate began at dawn, though they could begin later, and they proceeded either until the business was concluded or to dusk.  Because of the ritual preparations required, no meeting of the Senate could last more than a day, much like the assemblies, so if the business was not finished, a new meeting would need to be called and the process begun from scratch.  While it seems that magistrates generally tried to avoid calling the Senate during festival days, <em>dies nefandi</em> (days unsuited for public business) and meetings of the popular assemblies, there was no requirement to do so and the Senate might be called for any day for most of the Republic, with laws restricting the Senate’s meeting days only coming midway through the first century.</p>



<p>Beyond this, Senators were expected to show up and we hear of threats of fines or other censure for failure to show up, but it also seems like no meeting of the senate was ever very close to the full body and quorums for the Senate were fairly low, 100 or 150.  For the Sullan Senate, notionally of 600 members, the highest attendances we know of, as noted by Lintott, are 415, 417 and 392.  Of course some significant number of Senators will, at any time, have been active magistrates overseas, or serving as military tribunes, or as senatorial <em>legati</em>, but it seems clear that even beyond this attendance was not universal even if it was in theory supposed to be.</p>



<h2>Procedure</h2>



<p>Once the Senate met, it had a standard procedure which was followed.  <strong>The Senate was fundamentally a deliberative body</strong>, unlike the assemblies which merely voted, and so most of the procedure focused on that deliberation and debate.  And this makes sense, as the notional purpose of the Senate was as a large advisory council to the magistrates, in the same way that it had once been the advisory council to the kings.</p>



<p>Generally, each meeting of the Senate had a set agenda item, presented by the convening magistrate, although for that traditional meeting at the start of the consular year it was common to convene the Senate <em>de re publica infinite</em>, “on the whole Republic.”  By far the most common convening magistrate was the consul, but other magistrates could convene the Senate (notably the tribunes).  The convening magistrate spoke first with an introductory speech, a <em>relatio</em>, with introduced the topic and often presented a proposed course of action on that topic.  In some cases, that introduction might be a short one, but it could also be a long and involved speech or the introduction of an ambassador or the reading of dispatches.  The Senate seems also at sometimes to have formed subcommittees and a magistrate might use an introduction to put the recommendations of a subcommittee, such as pre-drafted legislation, before the body.  But it was just as common to open a debate on a broad topic.</p>



<p>Once the convening magistrate was done introducing the issue, the opinions of each senator, in turn, were sought.  The order was set by the censors, but it was based on offices held and seniority, so while the censors could shift (<em>‘movere’</em>) a senator down in the order, they were expected to have a good reason (typically conspicuous moral turpitude).  The order began with the <em>princeps senatus</em>, traditionally the most senior ex-consul, though ‘most senior’ here often meant both in age and in influence, so while the <em>princeps senatus</em> was never young, it might not strictly be the oldest senator.  After that, the former consuls (in Latin <em>consulares</em>, which enters English as ‘consulars’ to mean ‘men who have held the consulship’) spoke, with the most former (and thus likely oldest) going first.  And then the Senate proceeded down in rank order to ex-praetors and so on all the way down.  As you may well imagine, the figures who spoke first tended to set the terms of the debate and indeed the whole reason they spoke first is because they were understood to be preeminent in <em>auctoritas</em>.</p>



<p>Each senator, as the order came to them was expected to present their opinion (<em>sententia</em>).  The expression of their view could be as long or as short as they wished (filibusters were possible), but they had to answer.  Senators were given broad latitude in their response, able to interrogate the magistrate or visiting ambassadors, respond to their fellows or wander entirely off of the origional <em>relatio</em> to another topic entirely  They could also launch into long speeches which, again, might or might not actually pertain primarily to the topic at hand.  Cato the Elder was famous for ending speeches on topics entirely unrelated to the matter with an exhortation that “Carthage must be destroyed,” while Cicero took the opportunity of a debate on some relatively minor matters of roads and mints to launch into his Seventh Philippic, a speech exhorting the Senate to move against Marcus Antonius.  Still it was expected that at some point the response ought to speak to the matter at hand and so Cicero ends the Seventh Philippic with <em>quibus de rebus refers, P. Servilio adsentior</em>, “on the matters you refer [to the Senate], I agree with Publius Servilius.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the minimum possible response a senator could give, and this must have been a very frequent response, was to agree with what some other senator earlier in the speaking order had said and we certainly get the sense that this was the most common thing for more junior senators to do.  Indeed, we’re told that, while the more senior senators were speaking, more junior senators, termed <em>pedarii</em> (lit: ‘footmen’ but really ‘walkers’) by Cicero for reasons that will soon be obvious, would move in the hall to sit by the speaker with whom they agreed to show their support.  Given the elimination-contest nature of the Roman office holding, the Senate must always have had far more of these junior senators than of senior consulars whose opinion would carry real weight, but their movement <em>en masse</em> to agree with one or another position would have carried its own <em>auctoritas</em>.</p>



<p>Now, junior senators absolutely could hold forth on their own basis and we are told of occasions where they did so.  Sallust presents the debate on the fate of Catiline’s conspirators in 63 as turning on the opinions of Marcus Porcius Cato (the younger) and Gaius Julius Caesar; Cato was almost certainly one of the most junior members of the Senate, being the <em>quaestor urbanus</em> that very year, while Caesar was more senior as a praetor-elect and Pontifex Maximus, but still hardly the most senior fellow in the room.  But in practice, moments like these were probably relatively rare (Caesar and Cato both may have felt emboldened because of their current positions, though Cato especially, a powerful speaker, maintained outsized influence in the Senate despite never rising to the consulship).  Roman culture strongly encouraged deference both to elders and social superiors and the senior consulars were both, while in turn the mechanics of Roman politics will have meant that junior senators would have been wise to attach themselves to powerful consulars in any event.</p>



<p>At the end of this process of speaking, the presiding magistrate could put the issue to a vote.  The magistrate in question set the terms of the vote, laying out a proposed <em>senatus consultum</em> (opinion of the Senate) and asking all senators who agreed to go to one side while everyone who disagreed go to the other.  Multiple such motions could be voted in succession and the Senate might approve or disapprove of any set of them, but the order was up to the magistrate who might thus frame proposals tactically to achieve a given outcome.  If the vote passed then the proposal – drafted into written form by the presiding magistrate, usually with the assistance of a few more junior senators – and issued as a formal decree of the Senate, called a <em>senatus consultum</em>.</p>



<p>A few things could interrupt this stately order.  The simplest was that senators could change their mind, based presumably on the arguments of others later in the speaking order; they seem to have been able to interrupt the order to announce that change, that they now agreed with so-and-so.  Alternately, there might be calls for various kinds of floor motions, akin to points of order.  The most common was <em>consule!</em> (‘consult!’), a call to signal that the magistrate needed to consult the senators (run through the speaking order) before proceeding to a vote on a given measure; you couldn’t just propose a vote and ram it through without debate.  Alternately, senators might call out <em>divide</em>! (‘divide!’) to signal that certain motions being presented together needed to be split up, discussed and voted on separately.  Also <em>numera!</em> (‘numbers!’ meaning ‘count!’) was the call to demand a quorum check.  The Senate might even call for discussion to be opened on an issue, demanding a new <em>relatio</em> to discuss issues that had been raised – most often in the reading of dispatches or the reports of ambassadors, but sometimes from debates that broke out between senators.</p>



<p>Consequently, while the presiding magistrate convened the Senate and in theory set the agenda, in practice the Senate was much less under their control than the voting assembly.  The presiding magistrate, it must be noted, could not cut off debate, though he could simply refuse to put a motion to a vote at the end of it.  In addition, just to gum up the process further, a <em>senatus consultum</em> could be veto’d by the consuls or the tribunes, though the opinion of the Senate was still registered, just merely as the <em>senatus auctoritas</em> rather than <em>consultum</em>, though this carried a lot less weight.  A veto’d proposal could simply be brought another day, in the hope that it might escape veto subsequently and at least until the 130s, it seems to have been an accepted part of the <em>mos maiorum</em> that one did not maintain a veto indefinitely against either the popular will or the will of the Senate (much less both), so in the third and most of the second century, a veto was a delaying tactic rather than a decisive killing of a motion.</p>



<p>As an aside before we move on to the Senate’s (lack of) formal powers and (abundant) traditional prerogatives, it seems worth noting how much emphasis this sort of system placed both on the speaking ability of senators and their personal <em>auctoritas</em>.  Unlike as in many modern legislatures, the speeches here were not cosmetic and senators were not bound to a ‘party line’ in their votes.  Consequently, powerful speakers or senators with formidable reputations, <em>if they were present</em> (and not, say, deployed in the provinces) could exert a lot of sway among the junior members of the senate who would make up the majority of votes when it came time to approve a <em>senatus consultum</em>.</p>



<h2>Powers and Prerogatives</h2>



<p>Now we have a <em>senatus consultum</em>, so we may ask what power it has and the answer is ‘none.’  But it is also ‘very much.’  And that brings us to the central paradox of the Senate.  On the one hand, as I have my students chant in class, <strong>the Senate has no formal powers</strong> (in the Republic, before Sulla).  It cannot legislate, it cannot adjudicate court cases, it cannot create or appoint magistrates, it cannot order armies or convene assemblies.  <em><strong>All</strong></em> the Senate can do is<em><strong> issue opinions</strong></em>, which are not <em>technically</em> binding on anyone.  This is particularly true when a <em>senatus consultum</em> comes into conflict with a decision of a popular assembly (a <em>lex</em>); at all points, the <em>lex</em> wins.</p>



<p><strong>But the advice of the Senate is almost <em>always</em> followed, especially in certain key areas of the Republic</strong>.</p>



<p>Consequently while the Senate’s <em>de iure</em> powers basically don’t exist, its <em>de facto</em> powers under the <em>mos maiorum </em>are vast to the point that outside observers like Polybius conclude that the Senate is the most powerful part of the Roman state.<span id="easy-footnote-4-20956"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-20956" title="Though it must be noted that Polybius is mostly looking at Roman foreign policy, where the Senate is strongest."><sup>4</sup></a></span>  As a result, in the period we can see most clearly from the fourth to the second century, the Senate almost always gets its way and exercises a customary control over key aspects of Roman governance, especially foreign policy, that is nearly complete.  And while the Senate might not have any clearly defined legal authority to do <em>any of this</em>, <strong>governments are how they function</strong> and this is how the <em>res publica</em> functioned during the third and second centuries.</p>



<p>Domestically, the <em>auctoritas</em> of the Senate was such that it was clearly hard to pass laws without obtaining the <em>consilium</em> (consultation, counsel) of the Senate and receiving a favorable <em>senatus consultum</em>.  You can easily see the mix of pressures here: on the one hand, a politician pushing a law would be profoundly unwise to trample the Senate to do so, because at the end of his short one-year term he would go back to being just a senator and in any case reliant on the influence of other senators to win future high office or other honors.  At the same time, Roman voters seem to have taken the <em>consultum</em> of the Senate pretty seriously, so if the Senate was strongly against a motion, they were likely to vote it down <em>anyway</em>.  And that makes sense: the Senate is a body of the most successful, most prestigious, most respected Romans in a society where you are expected to the defer to the judgements of such men.  The People were not always supine before the Senate by any means, but the <em>auctoritas</em> <em>senatus</em> meant a lot.</p>



<p>That said, the Senate’s authority was unevenly spread.  It seems fairly clear, especially by the fourth century, that the Senate felt it necessary to yield – if only slowly – on proposals where it faced widespread popular opposition.  One may, of course, immediately contrast the Senate of the late-second and early-first century, which squanders its <em>auctoritas</em> trying to stop proposals of this sort.  So when it came to domestic affairs, the power of the Senate was perhaps at a low ebb; it could offer its approval to laws or its disapproval, but carrying out the laws was up to the magistrates and the assemblies of the people had the final say in passing or not passing proposals.</p>



<p>In foreign policy, the Senate was far more influential, to the point of dominance.  One crucial task that is clearly regularized well before 218, when the survival of more of Livy lets us see it clearly, is the assignment of magistrates to specific jobs or <em>provinciae</em>.  It is frankly unclear how strong the legal basis for these assignments was and in any event it doesn’t matter: what matters is that the Senate advised the magistrates and the magistrates always acted accordingly.  Consequently, the Senate was the senior strategic directing organ of the Republic, coordinating strategy and indeed <em>grand</em> strategy over the whole of the Mediterranean through a system of provincial assignments, directives to the magistrates assigned and transfers of resources between Italy and those provinces (including province-to-province transfers) accomplished by assigned senatorial commissioners (called <em>legati</em>).<span id="easy-footnote-5-20956"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-20956" title=" I should note much of this picture is owed to Michael Taylor, with whom I am collaborating on work on this very topic; I&amp;#8217;ll be sure to hollar if/when that work appears in print, of course."><sup>5</sup></a></span>  What we see in Livy is a regular cycle where these assignments are decided on at the start of each consular year, along with the Senate ‘advising’ the magistrates and pro-magistrates on how many <a href="https://acoup.blog/2023/06/16/collections-how-to-raise-a-roman-army-the-dilectus/" data-type="post" data-id="19439">soldiers they should levy</a> and where those troops ought to go (along with supplies, as mentioned); the Senates prerogative in this regard becomes so ironclad that it is by the career of Scipio Aemilianus treated as effectively a legal restriction, which can only be finessed by taking volunteers, but not by simply passing a law or ignoring the Senate.</p>



<p>Connected to this was the Senate’s oversight over state finance.  The finances of the <em>res publica</em>, you will recall, were overseen by quite junior officials, the quaestors.  In practice what that seems to have really meant was that the larger financial picture was handled by the Senate, which ,set the annual <em>tributum</em> (Rome’s direct tax on citizens) and approved major expenditures from the treasury, the largest of which will have been to the armies, thus neatly tying up with the above paragraph.  It is not hard to see why the Senate ends up running this aspect, both because it was one which required long-term vision, but also because the quaestors, as junior magistrates looking to move further up the <em>cursus honorum</em>, wouldn’t have have had any incentive or sufficient personal influence to defy the Senate’s <em>auctoritas</em> in any event.  The Senate thus ‘advised’ the quaestors on what to do with Rome’s finances, and they did it.  Once again, the question of if the Senate had the <em>legal</em> power to do this was rather beside the point: in any event the quaestors complied.</p>



<p>Likewise, the Senate had a powerful role in foreign policy, though in the end only the <em>comitia centuriata</em> could make peace or declare wars.  Foreign ambassadors had to report to the consuls, but the consuls role, in addition to hosting them, was primarily to introduce the ambassadors to speak to the Senate, and then it was the Senate which considered their positions.  That makes a lot of sense, as the Senate is a continuing body: an agreement with a consul would only hold potentially for a year, but an agreement with the Senate has some permanence to it and it certainly seems like if the Senate suggested treaty ratification to the assembly, it passed.  As noted previously, assemblies bucking the Senate on questions of war and peace was extremely rare; when it happened, concessions were made and eventually the People followed the advice of the Senate.</p>



<p>Finally, the Senate was also the effective final authority on Roman religion.  Quite a few students tend to assume this authority must rest with Rome’s most senior priest, the Pontifex Maximus, but it does not.  Instead, Rome’s senior priests, like the College of Pontiffs advised the Senate on religious matters, but it was the Senate which decided.  Thus it was the Senate which instituted the <em>Ludi Apollinares</em> (Livy  25.12), it was the Senate that directed that the worship of Cybele be brought to Italy as the Magna Mater (Livy 29.10), the Senate which ordered the suppression and later regulations (Livy 39.14 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_de_Bacchanalibus" data-type="link" data-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatus_consultum_de_Bacchanalibus">we have the text of the <em>senatus consultum</em></a>) of the Bacchanalia.  </p>

<h2>Auctoritas Senatus</h2>



<p>All of these prerogatives are based on the Senate’s informal authority, its <em>auctoritas</em>, rather than any formal powers of compulsion (which it lacks).  The extent of that <em>auctoritas</em> and the degree to which it was clearly felt by most Romans to be necessary to respect, can come as a bit of a surprise.  But it is worth remembering the sort of society the Romans have and also the kind of organization the Senate is.</p>



<p>On the one hand, Roman culture is one where deference to age and authority is expected and normalized, with the Romans being quite comfortable with open hierarchies among citizens.  These sorts of cultural values were mot than just a dry sense that one needed to be polite to the elderly; the Romans <em>felt</em> the demands of honor and deference quite keenly.<span id="easy-footnote-6-20956"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-20956" title="For a sense of how keenly, see C. Barton, <em>Roman Honor: the fire in the bones</em> (2001)."><sup>6</sup></a></span>  The Senate was in turn a collection of the 300 very highest status individuals, the men with the <em>most</em> <em>auctoritas</em> in a society that did not have many alternative structures of power or influence.  Modern politicians have to compete with journalists, pundits, business moguls and media stars for influence; but to a substantial degree the nature of Roman society meant that nearly all of the most influential men in this period were in the Senate.  These were the wealthiest men in Rome and also the most politically accomplished men in Rome and also the most visible and notable men in Rome.  When they spoke collectively through a <em>senatus consultum</em>, the <em>auctoritas</em> of the thing was immense.</p>



<p>At the same time, the Senate’s <em>auctoritas</em> also came from the accomplishments and in a sense the expertise of its members.  Because it was a body of ex-magistrates, pretty much every Roman with senior leadership experience in either civil or military affairs was a member.  It was at once a council of Rome’s most experienced political leaders and its most experienced generals, which also included its most experienced priests.  And as the only <em>deliberative</em> part of the Roman political process, it provided those figures the opportunity to debate and discuss; it is thus perhaps unsurprising that it usually took quite a lot for the Roman People to come to the decision that the Senate was making a poor choice.</p>



<p>Finally, the <em>auctoritas</em> of the Senate clearly rested substantially on its history, something that it seems to me the senators themselves did not fully understand.  In the early third century, the Senate – in as much as we can see with our often less-than-ideal sources – both managed the closing stages of the Struggle of the Orders and the successful completion of the last two wars to dominate Italy (the Third Samnite War, 298-290 and the Pyrrhic War, 280-275) against formidable opponents.  Then under the leadership of the Senate, Rome emerged victorious from a long and grueling first war against Carthage (264-241).  It seems little surprise then that, when deciding how to manage the governance of their new overseas provinces (Sicily, then Corsica et Sardinia) the Romans leaned on the Senate.  When the Second Punic War (218-201) came around, the Senate assumed a decisive role in strategic direction, especially after the initial setbacks.</p>



<p>In short, the Senate’s <em>auctoritas</em> was also substantially rooted in the perception that its advice was generally wise, that it had been generally successful, particularly through the third century.  That in turn explains substantially just how <em>dominant</em> the Senate is through much of the second century – its <em>auctoritas</em>, when we come to see it clearly – was at a high ebb.</p>



<p>But of course that <em>auctoritas</em> was to a substantial degree dependent on future performance.  We see pretty clearly that faith in the Senate wanes over the back half of the second century and its <em>auctoritas</em> with it.  Setbacks in the Third Punic War (149-146) and the Numantine War (143-133) lead the assemblies to demand unconventional generals – in both cases, electing the legally-ineligable-at-the-time Scipio Aemilianus to the task, over the objections of the Senate.  And the Senate’s stubborn failure to address perceived economic problems and the boiling crisis over the status of the <em>socii</em> also seems to have degraded its <em>auctoritas</em>.</p>



<p>The great advantage of government by <em>auctoritas</em> rather than laws was that the Senate’s authority could flow wherever it was needed, enabling the Roman system to adapt to the shift from being one city in Italy to an Italian empire to a Mediterranean Empire smoothly.  But such a government was also necessarily fragile in ways I am not sure the Romans ever quite realized, because if that <em>auctoritas</em> were squandered, there was no legal, compulsive authority for the Senate, which had become the central organ of Roman governance, to fall back on.  Sulla’s effort to restore the power of the Senate by radically expanding it seems, here, particularly misguided, as if adding 300 more mediocrities could restore the respect of an institution after Marius and Sulla himself had gotten done killing nearly all of the men of experience, capability and consequence in the body.</p>



<p>But all of this is getting rather too close to a narrative of the collapse of the Republic, which is a formidable topic in its own right.  Next time, we’ll close out the main trunk of this series with a look at Rome’s courts (but expect <em>addenda</em> also covering provincial government and Rome’s Italian alliance system).</p>
<ol><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-1-20956"></span>I stress this point because this is a common mistake: assuming that the <em>Pontifex Maximus</em> as Rome’s highest priest was in some way the ‘boss’ of all of Rome’s other priests.  He was not; he was the presiding officer of the college of Pontiffs and the manager of the calendar (this was a very significant role), but the <em>Pontifex Maximus</em> was not the head of some priestly heirarchy and his power over the other <em>pontifices</em> was limited.  Moreover his power over other religious officials (the <em>augures</em>, <em>haruspices</em>, the <em>quindecimviri sacris faciundis</em> and so on) was very limited.  Instead, these figures report to the Senate, though the Senate will generally defer to the judgement of the <em>pontifices</em>.<a href="#easy-footnote-1-20956"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-2-20956"></span>With sitting tribunes able to attend meetings of the Senate, but not being granted lifelong membership.<a href="#easy-footnote-2-20956"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-3-20956"></span>A touch higher than the 24 years a L3 Model West life table (what we generally use to simulate Roman populations) leads us to expect, but then these are elites who are likely to be well nourished and not in hazardous occupations, so they might live a bit longer.<a href="#easy-footnote-3-20956"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-4-20956"></span>Though it must be noted that Polybius is mostly looking at Roman foreign policy, where the Senate is strongest.<a href="#easy-footnote-4-20956"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-5-20956"></span> I should note much of this picture is owed to Michael Taylor, with whom I am collaborating on work on this very topic; I’ll be sure to hollar if/when that work appears in print, of course.<a href="#easy-footnote-5-20956"></a></li><li><span id="easy-footnote-bottom-6-20956"></span>For a sense of how keenly, see C.

             <img src="https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/assets/litestream-cover.webp" alt="">
           <p>I’m Ben Johnson. I wrote BoltDB, an embedded database that is the backend for systems like etcd. Now I work at <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly.io</a>, on <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>. Litestream is an open-source project that makes SQLite tenable for full-stack applications through the power of ✨replication✨. If you can set up a SQLite database, <a href="https://fly.io/docs/speedrun/">you can get Litestream working in less than 10 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom of full-stack applications is the n-tier architecture, which is now so common that it’s easy to forget it even has a name. It’s what you’re doing when you run an “application server” like Rails, Django, or Remix alongside a “database server” like Postgres. According to the conventional wisdom, SQLite has a place in this architecture: as a place to run unit tests.</p>

<p>The conventional wisdom could use some updating. I think that for many applications –&nbsp;production applications, with large numbers of users and high availability requirements –&nbsp;SQLite has a better place, in the center of the stack, as the core of your data and persistence layer.</p>

<p>It’s a big claim. It may not hold for your application. But you should consider it, and I’m here to tell you why.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-application-databases"><a href="#a-brief-history-of-application-databases" aria-label="Anchor"></a>A Brief History Of Application Databases</h2>
<p>50 years is not a long time. In that time, we’ve seen a staggering amount of change in how our software manages data.</p>

<p>In the beginning of our story, back in the ‘70s, there were <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/sql-in-a/9780596155322/ch01s01s01.html">Codd’s rules,</a> defining what we now call “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database">relational databases</a>”, also known today as “databases”. You know them, even if you don’t: all data lives in tables; tables have columns, and rows are addressable with keys; C.R.U.D.; schemas; a textual language to convey these concepts. The language, of course, is SQL, which prompted a Cambrian explosion of SQL databases, from Oracle to DB2 to Postgres to MySQL, throughout the '80s and '90s.</p>

<p>It hasn’t all been good. The 2000s got us XML databases. But our industry atoned  by building some <a href="https://www.vertica.com/secrets-behind-verticas-performance/">great columnar databases</a> during the same time. By the 2010s, we saw dozens of large-scale, open-source distributed database projects come to market.  Now anyone can spin up a cluster and query terabytes of data.</p>

<p>As databases evolved, so too did the strategies we use to plug them in to our applications. Almost since Codd, we’ve divided those apps into tiers. First came the database tier. Later, with <a href="https://memcached.org/">memcached</a> and <a href="https://redis.io/">Redis</a>, we got the caching tier. We’ve got <a href="https://sidekiq.org/">background job tiers</a> and we’ve got <a href="https://www.pgbouncer.org/">routing tiers</a> and distribution tiers. The tutorials pretend that there are 3 tiers, but we all know it’s called “n-tier” because nobody can predict how many tiers we’re going to end up with.</p>

<p>You know where we’re going with this. Our scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, and so on.</p>

<p>See, over these same five decades, we’ve also seen CPUs, memory, &amp; disks become hundreds of times faster and cheaper. A term that practically defines database innovation in the 2010s is “big data”. But hardware improvements have made that concept slippery in the 2020s. Managing a 1 GB database in 1996? A big deal. In 2022? Run it on your laptop, or a t3.micro.</p>

<p>When we think about new database architectures, we’re hypnotized by scaling limits. If it can’t handle petabytes, or at least terabytes, it’s not in the conversation. But most applications will never see a terabyte of data, even if they’re successful. We’re using jackhammers to drive finish nails.</p>
<h2 id="the-sweet-release-of-sqlite"><a href="#the-sweet-release-of-sqlite" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The Sweet Release of SQLite</h2>
<p>There’s a database that bucks a lot of these trends. It’s one of the most popular SQL databases in the world, so standardized it’s an <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html">official archival format of the Library of Congress</a>, it’s renowned for its reliability and its <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">unfathomably encompassing test suite</a>, and its performance is so good that citing its metrics on a message board invariably starts an argument about whether it should be disqualified. I probably don’t have to name it for you, but, for the one person in the back with their hand raised, I’m talking about <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>.</p>

<p>SQLite is an embedded database. It doesn’t live in a conventional architectural tier; it’s just a library, linked into your application server’s process. It’s the standard bearer of the “<a href="https://crawshaw.io/blog/one-process-programming-notes">single process application</a>”: the server that runs on its own, without relying on nine other sidecar servers to function.</p>

<p>I got interested in these kinds of applications because I build databases. I wrote <a href="https://github.com/boltdb/bolt">BoltDB</a>, which is a popular embedded K/V store in the Go ecosystem. BoltDB is reliable and, as you’d expect from an in-process database, it performs like a nitro-burning funny car. But BoltDB has limitations: its schema is defined in Go code, and so it’s hard to migrate databases. You have to build your own tooling for it; there isn’t even a REPL.</p>

<p>If you’re careful, using this kind of database can get you a lot of performance. But for general-purpose use, you don’t want to run your database off the open headers like a funny car. I thought about the kind of work I’d have to do to make BoltDB viable for more applications, and the conclusion I quickly reached was: that’s what SQLite is for.</p>

<p>SQLite, as you are no doubt already typing into the message board comment, is not without its own limitations. The biggest of them is that a single-process application has a single point of failure: if you lose the server, you’ve lost the database. That’s not a flaw in SQLite; it’s just inherent to the design.</p>
<h2 id="enter-litestream"><a href="#enter-litestream" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Enter Litestream</h2>
<p>There are two big reasons everyone doesn’t default to SQLite. The first is resilience to storage failures, and the second is concurrency at scale. Litestream has something to say about both concerns.</p>

<p>How Litestream works is that it takes control of SQLite’s <a href="https://sqlite.org/wal.html">WAL-mode journaling</a>. In WAL mode, write operations append to a log file stored alongside SQLite’s main database file. Readers check both the WAL file and the main database to satisfy queries. Normally, SQLite automatically checkpoints pages from the WAL back to the main database. Litestream steps in the middle of this: we open an indefinite read transaction that prevents automatic checkpoints. We then capture WAL updates ourselves, replicate them, and trigger the checkpointing ourselves.</p>
<div><p>The most important thing you should understand about Litestream is that it’s just SQLite. Your application uses standard SQLite, with whatever your standard SQLite libraries are. We’re not parsing your queries or proxying your transactions, or even adding a new library dependency. We’re just taking advantage of the journaling and concurrency features SQLite already has, in a tool that runs alongside your application. For the most part, your code can be oblivious to Litestream’s existence.</p>

<p>Or, think of it this way: you can build a Remix application backed by Litestream-replicated SQLite, and, while it’s running, crack open the database using the standard <code>sqlite3</code> REPL and make some changes. It’ll just work.</p>

<p>You can read more about <a href="https://litestream.io/how-it-works/">how this works here</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>It sounds complicated, but it’s incredibly simple in practice, and <a href="https://litestream.io/getting-started/">if you play with it</a> you’ll see that it “just works”. You run the Litestream binary on the server your database lives on in “replicate” mode:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>litestream replicate fruits.db s3://my-bukkit:9000/fruits.db
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>And then you can “restore” it to another location:</p>
<div>
  <pre><code>litestream restore -o fruits-replica.db s3://my-bukkit:9000/fruits.db
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Now commit a change to your database; if you restore again then you’ll see the change on your new copy.</p>
<p>We’ll replicate almost anywhere: to S3, or Minio; to Azure, or Backblaze B2, or Digital Ocean or Google Cloud, or an SFTP server.</p>
<p>The ordinary way people use Litestream today is to replicate their SQLite database to S3 (it’s remarkably cheap for most SQLite databases to live-replicate to S3). That, by itself, is a huge operational win: your database is as resilient as you ask it to be, and easily moved, migrated, or mucked with.</p>

<p>But you can do more than that with Litestream. The upcoming release of Litestream will let you live-replicate SQLite directly between databases, which means you can set up a write-leader database with distributed read replicas. Read replicas can <a href="https://fly.io/blog/globally-distributed-postgres/">catch writes and redirect them to the leader</a>; most applications are read-heavy, and this setup gives those applications a globally scalable database.</p>

<h2 id="you-should-take-this-option-more-seriously"><a href="#you-should-take-this-option-more-seriously" aria-label="Anchor"></a>You Should Take This Option More Seriously</h2>
<p>One of my first jobs in tech in the early 2000s was as an Oracle Database Administrator (DBA) for an Oracle9i database. I remember spending hours poring over books and documentation to learn the ins  and  outs of the Oracle database. And there were a lot. The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A91034_01/DOC/server.901/a90117.pdf">administration guide</a> was almost a thousand pages—and that was just one of over <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/cd/A91034_01/DOC/nav/docindex.htm">a hundred documentation guides</a>.</p>

<p>Learning what knobs to turn to optimize queries or to improve writes could make a big difference back then. We had disk drives that could only read tens of megabytes per second so utilizing a better index could change a 5-minute query into a 30 second query.</p>

<p>But database optimization has become less important for typical applications. If you have a 1 GB database, an NVMe disk can slurp the whole thing into memory in under a second. As much as I love tuning SQL queries, it’s becoming a dying art for most application developers. Even poorly tuned queries can execute in under a second for ordinary databases.</p>

<p>Modern Postgres is a miracle. I’ve learned a ton by reading its code over the years. It includes a slew of features like a genetic query optimizer, row-level security policies, and a half dozen different types of indexes. If you need those features, you need them. But most of you probably don’t.</p>

<p>And if you don’t need the Postgres features, they’re a liability. For example, even if you don’t use multiple user accounts, you’ll still need to configure and debug host-based authentication. You have to firewall off your Postgres server. And more features mean more documentation, which makes it difficult to understand the software you’re running. The documentation for Postgres 14 is nearly <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/files/documentation/pdf/14/postgresql-14-US.pdf">3,000 pages</a>.</p>

<p>SQLite has a subset of the Postgres feature set. But that subset is 99.9% of what I typically need. Great SQL support, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html">windowing</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/lang_with.html">CTEs</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html">full-text search</a>, <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html">JSON</a>. And when it lacks a feature, the data is already next to my application. So there’s little overhead to pull it in and process it in my code.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the complicated problems I really need to solve aren’t really addressed by core database functions. Instead, I want to optimize for just two things: latency &amp; developer experience.</p>

<p>So one reason to take SQLite seriously is that it’s operationally much simpler. You spend your time writing application code, not designing intricate database tiers. But then there’s the other problem.</p>
<h2 id="the-light-is-too-damn-slow"><a href="#the-light-is-too-damn-slow" aria-label="Anchor"></a>The light is too damn slow</h2>
<p>We’re beginning to hit theoretical limits. In a vacuum, light travels about 186 miles in 1 millisecond. That’s the distance from Philadelphia to New York City and back. Add in layers of network switches, firewalls, and application protocols and the latency increases further.</p>

<p>The per-query latency overhead for a Postgres query within a single AWS region can be up to a millisecond. That’s not Postgres being slow—it’s you hitting the limits of how fast data can travel. Now, handle an HTTP request in a modern application. A dozen database queries and you’ve burned over 10ms before business logic or rendering.</p>

<p>There’s a magic number for application latency: <strong>responses in 100ms or less feel instantaneous</strong>. Snappy applications make happy users. 100ms seems like a lot, but it’s easy to carelessly chew it up. The 100ms threshold is so important that people  <a href="https://jamstack.org/">pre-render their pages and post them on CDNs</a> just to reduce latency.</p>

<p>We’d rather just move our data close to our application.  How much closer? Really close.</p>

<p>SQLite isn’t just on the same machine as your application, but actually built into your application process. When you put your data right next to your application, you can see per-query latency drop to 10-20 microseconds. That’s micro, with a μ. A 50-100x improvement over an intra-region Postgres query.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more. We’ve effectively eliminated per-query latency. Our application is fast, but it’s also simpler. We can break up larger queries into many smaller, more manageable queries, and spend the time we’ve been using to hunt down corner-casey N+1 patterns building new features.</p>

<p>Minimizing latency isn’t just for production either. Running integration tests with a traditional client/server database easily grows to take minutes locally and the pain continues once you push to CI. Reducing the feedback loop from code change to test completion doesn’t just save time but also preserves our focus while developing. A one-line change to SQLite will let you run it in-memory so you can run integration tests in seconds or less.</p>
<h2 id="small-fast-reliable-globally-distributed-choose-any-four"><a href="#small-fast-reliable-globally-distributed-choose-any-four" aria-label="Anchor"></a>Small, Fast, Reliable, Globally Distributed: Choose Any Four</h2>
<p>Litestream is distributed and replicated and, most importantly, still easy to get your head around. Seriously, <a href="https://litestream.io/getting-started/">go try it</a>. There’s just not much to know.</p>

<p>My claim is this: by building reliable, easy-to-use replication for SQLite, we make it attractive for all kinds of full-stack applications to run entirely on SQLite. It was reasonable to overlook this option 170 years ago, when <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">the Rails Blog Tutorial</a> was first written. But SQLite today can keep up with the write load of most applications, and replicas can scale reads out to as many instances as you choose to load-balance across.</p>

<p>Litestream has limitations. I built it for single-node applications, so it won’t work well on ephemeral, serverless platforms or when using rolling deployments. It needs to restore all changes sequentially which can make database restores take minutes to complete. We’re <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/issues/8">rolling out live replication</a>, but the separate-process model restricts us to course-grained control over replication guarantees.</p>

<p>We can do better. For the past year, what I’ve been doing is nailing down the core of Litestream and keeping a focus on correctness. I’m happy with where we’ve landed. It started as a simple, streaming back up tool but it’s slowly evolving into a reliable, distributed database. Now it’s time to make it faster and more seamless, which is my whole job at Fly.io. There are improvements coming to Litestream — improvements that aren’t at all tied to Fly.io! — that I’m psyched to share.</p>

<p>Litestream has a new home at Fly.io, but it is and always will be an open-source project. My plan for the next several years is to keep making it more useful, no matter where your application runs, and see just how far we can take the SQLite model of how databases can work.</p>

    <h2>The Momentousness Ratings</h2>

    <p>Every six months, there is a new Java release. Ever so often (currently, every two years), Oracle labels a release as “long term support”, and Java users wonder whether they should upgrade. In theory, <a href="https://foojay.io/almanac/jdk-21/">other JDK distributors</a> could offer “long term support” for other releases, but it seems everyone is following Oracle's lead.</p>
    <p>Should you upgrade?</p>
    <p>Here are the major features of Java 21. I omit preview and incubator features (which you are surely not going to use in production), JVM internals, highly specialized features such as <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/452">this one</a>, and deprecations.</p>

    <p>Let's look at these features in more detail.</p>

    <h2>Virtual Threads</h2>
    <p><a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2023-06-27/index.html">Virtual threads</a> are a big deal. Similar to generics, lambda expressions, and modules, they solve a major problem for which the language has otherwise no good alternative. If you have the problem that they are designed to solve, you will have a powerful motivation to upgrade.</p>
    <p>Here is the problem. If you write applications that process many more concurrent requests than available platform threads, you currently have two unappealing choices:</p>
    <ul><li>Use a synchronous programming style and accept that throughput is limited by the number of platform threads</li>
      <li>Use an asynchronous or “reactive” programming style</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What is wrong with an asynchronous programming style? You have to structure your program as chunks of callbacks. You need library support for sequencing, branches, loops, and exception handling, instead of using the features that are built into Java. Debugging is more challenging since the debugger cannot show you a complete execution history when it stops at a breakpoint. Not convinced? Make one of your junior programmers read through the documentation of <a href="https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference">Project Reactor</a> and then assign a simple task, such as loading a web page and then loading all images in it. </p>
    <p>Of course, virtual threads are not appropriate for all concurrent programming. They only work for tasks that spend most of their time waiting for network I/O. This is the situation in many business applications where much of the request processing consists of calls to the database and external services.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, there is <a href="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2023-06-27/index.html">very little to learn</a> in order to use virtual threads. You just use them like regular threads. In most scenarios, you simply configure your application framework to invoke your business logic on virtual threads, and watch throughput increase.</p>
    <p>One idiom is worth learning. To run multiple tasks in parallel, use a <em>local</em> instance of <code>ExecutorService</code>:</p>
    <pre>try (var service = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
   Future&lt;T1&gt; f1 = service.submit(callable1);
   Future&lt;T2&gt; f2 = service.submit(callable2);
   result = combine(f1.get(), f2.get());
}
</pre>
    <p>Obtaining the result with <code>get</code> is a blocking call, but so what, blocking is cheap with virtual threads.</p>
    <p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/453">Structured Concurrency</a>, a preview feature in Java 21, simplifies error handling and makes it easier to harvest the results of multiple concurrent requests.</p>
    <p>There are a few caveats:</p>
    <ul><li>In the past, a thread pool didn't just throttle the incoming requests but also the concurrent resources that your app consumed. If you now accept many more incoming requests, you may need other ways to manage resource consumption.</li>
      <li>One resource that deserves particular attention is thread locals. With many more threads than before, do you really want many more thread locals? Or are there more appropriate mechanisms to achieve whatever you wanted to achieve with thread locals? Your framework provider needs to think this through, and if you actively use thread locals, so should you. A <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/446">lighter-weight alternative</a> is in preview.</li>
      <li>Virtual threads do not yet work well with blocking calls inside <code>synchronized</code> methods or blocks. The remedy is to rewrite the offending code with <code>java.util.concurrent</code> locks. Be sure that the providers of your framework, database driver, and so on, update their code to work well with virtual threads. Quite a few already did.</li>
    </ul>
 

    <h2>Pattern Matching</h2>
    <p>Many functional languages have some form of pattern matching that makes it convenient to work with “algebraic data types”, which in Java are implemented with sealed hierarchies and record classes.</p>
    <p>Java has chosen to extend the syntax for <code>instanceof</code> and <code>switch</code> for pattern matching, in order to leverage existing programmer knowledge. These extensions have been in preview until Java 20 and are now in their final form.</p>
    <p>Are you using sealed hierarchies and records in your code base? Then pattern matching is appealing. Here is an example, a simple JSON hierarchy:</p>
    <pre>sealed interface JSONValue permits JSONArray, JSONObject, JSONPrimitive {}

final class JSONArray extends ArrayList&lt;JSONValue&gt; implements JSONValue {}

final class JSONObject extends HashMap&lt;String, JSONValue&gt; implements JSONValue {}

sealed interface JSONPrimitive extends JSONValue
   permits JSONNumber, JSONString, JSONBoolean, JSONNull {}

final record JSONNumber(double value) implements JSONPrimitive {}

final record JSONString(String value) implements JSONPrimitive {}

enum JSONBoolean implements JSONPrimitive {
   FALSE, TRUE;
}

enum JSONNull implements JSONPrimitive {
   INSTANCE;
}

</pre>
    <p><img src="https://horstmann.com/unblog/2023-09-19/json.png" alt=".png" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>Now you can process JSON values like this:</p>

<pre>JSONPrimitive p = . . .;
double value = switch (p) {
   case JSONString(var v) when v.matches("-?(0|[1-9]\\d*)(\\.\\d+)?([eE][+-]?\\d+)?") -&gt;
      Double.parseDouble(v);
   case JSONString __ -&gt; Double.NaN;
   case JSONNumber(var v) -&gt; v;
   case JSONBoolean.TRUE -&gt; 1;
   case JSONBoolean.FALSE, JSONNull.INSTANCE -&gt; 0;
}
</pre>
    <p>Note the following:</p>
    <ul><li>This is a <code>switch</code> expression that yields a value</li>
      <li>The compiler checks that the <code>switch</code> is exhaustive</li>
      <li>The pattern <code>JSONString(var v)</code> binds the variable <code>v</code> to the component of the record</li>
      <li>The <code>when</code> clause restricts a match to a Boolean condition</li>
      <li>With <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/445">JEP 445</a>, you will be able to use <code>case JSONString _</code>, with a single underscore, to indicate that you do not need the variable binding. But that is still a preview feature.</li>
      <li>Since Java 14, you can have multiple constants in a single <code>case</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>All this is certainly nicer than the <code>instanceof</code> and casting that one might do right now with Jackson. But you might want to hold off switching to a new JSON hierarchy until Java gives us <a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/8277163">value classes</a>.</p>
    <p>In general, pattern matching is more useful in contexts that are designed for pattern matching. Today's use cases are perhaps not all that compelling, but it is an investment in the future.</p>
    <h2>Sequenced Collections</h2>
    <p>When you have a <code>Collection</code>, how do you get the first element? With a <code>List</code>, it's <code>list.get(0)</code>, but in general, you'd call <code>collection.iterator().next()</code>. Except with a stack or queue it is <code>peek</code>, with a deque <code>getFirst</code>, and the <code>SortedSet</code> interface has <code>first</code>. And what about the last element?</p>
    <p>And how do you visit the elements in reverse order? <code>Deque</code> and <code>NavigableSet</code> have a handy <code>descendingIterator</code>. For lists, you iterate backwards, starting from the last element.</p>
    <p><a href="https://openjdk.org/jeps/431">JEP 431</a> cleans up this situation with a <code>SequencedCollection</code> interface. It has these methods:</p>
    <pre>E getFirst();
E getLast();
void addFirst(E);
void addLast(E);
E removeFirst();
E removeLast();
SequencedCollection&lt;E&gt; reversed();
</pre>
    <p>The first six methods are the same as in the <code>Deque</code> interface, which is now a subinterface.</p>
    <p>There is also a <code>SequencedSet</code>, where <code>reversed</code> yiels a set, and a <code>SequencedMap</code>, with methods to get and put the first and last entry, and with sequenced views for the keys, values, and entries.</p>
    <p>This figure, by Stuart Marks, shows the change in the collections hierarchy.</p>
    <p><img src="https://cr.openjdk.org/~smarks/collections/SequencedCollectionDiagram20220216.png" alt=".png" loading="lazy"></p>
    <p>TL;DR Reverse iteration over a list, deque, tree set, or tree map is now more uniform. Getting the first and laste element too. That's nice. Obviously not momentous.</p>

    <h2>Should You Upgrade?</h2>
    <p>When Java 17 was released, I opined that none of its features were momentous enough to warrant upgrading, and one was downright ugly. Still, upgrading was a no-brainer: tens of thousands of bug fixes. </p>
    <p>Of course you should upgrade again to Java 21. Because, lots of bug fixes.</p>
    <p>And this time there is a truly momentous feature: virtual threads. If you are contemplating the use of reactive programming, or you are already unhappily doing so, you definitely want to check them out.</p>

    <h2>Also Nice</h2>
    <p>Oracle now has an <a href="https://dev.java/playground/">online “playground”</a> for testing Java snippets. Check it out!</p>

Since then many workers have returned to the office—but around 20 percent have <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/were-fumbling-the-return-to-physical-offices/">continued to work from home</a> at least part-time.</p>

<p>The benefits of remote work have become a hotly debated topic. Proponents argue that working from home is better for both workers’ health and the planet. And intuitively, it makes sense that cutting out a daily office commute would save a substantial amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet there have been few in-depth studies into how sustainable remote work actually is.</p>

<p>A new analysis examines the sustainability question and provides a comprehensive insight into the climate mitigation potential of remote work in the U.S. By looking at five factors, including commuting, noncommute travel, information technology devices, office energy efficiency and residential energy use, researchers were able to calculate how much carbon the average American office employee saves by working from home. The team found that remote work has the potential to reduce an individual’s carbon emissions by more than half—but only if they take the necessary measures at home. The <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2304099120">results were published</a> on September 18 in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA</em>.</p>

<p>Calculating the carbon cost of remote versus in-office work was a challenge. “This problem is fairly complicated,” says Fengqi You, a systems engineer at Cornell University and co-author of the paper. “The systems involved are complex.”</p>

<p>You and his team were able to obtain a massive anonymized dataset from Microsoft that gave them an unprecedented window into remote workers’ day-to-day energy use and lifestyle. By comparing these data with recorded greenhouse gas emissions from in-person office work, they calculated the actual carbon reduction potential of working from home. Some of the results, You says, were “surprising.”</p>

<p>For example, many previous analyses of remote work assumed that cutting out an office commute meant that workers wouldn’t drive during the day. But You and his team found that this isn’t the case. In fact, remote workers often drive more often than their in-office counterparts by taking several short car trips throughout the day.</p>

<p>The researchers also found that working from home can prompt people to use more energy over the course of a workday on things such as air-conditioning and a dishwasher. And remote workers are more likely to move out of big, centralized cities, where lifestyles are generally less carbon-intensive than in suburban or rural areas.</p>

<p>All of these observations have big policy implications. Recently some politicians have championed working from home as a major climate solution and have credited it with a 95 percent reduction in emissions. Unfortunately, “that’s not true,” You says.</p>

<p>Brian Caulfield, a civil and structural engineer at Trinity College Dublin, agrees. “It doesn’t stand up to scrutiny,” says Caulfield, who was not involved in the study.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that working from home cannot lower emissions substantially, however. Biking to a nearby coffee shop with your laptop, for example, is an extremely carbon-efficient way to work. The study found that people who work remotely four or more days a week can reduce their carbon footprint by up to 54 percent, and those who do so up to four days a week can reduce it by up to 29. But these reductions only hold if workers implement strategies such as turning off unnecessary lights and appliances, driving an electric vehicle or sourcing their home electricity from solar panels or wind turbines.</p>

<p>“It’s not all about how many days you work from home,” says Yanqiu Tao, a sustainability engineer at Cornell and first author of the paper. “It’s about how well you live sustainably.”</p>

<p>The study’s authors also point out that office buildings can be made greener. If older buildings were revamped with more energy-efficient appliances and put on a decarbonized grid, then in-office work could match the greenhouse gas emissions of working from home. Taking public transit can also contribute significantly to reducing an individual’s carbon footprint, even if they are working from an office.</p>

<p>Although the paper’s results were specific to the U.S., Caulfield believes that the same basic principles should hold for other industrialized countries. “The kind of patterns we see across the world are very similar,” he says, including in his home city of Dublin.</p>

<p>The biggest takeaway, the authors say, is that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-changed-the-world-of-work-forever/">remote work is here to stay</a>, and it can absolutely be part of a greener, more sustainable future—but it shouldn’t be seen as a panacea.</p>

<p>“The pandemic has really motivated us to think about [remote work] in a broader and more complex way, as a society,” You says. “So we really need to understand what we are putting into practice.”</p></div><section><h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)</h3><div><ul></ul><p><strong>Joanna Thompson</strong> is an insect enthusiast and former <em>Scientific American</em> intern.

<p>I <em>love</em> GitHub Actions: I’ve been a daily user of it since 2019 for both professional
and hobbyist projects, and have found it invaluable to both my overall productivity
and peace of mind. I’m <em>just</em> old enough to have used <a href="https://www.travis-ci.com/">Travis CI</a>
et al. professionally before moving to GitHub Actions, and I do not look back with joy<sup id="fnref:back" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:back" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>By and large, GitHub Actions continues to delight me and grow new features that I
appreciate: <a href="https://github.blog/2021-11-29-github-actions-reusable-workflows-is-generally-available/">reusable workflows</a>, <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-github-actions-secure-cloud-deployments-with-openid-connect/">OpenID connect</a>, <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-09-github-actions-enhance-your-actions-with-job-summaries/">job summaries</a>, <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-05-09-introducing-actions-on-the-repository-view-on-github-mobile/">integrations into GitHub Mobile</a>,
and so forth.</p>

<p>At the same time, GitHub Actions is a regular source of <em>profound</em> frustration and time loss<sup id="fnref:loss" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:loss" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
in my development processes. This post lists some of those frustrations, and how I think GitHub
could selfishly<sup id="fnref:selfishly" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:selfishly" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> improve on them (or even fix them outright)<sup id="fnref:roadmap" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:roadmap" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="debugging-like-im-15-again">Debugging like I’m 15 again</h2>

<p>Here’s a pretty typical session of me trying to set up a release workflow on GitHub Actions:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/github-actions-fails.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In this particular case, it took me 4 separate commits (and 4 failed releases) to debug
the various small errors I made: not using <code>${{ ... }}</code><sup id="fnref:jekyll" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:jekyll" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> where I needed to, forgetting
a <code>needs:</code> relationship, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Here’s another (this time of a PR-creating workflow), from a few weeks later:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/github-actions-fails-2.png" alt=""></p>

<p>I am not the world’s most incredible programmer; like many (most?), I program intuitively
and follow the error messages until they stop happening.</p>

<p>GitHub Actions is <strong>not</strong> responsible for catching every possible error I could make,
and ensuring that every workflow I write will run successfully on the first try.</p>

<p>At the same time, the current debugging cycle in GitHub Actions is <em>ridiculous</em>:
even the smallest change on the most trivial workflow is a 30+ second process
of tabbing out of my development environment (context switch #1), digging through
my browser for the right tab (context switch #2), clicking through the infernal
nest of actions summaries, statuses, &amp;c. (context switch #3), and impatiently
refreshing a buffered console log to figure out which error I need to fix next
(context switch #4). Rinse and repeat.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-this">Fixing this</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give us an interactive debugging shell, or (at least) let us re-run workflows
with small changes <em>without</em> having to go through a <code>git add; git commit; git push</code> cycle<sup id="fnref:breaks" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:breaks" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give us a repository setting to reject commits with obviously invalid workflows (things
like syntax that can’t possibly work, or references to jobs/steps that don’t exist).
It’s <em>infuriating</em> when I <code>git push</code> a workflow that silently fails because of invalid YAML;
<em>especially</em> when I then merge that workflow’s branch under the mistaken impression
that the workflow is <em>passing</em>, rather than not running at all.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security-woes">Security woes</h2>

<p>Speaking from experience: it’s <em>shockingly</em> easy to wreck yourself with GitHub Actions. <em>Way</em> easier
than it should be.</p>

<p>Here is just a small handful of the ways in which I have <em>personally</em> written potentially vulnerable
workflows over the past few years:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Using the <code>${{ ... }}</code> expansion syntax in a shell or other context where a
(potentially malicious) user controls the expansion’s contents. The following, for example, would
allow a user to inject code that could then exfiltrate <code>$MY_IMPORTANT_SECRET</code>:</p>

    <div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

    <p>Some among you will observe that a ✨good✨ programmer would simply know
not to do this, and that a bad programmer would eventually learn their
(painful) lesson. This might be an acceptable position for a niche
piece of software to hold; it is <strong>not</strong> an acceptable position
for the CI/CD platform that, to a first approximation, hosts the entire
open source ecosystem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using <code>pull_request_target</code>. As far as I can tell, it’s <em>practically</em>
impossible to use this event safely in a non-trivial workflow<sup id="fnref:trivial" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:trivial" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>This event appears to exist for an <em>extremely</em> narrow intended use case, i.e.
labeling or commenting on PRs that come from forks. I don’t understand
why GitHub Actions chooses to expose such a (relatively) simple operation
through as massive of a foot-gun as <code>pull_request_target</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over-scoping my workflow and job-level permissions.</p>

    <p>The default access set for Actions’ ordinary <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> is
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#permissions-for-the-github_token"><em>very</em> permissive</a>:
the only thing it <em>doesn’t</em> provide access to are the workflow’s OpenID Connect token.</p>

    <p>This consistently bites me in two different ways:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>I consistently forget to down-scope the default token, especially when
working with repositories under my personal account (rather than under an org,
where the default scope can be reduced across all repositories).</li>
      <li>
        <p>I consistently <em>over-scope</em> my tokens because I don’t know exactly
how much access my workflow will need.</p>

        <p>This is further complicated by the messy ways in which GitHub’s permission
model gets shoehorned into a single permissions dimension of <code>read/write/none</code>:
why does <code>id-token: write</code> grant me the ability to <strong>read</strong> the workflow’s OpenID Connect
token? Why do
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/permissions-required-for-github-apps?apiVersion=2022-11-28#repository-permissions-for-repository-security-advisories">some <code>GET</code> operations</a>
on security advisories require <code>write</code>, while others only require <code>read</code>?</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>There are also a few things that I <em>haven’t</em> done<sup id="fnref:donetome" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:donetome" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>, but are scary enough that I think they’re worth
mentioning.</p>

<p>For example, can you see what’s wrong with this workflow step?</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre><span>steps</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>actions/checkout@c7d749a2d57b4b375d1ebcd17cfbfb60c676f18e</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>Despite all appearances, SHA ref
<a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout/commit/c7d749a2d57b4b375d1ebcd17cfbfb60c676f18e"><code>c7d749a2d57b4b375d1ebcd17cfbfb60c676f18e</code></a>
is <strong>not</strong> a commit on the <code>actions/checkout</code> repository! It’s actually a commit on a fork in
<code>actions/checkout</code>’s network which, thanks to GitHub’s use of
<a href="https://github.blog/2015-09-22-counting-objects/#your-very-own-fork-of-rails">alternates</a>,
<em>appears</em> to belong to the parent repository.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.chainguard.dev/unchained/what-the-fork-imposter-commits-in-github-actions-and-ci-cd">Chainguard has an excellent post on this</a><sup id="fnref:stole" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:stole" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>,
but to summarize:</p>

<ol>
  <li>SHA references from forks are visually indistinguishable from SHA references
in the intended target repository. The only way to tell the two apart is
to manually inspect each reference and confirm that it appears on the expected
repository, and not one of its forks.</li>
  <li>GitHub’s own REST API makes no distinction between SHA references in a repository
graph — <code>/repos/{user}/{repo}/commits/{ref}</code> returns a JSON response that <em>only</em> references
<code>{user}/{repo}</code>, even if <code>{ref}</code> is only on a fork.</li>
  <li>Because GitHub fails to distinguish between fork and non-fork SHA references, forks
can bypass security settings on GitHub Actions that would otherwise restrict
actions to only “trusted” sources (such as GitHub themselves or the repository’s
own organization).</li>
</ol>

<p>GitHub’s response to this (so far) has been to add
<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas">a little bit of additional language</a>
to their documentation, rather than to forbid misleading SHA references outright.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-this-1">Fixing this</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give us push-time rejection of obviously insecure workflows. In other words:
let us toggle<sup id="fnref:default" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:default" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> a “paranoid workflow security” mode that, when enabled,
causes <code>git push</code> to fail with an explanation of what I’m doing wrong. Essentially
the same thing as the debugging request above, but for security!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give us runtime checks on our workflows, analogous to runtime instrumentation like
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html">AddressSanitizer</a>
in the world of compiled languages. There are <em>so many</em> things that could
be turned into hard failures for security wins without breaking 99.9% of legitimate
users, like failing any attempt to use <code>actions/checkout</code> on a <code>pull_request_target</code>
with a ref that isn’t from the targeted repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe just deprecate and remove <code>pull_request_target</code> entirely.
<a href="https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/">GitHub’s own Security Lab</a>
has been aware of how dangerous this event is for years; maybe it’s time to get rid of it
entirely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Allow us to set a more restrictive default token scope on our personal repositories,
similar to how organizations and enterprises can restrict their default
<code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> scopes across all repositories at once.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>By default, reject any SHA-pinned action for which the SHA only appears
on a fork and not the referenced repository. It’s hard to imagine a
<em>legitimate</em> reason to ever need to do this!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="real-types-would-be-nice">Real types would be nice</h2>

<p>When writing a custom GitHub Action, you can specify the actions inputs
using a mapping under the <code>inputs:</code> key. For example, the following
defines a <code>frobulation-level</code> input with a description (used for tooltips
in many IDEs) and a default value:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre><span>inputs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>frobulation-level</span><span>:</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>level</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>frobulate</span><span> </span><span>at"</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>1"</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>Notably, this syntax does <strong>not</strong> allow for type enforcement; the following
<strong>does not work</strong>:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>inputs</span><span>:</span>
  <span>frobulation-level</span><span>:</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>"</span><span>the</span><span> </span><span>level</span><span> </span><span>to</span><span> </span><span>frobulate</span><span> </span><span>to"</span>
    <span>default</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span>
    <span># NOTE: this SHOULD cause a workflow failure if the input</span>
    <span># isn't a valid number, but doesn't</span>
    <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>number</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>This absence is strange, but what makes it <em>bizarre</em> is that GitHub is <strong>inconsistent</strong>
about where types can appear in actions and workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>workflow_call</code> supports <code>type</code> with <code>boolean</code>, <code>number</code>, or <code>string</code></li>
  <li><code>workflow_dispatch</code> supports <code>type</code> with <code>boolean</code>, <code>choice</code>, <code>number</code>, or <code>string</code></li>
  <li>Action inputs: no types at all</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this is only the first level: even inputs that <em>do</em> support
typing doesn’t support compounded data structures, like lists or objects.
For example, neither of the following works:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
</pre></td><td><pre><span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>example/example</span>
  <span>with</span><span>:</span>
    <span># INVALID: can't use arrays as inputs</span>
    <span>paths</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>foo</span><span>,</span> <span>bar</span><span>,</span> <span>baz</span><span>]</span>
    <span># INVALID: can't use objects as inputs</span>
    <span>headers</span><span>:</span>
      <span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>bar</span>
      <span>baz</span><span>:</span> <span>quux</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>…which means that action writers end up requiring users to do silly things like these:</p>

<div><pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td><pre><span>-</span> <span>uses</span><span>:</span> <span>example/example</span>
  <span>with</span><span>:</span>
    <span># SILLY: action does ad-hoc CSV-ish parsing</span>
    <span>paths</span><span>:</span> <span>foo,bar,baz</span>
    <span># SILLY: action forcefully flattens a natural hierarchy</span>
    <span>header-foo</span><span>:</span> <span>bar</span>
    <span>header-baz</span><span>:</span> <span>quux</span>
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div>

<p>This is bad for maintainability, and bad for security: maintainability
because actions must carefully manage a single flat namespace of inputs
(with no types!), and security because both action writer and workflow writer
are forced into <a href="https://langsec.org/occupy/">ad-hoc, unspecified languages</a>
for complex inputs.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-this-2">Fixing this</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let action and workflow writers use <code>type:</code> everywhere, and let
us use <code>choice</code> everywhere — not just in <code>workflow_dispatch</code>!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give us stricter type-checking. Where action and workflow types
can be inferred statically, detect errors and reject incorrectly typed
workflow changes at <code>push</code> time, rather than waiting for the workflow
to inevitably fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give us <code>type: object</code> and <code>type: array</code> types. These won’t be perfect
to start with (thanks to potentially heterogeneous interior types),
but they’ll be a significant improvement over the status quo. Implementation-wise,
forward these as JSON-serialized strings or something similar<sup id="fnref:json" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:json" rel="footnote">11</a></sup> where
appropriate (such as in auto-created <code>INPUT_{WHATEVER}</code> environment variables).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="more-official-actions-would-be-nice">(More) official actions would be nice</h2>

<p>The third-party ecosystem on GitHub Actions is great: there are a <em>lot</em>
of high-quality, easy-to-use actions being maintained by open source contributors.
I maintain a <a href="https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pip-audit">handful</a>
<a href="https://github.com/sigstore/gh-action-sigstore-python">of them</a>!</p>

<p>Beneath the surface of these excellent third-party actions is a substrate
of <em>official</em>, GitHub-maintained actions. These actions primarily address
three classes of fundamental CI/CD activities:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Core <code>git</code> operations: <code>actions/checkout</code></li>
  <li>Core GitHub operations and repository housekeeping: <code>actions/{upload,download}-artifact</code>,
<code>actions/cache</code>, <code>actions/stale</code></li>
  <li>General (but essential) configuration: <code>actions/setup-python</code>, <code>actions/setup-node</code></li>
</ol>

<p>These classes are somewhat distinct from “higher-level” workflows (like the kind
I write): because of their centrality and universal demand, they benefit from
singular, high-quality, <em>officially maintained</em> implementations.</p>

<p>And so, the question: <strong><em>why are there so few of them</em></strong>?</p>

<p>Here is just a smattering of the official actions that <em>don’t</em> exist:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Programmatically adding a pull request to a merge queue</em>. GitHub <em>has</em> the machinery to
support this: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request-with-a-merge-queue?tool=cli"><code>gh pr merge</code> already exists</a>.
It just isn’t exposed as an action; users are (presumably) expected
to piece it together themselves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Even worse, there are actions that <em>did</em> exist but were deprecated (generally
for unclear reasons<sup id="fnref:time" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:time" rel="footnote">12</a></sup>):</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release"><code>actions/create-release</code></a>:
<a href="https://github.com/actions/create-release/issues/119">unmaintained as of March 2021</a>. Users
encouraged to switch to various community maintained workflows, most notably<sup id="fnref:notably" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notably" rel="footnote">13</a></sup>
<a href="https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release"><code>softprops/action-gh-release</code></a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/actions/upload-release-asset"><code>actions/upload-release-asset</code></a>: marked
as unmaintained at the same time as <code>actions/create-release</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby"><code>actions/setup-ruby</code></a>:
<a href="https://github.com/actions/setup-ruby/issues/97">unmaintained as of February 2021</a>. Users
encouraged to switch to <a href="https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby"><code>ruby/setup-ruby</code></a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I’m sympathetic to the individual maintainers here and, in each case, the transition
to a “recommended” third-party action was relatively painless.</p>

<p>Still, the overall impression given here is unmistakable: that GitHub does not see <em>official</em>
actions for its own platform features (or key ecosystem users, like Ruby) as priorities,
and would rather have the community develop and choose unofficial favorites. This is
<strong>not unreasonable</strong> on a strategic level (it induces third-party development
in their ecosystem), but has a <em>deleterious effect</em> on trust in the platform. I’d like
to be able to write workflows and know that they’ll run (with minimal changes) 5 years from
now, and not worry that GitHub has abandoned core pieces underneath me!</p>

<p>Apart from imparting a general feeling of shabbiness, this compounds with GitHub Action’s
poor security story (<a href="#some-security-would-be-nice">per above</a>): not providing official high-quality actions for their own
API surfaces means that users will <em>continue</em> to make exploitable security mistakes in
their workflows. Nobody wins<sup id="fnref:pentesting" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pentesting" rel="footnote">14</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="fixing-this-3">Fixing this</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Give us more official actions. As a <em>very</em> rough rule of thumb: if a thing
directly ties different pieces of GitHub infrastructure together <em>and</em> currently
needs to be done manually (with REST API calls, <code>gh</code> invocations, or whatever else),
it probably deserves a full official action!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Give us more <em>pseudo-official</em> actions. Work with the biggest third-party actions<sup id="fnref:biggest" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:biggest" rel="footnote">15</a></sup>
to form a <code>community-actions</code> (or whatever) org, with the expectation that actions homed under
that org have been reviewed (at some point) by GitHub, are forced to adhere to best practices
for repository security, receive semantically versioned updates, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>

<p>This is a long and meandering post, and many parts are in conflict: security and stability
(in the form of more official actions that break less often), for example, are in eternal
conflict with each other.</p>

<p>I’m just one user, and I don’t expect my interests or frustrations to be overriding ones.
Still, I hope that the problems (and potential fixes) above aren’t unique to me, and that there are
engineers at GitHub who (again, selfishly!) share these concerns and would like to see
them fixed.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Valve-Upstream-Everything-OSS">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Valve-Upstream-Everything-OSS</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37612127">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="VALVE" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/valve.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
This shouldn't come as any surprise to any longtime Phoronix readers and dedicated open-source/Linux enthusiasts, but Valve with their work on the Steam Deck and SteamOS have been lifting the open-source ecosystem as a whole. A talk this week at the Linux Foundation Europe's Open-Source Summit highlighted some of the great and ongoing contributions by Valve and their partners.
</p><p>
Alberto Garcia of the open-source consulting firm Igalia, which continues to collaborate with Valve on some of these Linux ecosystem improvements, talked at length around how SteamOS is contributing to the Linux ecosystem.
</p><p>
SteamOS is built atop Arch Linux with a GNU user-space and systemd, the desktop mode features KDE Plasma to which Valve has funded some improvements there, Valve's Steam Play / Proton that leverages Wine has been immensely valuable to Linux gamers and enthusiasts along with related open-source projects like DXVK / VKD3D-Proton, and then there's also they work they are doing around AMD color management / HDR. Igalia engineers have been involved with Valve on the AMD color management work as well as other areas like enabling new Linux kernel features for enabling better Steam Play support. 
</p><p>
The elephant in the room meanwhile is the countless improvements Valve engineers have made to the the Mesa OpenGL and Vulkan drivers as well as to the kernel graphics driver components. Not just to the AMD graphics drivers for benefiting the Steam Deck's hardware but also to Zink OpenGL-on-Vulkan and then other common infrastructure. But in this area of the Linux graphics driver support, Valve's contributions and those of their partners have been incredibly beneficial to the Linux desktop ecosystem even outside gaming.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=steamos-35-benchmarks&amp;image=steamos_35_4_med" alt="Steam Deck"></p>
<p>There has also been other efforts Valve has been involved in such on expanding case insensitive file-system support on Linux, various other kernel features, their Gamescope Wayland compositor, immutable software updates, and Flatpak. Igalia says it's part of Valve's policy to "upstream everything" they are working on.
</p><p>
So for those questioning Valve's contributions to the Linux and open-source ecosystems or for helping to convince any friends/colleagues about Valve's open-source software work, check out Alberto Garcia's <a href="https://osseu2023.sched.com/event/1Qv8y/how-steamos-is-contributing-to-the-linux-ecosystem-alberto-garcia-igalia?iframe=no&amp;w=100%&amp;sidebar=yes&amp;bg=no">OSS EU 2023 presentation</a> for the more comprehensive look at all of the great Valve / SteamOS upstream contributions.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                  <p><span>Honestly, this is the wrong question, but I understand the intent. What you really should be asking is "Where is the online community for your hobby/interest?"<p>The thing with HN, is it works for the startup/hacker/tech community, and that community has evolved here over time. If you want a link/topic sharing site for other interests, the answer is almost always going to be a subreddit.</p><p>But if what you really want is to be immersed in a community, those communities will be in weird corners that you have to discover. The reason for this is that a community almost always wants to be semi-private: discoverable by others that share the same interest, but just far enough out of the public eye to not get bombarded with bots/trolls/obnoxious people</p><p>Some examples I know of:</p><pre><code>  - Voron (3d printer)? You want to be on their discord
  - BigGreenEgg (kamado smoker)? eggheadforum.com
  - MMA? sherdog
  - Electronics/Robotics diy style hacky projects? hackaday and go to the comment secion
</code></pre>
The cool part about finding these true pockets of a community, is you can learn a ton about what truly makes them tick. What do they get excited about, what do they have an irrational hatred for, etc. If you've ever asked yourself "how do I market my app/website/saas", it's almost certainly because you haven't yet encountered where that niche community resides, and are falling back to more generic strategies. Find the community, and they'll tell you what they want in spades</span></p></div></td></tr>

    Exposing a service to your tailnet (cluster ingress)
    
  </a>
</h3>

<p>You can use the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to expose a Kubernetes service to your Tailscale network in three ways: by making it a <code>LoadBalancer</code> type with the <code>tailscale</code> <code>loadBalancerClass</code>, by annotating an existing service, or by creating an ingress resource fronting a service.</p>
<h4 id="exposing-a-service-using-loadbalancerclass">
  <a href="#exposing-a-service-using-loadbalancerclass">
    Exposing a service using <code>loadBalancerClass</code>
    
  </a>
</h4>

<p>Edit the service you want to expose and make it a load balancer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <code>spec.type</code> to <code>LoadBalancer</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>spec.loadBalancerClass</code> to <code>tailscale</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once provisioning is complete, the service’s status will show the
<a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/">fully-qualified domain name</a> of the service in your tailnet. You can view the
service’s status by running <code>kubectl get service &lt;service name&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>You should also see a new node with that name appear in the
<a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines"><strong>Machines</strong></a> page of the admin console.</p>
<h4 id="exposing-a-service-using-annotations">
  <a href="#exposing-a-service-using-annotations">
    Exposing a service using annotations
    
  </a>
</h4>

<p>If the service you want to expose already exists, you can
expose it to Tailscale using <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/annotations/">object annotations</a>.</p>
<p>Edit the service and under <code>metadata.annotations</code>, add the annotation
<code>tailscale.com/expose</code> with the value <code>"true"</code>. Note that <code>"true"</code> is quoted
because annotation values are strings, and an unquoted <code>true</code> will be
incorrectly interpreted as a boolean.</p>
<p>In this mode, Kubernetes doesn’t tell you the Tailscale machine name. You can look
up the node in the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines"><strong>Machines</strong></a> of the admin console to learn
its machine name. By default, the machine name of an exposed service is
<code>&lt;k8s-namespace&gt;-&lt;k8s-servicename&gt;</code>.</p>
<h5 id="using-a-custom-machine-name">
  <a href="#using-a-custom-machine-name">

  </a>
</h5>

<p>If you want the service to have a machine name other than the default
<code>&lt;k8s-namespace&gt;-&lt;k8s-servicename&gt;</code>, you can provide your own machine name by
setting the <code>tailscale.com/hostname</code> annotation on the service, with your
desired machine name as the value.</p>
<p>Machine names are subject to the constraints of DNS: they can be up to 63 characters
long, must start and end with a letter, and consist of only letters, numbers,
and <code>-</code>.</p>
<h5 id="customizing-acl-tags">
  <a href="#customizing-acl-tags">
    Customizing ACL tags
    
  </a>
</h5>

<p>By default, services join your tailnet tagged with the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1068/acl-tags/">ACL tag</a> <code>tag:k8s</code>. You can use a
different tag or tags by setting the <code>tailscale.com/tags</code> annotation on the
service, with a comma-separated list of the desired tags.</p>
<p>For example, setting <code>tailscale.com/tags = tag:foo,tag:bar</code> will result in the
tailnet node having the tags <code>tag:foo</code> and <code>tag:bar</code>.</p>
<p>The Tailscale operator must be a <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/#tag-owners">tag owner</a> of all the specified tags: if you want
to expose a service with <code>tag:foo,tag:bar</code>, the <code>tagOwners</code> section of the
<a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1018/acls/">tailnet policy file</a> must list <code>tag:k8s-operator</code> as one
of the owners of both <code>tag:foo</code> and <code>tag:bar</code>.</p>

  <a href="#exposing-a-service-using-ingress">
    Exposing a service using ingress

</h4>

<p>You can use the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to expose an ingress resource in your Kubernetes cluster to your tailnet.</p>
<p>Ingress resources only support TLS, and are only exposed over HTTPS. You must <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https/">enable HTTPS</a> on your tailnet.</p>
<p>Edit the ingress resource you want to expose to use the ingress class <code>tailscale</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set <code>spec.ingressClassName</code> to <code>tailscale</code>.</li>
<li>Set <code>tls.hosts</code> to the desired host name of the Tailscale node. Only the first label is used.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can use the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to expose and access the Kubernetes control plane (kube-apiserver) over Tailscale.</p>
<p>You can use the API server proxy with or without authentication headers. With authentication headers, when a user tries to access the Kubernetes control plane over Tailscale using an API server proxy, they will hit the kube-apiserver with the same user identity that they have in Tailscale. This is done by injecting an authentication header in the request. For example, <code>alice@example.com</code> will have the user <code>alice@example.com</code> in an API server proxy.</p>
<p>If you do not want to use Tailscale for authentication, but use an existing authentication mechanism instead, you can disable the use of authentication headers. This allows you to access the Kubernetes control plane over Tailscale, without using Tailscale for authentication.</p>

    Enabling tagged nodes to authenticate using the API server proxy
    
  </a>
</h5>

<p>The API server proxy allows users to use their Tailscale identities to authenticate to the Kubernetes control plane.</p>
<p>Tagged nodes authenticate as the node name instead of the user who created the node.</p>

<p>To enable tagged nodes to authenticate to the Kubernetes control plane, create a Kubernetes RoleBinding for a group, and give the group cluster access.</p>
<p>For example, create a RoleBinding for the group <code>tag:ci</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>subjects</span><span>:</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>- <span>kind</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Group</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"tag:ci"</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>  </span><span>apiGroup</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>rbac.authorization.k8s.io</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, grant the group <code>tag:ci</code> a <code>ClusterRole</code> using a Kubernetes ClusterRoleBinding:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="sh"><span><span>kubectl create clusterrolebinding --clusterrole cluster-admin --group <span>"tag:ci"</span> tag-ci
</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>To use the API server proxy without authentication headers, in the <code>env</code> section of your Kubernetes operator.yml file, set the value <code>"noauth"</code> for the <code>APISERVER_PROXY</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>   </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>APISERVER_PROXY</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span>   </span><span>value</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"noauth"</span><span> </span><span># instead of true</span><span>

</h3>

<p>You can use the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to advertise a service external to your cluster which is on your Tailscale network.</p>
<p>This is done by deploying a proxy in the cluster, setting the service’s <code>spec.externalName</code> to point to the proxy, and setting iptables rules for the proxy to direct incoming traffic to the DNS entry for the tailnet service. When a cluster workload attempts to reach the service, it is first directed to the proxy, which then redirects the traffic to the external service.</p>

  <a href="#exposing-a-tailnet-service-using-annotations">
    Exposing a tailnet service using annotations
    
  </a>
</h4>

<p>You can expose a tailnet service to your cluster workloads using annotations and an <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname">external name</a>. You can currently only expose tailnet services that use HTTP.</p>
<p>To expose a tailnet service to your cluster workloads:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a Kubernetes Service of type <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname">ExternalName</a> annotated with the Tailscale IP address of the service you want to make available:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="yaml"><span><span><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>v1</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span>  </span><span>externalName</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>unused // any value - will be overwritten by operator</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Under <code>metadata.annotations</code>, add the annotation
<code>tailscale.com/tailnet-ip</code> with the Tailscale IP address for the tailnet service.
This can be either an IPv4 or IPv6 address, for either a Tailscale node or a route in a Tailscale subnet. This does not support IP ranges or Tailscale node names.</p>
<p>Under <code>spec.externalName</code>, add any value. This needs to be set to pass Kubernetes validation, but can hold any placeholder value. It will be overwritten by the Tailscale Kubernetes operator with a DNS name that cluster workloads can use to reach the proxy.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Wait for the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to deploy the proxy in the <code>tailscale</code> namespace, and to update the <code>spec.externalName</code> of the Kubernetes Service. It will get set to the DNS name of the egress proxy that Tailscale operator creates.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any cluster workload can now access the exposed Tailscale service using the annotated Kubernetes Service — calls to it will be routed to the proxy and forwarded to the right Tailscale node.</p>

</h5>

<p>The proxy pod is deployed in the <code>tailscale</code> namespace, and will have a name of the form <code>ts-&lt;annotated-service-name&gt;-&lt;random-string&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>If there are issues reaching the external service, verify the proxy pod is properly deployed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the logs of the proxy pod.</li>
<li>Review the logs of the operator. You can do this by running <code>kubectl logs deploy/operator --namespace tailscale</code>. The log level can be configured using the <code>OPERATOR_LOGGING</code> environment variable in the operator’s <a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/cmd/k8s-operator/manifests/operator.yaml">manifest file</a>.</li>
<li>Verify that the cluster workload is able to send traffic to the proxy pod in the <code>tailscale</code> namespace.</li>

  </a>
</h3>

<p>You can use the Tailscale Kubernetes operator to expose a service in one cluster to another cluster. This is done by exposing the service on destination cluster A to the tailnet (<a href="#cluster-ingress">cluster ingress</a>), and connecting from a source service in cluster B to the tailnet (<a href="#cluster-egress">cluster egress</a>) in order to access the service running in cluster A.</p>
<p>This will need to be configured for each ingress and egress pair of services. To set this up for access via ingress to a service in cluster A and routing via egrees from a service in cluster B:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up <a href="#exposing-a-service-using-ingress">ingress</a> in cluster A for the service you wish to access.</li>
<li>Expose the external service (running in cluster A) using its Tailscale IP address in cluster B with an <a href="#exposing-an-external-service-using-annotations">annotation on the external service</a></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="limitations">
  <a href="#limitations">
    Limitations
    
  </a>
</h3>

<ul>
<li>Only development (“unstable”) builds are usable for now, as the operator
depends on some changes that happened after the release of Tailscale v1.36.</li>
<li>There are no deployment options other than applying the
<a href="https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/main/cmd/k8s-operator/manifests/operator.yaml">manifest file</a>.</li>
<li>There are no automated updates. The operator and proxy pods will not update
automatically to newer Tailscale releases as they become available.</li>
<li>There are no dashboards or metrics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster ingress</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags are only considered during initial provisioning. That is, editing
<code>tailscale.com/tags</code> on an already exposed service doesn’t update the tags
until you clean up and re-expose the service.</li>
<li>The requested machine name is only considered during initial provisioning. That
is, editing <code>tailscale.com/hostname</code> on an already exposed service doesn’t
update the machine name until you clean up and re-expose the service.</li>
<li>Ingress to cluster services currently only supports hosts where netfilter can be configured via iptables.</li>
</ul>
<p>API server proxy</p>
<ul>
<li>The API server proxy runs inside of the cluster. If your cluster is non-functional or is unable to schedule pods, you may lose access to the API server proxy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cluster egress</p>
<ul>
<li>When exposing a service to your cluster, any associated MagicDNS name will not resolve in-cluster. Instead, the name of the ExternalName service should be used to connect to the resource. As a result of this, if you use Tailscale to provision certificates you may see certificate name mismatch errors. <em>We are working on this.</em></li>
<li>Egress to external services supports using an IPv4 or IPv6 address for a single route in the <code>tailscale.com/tailnet-ip</code> annotation, but not IP ranges or node names.</li>
<li>Egress to external services currently only supports hosts where netfilter can be configured via iptables.</li>
<li>Egress to external services currently only supports clusters where privileged pods are permitted (i.e., GKE Autopilot is not supported).</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Feature flags, sometimes called feature toggles or feature switches, are a software development technique that allows engineering teams to decouple the release of new functionality from software deployments. With feature flags, developers can turn specific features or code segments on or off at runtime, without the need for a code deployment or rollback. Organizations who adopt feature flags see improvements in all key operational metrics for DevOps: Lead time to changes, mean-time-to-recovery, deployment frequency, and change failure rate.</p><p>There are 11 principles for building a large-scale feature flag system. These principles have their roots in distributed systems architecture and pay particular attention to security, privacy, and scale that is required by most enterprise systems. If you follow these principles, your feature flag system is less likely to break under load and will be easier to evolve and maintain.</p><p>These principles are:</p><ol><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/runtime-control">Enable run-time control. Control flags dynamically, not using config files.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/never-expose-pii">Never expose PII. Follow the principle of least privilege.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/evaluate-flags-close-to-user">Evaluate flags as close to the user as possible. Reduce latency.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/scale-horizontally">Scale Horizontally. Decouple reading and writing flags.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/limit-payloads">Limit payloads. Feature flag payload should be as small as possible.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/availability-over-consistency">Design for failure. Favor availability over consistency.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/short-lived-feature-flags">Make feature flags short-lived. Do not confuse flags with application configuration.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/unique-names">Use unique names across all applications. Enforce naming conventions.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/democratize-feature-flag-access">Choose open by default. Democratize feature flag access.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/prioritize-ux">Do no harm. Prioritize consistent user experience.</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.getunleash.io/topics/feature-flags/enable-traceability">Enable traceability. Make it easy to understand flag evaluation</a></li></ol><h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2><p>Feature flags have become a central part of the DevOps toolbox along with Git, CI/CD and microservices. You can write modern software without all of these things, but it sure is a lot harder, and a lot less fun.  </p><p>And just like the wrong Git repo design can cause interminable headaches, getting the details wrong when first building a feature flag system can be very costly.</p><p>This set of principles for building a large-scale feature management platform is the result of thousands of hours of work building and scaling Unleash, an open-source feature management solution used by thousands of organizations.  </p><p>Before Unleash was a community and a company, it was an internal project, started by <a href="https://github.com/ivarconr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one dev</a>, for one company. As the community behind Unleash grew, patterns and anti-patterns of large-scale feature flag systems emerged. Our community quickly discovered that these are important principles for anyone who wanted to avoid spending weekends debugging the production system that is supposed to make debugging in production easier.</p><p>“Large scale” means the ability to support millions of flags served to end-users with minimal latency or impact on application uptime or performance. That is the type of system most large enterprises are building today and the type of feature flag system that this guide focuses on.</p><p>Our motivation for writing these principles is to share what we’ve learned building a large-scale feature flag solution with other architects and engineers solving similar challenges. Unleash is open-source, and so are these principles.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.sequin.io/all-the-ways-to-capture-changes-in-postgres/">https://blog.sequin.io/all-the-ways-to-capture-changes-in-postgres/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37610899">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Working with data at rest is where Postgres shines. But what about when you need data in motion? What about when you need to trigger a workflow based on changes to a table? Or you need to stream the data in Postgres to another data store, system, or service in real-time?</p>
<p>Fortunately, Postgres comes with a lot of options to make this happen. In this post, I’ll lay them all out. I’ll also give you an idea of which are easy to do, which are more robust, and how to make the right choice for you.</p>
<h2 id="listennotify">Listen/Notify</h2>
<p>Perhaps the simplest approach is to use Postgres' interprocess communication feature, Listen/Notify. Listen/Notify is an implementation of the publish-subscribe pattern.</p>
<p>With Listen/Notify, a Postgres session (or connection) can "listen" to a particular channel for notifications. Activity in the database or other sessions can "notify" that channel. Whenever a notification is sent to a channel, all sessions listening to that channel receive the notification instantly.</p>
<p>You can see Listen/Notify for yourself by opening two <code>psql</code> sessions.</p>
<p>In session 1, you can setup your listener:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; listen my_channel;
LISTEN
</code></pre>
<p>And in session 2, you can publish to that channel with a message:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; notify my_channel, 'hey there!';
NOTIFY
&gt; notify my_channel, 'is this thing on?';
NOTIFY
</code></pre>
<p>While the listener process received the message right away, <code>psql</code> won't print the message automatically. To get it to print out the messages it's received so far, you just need to run any query. For example, you can just send an empty query like this:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; listen my_channel;
LISTEN
&gt; ;
Asynchronous notification "my_channel" with payload "hey there!" received from server process with PID 80019.
Asynchronous notification "my_channel" with payload "is this thing on?" received from server process with PID 80019.
</code></pre>
<p>(Naturally, this isn't how the Postgres client library in your preferred programming language will work. Libraries will deliver messages to your subscriber immediately without requiring a query.)</p>
<p>To use Listen/Notify to capture changes, you can set up a trigger. For example, here's an <code>after</code> trigger that sends along the payload of the record that changed as JSON via Notify:</p>
<pre><code>create or replace function notify_trigger() returns trigger as $$
declare
  payload json;
begin
  payload := json_build_object('table', TG_TABLE_NAME, 'id', NEW.id, 'action', TG_OP);
  perform pg_notify('table_changes', payload::text);
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

create trigger my_trigger
after insert or update or delete on my_table
for each row execute function notify_trigger();
</code></pre>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides</h3>
<p>Listen/Notify is simple and powerful, but has some notable downsides.</p>
<p>First, as a pub-sub mechanism, it has "at most once" delivery semantics. Notifications are transient; a listener needs to be listening to a channel when notifications are published. When a listener subscribes to a channel, it will only receive notifications from that moment forward. This also means that if there are network issues that cause a listening session to disconnect even briefly, it won't receive the notification.</p>
<p>Second, the payload size limit is 8000 bytes. If the message exceeds this size, the <code>notify</code> command will fail. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>As such, Listen/Notify is solid for basic change detection needs, but you'll probably find it does not serve more sophisticated needs well. However, it can complement other strategies (like "poll the table") nicely.</p>
<h2 id="poll-the-table">Poll the table</h2>
<p>The simplest <em>robust</em> way to capture changes is to poll the table directly. Here, you need each table to have an <code>updated_at</code> column or similar that updates whenever the row updates. (You can use a trigger for this.) A combination of <code>updated_at</code> <a href="https://blog.sequin.io/whats-changed-in-your-api/">and <code>id</code></a> serve as your cursor. In this setup, your application logic that polls the table handles storing and maintaining the cursor.</p>
<p>In addition to polling the table, you can use a Notify subscription to inform your application that a record has been inserted or modified. Postgres' notifications are ephemeral, so this should only serve as an optimization on top of polling.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides</h3>
<p>This approach has two downsides.</p>
<p>The first is that you can't detect when a row is deleted. There's no way to "see" the missing row in the table.</p>
<p>One remediation is to have a Postgres trigger fire on deletes, and store the <code>id</code> (and whatever other columns you want) in a separate table: e.g. <code>deleted_contacts</code>. Then, your application can poll that table to discover deletes instead.</p>
<p>The second downside is that you don't get diffs. You know this record was updated since you last polled the table, but you don't know <em>what</em> was updated on the record.</p>
<p>Maybe deletes aren't a big deal for your use case or you don't care about diffs. If so, polling the table is a reasonable and simple solution for tracking changes.</p>
<h2 id="replication-wal">Replication (WAL)</h2>
<p>Postgres supports streaming replication to other Postgres databases. In streaming replication, Postgres sends the WAL stream over a network connection from the primary to a replica. The standby servers pull these WAL records and replay them to keep their database in sync with the primary database.</p>
<p>Streaming replication was built for streaming changes to other Postgres servers. But you can use it to capture changes for your application too.</p>
<p>You first create a replication slot, like this:</p>
<pre><code>select * from
pg_create_logical_replication_slot('&lt;your_slot_name&gt;', '&lt;output_plugin&gt;');
</code></pre>
<p><code>output_plugin</code> is a parameter which specifies which plugin Postgres should use to decode WAL changes. Postgres comes with a few built-in plugins. <code>pgoutput</code> is the default. It formats the output in the binary expected by client servers. <code>test_decoding</code> is a simple output plugin that provides human-readable output of the changes to the WAL.</p>
<p>The most popular output plugin not built-in to Postgres is <code>wal2json</code>. It does what it says on the tin. JSON will be a lot easier for you to consume from an application than Postgres' binary format.</p>
<p>After creating your replication slot, you can start it and consume from it. Working with replication slots uses a different part of the Postgres protocol than standard queries. But many client libraries have functions that help you work with replication slots.</p>
<p>For example, this is how you consume WAL messages in the <code>psycopg2</code> library:</p>
<pre><code>cursor.start_replication(slot_name='your_slot_name', decode=True)
cursor.consume_stream(lambda msg: acknowledge_to_server(cursor, msg))

def acknowledge_to_server(cursor, msg):
    # Process the message (msg) here
    # ...
    # Acknowledge the message
    cursor.send_feedback(flush_lsn=msg.wal_end)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that the client is responsible for ack'ing WAL messages that it has received. So the replication slot behaves like event buses such as SQS.</p>
<p>Instead of consuming from the WAL directly, you can use tools like Debezium to do this for you. Debezium will consume the WAL from Postgres and stream those changes to a variety of sinks, including Kafka or NATS.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides</h3>
<p>Using Postgres' replication facilities to capture changes is a robust solution. The biggest downside is complexity. Replication slots and the replication protocol are less familiar to most developers than the "standard" parts (i.e. tables and queries).</p>
<p>Along with this complexity is a decrease in clarity. If something with replication breaks or if there's a lag or things aren't working as expected, it can be a bit trickier to debug than the other solutions outlined here.</p>
<p>Another aspect worth mentioning is that replication slots may require tweaking <code>postgresql.conf</code>. For example, you may need to tweak parameters like <code>max_wal_senders</code> and <code>max_replication_slots</code>. So you'll need total access to the database to implement this solution.</p>
<h2 id="capture-changes-in-an-audit-table">Capture changes in an audit table</h2>
<p>In this approach, you set up a separate table for logging changes, e.g. <code>changelog</code>. That table contains column related to the record's modification, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>action</code>: Was this an <code>insert</code>, <code>update</code>, or <code>delete</code>?</li>
<li><code>old</code>: A jsonb of the record before the mutation. Blank for inserts.</li>
<li><code>values</code>: A jsonb of the change fields. Blank for deletes.</li>
<li><code>inserted_at</code>: Time the change occurred.</li>
</ul>
<p>To set this up, you need to create a trigger function that inserts into this table every time a change occurs. Then, you need to create triggers on all the tables you care about to invoke that trigger function.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what that trigger function might look like:</p>
<pre><code>create or replace function changelog_trigger() returns trigger as $$
declare
  action text;
  table_name text;
  transaction_id bigint;
  timestamp timestamp;
  old_data jsonb;
  new_data jsonb;
begin
  action := lower(TG_OP::text);
  table_name := TG_TABLE_NAME::text;
  transaction_id := txid_current();
  timestamp := current_timestamp;

  if TG_OP = 'DELETE' then
    old_data := to_jsonb(OLD.*);
  elseif TG_OP = 'INSERT' then
    new_data := to_jsonb(NEW.*);
  elseif TG_OP = 'UPDATE' then
    old_data := to_jsonb(OLD.*);
    new_data := to_jsonb(NEW.*);
  end if;

  insert into changelog (action, table_name, transaction_id, timestamp, old_data, new_data) 
  values (action, table_name, transaction_id, timestamp, old_data, new_data);

  return null;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
</code></pre>
<p>After setting up a way to capture changes, you need to figure out how to consume them.</p>
<p>There's a lot of different ways you can do this. One way is to treat the <code>changelog</code> as a queue. Your application workers can pull changes from this table. You'll probably want to ensure that changes are processed ~exactly once. You can use the <code>for update skip locked</code> feature in Postgres to do this. For example, your workers can open a transaction and grab a chunk of <code>changelog</code> entries:</p>
<pre><code>begin;

select * 
from changelog 
order by timestamp 
limit 100 
for update skip locked;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, other workers running that query will not receive this "locked" block of rows. After your worker processes the records, it can delete them:</p>
<pre><code>delete from changelog 
where id in (list_of_processed_record_ids);

commit;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides</h3>
<p>This approach is similar to using a replication slot, but more manual. The trigger function and table design I've outlined might work to start. But you'd likely need to make tweaks before deploying at scale in production. <sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The advantage over replication slots is that it's all "standard" Postgres. Instead of an opaque replication slot, you have an easy to query Postgres table. And you don't need access to <code>postgresql.conf</code> to make this work.</p>
<h2 id="foreign-data-wrappers">Foreign data wrappers</h2>
<p>Foreign data wrappers (FDWs) are a Postgres feature that allow you to both read from and write to external data sources from your Postgres database.</p>
<p>The most notable and widely supported extension built on FDWs is <code>postgres_fdw</code>. With <code>postgres_fdw</code>, you can connect two Postgres databases and create something like a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html?ref=blog.sequin.io">view</a> in one Postgres database that references a table in another Postgres database. Under the hood, you're turning one Postgres database into a client and the other into a server. When you make queries against foreign tables, the client database sends the queries to the server database via Postgres' <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html?ref=blog.sequin.io">wire protocol</a>.</p>
<p>Using FDWs to capture changes is an unusual strategy. I wouldn't recommend it outside very specific situations.</p>
<p>One situation where FDWs could make sense is if you're capturing changes in one Postgres database in order to write them to another Postgres database. Perhaps you use one database for accounting and another for your application. You can skip the intermediary change capture steps and use <code>postgres_fdw</code> to go from database to database.</p>
<p>Here's an example trigger that ensures the status for a given account (identified by <code>email</code>) is in-sync across two databases. This assumes the foreign table has already been declared as <code>foreign_app_database</code>:</p>
<pre><code>create or replace function cancel_subscription()
  returns trigger as $$
declare
  account_status text;
begin
  if (new.status = 'cancelled' or new.status = 'suspended') then
    account_status := 'cancelled';

    update foreign_app_database.account
    set status = account_status
    where email = new.email;
  end if;

  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;
</code></pre>
<p>In addition to <code>postgres_fdw</code>, you can create and load your own foreign data wrappers into your Postgres database.</p>
<p>That means you could create a foreign data wrapper that posts changes to an internal API. Unlike the other change detection strategies in this list, because you'd write to the API inside your commit, your API would have the ability to reject the change and roll back the commit.</p>
<h3 id="downsides">Downsides</h3>
<p>Foreign data wrappers are a fun and powerful Postgres feature. But they'll rarely be your best option for capturing changes. You're probably not trying to replicate changes from one Postgres database to another. And while writing your own foreign data wrapper from scratch <a href="https://github.com/supabase/wrappers?ref=blog.sequin.io">has gotten easier</a>, writing your own FDW is probably the biggest lift in this list for capturing changes.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are lots of options for capturing changes in Postgres. Depending on your use case, some options are clearly better than others. In sum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen/Notify is great for non-critical event capture, prototyping, or optimizing polling.</li>
<li>Polling for changes is a fine, straightforward solution for simple use cases.</li>
<li>Replication is probably your best bet for a robust solution. If that’s too difficult or opaque, then perhaps the audit table is a good middle-ground.</li>
<li>Finally, foreign data wrappers solve a need you’re unlikely to have.</li>
</ul>
<p>We examined all of these options for our own change capture requirements, and unfortunately none of them met our complex (and niche) needs. So, we ended up needing to build a Postgres proxy 😅 You can <a href="https://blog.sequin.io/we-had-no-choice-but-to-build-a-postgres-proxy/">read more about that here</a>.</p>
