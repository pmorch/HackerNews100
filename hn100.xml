<p>Does anything stick out? Yes, exactly, it's a screenshot of Zed running <em>on Linux</em>!</p>
<p>Wait, what? Zed on Linux? Is it released yet? No, it's not, but it's taking shape, fast.</p>
<p>At the end of January <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-is-now-open-source">we open-sourced Zed</a> and had zero Linux support. Now, three months later, you can <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md">compile &amp; run</a> Zed on Linux and actually use it. And I mean <em>really</em> use it — I've worked in Zed (on Zed!) the whole last week without any problems.</p>
<p>The words "alpha release" seem to appear at the end of the tunnel. We're getting closer.</p>
<p>Today we're going to talk about how Zed on Linux took shape, what the challenges were, who did the work, and what's still left to do.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-linux-from-the-start-or-the-tricky-thing-about-platforms"><span data-br=":R97brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Why not Linux from the start? Or: the Tricky Thing About Platforms</span></h2>
<p>Why didn't Zed work on Linux out of the box? That's not an unreasonable thing to ask and many of you did. After all, Zed's written in Rust, a language that's known for its cross-platform support. So if Rust programs can run on macOS, Linux, and Windows, why didn't Zed?</p>
<p>The tricky thing about cross-platform support is that — in general and in Rust — it only works as long as you're fine with the platform being abstracted away, hidden behind an API that is the same on every platform.</p>
<p>At Zed, though, we want to use each platform as best as we can to build a high-performance application that is and <em>feels</em> native to the platform. That often means talking directly to the platform, in order to use it to the best of its abilities.</p>
<p>On macOS, for example, Zed makes direct use of <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">Metal</a>. We have our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/shaders.metal">own shaders</a>, our <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/593f0e0c3ef08da7e528230867526dcb77e723fa/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/metal_renderer.rs">own renderer</a>, and we put <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">a lot of effort into understanding macOS APIs to get to 120FPS</a>. Zed on macOS <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/platform.rs#L66">is also a fully-native AppKit NSApplication</a> and we integrated <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/zed-decoded-async-rust">our async Rust runtime with macOS' native application runtime</a>.</p>
<p>If you want your application to have this level of depth and control over its platform integration <em>and</em> have it be cross-platform, what you'll need to build is a framework. A framework that allows you to talk directly to the platform whenever you need, but otherwise abstract it away from you so you don't have to worry about it when you write application-level code.</p>
<p>That's what Zed did. The framework is called <a href="https://www.gpui.rs/">GPUI</a> and when we released it as open-source, along with Zed, it came with cross-platform support. Except not really.</p>
<h2 id="gpuis-cross-platform-support"><span data-br=":Rg7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">GPUI's cross platform support</span></h2>
<p>GPUI does abstract away the underlying platform and assumes there's more in the world than macOS. Here are parts of <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform.rs#L95-L162">GPUI's <code>Platform</code> trait</a>, which is all a GPUI application has to interact with:</p>

<p>This <code>Platform</code> offers nearly everything an application might want to do: execute work on different threads, start/stop the application, manage windows, open URLs, open system dialogues to open files and directories, cursor style, clipboard, credentials, ... and a few more things that I left out to keep this succinct.</p>
<p>From the start, GPUI has had this <code>Platform</code> abstraction built-in. GPUI never was macOS-only. It was always platform-agnostic, as long as the <code>Platform</code> trait is implemented for the platform.</p>
<p>And that's essentially what it meant to get Zed running on Linux: implement <code>Platform</code> for Linux.</p>
<p>So, just implemented a bunch of methods and then Zed works on any platform? Well... yes, kind of.</p>
<p>Here's what the Linux <code>Platform</code> implementation <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/266988adea954cd759525cc7222e261536c25fd1/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/platform.rs#L99-L281">looked like in the middle of February</a>. Again, in excerpts:</p>

<p>Some methods implemented, some marked with <code>todo!</code>, others panicking with an <code>unimplemented!()</code>. Back in February this file had 11 <code>todo!</code> comments and 9 calls to <code>unimplemented</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/593f0e0c3ef08da7e528230867526dcb77e723fa/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/platform.rs#L99-L281">Now</a> it has 9 <code>todo!</code>s (different ones) and the word <code>unimplemented</code> in a string.</p>
<p>So, yes, the work was getting rid of the <code>todo!</code>s and implementing the missing methods. But we all know: not all methods are created equal.</p>
<p>While a <code>write_to_clipboard</code> method seems relatively straightforward to implement, things weren't as easy as the lower-case <code>todo!</code> and its defiantly cute exclamation mark might suggest.</p>
<h2 id="which-linux-are-you-talking-about"><span data-br=":Rt7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Which Linux are you talking about?</span></h2>
<p>A big challenge when building a GUI application for Linux is that there is no such thing as Linux, really. Linux is a kernel and when you install and run it, you're mostly likely doing that through a Linux distribution that gives you the rest of the operating system too: Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Arch, Gentoo, and so on.</p>
<p>They nearly all differ in some aspects that are relevant for an application developer. Example: package management. Distributions not only have their own format with which to distribute applications, but they also have different ways of managing dependencies. And there's no standard across distributions (but of course there are <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">competing standards</a>). So far, with Zed, we've avoided the whole packaging topic and just focused on building <code>.tar.gz</code> archives that others can then turn into distribution-specific packages. But just scrolling through <a href="https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable">Tailscale's Packages site</a> tells us that there's a lot of work to do that we never had to do for macOS.</p>
<p>But even if you focus on only one distribution, say Ubuntu, you still have to decide: do you support X11 or Wayland? Both are — ignoring some technical details (don't send me angry letters) — display servers with which Linux software can draw things on the screen. X11 has been around for a long, long time and Wayland has been trying to replace it, also for a long, long time. That, in turn, makes the question a trick question: you have to support both. They're both widely used. <em>Still used</em> in the case of X11 and <em>gaining users</em> in the case of Wayland, but it's not realistic that 100% of Linux users will be on Wayland anytime soon.</p>
<p>After deciding to support Ubuntu and X11 and Wayland, the next question is: which desktop environment or window manager are you going to support? KDE or GNOME? Qt or GTK? What about tiling window managers and users that want to turn window decorations off? Which <em>audio server</em> are you going to support to get audio calls working? PipeWire? Or still PulseAudio? Do you even have to worry about that or is that choice dictated by the desktop environment you chose?</p>
<p>I could probably go on and find more "actually, there's more than one of X" to list, but you get the point: when building a graphical application to run on Linux, you have to make quite a few technical decisions about which platform combinations to target and how.</p>
<p>And we haven't even touched on the most fundamental of all of these decisions yet: how do we render Zed?</p>
<h2 id="from-metal-to-what"><span data-br=":R147brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">From Metal to... what?</span></h2>
<p>Even if you knew how to package your application, and how to target X11 and/or Wayland, and managed to open an application window in them — how do you draw your application in that window?</p>
<p>You might have missed it, but in the <code>Platform</code> trait above, there's a method to open a new window:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>In order to implement that, you also have to implement the interface of the thing it returns: <code>PlatformWindow</code>. And that packs a punch.</p>
<p>As of right now, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform.rs#L189-L241"><code>PlatformWindow</code> requires 37 methods</a> to be implemented. The methods range from hooks (<code>on_close</code>, <code>on_fullscreen</code>) to attributes (<code>is_fullscreen</code>, <code>is_minimized</code>) to bread-and-butter (<code>content_size</code>, <code>mouse_position</code>, <code>toggle_fullscreen</code>) to tricky (<code>scale_factor</code>, <code>appearance</code>).</p>
<p>But there's one method on <code>PlatformWindow</code> that's the most fundamental of them all: <code>draw</code>. Another name for it could be <code>where_the_rubber_hits_the_road</code>. Here is its implementation for macOS:</p>

<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>It doesn't look imposing, but it is: <code>Scene</code> is the result of GPUI rendering a frame and this method, <code>draw</code>, is what makes it appear on the screen.</p>
<p>A <code>Scene</code> is the visible parts of the application —&nbsp;text, windows, borders, rectangles, underlines, and so on — turned into data, <em>primitives</em>. Here's <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/scene.rs#L15-L28">the definition of <code>Scene</code></a>:</p>

<p>Shadows, quads, paths, underlines, sprites — that's what GPUI boils your application down to when a frame is rendered. And then, in <code>draw</code>, it hands that data over to the renderer.</p>
<p>And the renderer — that's your GPU.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above: on macOS we use the Metal APIs to talk to the GPU and when you follow the definitions there, you'll end up at <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/mac/metal_renderer.rs#L238">a <code>fn draw</code>, implemented on <code>MetalRenderer</code></a>, that contains nearly the complete saga as told in our <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/120fps">120FPS</a> blog post: setting up a rendering pipeline, triple-buffering, syncing up with the OS and the display, all of that.</p>
<p>So how do we implement <code>draw</code> on Linux, without Metal? How do we talk to the GPU on Linux?</p>
<h2 id="enter-stage-the-open-source-hackers"><span data-br=":R1j7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">Enter stage: the open-source hackers</span></h2>
<p>Less than two weeks after Zed going open-source, flying through the cloud of pull requests and issues that's been stirred up by all the excitement comes <a href="https://github.com/kvark">@kvark</a> (Dzmitry Malyshau) with a by now <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/7343">legendary PR</a> that makes Zed render on Linux. In less than four thousand lines of code. Sure, it didn't render all of Zed yet, but: wow.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/kvark_pull_request.png" alt="Screenshot of kvark's pull request that made Zed render on Linux"><figcaption>Screenshot of kvark's pull request that made Zed render on Linux</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The PR answers the question of how to talk to the GPU on Linux: with <a href="https://github.com/kvark/blade">blade</a>, kvark's "rendering solution for Rust", that offers a "lean low-level GPU abstraction focused at ergonomics and fun". Blade uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan">Vulkan</a> under the hood, a graphics API that's similar to Metal in the level of abstraction it offers, to talk to the GPU and render Zed.</p>
<p>After @kvark opened the PR, Mikayla, Antonio, and Nathan reached out to him to talk about the feasibility of using Blade in Zed and shared goals. It didn't take long to get to a shared understanding and, exactly two weeks after open-sourcing Zed, the PR that made it compile and run on Linux was merged.</p>
<p>With that big TODO and question out of the way, the community jumped on the chance to remove the remaining <code>todo!</code>s: <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Awitelokk">@witelokk added support for Wayland</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+linux+author%3Akvark">@kvark continued his work on getting all of Zed to render smoothly</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/7852">@romgrk added support for file dialogues</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/9103">@apricobucket28 fixed scrolling and selections</a> and many others <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+in%3Atitle+linux">contributed and fixed a lot of other things</a>, with Mikayla diligently reviewing, coding, managing, leading and keeping an eye on everything.</p>
<p>This list of contributions is incomplete and I'm sure I should've mentioned more people, but the point I want to make is this: Zed on Linux was and is an impressive open-source team effort that surprised all of us at Zed with how fast it got Zed to a working state.</p>

<p>And there are two implementations of <code>LinuxClient</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/98ea5e172ec114004116f996f51b46cdf5c438e4/crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/wayland/client.rs#L360">one for Wayland</a></li>

</ul>
<p>Both of them have an implementation of <code>PlatformWindow</code> too:</p>

</ul>
<p>But both of them use Blade in their <code>draw</code> method:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre tabindex="0" data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><code data-language="rust" data-theme="light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// crates/gpui/src/platform/linux/x11/window.rs</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>That means the rubber hits the road through these layers of abstractions:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPUI asks the <code>Platform</code> to open a window</li>
<li>The Wayland <code>LinuxClient</code> uses Wayland to open a window, the X11 client uses X11</li>
<li>When rendering a frame, GPUI turns the application into a <code>Scene</code></li>
<li>It then calls the <code>PlatformWindow</code> to <code>draw</code> that <code>Scene</code></li>
<li>Both the Wayland and the X11 implementations use Blade, which uses Vulkan, to talk to the GPU, to draw the <code>Scene</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That's obviously only scratching the surface. There are a lot more interesting things going in the Linux implementation — did you know that there's multiple clipboards on Linux but only one on macOS? Or here, take a look at this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://zed.dev/img/post/zed-decoded-linux-when/linux_screenshot_2.png" alt="Screenshot of Zed on Linux, including a native file dialog"><figcaption>Screenshot of Zed on Linux, including a native file dialog</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Yup, that's a native file dialog, but we don't use GTK in Zed and that clearly is GTK — so, how does that work? You'll find the answer in <a href="https://youtu.be/O5XVVnA2LoY">the companion video</a> in which Mikayla and I dive deeper into this and also touch on the question of whether or not we should use GTK or Qt or something else (spoiler: it's complicated).</p>
<h2 id="so-linux-when"><span data-br=":R2b7brrrqbf9la:" data-brr="1">So, Linux when?</span></h2>
<p>So what's left to do for Linux? In order to get to an alpha release: <em>not that much</em>, but don't quote me on that. Essentially: fix 86 remaining <code>todo!</code>s of various difficulty levels, get window resizing/moving to work on Wayland, and implement system dialogues for GPUI. We're close, very close.</p>
<p>After the alpha, we'll need to add support for audio calls, drag &amp; drop, storing of credentials, make sure the performance is consistently high, increase stability, and so on. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/7015">Linux Roadmap</a> tracking issue.</p>
<p>Even though there might still be a lot to do (I don't even want to know how complicated drag &amp; drop can be on Linux— I mean, GNOM— I mean, KDE, no, I mea—) and a lot of unknown unknowns and surprises along the way, one thing's for sure: the fact that we got to the current state of Zed on Linux in three months, with that many high-quality open-source contributions, is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Want to try out Zed on Linux? You need Rust, some dependencies, and depending on your patience enough CPU and memory to compile it in a reasonable amount of time. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/main/docs/src/development/linux.md">these instructions</a>. Have fun!</p><hr></article></div></div>]]></description>

They can soak up excess solar power during the day and store it for use when it gets dark.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Those batteries play a pivotal role in California’s electric grid, partially replacing fossil fuels in the evening. Between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on April 30, for example, <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/caiso?date=2024-04-30">batteries supplied more than one-fifth of California’s electricity</a> and, for a few minutes, pumped out 7,046 megawatts of electricity, akin to the output from seven large nuclear reactors.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Across the country, power companies are increasingly using giant batteries the size of shipping containers to address renewable energy’s biggest weakness: the fact that the wind and sun aren’t always available.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“What’s happening in California is a glimpse of what could happen to other grids in the future,” said Helen Kou, head of U.S. power analysis at BloombergNEF, a research firm. “Batteries are quickly moving from these niche applications to shifting large amounts of renewable energy toward peak demand periods.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Over the past three years, battery storage capacity on the nation’s grids has grown tenfold, to 16,000 megawatts. This year, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61202">it is expected to nearly double</a> again, with the biggest growth in Texas, California and Arizona.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic"><div><p><h3><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><span>Battery Storage Plants</span> Across the <span>United States</span><span>U.S.</span><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h3>  </p></div>   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Note: Each circle represents a facility that has at least one battery as of March 2024.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Most grid batteries use lithium-ion technology, similar to batteries in smartphones or electric cars. As the electric vehicle industry has expanded over the past decade, battery costs have fallen by 80 percent, making them competitive for large-scale power storage.

While the state remains heavily dependent on natural gas, a significant contributor to global warming, batteries are starting to eat into the market for fossil fuels. State regulators plan <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/california-puc-carbon-preferred-system-plan-irp-caiso/707876/">to nearly triple battery capacity</a> by 2035.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“The future is bright for energy storage,” said Andrés Gluski, chief executive of AES Corporation, one of the world’s largest power companies. “If you want more renewables on the grid, you need more batteries.

Prices then soar in the evening when solar disappears and grid operators have to increase output from gas plants or hydroelectric dams to compensate.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic">   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sources: California Independent System Operator via <a href="http://gridstatus.io/">Grid Status</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->California now has <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/energy-almanac/california-electricity-data/california-energy-storage-system-survey">10,000 megawatts of battery capacity on the grid</a>, enough to power 10 million homes for a few hours. Those batteries are “able to very effectively manage that evening ramp where solar is going down and customer demand is increasing,” said John Phipps, executive director of grid operations for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state’s grid.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Batteries can also help California’s grid handle stresses from heat waves and wildfires, Mr. Phipps said. “It made some differences last summer,” he said. “We were able to meet high load days and wildfire days when we might lose some power lines.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, batteries are still largely used to provide ancillary services, stabilizing the grid against unexpected disruptions. Texas is also more reliant than California on wind energy, which fluctuates in less-predictable patterns.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->But Texas is quickly catching up to California in solar power, and batteries increasingly help with evening peaks. On April 28, the sun was setting just as wind power was unexpectedly low and many coal and gas plants were offline for repairs. Batteries jumped in, <a href="https://www.gridstatus.io/live/ercot?date=2024-04-28">supplying 4 percent of Texas’s electricity at one point</a>, enough to power a million homes. Last summer, batteries <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ercot-grid-battery-solar-enel-texas-18350609.php">helped avert evening blackouts</a> by providing additional power during record heat.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="graphic">   <div> <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sources: Electric Reliability Council of Texas via <a href="http://gridstatus.io/">Grid Status</a><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->By The New York Times<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div> </figure><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The two states built their battery fleets in distinct ways. In California, government mandates were the impetus: In 2019, regulators worried that too many older gas plants were closing, risking blackouts, and ordered utilities to quickly install thousands of megawatts of storage.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In Texas, market forces dominate. The state’s deregulated electricity system allows prices to fluctuate sharply, rising as high as $5,000 per megawatt-hour during acute shortages. That makes it lucrative for battery developers to take advantage of spikes, such as in locations where power lines periodically get clogged.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Anywhere we think the market is going to get tight, you can put batteries in and even things out,” said Stephanie Smith, chief operating officer of Eolian, a battery developer. “Then, we’re making bets all day about when to charge and discharge.”<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->One battery, for instance, sits near Fort Worth, absorbing excess wind power from West Texas during the nighttime, when no one needs it, and feeding it into the grid when demand surges.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Other states are following. In Arizona and Georgia, utilities plan to install thousands of megawatts of battery capacity to help manage rising demand from data centers and factories. It helps that batteries can be deployed quickly, said Aaron Mitchell, vice president of planning and pricing at Georgia Power.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The industry still faces obstacles, however. Lithium-ion batteries are flammable, and while operators have taken steps to reduce fire risk, some communities <a href="https://thecoastnews.com/residents-remain-opposed-to-seguro-battery-facility-despite-changes/">oppose projects in their backyards</a>. Most batteries still come from China, making them vulnerable to trade disputes. In Texas, a state fund <a href="https://www.expressnews.com/business/article/texas-energy-fund-loan-program-ercot-19361692.php">to subsidize gas plants</a> could undercut the battery boom. In other states, complex regulations <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/10/02/battery-storage-seen-as-backbone-of-reliable-electric-grid-but-adoption-uneven-across-us/">sometimes prevent utilities from adding energy storage</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Because these storage resources are so new, the rules are still catching up,” said Natalie McIntire, who works on grid issues for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><h2><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Can Grid Batteries Help Fight Climate Change?<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></h2> </p><figure role="group" aria-label="image">   <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Wind turbines near Sweetwater, Texas.

That’s because operators focus on maximizing revenue and sometimes charge with coal or gas power.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“These batteries have an immense capability to abate carbon, but they need the right incentives to do so,” said Emma Konet, co-founder of <a href="https://www.tierraclimate.com/about">Tierra Climate</a>, a startup working to help batteries earn money for reducing emissions.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In California, by contrast, batteries appear to be cutting emissions from fossil fuels. The state’s gas use in April <a href="https://twitter.com/grid_status/status/1785399291671924856">fell to a seven-year low</a>. “We have reached the conclusion that batteries are displacing natural gas when solar generation is ramping up and down each day,” said Max Kanter, chief executive of Grid Status, an electricity data tracking firm.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Yet California still gets roughly 40 percent of its electricity from natural gas, and it could be difficult for current battery technology to replace all of that. One <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/how-pv-plus-storage-will-compete-with-gas-generation-in-the-u-s/">analysis from BloombergNEF</a> found that solar and batteries can be a cost-effective alternative to smaller gas “peaker” plants that only switch on when demand spikes. But batteries remain too costly to replace many of the larger gas-burning plants that provide steadier power day and night.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“You don’t want to necessarily build a system where you’ve got batteries to suck up every last megawatt-hour, because that’s a pretty expensive system,” said Meredith Fowlie, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Today’s lithium-ion batteries can only deliver power for two to four hours before needing to recharge. If costs keep falling, battery companies <a href="https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/85878.pdf">might be able to extend that to eight or ten hours</a> (it’s a matter of adding more battery packs) but it may not be economical to go far beyond that, said Nate Blair, an energy storage expert at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->That means additional long-duration storage technologies could be needed. If California wants to rely largely on renewable energy, it will have to handle <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/energy-droughts-wind-and-solar-can-last-nearly-week-research-shows">weeklong periods where there’s no wind and little sun</a>. Another challenge: There’s far more solar power available in summer than in winter, and no battery today can store electricity for months to manage those seasonal disparities.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Some companies are exploring solutions. In Sacramento, a start-up called ESS <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/long-duration-energy-storage/sacramento-utility-rolls-out-its-first-long-duration-grid-batteries">is building “flow” batteries</a> that store energy in liquid electrolytes and can last 12 hours or longer. Another start-up, Form Energy, <a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2023-12/cec-awards-30-million-100-hour-long-duration-energy-storage-project">is building a 100-hour iron-air battery</a>. These ideas will have to compete against alternatives like nuclear power, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/climate/geothermal-energy-projects.html">advanced geothermal</a> or even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/12/climate/green-hydrogen-climate-change.html">using green hydrogen to store electricity</a>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->California’s regulators say they may need five times as much storage capacity by midcentury, even if it’s unclear which technologies will prevail.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“We’re just at the beginning of this,” said Mr. Phipps of the California Independent System Operator.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p><figure role="group" aria-label="image">   <div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Ross D.

<p>If you’ve ever tried to “future-proof” a purchase by paying for everything you might eventually need up front, you know it can be a sucker’s game. The problem? <em>We can’t actually see the future.</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>But today we got our hands on LPCAMM2 for the first time, and this looks like the future to us. LPCAMM2 is a totally modular, repairable, upgradeable memory standard for laptops, using the latest LPDDR chips for maximum speed and efficiency. So instead of overpaying (or under-speccing) based on guesswork about your future memory needs, you’ll hopefully be able to buy your next laptop and then install more RAM as needed. Imagine that!</p>



<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use.jpg" alt="The Micron LPCAMM2 module disassembled next to iFixit tools and laptop parts" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06213451/newmicronram-in-use-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>We say “hopefully” because the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Lenovo_ThinkPad_P1_Gen_7">laptop</a> on our teardown table today is the first of its kind, thanks to a collaboration between <a href="https://www.micron.com/about/blog/memory/dram/lpcamm2-no-compromise-for-next-gen-laptops">Micron</a> and <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-unveils-its-new-ai-ready-thinkpad-p1-gen-7-mobile-workstation/">Lenovo</a>—and it remains to be seen how many other big laptop makers will adopt LPCAMM2 technology. But judging by the results of our initial hands-on, the writing is on the wall for laptops with soldered-down, non-serviceable memory.</p>



<h2><strong>What is LPDDR, and why do manufacturers solder it down?</strong></h2>



<p>Repairable, upgradeable RAM isn’t exactly a new idea. As anyone who has ever built a PC knows, we’ve had swappable DDR RAM sticks (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIMM#SO-DIMM">DIMMs</a>, or <em>Dual In-Line Memory Modules</em>) since basically forever. From old Gateway towers to today’s gaming powerhouses to zillion-dollar industrial servers, upgradeable and replaceable RAM is still very much a thing. And for many years, the same was true of laptops, which used a slightly more compact (“Small-Outline” DIMM, or <em>SO-DIMM</em>) version of those same RAM sticks.</p>



<p>More recently though, we’ve seen increasing adoption of <em>LPDDR</em>—a <em>low-power</em> flavor of RAM (hence the “LP”) developed for mobile devices like phones and tablets. Whereas conventional DDR RAM excels at performance applications where power consumption isn’t a primary concern, like video editing or gaming, LPDDR wins the day when it comes to efficiency—<em>a.k.a. battery life</em>. And so for laptops in particular, the benefits of LPDDR are hard to beat.</p>



<div><p>The drawback of LPDDR, though, is that it has to be soldered to the main board in close proximity to the processor—making repairs and upgrades completely impractical. But why?</p><p>LPDDR operates at lower voltages compared to DDR, giving it the edge in power efficiency. But, the lower voltage makes signal integrity between the memory and processor challenging, requiring tighter tolerances and shorter trace distances—that is, the farther the signal has to travel, the more voltage you need for a reliable signal. This is why LPDDR is soldered down as close to the processor as possible.</p></div>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06215652/soldered-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"><figcaption>Historically, LPDDR chips (left) had to be soldered very close to the main processor (right).</figcaption></figure>



<p>In short, laptop makers and consumers alike have faced an unfortunate dilemma: conventional SO-DIMM RAM for serviceability and upgradeability, or soldered LPDDR chips for longer battery life.</p>



<p>Today, that changes.</p>



<h2><strong>Enter LPCAMM2&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Standing for “Low-Power Compression-Attached Memory Module,” the new tech is as the name suggests: LPDDR chips on a compact board that screws in place very close to a laptop’s CPU. Combining the efficiency and speed of LPDDR with a thin, lightweight, upgradeable design and a trick interface that gets everything up close and personal with the CPU, LPCAMM2 seemingly does it all. And with dual-channel performance already baked in, a single LPCAMM2 module can do the job of a pair of the old socketed SO-DIMM sticks with a much smaller footprint and better thermals to boot. Finally: modular, performant, power-efficient laptop memory for the masses.</p>

<figcaption>Lenovo’s <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Device/Lenovo_ThinkPad_P1_Gen_7">ThinkPad P1 (Gen 7)</a> is the first laptop you can actually buy that uses LPCAMM2 tech—check out our <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Lenovo+ThinkPad+P1+Gen+7+LPCAMM2+Memory+Replacement/172267">repair guide</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though LPCAMM2 is arriving initially from Micron, in a Lenovo product, the technology owes its existence to an alliance of tech companies working together over the course of several years. The first iteration, known as <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/dell-introduces-camm-ddr5-memory-for-its-new-precision-laptops-up-to-128gb-per-module">CAMM</a>, was an in-house project at Dell, with the first DDR5-equipped CAMM modules installed in Dell Precision 7000 series laptops. And thankfully, after doing the initial R&amp;D to make the tech a reality, Dell didn’t gatekeep. Their engineers believed that the project had such a good chance at becoming the next widespread memory standard that instead of keeping it proprietary, they went the other way and opened it up for standardization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They were right. Only a few short years later, with the blessing of the <a href="https://www.jedec.org/news/pressreleases/jedec-publishes-new-camm2-memory-module-standard">JEDEC</a> standards body, LPCAMM2 is here and ready to take the torch.</p>



<p>Dell is one hero in this story, creating something the tech world sorely needed and then sharing instead of keeping it for themselves. Thankfully, this story is full of heroes: Micron and Lenovo are first to bring LPCAMM2 to market, with <a href="https://semiconductor.samsung.com/dram/module/lpcamm2/">Samsung</a>, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/adata-demos-next-gen-memory-modules">ADATA</a>, and others backing it as well. Instead of everyone going their own way, they’ve rallied around a new industry standard—meaning an off-the-shelf LPCAMM2 module should theoretically work in any laptop that adopts the technology, regardless of who manufactures it. With the industry as a whole on the same page, backing standards like this, the world becomes a more repairable place.</p>



<h2><strong>Designing for a repairable future</strong></h2>



<p>The advent of LPCAMM2 is especially gratifying for repair advocates, who for years have been told that repairability simply can’t coexist with cutting-edge tech in thin-and-light devices. We’re not ready to accept that, and we’ve long argued that OEMs who are willing to innovate with repairability in mind can do better. Maybe we can’t see the future, but we can envision one that’s more repairable than what we’ve been sold in recent years—and we’re grateful when companies like Micron and Lenovo take the leap to make that future a reality.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1922" height="1081" src="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1.jpg 1922w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://valkyrie.cdn.ifixit.com/media/2024/05/06220218/Lenovo_P1_108-1-1600x900.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1922px) 100vw, 1922px"></figure>



<p>LPCAMM2 exemplifies our ability to advance technologically while designing with sustainability in mind. It represents a significant step forward in the fight against planned obsolescence. By fighting for a modular, upgradeable memory solution for chips previously stuck in a soldered hellscape, manufacturers are demonstrating their commitment to creating devices that stand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s so much to gain here: from increasing device lifespan at schools and businesses, to reducing anxiety for consumers at the point of purchase, to enabling hassle-free repairs for devices that would otherwise be scrapped. As more companies rally behind this standard, we can look forward to a future where more laptops are built to last, and where repairs and upgrades aren’t only possible, but encouraged. There’s no question that the potential for this technology to make a tangible difference is real, and it’s right in front of us.</p>



<p><em>Full Disclosure: iFixit has prior business relationships with both Micron and Lenovo, and we are hopelessly biased in favor of repairable products.</em></p>

                 <div><span>CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA</span> Apple today announced M4, the latest chip delivering phenomenal performance to the all-new <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/" target="_blank">iPad Pro</a>. Built using second-generation 3-nanometer technology, M4 is a system on a chip (SoC) that advances the industry-leading power efficiency of Apple silicon and enables the incredibly thin design of iPad Pro. It also features an entirely new display engine to drive the stunning precision, color, and brightness of the breakthrough Ultra Retina XDR display on iPad Pro. A new CPU has up to 10 cores, while the new 10-core GPU builds on the next-generation GPU architecture introduced in M3, and brings Dynamic Caching, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, and hardware-accelerated mesh shading to iPad for the first time. M4 has Apple’s fastest Neural Engine ever, capable of up to 38 trillion operations per second, which is faster than the neural processing unit of any AI PC today. Combined with faster memory bandwidth, along with next-generation machine learning (ML) accelerators in the CPU, and a high-performance GPU, M4 makes the new iPad Pro an outrageously powerful device for artificial intelligence.
</div>
                 
             
                 <div>“The new iPad Pro with M4 is a great example of how building best-in-class custom silicon enables breakthrough products,” said Johny Srouji, Apple’s senior vice president of Hardware Technologies. “The power-efficient performance of M4, along with its new display engine, makes the thin design and game-changing display of iPad Pro possible, while fundamental improvements to the CPU, GPU, Neural Engine, and memory system make M4 extremely well suited for the latest applications leveraging AI. Altogether, this new chip makes iPad Pro the most powerful device of its kind.”

										<p>I’ve paid over $350,000 of rent in my life. That averages out to $2,500 a month since mid 2012. And, with near record interest rates and elevated home prices, I may end up paying another $350,000 in rent before I ever buy a house.</p>
<p>I am a part of what you might call the Forever Renter class. This is a cohort of people in their mid-20s to late-30s who are either <em>unwilling</em> or <em>unable</em> to buy a home under current market conditions. Unfortunately, those conditions aren’t moving in the right direction either. As <a href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-market-update-home-prices-costs-record-high/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfin recently reported</a>, “The median U.S. home-sale price hit a record $383,725 during the four weeks ending April 21, up 5.2% from a year earlier.”</p>
<p>But it’s not just the median U.S. home that is setting records. Homes in many high cost of living areas are near their highs as well. Last month <a href="https://www.zillow.com/research/million-dollar-cities-2024-33891/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow reported</a> that there are now a record 550 “Million-Dollar” cities in the United States. These are cities where the <em>typical</em> home price is greater than $1 million. While nearly half of these Million-Dollar cities are in California, the New York metropolitan area has the most with 106:</p>

<p>But rising home prices are just one factor impacting affordability. High interest rates are another.</p>
<p>The 30-Year mortgage rate peaked last October at 7.8% before dropping through year end. At the time, the worst of it seemed to be over. However, with inflation coming in hotter than expected this year, many believe that the Fed <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1785294648212390216" target="_blank">will no longer cut rates as planned</a> in 2024. As a result, mortgage rates have started creeping up yet again with the 30-Year near 7.2% today:</p>

Incomes haven’t risen in lockstep with housing prices and mortgage rates. For example, <a href="https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/hai-02-2024-housing-affordability-index-2024-04-12.pdf?_gl=1*15hok00*_gcl_au*NTEzNTgwMTMxLjE3MTQ0MTEzNTk." target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the National Association of Realtors</a>, the median family income increased by 18% from $85,806 to $100,876 between 2021 and February 2024.</p>
<p>However, over the same time period, the monthly mortgage payment required to purchase the median U.S. home doubled:</p>

<p>So while American families were getting an 18% raise, their prospective housing cost increased by 100%. Technically, the median sales price for new houses in the U.S. has dropped by 13% since their peak in late 2022:</p>

<p>However, this has done very little to affect affordability. Since rates are still so high, the American Dream remains out of reach for so many.</p>
<p>This is why the Forever Renter class exists. Though incomes have increased, housing costs have increased by far more. It’s gotten so bad that <a href="https://zillow.mediaroom.com/2024-02-29-Home-buyers-need-to-earn-47,000-more-than-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zillow estimated</a> that homebuyers need to earn nearly $50,000 more today than in 2020 to comfortably afford a home. And, in some cities in California, the amount of additional income needed exceeds $100,000!</p>
<p>But, this only addresses a portion of the Forever Renter class—those who are <em>unable</em> to buy a home. It ignores those who can afford to buy one, but choose not to. Because, even if you could buy a house in this market, should you?</p>
<h2>The Unwilling Buyers</h2>
<p>For those that have the means to purchase a home in the current housing market, they may still choose not to if renting is much cheaper. While the numbers vary by location, <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-you-rent-or-buy-a-house/">I ran an analysis a few weeks ago</a> that suggests that renting has the upper hand in many high cost cities.</p>
<p>For example, in a place like NYC, a Forever Renter could end up having to decide between paying $4,000 a month <em>to rent</em> or $7,000 a month <em>to buy</em> the same apartment. Even if they could afford such a high housing cost, would that be better than renting and investing the extra $3,000 a month into a diversified portfolio? My conservative estimate suggests not. For the time being, renting wins out.</p>
<p>This is where many in the <em>unwilling</em> Forever Renter class find themselves. They have good jobs. They make good money. But interest rates are also the highest they have been in two decades. As a result, if they want to borrow money to buy a house, they will pay for it dearly.</p>
<p>Given this, their best course of action may be to forego the mortgage market altogether and save up enough money to buy a house in cash. If that is too difficult, they could at least trying saving up a larger downpayment instead. Rather than putting the standard 20% down, maybe they put 50% down. Anything that helps them reduce the amount of money that they borrow at high rates would be a win.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they could use a “wait and see” approach as well. Maybe they start by saving for a larger downpayment, but if rates drop to a more suitable level sooner, then they pull the trigger and buy a house.</p>
<p>No matter how the future plays out, being flexible with your planning can go a long way in helping you make the right financial decision.&nbsp;And, in the event that the immediate future doesn’t play out in your favor, remember that “forever” isn’t as long as it seems.</p>
<h2>Forever Isn’t Forever</h2>
<p>&nbsp;As much as I want to go on about the woes of the Forever Renter class, they may not stay as Forever Renters for all too long. The problem with a lot of financial opinions (mine included) is that they can be far too short-sighted. We overindex on what’s happening right now and extrapolate that out into the future. But that’s almost never how the future actually turns out.</p>
<p>Just go back in time with me five years to May 2019. Imagine all the forecasts, price targets, and predictions that were made in that year. How many of them turned out to be right? None. Not a single one predicted what happened in the next year. And I wouldn’t expect them to.</p>
<p>The same thing will be true with regards to the U.S. housing market. Right now things look bleak. The vast majority of 20 and 30 somethings can’t afford a home today. But this doesn’t mean that they won’t be able to afford one later. Just look at what is happening in Austin, Texas as an example of what could be. Developers started building more homes and prices <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/larry-ellison-s-austin-snub-adds-to-city-s-housing-office-woes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have dropped by 18% since May 2022</a>. Increasing supply works. Go figure.</p>
<p>Of course, this won’t happen everywhere (for a host of reasons). But it illustrates how a difficult situation is unlikely to stay difficult indefinitely. Something’s got to give. A solution will present itself. Whether that solution is the one we want is another story entirely. In the meantime, here are some options that can help you during your “forever renter” period:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Earn more</strong>: If you feel like you will be forever priced out of the housing market, start finding ways to earn more. I know this won’t help in the short run, but <a href="https://ofdollarsanddata.com/paychecks-not-portfolios/">raising your income</a> is the best thing you can do to improve your financial situation in the long run. If you have both Saturday and Sunday off every single week, then there is no excuse to get started on <em>something</em> that can eventually increase your earnings.</li>
<li><strong>Consider other housing arrangements</strong>: Being more open with where you live and who you live with as you wait for market conditions to improve. Living with roommates, moving to a lower cost of living area, or downsizing can help reduce your living costs temporarily as you save up to buy your desired home.</li>
<li><strong>Be flexible</strong>: Buying a home will likely be the biggest financial decision of your life, so don’t rush into it. This is especially true in an unfavorable housing market. Be willing to adjust your timeline and keep saving until the right opportunity comes along. When things aren’t looking good, being flexible enough to wait out the storm has its advantages.</li>
</ul>
<p>While things don’t look great now, I am a firm believer that the housing market will become less daunting…eventually. Until then, happy investing and thank you for reading.</p>

Roundhouse Studios will be absorbed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> developer ZeniMax Online Studios. Microsoft, currently valued at over $3 trillion, did not say how many staff will lose their jobs, but significant layoffs are inevitable. IGN has asked Bethesda for comment. Microsoft declined to expand further when contacted by IGN.</p><p>On Redfall, the disastrous vampire co-op game will now not receive promised updates, including an offline mode and new character DLC, as Microsoft has ended all development on the game. Microsoft said Redfall will remain online to play, and it will provide a "make-good" offer for those who bought the Hero DLC.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Signup here <a href="https://t.co/wb1R4m4emj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/wb1R4m4emj</a> to receive details on how eligible players can receive this credit. <a href="https://t.co/69Os17kpQ8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/69Os17kpQ8</a></p>— Arkane Studios (@ArkaneStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkaneStudios/status/1787837804287860886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Arkane Lyon, which is working on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/blade-arkane">Marvel's Blade</a>, survives the cull, as does Bethesda Game Studios (Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Starfield), and Machine Games (<a href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a>). Doom developer id Software is also unaffected.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This reprioritization of titles and resources means a few teams will be realigned to others and that some of our colleagues will be leaving us.&nbsp;</p></div><p>In an email to staff sent by Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft blamed the cuts on a “reprioritization of titles and resources”. The email, verified by IGN, is below:</p><blockquote>Today I’m sharing changes we are making to our Bethesda and ZeniMax teams. These changes are grounded in prioritizing high-impact titles and further investing in Bethesda’s portfolio of blockbuster games and beloved worlds which you have nurtured over many decades. </blockquote><blockquote>To double down on these franchises and invest to build new ones requires us to look across the business to identify the opportunities that are best positioned for success. This reprioritization of titles and resources means a few teams will be realigned to others and that some of our colleagues will be leaving us.  </blockquote><blockquote>Here are the changes going into effect: </blockquote><blockquote>Arkane Austin – This studio will close with some members of the team joining other studios to work on projects across Bethesda. Arkane Austin has a history of making impactful and innovative games and it is a pedigree that everyone should be proud of. Redfall’s previous update will be its last as we end all development on the game. The game and its servers will remain online for players to enjoy and we will provide make-good offers to players who purchased the Hero DLC. </blockquote><blockquote>Alpha Dog Studios – This studio will also close. We appreciate the team’s creativity in bringing Doom to new players. Mighty Doom will be sunset on August 7 and we will be turning off the ability for players to make any purchases in the game.  </blockquote><blockquote>Tango Gameworks – Tango Gameworks will also close. We are thankful for their contributions to Bethesda and players around the world. Hi-Fi Rush will continue to be available to players on the platforms it is today.  </blockquote><blockquote>Roundhouse Games – The team at Roundhouse Games will be joining ZeniMax Online Studios (ZOS). Roundhouse has played a key role in many of our recent game launches and bringing them into ZOS to work on The Elder Scrolls Online will mean we can do even more to grow the world that millions of players call home.  </blockquote><blockquote>With this consolidation of our Bethesda studio teams, so that we can invest more deeply in our portfolio of games and new IP, a small number of roles across select Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will also be eliminated. </blockquote><blockquote>Those whose roles will be impacted will be notified today, and we ask that you please treat your departing colleagues with respect and compassion. We will provide our full support to those who are impacted in today’s notifications and through their transitions, including severance benefits informed by local laws.  </blockquote><blockquote>These changes are not a reflection of the creativity and skill of the talented individuals at these teams or the risks they took to try new things. I acknowledge that these changes are also disruptive to the various support teams across ZeniMax and Bethesda that bring our games to market. We are making these tough decisions to create capacity to increase investment in other parts of our portfolio and focus on our priority games. </blockquote><blockquote>Bethesda remains one of the key pillars of Xbox with a strong portfolio of amazing games and thriving communities. As we look to the future, there is an impressive line-up of games on the horizon. In 2024 alone we have Starfield Shattered Space, Fallout 76 Skyline Valley, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, and The Elder Scrolls Online’s Golden Road. As we align our plans and resources to best set ourselves up for success in this complex and changing industry, our teams across Arkane Lyon, Bethesda Game Studios, id Software, MachineGames, ZeniMax Online Studios and the Bethesda publishing and corporate teams will be well-positioned to build new IP, explore new game concepts, and expand on our existing franchises.  </blockquote><blockquote>- Matt</blockquote><p>Microsoft's announcement of the cuts at Bethesda come over three months after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">the company announced plans to cut 1,900 staff from its video game workforce</a>, and amid a boom time for Bethesda's Fallout series following the breakout hit Prime Video TV show.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>There are about a thousand real-estate developers in New York City. Nathan Berman is one of them, and he’s become rich doing it. But, he told me recently, “I never built a building from scratch, and never wanted to.” Instead, Berman, who is sixty-four, specializes in taking existing structures and converting them into apartments, a useful trick in a city that’s always starved for housing—and newly wary of the five-day-a-week office routine. In 2017, he converted 443 Greenwich Street, a former warehouse and book bindery in Tribeca, built in 1883, into a luxury condo; among the celebrities who now own apartments there are <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/notes-on-hollywood/is-harry-styles-a-movie-star">Harry Styles</a> and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jake-gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a>. (The building was designed to be “paparazzi-proof,” so it features an underground parking area with a valet.) It’s not much of a feat, though, to redo an industrial space that has a rudimentary interior. Berman is more excited by the transformation of huge, obsolete office towers into warrens of one- and two-bedroom apartments. He compares the effort to extract as much residential rental space as possible out of such buildings to solving a Rubik’s Cube.</p><p>Since 1997, Berman, through his firm, Metro Loft Management, has turned eight Manhattan office towers into rental-apartment complexes, adding some five thousand units to the city’s housing stock. His company has just signed a contract for the largest conversion yet in the United States: Pfizer’s former headquarters, on East Forty-second Street, will be refashioned to house about fifteen hundred apartments. Berman has no patience for nostalgia. “You’re tearing down something that simply doesn’t work anymore,” he explained. Although Metro Loft has offices at 40 Wall Street, Berman often works at home himself, on the Upper East Side. He happily spends hours poring over blueprints, dividing former fields of cubicles into small but clever residences and reconceiving onetime copy-machine nooks as mini laundry rooms or skinny kitchens. All his apartments are market-rate properties, so what he creates is élite but ordinary, luxurious but cramped, permanent but marginal. Avinash Malhotra, an architect who has done several conversions with Berman, noted that a single office tower can be carved up into hundreds of little units, as in a hotel. “He is not making housing for the homeless,” Malhotra said. “But I often joke among my employees that what we do is slums for the rich.”</p><p>One day in December, I went to the financial district and joined Berman in the stark white lobby of 55 Broad Street, a thirty-story former office tower that was built in 1967 by Emery Roth &amp; Sons. Berman has started converting it into five hundred and seventy-one apartments, many of them studios aimed at professionals just out of college. Scaffolding surrounded the bottom of the tower, imprisoning a Starbucks by the entrance. Berman dresses to understated effect. He wore a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/lets-talk-about-the-clothes-on-succession">quiet-luxury</a> ensemble—unzipped Brunello Cucinelli vest, Loro Piana sweater, John Lobb shoes—and carried nothing in his hands but his phone.</p><p>He was overhauling 55 Broad Street under complicated conditions: it still had office tenants inside. The day we visited, five of the floors were still occupied by companies that had not yet left. (One, a property-management outfit called Solstice Residential Group, even sued to stay, but ultimately settled and moved nearby.) Every so often, an office worker rushed through the lobby, looking as lonely as a ghost. The entrance was renovated twenty years ago by the building’s original owners—the Rudin family, a New York real-estate powerhouse—and featured a revolving door, white marble walls, harsh Kubrickian lighting, and a long security credenza. Berman said that he would put in a hinged door, lower the lighting, cover the walls with wood panelling, add a fireplace and an inviting couch or two, and install wide stairs that flowed down to amenity rooms on the floor below. “Walking into the building will seem like walking into a lounge that people are hanging out in,” he told me. “And you just happen to be one of the people that lives here.”</p><p>Among white-collar workers, the <em>covid</em>-19 pandemic led to a profound shift: even when it became safe to return to the office, many employees preferred to <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-inquiry/can-remote-work-be-fixed">work remotely</a>. Nationwide, offices are only about fifty per cent full. Since 2019, according to a recent academic study, downtown street foot traffic has fallen by an average of twenty-six per cent in America’s fifty-two biggest cities. Urban theorists describe a phenomenon called the “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/23/what-happened-to-san-francisco-really">doom loop</a>”: once workers stop filling up downtown offices, the stores and restaurants that serve them close, which in turn makes the area even emptier. And who wants to work somewhere with no services? In St. Louis, whole swaths of the downtown business district are vacant. Not long ago, the A.T.&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;T. Tower, one of the city’s marquee properties, which was sold for two hundred and five million dollars in 2006, was off-loaded for $3.6 million.</p><p>In New York, the rebound has been stronger. On Wall Street, where numerous executives have expressed sharp impatience with remote work—David Solomon, the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, has called it an “aberration” that undercuts the company’s “collaborative apprenticeship culture”—foot traffic has returned to eighty per cent of its pre-pandemic level. But on Mondays and Fridays many Manhattan towers become as sparsely populated as an Edward Hopper painting. Some company accountants have started to see the rental of large office spaces—which in New York can cost more than three hundred dollars per square foot—as a colossal waste. In lower Manhattan, major renters such as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/spotify">Spotify</a> and Meta have begun shrinking their footprints, vacating entire floors that once bustled with employees. For the past three years, about twenty-two per cent of office space in New York has gone unrented—that’s a hundred million vacant square feet, the equivalent of nearly thirty-five Empire State Buildings. For the owners of half-empty towers, it’s become increasingly apparent that a new financial strategy is needed.</p><p>Berman has helped show desperate office-tower owners a way out. Although fewer people may want to work in Manhattan, more than enough still want to live there. The over-all vacancy rate for apartments in the city is now 1.4 per cent—the tightest market in fifty years. The reasons that the city’s work and residential fortunes have not moved in step are various. “There is only one New York,” Berman told me. “Culture, diversity, business, technology, medicine, education—all in one small island.” New York remains a place where many ambitious young people go to start their careers, if not to stay, and this demographic is ideal for the hotel-style conversions for which office towers are most suitable. Moreover, Berman said, “young people are social—they don’t want to sit in the middle of a forest on a Zoom call.”</p><p>Converting offices into apartments won’t be a panacea for New York’s real-estate titans: there is simply too much square footage that is going unused, and this will be a problem as long as companies continue switching to smaller premises. Berman told me, “If we ultimately absorb twenty per cent of the office space, that would be optimistic.” But, he added, conversions will energize neighborhoods that otherwise would be among the worst hit, like the financial district. There, Berman foresees apartments replacing half the empty offices.</p><p>The tower at 55 Broad Street has spent most of its existence as an unlovable building in an unlivable neighborhood. In the Art Deco era, the architectural firm founded by Emery Roth was an innovator—it designed the San Remo and the Beresford apartment buildings, on Central Park West—but by the late nineteen-sixties it was known for maximizing rentable office space above all else. At 55 Broad, which is right around the corner from the Stock Exchange, two adjoining ten-story structures came down to make way for a much taller new building. It was a time of rapid growth on Wall Street—between 1958 and 1973, the amount of office space downtown doubled. The design ethos was “do your own thing.” “This is not the Renaissance, or an age of uniform standards of beautiful buildings,” a member of the City Planning Commission <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/08/archives/innovative-design-and-planning-take-shape-in-lower-manhattan.html">explained to the <em>Times</em></a> in 1973. “No one agrees on anything.”</p><p>The result at 55 Broad was a dark curtain-wall tower with windows and brown panels spaced between thick steel pinstripes. Deep rectangular floors were set back every ten stories, creating a three-tiered wedding cake. Two renovations followed over the decades, but the building remained what it had always been: a dull stack of boxes.</p><p>Shortly after the Rudins built the tower, they attracted as its anchor tenant Goldman Sachs, which was then in a period of wild ascent. Four years after the building opened, a <em>Times</em> reporter dropped by Goldman and excitedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/11/archives/goldman-sachs-investment-banker-expands-into-new-markets.html">described</a> an “assemblage of young men with longish haircuts and bright colored shirts” on a trading floor that “rips with action.” Goldman was so successful that it eventually built its own building, two blocks south, leaving 55 Broad half empty. In 1985, Drexel Burnham Lambert, the firm that pioneered the junk bond, moved in. Within five years, it had fallen under indictment and gone bankrupt, forcing the Rudins to scramble again. The family spent millions to make 55 Broad into a state-of-the-art tech hub, borrowing strategies from “Being Digital,” by the nineties tech guru Nicholas Negroponte. Broadband was installed on every floor, and for a time the mid-century structure was “one of the most wired in the world,” according to <em>Forbes</em>. This incarnation lasted until the dot-com bust of 2000, when many of 55 Broad’s tenants went under or moved out. In the next decade, terabytes replaced gigabytes, and the number of servers that a cutting-edge tech firm needed could have taken up an entire warehouse. In 2014, plans were leaked for a proposed fifty-three-story replacement at 55 Broad, but it was never built. A lot of time and money is required to safely dismantle a thirty-story tower on a narrow, busy street.</p><p>Six years later, the pandemic hollowed out the city, particularly the business districts. By July, 2023, the Rudins had concluded that 55 Broad—then only sixty per cent rented—had no future as an office tower. They sold most of their interest in the building to Berman, keeping a small part so they could observe how he handled conversions. (Silverstein Properties, which rebuilt the World Trade Center, also became a partner in the project.) The decision to convert to residential was a hard one for the Rudins. “We don’t like selling our buildings,” Bill Rudin, one of the chairs of the family’s company, told me. “That’s kind of a mantra for us.” The opportunity to learn from Berman was a big factor: “We wanted to see the maestro, like a front-row seat to see Leonard Bernstein.”</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28880&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a28880" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“Let me read to you from a recently fictionalized version of the procedure&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by P. C. Vey</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The sale price for 55 Broad was $172.5 million. The construction loan was set at two hundred and twenty million dollars. The total cost of the project—nearly four hundred million dollars—was considerable, but replacing the office tower with a new building, Berman told me, would have cost “well over six hundred million.” (Upgrading it in the hope of attracting new office tenants, according to Berman, would have cost roughly eighty million dollars.) And, because of zoning reforms, no new building would be allowed to overwhelm a Manhattan street the way the hulking towers of the postwar period did. A developer who constructed a tower the same height as 55 Broad would likely have to sacrifice twenty per cent of the rentable space.</p><p>Early in the conversion process, Berman’s construction team removed the fluorescent-tube lighting and the dropped PVC ceilings. Then workers knocked down the drywall that had once delineated corner offices, windowless offices, rest rooms, mop closets. “We do a very thorough gut renovation,” Berman told me. “We literally take everything out.” At 55 Broad, the result was nearly four hundred thousand square feet of raw space, with a potential to generate more than thirty million dollars in rental income annually. But Berman still had a major puzzle to solve: If no one wanted to work in a glum, out-of-date building, why would anyone want to live there?</p><p>In the lobby at 55 Broad, Berman pressed the Up button. “This building is <em>way</em> over-elevatored,” he said. Soon, five elevators would be torn out. Apartment buildings, he explained, generally need fewer than half the elevators that office buildings do. “Residents don’t mind waiting twenty seconds more for the elevator,” he said.</p><p>A visit to the sixth floor offered a bleak sight—it was an empty, dark space half the size of a football field, interrupted only by steel support beams and rusted copper waste pipes. The floor was unsealed concrete, and transverse beams along the ceiling were coated with intumescent paint, a fire-resistant covering that looks like bubbling-hot marshmallow. When I stood at the center of the building, the windows were so far away that they looked almost like portholes.</p><p>Berman gave me a detailed tour of the thirteenth floor. In his business, a crucial metric for turning a profit is the time lag between borrowing construction money and renting out units. So he works fast. Just four months had passed since Berman, Silverstein, and Rudin had closed their deal, but the thirteenth floor already felt like part of a new apartment complex. Workers were measuring, drilling, staple-gunning. Metal track had been laid down where new walls would go, and a few drywall panels had already been installed—they were covered in a playful-looking purple glaze, to make them resistant to mold. “It’s a little bit more expensive,” Berman said. “But we don’t want any issues down the road.” On one piece of drywall, “Apt. 10” was scratched in pen. There was even a handsome tub in a bathroom without walls, like a guest who’d arrived too early for a party.</p><p>Renters are now used to the layouts of chain hotels, where there’s one window by the bed, so Berman’s bathrooms and kitchens didn’t need to be sunny, and the kitchens could have a minimal footprint. “Our demographic doesn’t cook,” he said. He referred to the other rooms without windows as “home offices.” Now that working from home was common, I observed, such spaces were likely to get a lot of use. He smiled, then said that many would wind up as bedrooms. This is technically forbidden, because in New York City every bedroom must have a window that can be opened, but it’s a widespread practice nonetheless. Berman laid out a rental scenario: “Imagine two or three Goldman Sachs associates who came to New York just after college and want a little bit more spending money.” (In real-estate ads, a one-bedroom with a windowless office is often called a “convertible two-bedroom.”)</p><p>Berman told me that he could repurpose any office building to residential if the sale price was right. But he acknowledged that 55 Broad posed special challenges. Until the mid-twenty-tens, office-tower conversions in Manhattan mostly involved prewar buildings. These had narrow, smaller floors that divided easily into apartments, and because they were built before air-conditioning they often had courtyards or ventilation shafts. You therefore didn’t have to create odd layouts to give bedrooms some sun. (Natural light tends to peter out about thirty feet into a building’s interior.) Prewar buildings were also full of setbacks, which could become private terraces, and they had oak-panelled elevators that felt homey. I had recently visited the first such building to undergo a major office-to-residence conversion in the financial district, 55 Liberty Street, which long served as the headquarters of Sinclair Oil Corporation. An architect named Joseph Pell Lombardi had converted the building in 1980. I checked out the apartment of one of the first purchasers, on the twenty-third floor. The view was magnificent in three directions, the vista broken only by the gargoyles that the original architect, Henry Ives Cobb, had mounted on the Gothic Revival façade. Looking down from one window, I saw the august Federal Reserve Bank, with its vaults full of gold bars. The view matched the fantasy we all have of living in New York. As the architect Robert&nbsp;A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;Stern told the <em>Times</em> in 1996, “Who doesn’t want to live in a skyscraper? Everybody in movies lives in apartments on the top of Manhattan.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But few towers like 55 Liberty remain available for conversion in the financial district. What are left are postwar structures—many with deep, dark interiors, low ceilings, and scant visual appeal. Berman did what he could to add comfort to such buildings while holding on to his wallet. He could repurpose extra elevator shafts as garbage chutes, for example. In one building, he turned elevator-shaft spaces into foyers for a line of apartments.</p><p>The double-height mechanical floor of 55 Broad, which once contained giant heating and cooling systems, would be turned into two floors of apartments. Residents would be provided with compact <em>HVAC</em> units under certain windows, as in a motel. These units required much less space than the old systems, and were far more energy-efficient. Berman noted that 55 Broad would be the first all-electric, emission-free apartment building in Manhattan. This was not only environmentally beneficial; it also saved him the cost of inserting thousands of feet of piping into concrete floors. It was but one example of how Berman’s monetary interest and the common good conveniently aligned. We looked out a window at an adjacent nondescript office building, and he saw prey. “That’s going to be that way for maybe three to five more years,” he predicted. “That building will be converted, too.”</p><p>Adaptive reuse is a form of recycling, a point that Berman often makes. According to a recent paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, converting an out-of-date office building into an apartment complex can increase its energy efficiency by as much as eighty per cent. (In a residential building, not everyone blasts the air-conditioning 24/7.) According to <a data-offer-url="https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion&quot;}" href="https://www.arup.com/news-and-events/study-estimates-carbon-savings-from-office-to-residential-conversion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report</a> by the Arup Group, an engineering firm, converting a Manhattan office tower releases, on average, less than half the carbon that building one from scratch does.</p><p>As expensive as these projects may seem, the cheaper cost of repurposing an old building can allow rental prices to be set lower than they would be in a new one. Berman estimated the minimum monthly rent for a studio apartment in a new lower-Manhattan building at well over four thousand dollars, whereas a comparable apartment in 55 Broad will go for about thirty-five hundred. Although this is a considerable sum for one person, it’s not especially expensive by Manhattan standards, and, as Berman acknowledged, many of his units will end up being shared.</p><p>He stressed to me that he is not particularly interested in what goes on inside the apartments, or in what the tenant experience is like. “A renter is <em>not</em> a condominium owner,” he told me several times. He isn’t trying to re-create 443&nbsp;Greenwich Street, his celebrity-friendly condo development, with its wine cellar and tiled hammam. “Our profile is a young person,” he said. “Maybe twenty-four, twenty-five, who stays one or two years, maybe three. They’re not committing.” His clients are in the city-hopping phase of life: “&nbsp;‘O.K., next year, the year is up and I’m going because I need to be in Boston, or I need to be in Chicago, or I’m going to San Francisco.’&nbsp;” Berman had considered improving 55&nbsp;Broad’s dated façade, but decided that it was money poorly spent. “Renters pay less attention to these things,” he said.</p><p>New York renters don’t have much choice, anyway. “We’ve never had this kind of imbalance between demand and supply before,” Berman said, with the pleasure of a person who likes his odds. The vacancy rate in the five or so buildings that he currently owns is about one and a half per cent. He estimated that all the units at 55 Broad would be rented within six months of going on the market.</p><p>A few of Berman’s redevelopment schemes have been more architecturally adventurous. In 2017, he worked with Avinash Malhotra to convert 180 Water Street, also in the financial district. The building, like 55 Broad, was a thick rectangular slab designed by Emery Roth &amp; Sons, and had interior spaces more than seventy feet long. Berman could have rented out these extra-long apartments as they were, but instead he decided to remove the core of the building, where mechanical equipment was taking up space, thereby creating a courtyard and cutting the apartment layouts down to normal length. Though such a restructuring had never been tried before, he took the risk, at a cost of several million dollars. The result gave tenants more light, he said, but that was incidental. New York City law permitted him to add the removed square footage to the top of the building—he gained four floors and a roof with a pool. “If I couldn’t have done that, I wouldn’t have had cost-efficient units,” he said.</p><p>The architects for 55 Broad are John Cetra and his spouse and professional partner, Nancy J. Ruddy. They are well respected in the industry, but they are not starchitects, a type that Berman has no time for. “A young-professional renter isn’t going to pay me more money because my building was designed by Norman Foster,” he told me. One day, Cetra and Ruddy met me at 55 Broad. Cetra described the back-and-forth that he and Berman have on their projects. (55 Broad is their sixth.) Berman sketches out a plan first, then passes it to Cetra. “He wants to make it more efficient,” Cetra said. “I want to make it a little better. ‘Nathan, let’s give this foyer a <em>bit</em> more room.’&nbsp;”</p><p>Whereas Berman focusses on the architect Cass Gilbert’s definition of the skyscraper as a “machine that makes the land pay,” Cetra and Ruddy emphasize pleasure. Cetra showed me his floor plan for 55 Broad: apartments curled around apartments like frolicsome seals. He explained that he and Ruddy always sought the “wow factor,” adding, “Ideally, in as many apartments as you can, when you open the door you see light and you walk toward light.” Shiny wood floors would have heightened this effect, but, Cetra noted a bit sheepishly, the floors at 55 Broad would be covered in something called “vinyl plank flooring.” Wood scuffs too easily in a building where people are constantly moving in and out, and, Cetra said, vinyl flooring was getting better. “They’re able to create patterns that don’t repeat,” he said.</p><p>Ruddy said that it was fun to fit apartment layouts into the constraints set by an office tower’s shape—each unit had “the intricacy of a watch.” She recounted a notable success for which they’d won an award. In 2014, while converting the former Flatotel, on Fifty-second Street, into condos, they had reconfigured an old loading dock—a concrete area where trucks parked and dumpsters were stored—into a new mid-block entrance. “We created this sort of magical lobby out of it,” Ruddy said. “I don’t think anyone had ever converted a loading dock before.”</p><p>Cetra jabbed at his floor plan for 55 Broad to amplify the point: “If this were a new building, every one-bedroom would be exactly the same. But look here. This is a one-bedroom, that’s a studio, that’s a one-bedroom studio, and every one has different proportions.” (A resident of 20 Broad Street, an earlier project that Cetra and Ruddy developed with Berman, complained to Bloomberg News last year about her studio: “It was a very awkward space. It wasn’t square, it wasn’t a rectangle, it had all kinds of bizarre edges and weird corners.”)</p><p>One feature would be standard at 55 Broad: a washer and dryer. “People do their laundry in their pajamas or their underwear while they’re watching television,” Ruddy explained. In the basement, public space that might otherwise be devoted to a large communal laundry room would be aimed at helping tenants meet one another. Small apartments make people want amenities, and amenities make people accept small apartments. The new generation expects post-college life to resemble college. “We’re in an amenities war,” Ruddy said. All the buildings converted in the financial district are full of co-working spaces, gyms, and plush couches.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>One of Cetra and Ruddy’s signature moves, they told me, is to adorn a public space with a modular shelving unit that contains small sculptures and ceramics that “feel like they could have been picked up on a trip overseas.” The architects also include a pile of art books—“Jazzlife,” “Helmut Newton: Work,” a book of Ai Weiwei’s installations. I objected that these seemed like the sorts of books people never actually read, but they disagreed. Tenants did pull them down. In fact, Cetra and Ruddy told me, the books at AVA DoBro, a new apartment building in downtown Brooklyn that they had designed, once disappeared entirely. “It turned out it was a construction worker who had grown up without books,” Ruddy said. “So I replaced them.”</p><p>“They’re good books,” Cetra added.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27105&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27105" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“For the last time—because it’s relaxing and romantic!”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Sofia Warren</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>We went to 55 Broad’s roof, where we stood in front of a long, empty concrete pit. Ruddy pulled out an iPad to show me a rendering of a future pool: eleven by forty-five feet, set off by a dozen deck chairs facing east and a tasteful border of shrubs to increase, as Ruddy said, “connectivity with nature.” There was what looked to me like a pool house but turned out to be “an indoor-outdoor working space.”</p><p>The 55 Broad tower is four hundred feet tall, but in the financial district that makes it midsize. I pointed out that remnant workers in the neighboring towers could easily peek out their office windows and observe whatever action was ripping on 55 Broad’s rooftop. Cetra said, “That’s part of the fun!”</p><p>In the late seventies, my father and mother, an Upper West Side couple, separated. My father, a corporate lawyer, had long worked at 77 Water Street, a steel-and-glass-curtain edifice, designed by Emery Roth, that still functions as an office building. A few years later, he moved into a nearby one-bedroom apartment, in one of the first converted office towers. It was a prewar building, and the impressive lobby made you feel as though you were heading for an appointment with Mr. Morgan. For my father, the short walk to work, after a professional lifetime of taking the 2 or 3 train up and down Manhattan’s spine, was a pleasure. The apartment had a kitchen he didn’t use, and it was on a high floor. On the nights I stayed with him, we would look out at neighboring towers’ brightly illuminated interiors, the cleaners slowly advancing through each floor, emptying the wastebaskets. He told me that he liked the feeling of being a lumberjack going to sleep in the middle of his forest.</p><p>Back then, there were no restaurants or stores open after business hours, not even a Blimpie. Joseph Pell Lombardi’s son, Michael, who grew up at 55 Liberty Street—the building next to the Federal Reserve—also remembers the streets being empty at night, with guards moving pallets of gold bars. “It all seemed incredibly casual,” Michael remembered. “There was no one around, only me, a kid, imagining how easy it would be just to take one of them.”</p><p>Census figures from 1970 show that just eight hundred and thirty-three people lived south of Chambers Street. By the time I began visiting my father’s place, there were more—but not many. “The jury is still out,” Henry Robbins, an expert on real-estate trends, told the <em>Times</em> in 1996, in an article about living in the financial district. “The area dies at night. It needs a neighborhood, a community.”</p><p>Thanks in part to Berman, the financial district now has enough population density to feel like a proper New York neighborhood. His office at 40 Wall Street is on the seventeenth floor, and he can see five of his converted towers out the window. Within just a few blocks of 55 Broad, he has turned 20 Exchange Place, 63 Wall Street, 67 Wall Street, 180&nbsp;Water Street, and 20 Broad Street into apartment buildings. He is currently working on 25 Water Street, the former headquarters of J. P. Morgan, which, after the Pfizer building, will be the second-largest conversion to date in the United States, with Cetra and Ruddy helping him design thirteen hundred units. <em>Crain’s New York Business</em> has called Berman “the king of FiDi.”</p><p>He enjoys his stature as a local potentate. He began his conversion business in the late nineties, after receiving an eighty-thousand-dollar loan from his father-in-law. For a time, Berman was an outlier as a developer, focussing on a market that others found too small or insufficiently profitable. Now he is turning away projects. David Marks, the executive at Silverstein Properties who is developing 55 Broad Street with Berman, said, “For many years—and I’m quoting Nathan—he was the quirky monster that no one really understood, and now he’s the prettiest girl on the dance floor and everyone wants a dance with him.” Berman can decide almost instantly—just by knowing the age and the location of a building and by glancing at Google Earth—if the place is ripe for conversion. “If the price per pound is right, I say, ‘Let’s go,’&nbsp;” he said.</p><p>Berman, who was born in Ukraine and came to New York at the age of fourteen, is the child of a Holocaust survivor, and the niche he occupies in the city’s real-estate ecology makes sense for an immigrant with a mistrust of government. He focusses only on buildings built before certain years—1977 below Murray Street, and 1961 for the rest of Manhattan—because they can be converted without special variances. (Conversions have long been restricted in Manhattan because sudden population surges in residential neighborhoods can crowd schools and overwhelm public transport.) “Life is short,” he told me. “I don’t want to wait two or three years for rezoning.” A current zoning-change proposal, which Mayor Eric Adams supports, would allow any building in New York built before 1990 to be converted. It would add to the pool of potential apartments nearly as much office space as there is in all of Philadelphia. Berman hopes that the zoning change will become law by the end of the year.</p><p>After we left 55 Broad, Berman took me on a tour of two of his other properties. We started down the street, at 20 Broad, once a part of the Stock Exchange. We briefly visited an apartment, but the showpiece was the sub-lobby level. There was a commercial-size gym replete with punching bags, elliptical trainers, free-weight racks, and rows of treadmills. Another room held pool tables, and a third was a library graced with one of Cetra and Ruddy’s modular shelving units. Nobody seemed older than thirty-five. Down the hall was a vault with heavy iron bars where bonds had once been stored. Rather than pull the huge structure out, Cetra and Ruddy had set up a co-working space in it. (“Tenants sometimes play poker there now.”) As we left, Berman took the massive door and swung it on its massive hinges, eager to show me that it still worked.</p><p>We walked down Beaver and Pearl Streets to 180 Water Street, the building from which Berman had removed the core. At the entrance, he said, “I will challenge you to show me any elements in this interior where you can point out and say, ‘Gee, that’s really from the office period.’&nbsp;” I couldn’t. He boasted that he’d never lost that bet. In the elevator, we met a young resident. She had a dog and said that she had been in the building for more than five years. Berman seemed disappointed.</p><p>On the twelfth floor, near another modular shelving unit, there was a bright-white machine labelled “Tulu: Your Smart Rental Store.” Using your phone, you could rent household items like a toaster or a vacuum cleaner, or buy something you’d run out of: tampons, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/substitutes-for-your-tide-pod-craving">Tide Pods,</a> Doritos. It was a clever way to both justify small closets—“Nathan believes in <em>very</em> compact closets,” Ruddy told me—and monetize how people live now. “These people want to snack at night,” Berman said.</p><p>Afterward, I walked out into the early FiDi night. I turned onto Exchange Place, where I passed crowds of tourists taking pictures of Kristen Visbal’s “Fearless Girl” statue. Various restaurants were filling up, from beer halls like Trinity Place to steak houses like the recently renovated Delmonico’s. Stone Street was now a sort of food court, and I could have picked up groceries at a Whole Foods just north of Exchange Place. (My father would have had to go to the Village to get groceries, if he’d wanted any.) The street life died out at Chambers Street, where government offices stood dark and empty. It was as if the original Dutch settlement had been re-created, back when Wall Street had a wall.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In a 2022 Glassdoor post, a user called McKinsey Consultant asked, “Should I live in FiDi?” The responses included a lot of cheering for the rooftop pools and the great views. But a user called IBM1 advised living somewhere else. “It’s such a soulless neighborhood,” IBM1 wrote. “Don’t be swayed by the ultra luxe buildings.” It’s true that FiDi remains on the sterile side. It could use some parks, and its inhabitants seem either new to the island or temporary. All those amenities in the buildings keep people within their confines; if you have a Tulu dispensing machine in your basement, who needs to drop by a local hardware store or a pharmacy?</p><p>All the same, more than thirty thousand people now live in FiDi—and at least some of them have begun to see it as a permanent home. Berman told me that, whereas more than half of his renters used to be apartment sharers, he expected the percentage at 55 Broad Street to be closer to fifteen. This suggested to him that families were moving in. He added that he recently ripped out a Ping-Pong room at 180 Water and turned it into a children’s play space. “We have sixty children in the building!” he said, amazed. One was his grandson. His son, who is the No. 2 at the firm, and his daughter-in-law moved in five years ago. “They never left,” Berman said.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <p><span><strong>UNSW Sydney engineers have utilised sound waves to cut the time it takes to make a cold brew coffee from many hours down to mere minutes.</strong></span></p>
<p>Fans of cold brew coffee often rave about the smoother, less acidic and less bitter taste compared to a regular hot brew.</p>
<p>There’s just one major problem – it takes anywhere from 12 to 24 hours to fully steep the grounds and allow the flavours to slowly be extracted using only cold water.</p>
<p>That’s far from ideal if you want or need your caffeine fix in a hurry in the morning.</p>
<p>However, engineers from UNSW have now developed a new way to make cold brew coffee in under three minutes – just like a regular hot brew – without sacrificing on the taste experience.</p>
<p>The process involves using an ultrasonic reactor to speed up the brew of the grounded coffee beans, with the research published in <a><i></i></a><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417724001330" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Ultrasonics Sonochemistry" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Ultrasonics Sonochemistry">Ultrasonics Sonochemistry</a>.</p>

<p>Addressing the challenge of speeding up the brewing process of a cold brew, the UNSW team led by <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/francisco-trujillo" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Dr Francisco Trujillo" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Dr Francisco Trujillo">Dr Francisco Trujillo</a>, used an existing model of a Breville espresso machine and superimposed their own patented sound transmission system.</p>
<p>The system connects a bolt-clamped transducer with the brewing basket via a metallic horn – transforming a standard espresso filter basket into a powerful ultrasonic reactor.</p>
<p>The reactor works by injecting sound waves at a frequency of 38.8 kHz at multiple points through its walls – generating multiple regions for acoustic cavitation within the reactor.</p>

    <p>The study also found that this setup can double the extraction yield and caffeine concentration compared to unsonicated samples.</p>
<p>Dr Trujillo, corresponding author of the paper and UNSW food processing engineer in the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/chemical-engineering" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_School of Chemical Engineering" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="School of Chemical Engineering">School of Chemical Engineering</a>, says the ultrasound process speeds up the extraction of the oils, flavours and aroma of the ground coffee.</p>
<p>“Ultrasounds accelerate the extraction process due to acoustic cavitation,” he says.</p>
<p>“When acoustic bubbles collapse near the grounded coffee, they generate micro-jets with enough force to pit and fracture the coffee grounds – intensifying the extraction of the aroma and flavours of the brew.</p>
<p>“And the acceleration is enormous – we are reducing what would typically take 12 to 24 hours to less than three&nbsp; minutes.”</p>

    <p>Dr. Trujillo says the aim was to make the process as easy as making a regular espresso coffee.</p>
<p>“We’re able to demonstrate that this can be adapted to existing espresso machine,” he says.</p>
<p>“We are very excited about developing this technology that can be used by companies that already manufacture coffee machines, so consumers can enjoy an ultrasonic cold brew at home in less than three minutes.</p>
<p>“Very importantly, this breakthrough opens the door for coffee shops and restaurants to produce on-demand brews comparable to 24-hour cold brews, supplying the rising demand while eliminating the need for large semi-industrial brewing units and the associated requirement for extensive refrigeration space.”</p>

    <h2><strong>Same taste in less time</strong><br>
</h2>
<p>Collaborating with researchers from University of Queensland, samples of coffee were sent to the <a href="https://qaafi.uq.edu.au/" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food">Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food</a> (QAAFI) where they underwent a thorough sensory analysis.</p>
<p>The samples included cold brew sonicated at room temperature for one minute, the second was sonicated for 3 minutes, and the third was a regular 24 hours stepped brew at four degrees Celsius without sonication.</p>
<p>They were evaluated on their aroma, texture, flavour, and aftertaste attributes.</p>
<p>“Compared to the 24-hour brew, the sonicated one-minute brew sample received similar ratings, especially in flavour, aftertaste attributes including bitterness, sourness, fullness texture and aroma,” says Dr. Trujillo.</p>
<p>“However, it scored lower in aroma intensity and dark chocolate aroma. This suggests that the sonicated 1-minute sample is slightly under-extracted compared to the 24-hour cold brew.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, the sonicated three-minute sample provided a similar dark chocolate aroma and aroma intensity to the 24-hour cold brew, but slightly more bitter.</p>
<p>“The results of the sensory study showed that a sonication time between one and three minutes is ideal for creating a coffee comparable with 24-hour cold brew coffee, depending on the interest of customers.”</p>
<p>University of Queensland Sensory Scientist and Flavour Chemist <a href="https://qaafi.uq.edu.au/profile/33/heather-smyth" target="_blank" data-click_category="TextComponentRichText" data-click_id="text_Professor Heather Smyth" data-click_title="RichText" data-click_name="Professor Heather Smyth">Professor Heather Smyth</a>, a co-author of the paper, said the new method created a coffee as good as cold brew steeped overnight.</p>
<p>“Our trained sensory panel tastings proved that we can get a very similar taste profile to either a traditional cold brew or an espresso in the time it takes to brew a hot espresso,” Prof. Smyth said.</p>
<p>“Further work could explore different types of beans, different regions of beans and for companies or cafes that specialise in single origin or high-quality beans, this would be another string to the bow to show yet another dimension of coffee.</p>
<p>“Once again, Australia has new technology at our fingertips that moves on from traditional methods to modern methods of coffee making to give consumers a new premium experience.”</p>
<h2><strong>Shaking up the beverage industry</strong></h2>
<p>Ultrasounds can be applied to several areas across the food industry including drying, extraction, emulsification and crystallisation – making the process faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>Dr. Trujillo says this technology can be also used to speed up the brewing process of teas as well.</p>
<p>“With this technology, we’re offering coffee shops, restaurants and even home coffee-brewers the chance to produce on-demand brews, eliminating the need for large brewing and refrigeration units.”</p>

<p><em>pyspread</em> is free software. It is released under the GPL v3 licence.</p>

<p>The latest release is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyspread/" target="blank">pyspread v2.2.3</a> (<a href="https://gitlab.com/pyspread/pyspread" target="blank">source code</a>). It requires Python 3.6+.</p>

<p>The last (outdated) release that is compatible with Python 2.x is pyspread v1.1.3.</p>

<h2 id="target-user-group">Target User Group</h2>

<p>Directly using Python code in a grid is a core feature of <em>pyspread</em>. The target user group has
experience with or wants to learn the programming language Python:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clara is a research engineer. She systematically compares results of different parameter sets.
She is proficient with Python and has used it for her scientific analyses. Clara wants a quick initial overview
of how changing specific parameters affects her results. With <em>pyspread</em>, Clara is displaying each result in one cell.
This allows her to quickly figure out, which parameters she is going to focus on next.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Peter is using spreadsheets to prepare business decisions. 
He separates data from code by keeping his business data in CSV files and accessing these files from <em>pyspread</em>. 
Furthermore, Peter is worried about algorithmic errors and calculation inaccuracies is his complicated tables. 
He is importing the <em>Money</em> datatype from <a href="https://github.com/py-moneyed/py-moneyed" target="blank">py-moneyed</a>
in the Macro panel. The dedicated Money class helps him avoiding floating point errors. 
Peter has implemented his analysis tools together with unit tests in a separate Python module, 
which he is importing as well. Therefore, he is worrying less about wrong results 
that may lead to bad business decisions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not part of the target user group are Donna and Jack:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Donna is looking for a free replacement for Ms. Excel. She does not know any programming language, and she has no time to learn Python.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jack does computation intensive data analysis. He is looking for a spreadsheet that can parallelize calculations - ideally out of the box as a cluster or a cloud solution.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This does not mean that Donna or Jack cannot work with <em>pyspread</em>. However, Donna might find the learning
curve for using Python code in cells too steep. Jack on the other hand might be disappointed because he has to 
ensure manually that his long running tasks are not locking up pyspread.</p>

<p>Researchers have devised an attack against nearly all virtual private network applications that forces them to send and receive some or all traffic outside of the encrypted tunnel designed to protect it from snooping or tampering.</p>
<p>TunnelVision, as the researchers have named their attack, largely negates the entire purpose and selling point of VPNs, which is to encapsulate incoming and outgoing Internet traffic in an encrypted tunnel and to cloak the user’s IP address. The researchers believe it affects all VPN applications when they’re connected to a hostile network and that there are no ways to prevent such attacks except when the user's VPN runs on Linux or Android. They also said their attack technique may have been possible since 2002 and may already have been discovered and used in the wild since then.</p>
<h2>Reading, dropping, or modifying VPN traffic</h2>
<p>The effect of TunnelVision is “the victim's traffic is now decloaked and being routed through the attacker directly,” a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU">video demonstration</a> explained. “The attacker can read, drop or modify the leaked traffic and the victim maintains their connection to both the VPN and the Internet.”</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ajsLmZia6UU?si=kroidLuk1JIYZpl_?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>TunnelVision - CVE-2024-3661 - Decloaking Full and Split Tunnel VPNs - Leviathan Security Group.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The attack works by manipulating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP server</a> that allocates IP addresses to devices trying to connect to the local network. A setting known as <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3442">option 121</a>&nbsp;allows the DHCP server to override default routing rules that send VPN traffic through a local IP address that initiates the encrypted tunnel. By using option 121 to route VPN traffic through the DHCP server, the attack diverts the data to the DHCP server itself. Researchers from Leviathan Security explained:</p>                                            
                                                        
<blockquote><p>Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway. When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it.</p>
<p>We use DHCP option 121 to set a route on the VPN user’s routing table. The route we set is arbitrary and we can also set multiple routes if needed. By pushing routes that are more specific than a /0 CIDR range that most VPNs use, we can make routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual interface the VPN creates. We can set multiple /1 routes to recreate the 0.0.0.0/0 all traffic rule set by most VPNs.</p>
<p>Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface. This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server.</p>

<p>We now have traffic being transmitted outside the VPN’s encrypted tunnel. This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server. We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attack can most effectively be carried out by a person who has administrative control over the network the target is connecting to. In that scenario, the attacker configures the DHCP server to use option 121. It’s also possible for people who can connect to the network as an unprivileged user to perform the attack by setting up their own rogue DHCP server.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The attack allows some or all traffic to be routed through the unencrypted tunnel. In either case, the VPN application will report that all data is being sent through the protected connection. Any traffic that’s diverted away from this tunnel will not be encrypted by the VPN and the Internet IP address viewable by the remote user will belong to the network the VPN user is connected to, rather than one designated by the VPN app.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Android is the only operating system that fully immunizes VPN apps from the attack because it doesn't implement option 121. For all other OSes, there are no complete fixes. When apps run on Linux there’s a setting that minimizes the effects, but even then TunnelVision can be used to exploit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side channel</a> that can be used to de-anonymize destination traffic and perform targeted denial-of-service attacks. Network firewalls can also be configured to deny inbound and outbound traffic to and from the physical interface. This remedy is problematic for two reasons: (1) a VPN user connecting to an untrusted network has no ability to control the firewall and (2) it opens the same side channel present with the Linux mitigation.</p>
<p>The most effective fixes are to run the VPN inside of a virtual machine whose network adapter isn’t in bridged mode or to connect the VPN to the Internet through the Wi-Fi network of a cellular device. The research, from Leviathan Security researchers Lizzie Moratti and Dani Cronce, is available <a href="https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/tunnelvision">here</a>.</p>

<!-- cache miss 51:single/related:d03e7bdb9fb55c2913b9e234b80a5a0d --><!-- empty -->
<p>Google is killing off the Google Fit APIs. The platform originally existed to sync health data from third-party fitness devices to your Google account, but now it's <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/evolving-health-on-android-migrating-from-google-fit-apis-to-android-health.html">being killed off</a>. Deprecation of the APIs happened on May 1, and Google has stopped accepting new sign-ups for the API. The official shutdown date is June 30, 2025.</p>
<p>The Google Fit API was launched <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/google-previews-google-fit-apis-for-sharing-fitness-logging-info/">in 2014</a>, just a few weeks after Apple announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/06/apple-announces-ios-8-at-wwdc/">Healthkit</a> in iOS 8. The goal of both platforms is to be a central repository for health data from various apps and services. Instead of seeing steps in one app and weight in another, it could all be mushed together into a one-stop-shop for health metrics. Google had a lot of big-name partners at launch, like Nike+, Adidas, Withings, Asus, HTC, Intel, LG, and app makers like Runtastic and RunKeeper.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2024, and we get the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">familiar story</a> of Google being unable to throw its weight behind a single solution. Today, Google has <em>three</em> competing fitness APIs. There is a "<a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/comparison-guide">Comparison Guide</a>" on the Android Developer site detailing the differences between the "Health Connect" API, the "Fitbit Web API" and the "Google Fit REST API."</p>
<p>Besides killing off the API, Google Fit in general seems like a dead product. Google's deal to acquire Fitbit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/google-closes-the-fitbit-acquisition-pledges-to-not-use-data-for-ads/">closed in 2021</a>, making Fitbit the shiny new fitness brand and bringing with it fitness API No. 2. New Google products like the Pixel Watch and Pixel phones come with the Fitbit app as the built-in fitness solution instead of Google Fit, and the Google Fit app hasn't seen a significant upgrade in a while.</p>
<figure><img alt="Google's Fit API shutdown timeline. " src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fit-timeline.png" width="960" height="192"><figcaption><p>Google's Fit API shutdown timeline. </p><p>Google</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's new fitness API, Health Connect, has had a "beta" app on the Play Store since 2022 that only works with Android 13, and in Android 14, Health Connect became baked into the OS as an open source framework for storing health data. That Android 14 launch was only seven months ago, and with Android's slow update schedule and even slower developer feature adoption, it's hard to say too much about Health Connect. Google notes that the Play Store version of Health Connect and the Android 14 version of Health Connect are not the same thing (!), and an automatic <a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/migrate-from-android-13-to-14">"migration" pop-up screen</a> and <em>device reboot</em> is needed to move to the Android 14 version. Google hasn't said anything about compatibility with versions of Android older than Android 14 (or 13?), so even in 2025, Android's slow update speed means this is going to be an API with low device support.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>One change pointed out by Google's comparison guide is that while the Fitbit API syncs health data to your Fitbit account (Fitbit accounts are also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/google-will-start-assimilating-fitbit-accounts-next-year/">being shut down</a> in 2025), and the Google Fit API syncs health data to your Google account, Health Connect doesn't sync to any cloud provider. The documentation around Health Connect never talks about the cloud at all. From a platform perspective, not having cloud sync makes Health Connect more of a neutral, not-Google-affiliated standard for health data storage. Google also pitches the lack of cloud storage as a privacy feature. And just like how Google and Samsung <a href="https://youtu.be/d14GVcnbTeo?t=263">teamed up</a> for Wear OS (I assume this was a related project) Samsung has agreed to give up on the "<a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-services/health-platform">Health Platform API</a>" and is a <a href="https://developer.samsung.com/health/health-connect-faq.html">launch partner</a> for Health Connect.</p>
<p>From a user perspective, with no cloud syncing, what happens to my health data if I switch devices or if my phone breaks? Can I ever easily look at my health data in a more capable tablet or web app, or will that not work? For now, all talk of "sharing" is limited to local apps or devices that directly sync to your phone, like a smartwatch. The Fitbit app can show third-party <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-february-2024/">Health Connect</a> data right now, but it's unclear if it will sync third-party data to the cloud. Google notes that "Our Android Health API offerings have moved to an on-device model, so there will not be an alternative to the Fit REST API." (A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST">REST API</a>, by definition, is over the Internet.)</p>
<p>The company's <a href="https://developer.android.com/health-and-fitness/guides/health-connect/migrate/migration-guide">migration guide</a> notes that the Google Fit and Health Connect APIs aren't compatible, and for now Google recommends supporting both while users and manufacturers transition from one API to the other. The guide also flatly says, "We don't recommend migrating to Health Connect if you're an existing Google Fitbit Web API developer," and then offers no alternative, so it sounds like the goal is siloed on-device data only, and any devices that use the web APIs will stop syncing in 2025.</p>
<p>By the way, despite being the same age, Apple's Healthkit ecosystem<em> isn't</em> being shut down and will continue running. While Google starts over, Healthkit will continue growing its ecosystem and its already significant lead, and Apple will continue to build user and developer trust.</p>

I, as a user online, spend my time on many sites. As such, when I come to your site, I am already used to the way the other sites work, and I don’t want to learn new paradigms. <a href="https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1786557956617601486">Some also call these preconceived notions</a> user mental models or affordances.</p><p>I like to call it the user-site contract.</p><p>For years, we have been conditioned to navigate sites along several axes as content consumers: along search and recommendations, and along ecommerce and social.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/vibespace1.png" width="400"></figure><p>Each of these four quadrants has their particular nuances, but we primarily understand what each is for.</p><p>On ecommerce search, we are conditioned to enter keywords stripped of context like monosyllabic cavepeople until we get what we want: “adidas sneakers white size 6 small.” Here, we are squarely in the goal space, and we are conducting mostly keyword search.</p><p>When we go to Twitter/Bluesky/Instagram/Discord/<a href="https://twitter.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1591990980387147777">OpenTwang</a> and we are served channel or post or image recommendations, we recognize that we are in the vibe space and can only influence these through our explicit and implicit behavior on a given site, which goes to some <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/">great matrix factorization in the sky</a> and pulls out recommended items into a stream, or a timeline, or a carousel. We do this all publicly with the expectation that all our data is harvested and reintegrated into <a href="https://github.com/igorbrigadir/awesome-twitter-algo">The Algorithm</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/flutter.png" width="400"></figure><p>On social-type searches like Google, results are mixed because we perform hybrid search, a combination of <a href="https://opensearch.org/blog/semantic-search-solutions/">keyword and semantic search</a> that moves us closer to the vibe space: sometimes we want to search for “what minivan to buy”, sometimes “restaurants with mexican food and good music near me”, sometimes “tell me more about transformer models.”</p><p>On ecommerce recommendations, we are presented with items based on our browsing history, such as in our Instagram reels feeds, but we have no control over what those items are, other than we spent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwell_time">10 seconds dwelling</a> on a <a href="https://creators.instagram.com/blog/instagram-recommendations-eligibility-tips-creators?locale=en_US">video of people drinking Chianti</a> and get an ad for tickets to Rome.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/vibespace2.png" width="400"></figure><p>For a long time, these four quadrants have been pretty distinct, because search and recommendations, while they occupy opposite ends of the same spectrum conceptually, have different tooling and architectures, and machine learning goals. You can even tell the way org structure of companies who hire for the teams have developed: usually there are distinct search and recommendations teams.</p><p>What happens in today’s world, when we have LLMs? We now have the collision of three different sets of user expectations.</p><ol><li><p>First, we expect all LLM experiences to be like ChatGPT, because ChatGPT was the first LLM product to truly hit the market in a customer-facing way, and all products are in some way modeled on it. This cascades down even to the API, where many backend API products (VLLM, Ray, Llamafile), even if they don’t use the OpenAI API, are compliant with it; both the UX and dev-ex have become industry standard. The ChatGPT user experience is an open textbox that will allow you to get an answer about anything in freeform. We expect to be able to interact with this in natural language.</p></li><li><p>Second, we have our old expectation that <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2024/04/25/how-i-search-in-2024/">search boxes are open-ended</a>, but bounded by how we search: by keyword or short phrases, and that we will iterate on those short phrases to get what we need.</p></li><li><p>Third, we have our expectation that unclear results or results generated from semantic similarity or work in the latent space will be served to us as recommendations and tagged as such.</p></li></ol><p>All of these are a clash of expectations that now need to be managed carefully, especially because, as I found in <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2024/01/05/retro-on-viberary/">building semantic search products</a>, it’s hard to guide customer intent in an open-ended solution space (i.e. what does it mean to search for a “vibe?”)</p><p>What then to make of Meta’s latest decision to put Llama3, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2024/04/meta-ai-assistant-built-with-llama-3/">a generative open-ended autoregressive model that can generate open-ended content</a>, into every search bar in all of their platform properties?</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/llamabar.png" width="400"></figure><p>These are four very hard design principles to square, because now, with open-ended models, we end up migrating all our use-cases to the center space.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/vibespace3.png" width="400"></figure><p>Even when we open up Instagram search to perform a directed search, we’re greeted with The AI Box, which asks us to learn about K-pop.</p><figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veekaybee/veekaybee.github.io/main/static/images/llamabar2.png" width="400"></figure><p>But I don’t want to ask Meta AI about the best history podcasts or ask about k-pop, I want to find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBMLHFSZlEg">video of the trained raven I saw a couple weeks ago.</a> I want to perform social keyword search.

Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/unsexy-future-generative-ai-enterprise-apps/">this is already happening to some extent in the enterprise space</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/07/apple_fingerprinting_rules/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/07/apple_fingerprinting_rules/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40281588">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Last week, Apple began requiring iOS developers justify the use of a specific set of APIs that could be used for device fingerprinting. Yet the iGiant doesn't appear to be making much effort to ensure that Google, Meta, and Spotify comply with the rules, it's claimed.</p>
<p>Device fingerprinting involves collecting information about various device settings and components, then combining those into a single identifier that's likely to be unique and thus useful for targeting people with ads and other stuff tailored to their individual interests and circumstances.</p>
<p>There are other forms of fingerprinting involving browser settings, the HTML Canvas element, WebGL, fonts, and so on, some of which have legitimate commercial applications, such as bot detection. But digital fingerprinting can also be used to violate privacy and track people online.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We found out that apps such as Google Chrome, Instagram, Spotify, and Threads don’t adhere to their declared reasons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While Apple allows user tracking if permission has been granted, it mostly <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10060/?time=457">forbids</a> device-level fingerprinting on iOS, at least in theory. It made that policy official in a recent <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/support/third-party-SDK-requirements/">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>As such the iBiz now requires app developers to supply among other things reasons for using any of its designated "required reason APIs" that can be used for device fingerprinting.</p>

    

<p>Crucially, data collected from these interfaces, which could be used for fingerprinting, must stay on the user's device to maximize privacy.</p>

        


        

<p>The iPhone maker explains as much in its developer documentation. "Some APIs that your app uses to deliver its core functionality — in code you write or included in a third-party SDK — have the potential of being misused to access device signals to try to identify the device or user, also known as fingerprinting," the Apple's developer website <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api">states</a>. "Regardless of whether a user gives your app permission to track, fingerprinting is not allowed."</p>
<p>Examples of these fingerprint-friendly APIs include: File timestamp APIs, System boot time APIs, Disk space APIs, Active keyboard APIs, and User defaults APIs.</p>

        

<p>As of May 1, 2024, apps that fail to include reasons for using these APIs in their privacy manifest file won't be accepted in the iOS App Store. Previously, Apple just sent non-compliant developers an email warning.</p>
<p>According to developers Talal Haj Bakry and Tommy Mysk, several major app makers are simply ignoring Apple's requirements, and using tracker-happy APIs without sticking to the rules. Big Tech players like Google, Meta, and Spotify - the duo claim - are providing reasons for this API usage, collecting that data, and then not abiding by the requirement to keep that information on the device.</p>
<p>In other words, Google, Meta, and Spotify are all collecting at least some info from these APIs and then sending that data off-device against Apple's rules, we're told.</p>

        

<p>"To prevent misuse of these APIs, Apple will reject apps that don’t describe their use of the APIs in their privacy manifest file," the pair explain in an <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mysk.blog/2024/05/03/apple-required-reason-api/">advisory</a>. "However, we found out that apps such as Google Chrome, Instagram, Spotify, and Threads don’t adhere to their declared reasons."</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/29/apple_developer_api/">Apple demands app makers explain use of sensitive APIs</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/06/link_tracking_privacy/">Online tracking is alive and well in link decoration</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/04/08/apple_ios_privacy/">Apple iOS privacy clampdown 'did little' to reduce tracking</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/30/apple_google_privacy/">What do iOS and Android have in common? Their apps suck at privacy, boffins say</a></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The Register</em> asked Google, Meta, and Spotify whether they are in fact using these "required reason APIs" for iOS device fingerprinting and beaming that data off to backend servers, and we've not heard back from the last two. A Google spokesperson confirmed it is looking into the report, but didn't immediately have a response.</p>
<p>"It's hard to tell if the apps are using the information for fingerprinting or not," said Mysk in a message to <em>The Register</em>. "But Apple already classified a set of APIs that can potentially be used for fingerprinting. Apps accessing such APIs must declare the reasons why they need such access."</p>
<p>Apple has published a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api">list of valid reasons</a> for using certain APIs that reveal information useful for fingerprinting. For example, iOS provides an API called <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/processinfo/1414553-systemuptime">systemUptime</a> that can be queried to provide the time elapsed since the device was last restarted.</p>
<p>Developers who want to use this API can select from several allowed reasons, one which must be declared in a manifest file. Google for example has chosen 35F9.1, with italics added by us for emphasis:</p>

<p>Although Apple's rule plainly states that uptime data cannot be sent off-device, Google Chrome appears to be doing just that, based on network data analysis from Bakry and Mysk. The rule does allow for an exception, but one that doesn't apply to Chrome.</p>
<p>"No, this exception is about using the system uptime on-device locally to order events for example," Mysk told <em>The Register</em>, explaining that Google has the option to transmit relative time intervals between two events but not the absolute device uptime number.</p>
<p>Mysk argues that Apple's "required reason APIs," like its Privacy Nutrition Labels, amount to privacy theater because there appears to be no enforcement.</p>
<p>"Just like the Privacy Nutrition Labels, developers are free to enter what they please," said Mysk.</p>
<p>"Apple doesn't seem to review if the description is accurate or not. While the nutrition labels are visible to the users, the required reason API isn't. So, it is not clear how that is going to prevent fingerprinting and enhance user privacy if Apple doesn't check the reasons developers submit."</p>
<p>Cupertino did not respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

    </div><p>Ever wonder what happens when you fall into a black hole? Now, thanks to a new, immersive visualization produced on a NASA supercomputer, viewers can plunge into the event horizon, a black hole's point of no return.</p>


										      
																																	<p>"People often ask about this, and simulating these difficult-to-imagine processes helps me connect the mathematics of relativity to actual consequences in the real universe," said Jeremy Schnittman, an astrophysicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who created the visualizations. "So I simulated two different scenarios, one where a camera—a stand-in for a daring astronaut—just misses the event horizon and slingshots back out, and one where it crosses the boundary, sealing its fate."</p>
<p>The visualizations are available in multiple forms. Explainer videos act as sightseeing guides, illuminating the bizarre effects of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Versions rendered as 360-degree videos let viewers look all around during the trip, while others play as flat all-sky maps.</p>
<p>To create the visualizations, Schnittman teamed up with fellow Goddard scientist Brian Powell and used the Discover supercomputer at the NASA Center for Climate Simulation. The project generated about 10 terabytes of data—equivalent to roughly half of the estimated text content in the Library of Congress—and took about 5 days running on just 0.3% of Discover's 129,000 processors. The same feat would take more than a decade on a typical laptop.</p>
<p>The destination is a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/supermassive+black+hole/" rel="tag">supermassive black hole</a> with 4.3 million times the mass of our sun, equivalent to the monster located at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.</p>

</figure><p>"If you have the choice, you want to fall into a supermassive black hole," Schnittman explained. "Stellar-mass black holes, which contain up to about 30 <a href="https://phys.org/tags/solar+masses/" rel="tag">solar masses</a>, possess much smaller event horizons and stronger tidal forces, which can rip apart approaching objects before they get to the horizon."</p>

																																						
																																			<p>This occurs because the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+pull/" rel="tag">gravitational pull</a> on the end of an object nearer the black hole is much stronger than that on the other end. Infalling objects stretch out like noodles, a process astrophysicists call spaghettification.</p>
<p>The simulated black hole's event horizon spans about 16 million miles (25 million kilometers), or about 17% of the distance from Earth to the sun. A flat, swirling cloud of hot, glowing gas called an accretion disk surrounds it and serves as a visual reference during the fall. So do glowing structures called photon rings, which form closer to the black hole from light that has orbited it one or more times. A backdrop of the starry sky as seen from Earth completes the scene.</p>
<p>As the camera approaches the black hole, reaching speeds ever closer to that of light itself, the glow from the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/accretion+disk/" rel="tag">accretion disk</a> and background stars becomes amplified in much the same way as the sound of an oncoming race car rises in pitch. Their light appears brighter and whiter when looking into the direction of travel.</p>
<p>The movies begin with the camera located nearly 400 million miles (640 million kilometers) away, with the black hole quickly filling the view. Along the way, the black hole's disk, photon rings, and the night sky become increasingly distorted—and even form multiple images as their light traverses the increasingly warped <a href="https://phys.org/tags/space-time/" rel="tag">space-time</a>.</p>

</figure><p>In real time, the camera takes about 3 hours to fall to the event horizon, executing almost two complete 30-minute orbits along the way. But to anyone observing from afar, it would never quite get there. As space-time becomes ever more distorted closer to the horizon, the image of the camera would slow and then seem to freeze just shy of it. This is why astronomers originally referred to black holes as "frozen stars."</p>

																																			<p>At the event horizon, even space-time itself flows inward at the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit. Once inside it, both the camera and the space-time in which it's moving rush toward the black hole's center—a one-dimensional point called a singularity, where the laws of physics as we know them cease to operate.</p>
<p>"Once the camera crosses the horizon, its destruction by spaghettification is just 12.8 seconds away," Schnittman said. From there, it's only 79,500 miles (128,000 kilometers) to the singularity. This final leg of the voyage is over in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>In the alternative scenario, the camera orbits close to the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/event+horizon/" rel="tag">event horizon</a> but it never crosses over and escapes to safety. If an astronaut flew a spacecraft on this 6-hour round trip while her colleagues on a mothership remained far from the black hole, she'd return 36 minutes younger than her colleagues. That's because time passes more slowly near a strong gravitational source and when moving near the speed of light.</p>
<p>"This situation can be even more extreme," Schnittman noted. "If the black hole were rapidly rotating, like the one shown in the 2014 movie 'Interstellar,' she would return many years younger than her shipmates."</p>

                                    <p>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — About a year ago, veterinarian Melissa Ezell started noticing subtle changes at the midsized animal clinic in Huntsville, Alabama, where she works.</p>
	
	
<p>She said she and other vets were feeling pressure from management to make a certain amount of money from every appointment. If a pet owner wasn’t going to spend enough, the message from management was to offer more services. She was urged to pack in more patients outside of normal business hours.</p>
<p>“Before, I never felt any pressure to be making a certain amount of money in a day,” Ezell, who started working at the clinic in 2021, told Stateline. “It was just, ‘Fill your schedule, practice good medicine, everything else will come.’”</p>
<p>The clinic is owned by National Veterinary Associates, one of the largest veterinary chains in the nation. In 2020 the company was acquired by JAB Consumer Partners, a global private equity firm based in Luxembourg. By early 2023, Ezell said, she felt a shift in atmosphere at the clinic and a greater focus on increasing profits.</p>
<p>Private equity’s foray into the human health care industry in recent years has <a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/">drawn public outrage and legislative scrutiny</a> as firms have been blamed for increasing prices, slashing services and shuttering hospitals to maximize shareholder profits.</p>
<p>Now, some veterinarians and advocates are sounding the alarm that private equity’s entry into the pet health care industry could lead to similar results.</p>
<p>Some states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning veterinary practices, and some consumer advocates want states to review large-scale acquisitions in the industry.</p>
<p>“A large number of these funds are seeing veterinary medicine as a good profit center,” said Dr. Grant Jacobson, an Iowa veterinarian who serves on the board of the Independent Veterinary Practitioners Association. He said he’s seen corporate-owned chains in his region drive up prices for consumers, suppress market competition and skirt state laws that ostensibly prohibit veterinary practices from being owned by non-veterinarians.</p>
<p>Private equity firms such as Shore Capital Partners, KKR, TSG Consumer and JAB Consumer Partners have spent billions over the past few years on veterinary practices, specialty animal hospitals, pet insurance services and pet food companies. Among the companies owned by private equity are PetSmart, PetVet Care Centers, FIGO, Thrive Pet Healthcare and ASPCA Pet Health Insurance.</p>
<p>Private equity firms say those investments are giving clinics and other providers the capital they need to buy better technology, and that they are improving efficiency. And in many cases, corporate chains can offer their employees better workplace benefits, such as health insurance.</p>
<p>In a statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates said its corporate philosophy is “grounded in vets making medical decisions and not a corporate office,” and that its program of shared ownership by veterinarians is “the industry’s largest such program and unique among our peers.”</p>
<p>“Our vision is to build a community of hospitals that pet owners trust, are easy to access, and provide the best possible care,” National Veterinary Associates said in the statement.</p>
<p>JAB Consumer Partners did not respond to Stateline’s request for comment.</p>
    <h4>More pets, more money</h4>

	
<p>Private equity uses pooled investment money from pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy controlling stakes in companies. The firms typically look for a quick return on their investment before selling it within a few years. They have been gobbling up small businesses in myriad industries in recent years — from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/12/24/nursing-homes-private-equity-fraud-00132001">nursing homes</a> to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-wants-to-wash-your-car-11660968031">car washes</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-secret="lzVYrrJo9E"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/18/shell-game-when-private-equity-comes-to-town-hospitals-can-see-cutbacks-closures/">‘Shell game’: When private equity comes to town, hospitals can see cutbacks, closures</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/reports-statistics/us-pet-ownership-statistics">pet ownership soared</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic, private equity followed close behind. The pandemic years of 2020-2022 were “the peak years for private equity acquisitions of veterinary services and practices,” said Michael Fenne, senior coordinator for health care at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group that advocates for communities affected by private equity ownership.</p>
<p>Americans spent a record $147 billion on pet products and services last year. From 2017 to 2022, <a target="_blank" href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pe-deals-veterinary-clinics-pet-care">private equity spent $45 billion</a> on deals in the veterinary sector, according to PitchBook, which tracks investment data.</p>
<p>The vet industry is attractive because it’s mostly made up of small, privately owned businesses that corporations can buy and consolidate into larger chains. And it’s mainly a cash-based business: Unlike in human health care, veterinary customers typically pay out of pocket, rather than rely on third-party payers such as insurance companies.</p>
<p>In some cases, private equity firms and other corporations buy community clinics from the veterinarians who own them for two, five or even 10 times their value. Then the firms roll them up into a larger chain of clinics that can corner a regional market.</p>
<p>It’s a strategy that can push other private owners out of the business, said Jacobson, the Iowa veterinarian. He spent nearly 20 years working at a privately owned practice in Iowa and had hoped to buy it when the original founder retired.</p>
<p>But the founder sold the practice to a large veterinary chain owned by Mars Inc. — the private company best known for owning candy brands that include M&amp;Ms — for more than $1 million above his offer, Jacobson said. Mars, while not a private equity firm, is the biggest consolidator of pet care companies in the United States, owning pet food companies, pet pharmacies and veterinary care clinic chains such as Banfield Pet Hospitals and BluePearl.</p>

	<p>You feel like you don’t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if they’re sick.</p>
		<p><b>– Melissa Ezell, veterinarian</b></p>
	</div>

	
<p>About a quarter of general veterinary practices and about three-quarters of specialty practices, such as emergency and surgery care, are now owned by large corporations, according to John Volk of Brakke Consulting, a veterinary management consulting firm.</p>
<p>Some private equity-backed chains, such as National Veterinary Associates, buy community-based veterinary practices like Ezell’s without rebranding them under the chain’s name. As a result, clients might not be aware of the ownership change.</p>
<p>“It can appear you’re getting community-oriented care when there’s actually this set of big-box incentives underlying [the clinic] that comes from their private equity owners,” Fenne said.</p>
    <h4>Where vets want to work</h4>

	
<p>Lori Kogan, a clinical sciences professor at Colorado State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, surveyed nearly 900 veterinarians in 2022 about their experiences and perceptions of <a target="_blank" href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/261/12/javma.23.06.0326.xml">corporate vs. privately owned veterinary clinics</a>.</p>
<blockquote data-secret="0DBBSnGFD1"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2024/01/31/private-equitys-growing-footprint-in-home-health-care-draws-scrutiny/">Private equity’s growing footprint in home health care draws scrutiny</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Even though most of the veterinarians surveyed reported working for corporate-owned clinics, Kogan found more than half said they would prefer to work in privately owned clinics. The benefits offered by corporate chains, such as health insurance, didn’t seem strong enough to override other preferences, Kogan told Stateline.</p>
<p>“Feeling like they have a voice in decision-making, feeling like they’re recognized as an individual, those are things that are really important to people,” she said. “I think corporate ownership could accomplish those things, but it will take paying attention.”</p>
<p>Ezell, the veterinarian who left National Veterinary Associates, said the pressure has an impact on patients and their humans as well.</p>
<p>“Either you’re getting talked into additional services that may or may not actually be necessary, or your feel like you’re being rushed,” Ezell said. “You feel like you don’t have the time with the doctor, and you leave not fully understanding what was done to your pet or what is wrong with your pet if they’re sick.”</p>
<p>In its statement to Stateline, National Veterinary Associates noted that it has made “continued investment in technology and infrastructure, pioneering clinical research, industry-leading continuing education programs and wellbeing initiatives.”</p>
    <h4>Could states step in?</h4>

	
<p>Last August, Thrive Pet Healthcare announced it would be closing the only 24-hour emergency veterinary clinic in the Rochester, New York, metro area. Thrive is a chain of&nbsp;more than 380 veterinary hospitals&nbsp;based in Austin, Texas, that is owned by private equity firm TSG Consumer.</p>
<p>“The thought of having the only 24-hour emergency pet care center in our entire metro area close was really scary,” said Rachel Barnhart, a Democratic member of the Monroe County Legislature in New York who has taken her dogs to the clinic. “We are a community of more than a million people. The idea that we can’t support a 24-hour pet facility is outrageous.”</p>
<p>Barnhart wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission, asking it to look into Thrive, which operates more than a dozen clinics in Rochester. She said she’d seen the FTC act against anticompetitive practices in the veterinary industry elsewhere, and she felt Thrive deserved similar scrutiny.</p>
<p>Thrive leadership&nbsp;said in a letter to Barnhart and in media reports that a shortage of ER veterinarians made it impossible to hire enough workers to keep the 24-hour clinic open. But Barnhart suspected the company wanted to shutter the clinic because its staff&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.whec.com/archive/vses-first-veterinary-practice-on-east-coast-to-unionize/">recently voted to unionize.</a> CEO Tad Stahel said in the letter to Barnhart that the closure was unrelated to the staff unionization.</p>
<blockquote data-secret="3HcbVh4fzw"><p><a target="_blank" href="https://stateline.org/2022/09/02/should-you-insure-your-pet-without-state-oversight-its-hard-to-say/">Should You Insure Your Pet? Without State Oversight, It’s Hard to Say.</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In 2022, the FTC took action against JAB Consumer Partners, which recently acquired an array of veterinary and pet service companies. The FTC required the firm to divest some of its vet clinics in California, Colorado, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., as a condition of approving its multibillion-dollar purchases of two other multistate veterinary care chains.</p>
<p>If states were to authorize officials or agencies to review similar large-scale mergers and acquisitions in the veterinary industry, that “would be a good first step” toward protecting consumers, said Fenne, of the advocacy group.</p>
<p>Many states already have laws that prohibit non-veterinarians from owning veterinary practices, including Iowa, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and North Carolina. The idea is to prevent corporate interests from guiding veterinarians’ medical judgment.</p>
<p>Experts and advocates expect to see further corporatization in veterinary care as more companies acquire not just vet clinics, but also other businesses across the pet care spectrum.</p>
<p>In February, asset management behemoth Blackstone Inc. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-completes-acquisition-of-rover/">acquired Rover</a>, the nation’s largest online platform for pet sitting, dog walking and other services. In the past two years, JAB has acquired several of the largest pet insurance companies in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Ezell, the Alabama veterinarian, eventually decided to take a job at another clinic in town that’s privately owned. She will start there in a few weeks.</p>
<p>“Not all corporate medicine is horrible, and you can find amazing veterinarians and caring support staff anywhere,” she told Stateline.</p>
<p>“But it’s easy to lose sight of your values. The whole reason we’re doing this is we want to make a difference in animals’ and people’s lives. If we’re unable to do that, shouldn’t we try to fix that?”</p>

				<p>Boeing’s <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1787531120852312388">Starliner</a> launch tonight has been postponed “out of an abundance of caution” scarcely two hours before the historic liftoff. The scrub is reportedly due to an issue with the oxygen relief valve on the Atlas V rocket’s upper stage.</p>
<p id="speakable-summary">There are backup launch opportunities on May 7, 10 and 11. After years of delays and over $1 billion in cost overruns, the mission is set to be Boeing’s first attempt to transport astronauts to the International Space Station.</p>
<p>Once the issue is resolved with the upper stage, the United Launch Alliance Atlas V will carry the CST-100 Starliner capsule to orbit along with the two onboard astronauts — Butch Wilmore and Sunny Williams — from Florida’s Cape Canaveral at 10:34 PM local time Monday evening. The mission also marks the first time ULA’s Atlas will carry crew. The rocket boasts a success rate of 100% across 99 missions. (ULA is a joint venture of Boeing and Lockheed Martin.)</p>
<p>The astronauts would now dock at the station at the earliest on Thursday, where they would remain for at least eight days. The two astronauts will return to Earth in the capsule no earlier than May 16.</p>
<p>If all goes to plan, Boeing will be able to finally certify its Starliner for human transportation and begin fulfilling the terms of its $4.2 billion NASA astronaut taxi contract. That contract, under the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, was awarded in 2014. Elon Musk’s SpaceX was also granted a contract under that program, for its Crew Dragon capsule, and has been transporting astronauts to and from the ISS since 2020.</p>
<p>While SpaceX has soared in its human transportation services, flying over a dozen crewed missions and also racking up private flights with Axiom Space and billionaire Jared Isaacman, Boeing has fallen sharply behind. The aerospace giant originally attempted an uncrewed mission to the ISS in 2019, though <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/20/boeings-starliner-crew-capsule-fails-to-enter-planned-target-orbit-for-space-station-docking/">that failed due to technical issues</a>; further problems delayed the next attempt, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/25/starliner-returns-to-earth-after-a-successful-first-trip-to-iss/">until it was finally accomplished in 2022.</a></p>
<p>As of last year, Boeing had rung up $1.5 billion in charges due to the long-delayed Starliner program.</p>
<p>But despite the technical snags, both NASA and Boeing have stressed their commitment to the mission, and to the safety of the two astronauts.</p>
<p>“The lives of our crew members,&nbsp;Suni Williams&nbsp;and&nbsp;Butch Wilmore, are at stake,” NASA’s associate administrator Jim Free said in a press conference late last month. “We don’t take that lightly at all.”</p>
<p>Indeed, for NASA a successful mission bring the agency one step closer to having two operational transportation providers, bringing critical redundancy to the Commercial Crew program. Per Boeing’s contract, it is on the line for six astronaut missions.</p>
<p>Musk took to X, the social media platform he also owns, to comment on the mission, noting that “although Boeing got $4.2 billion to develop an astronaut capsule and SpaceX only got $2.6 billion, SpaceX finished 4 years sooner.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">
<!-- 🌟 START OF MAIN CONTENT 🌟 -->
<p>Right now, asyncio is one of the trendier topics in Python, and rightfully so – It’s a great way to handle I/O-bound programs! When I was learning about asyncio, It took me a while to understand how it actually worked. But later, I came to find out that it’s basically just a really nice layer on top of Python Generators. In this article, I’m going to create a simplified version of asyncio using just Python generators. Then, I’m going to refactor the example to use the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords with the help of the <code>__await__</code> dunder method before coming full circle and swapping out my version for the real asyncio. By building a simple version of asyncio, hopefully, by the end of this article, you’ll be able to get a better grasp of how it does its magic!</p>

<h2 id="generators-review">Generators Review</h2>

    <p>If you're already familiar with generators skip this part, but if you aren't, it's what asyncio is built off of, so it's very important to understand how they work.</p>
    <p>First of all, the reason why generators are a thing is because they allow you to make your code more memory efficient. Imagine if you had the following loop:</p>

    <pre><code>for i in range(100_000_000):
&nbsp; &nbsp; print(i)</code></pre>

    <p>If <code>range</code> wasn't a generator, but rather was a function that returned a list for you to then loop over, code like the example above would be very memory inefficient since you would be creating a list with 100 million elements… However, because <code>range</code> is a generator, at least in Python 3+, you only generate the numbers as they are needed, one by one, without ever storing the entire sequence in memory.</p>
    <p>There are a few ways to create generators, but we're going to focus on generator functions. These generators are defined like any other function but use the <code>yield</code> statement to return data. This statement turns a regular function into a generator that, instead of executing all at once, can pause and resume its state when calling <code>next(iterator)</code>.</p>
    <p>Take the following generator function, for example:</p>

    <pre><code>def generator():
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield 'hello'
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield 'world'

iterator = generator()</code></pre>

    <p>When you call the generator, instead of running the code inside of the function like Python normally would, it sees the <code>yield</code> keyword and, therefore, returns a generator object. Once we have the generator object, we can then call <code>next(iterator)</code>, which will run the function’s code up until the first/next <code>yield</code> statement:</p>

    <pre><code>print(next(iterator)) &nbsp;# Output: hello
print(next(iterator)) &nbsp;# Output: world</code></pre>

    <p>If we try calling <code>next(iterator)</code> again, the generator will raise a <code>StopIteration</code> exception because there are no more yield statements in the generator function.</p>
    <p>Another cool feature of Python generators is <code>yield from</code>, which lets a generator call a sub-generator or an iterable object, enabling you to create a chain of generators!</p>

    <pre><code>def generator():
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield 'hello'

def another_generator():
&nbsp; &nbsp;yield from generator()

iterable = another_generator()
print(next(iterable)) &nbsp;# Output: hello</code></pre>

    <p>There’s a bit more to generators than I’m talking about, such as generator comprehensions, which are like list comprehensions but created with parentheses instead of brackets, and the ability to send data to generators with <code>iterator.send(value)</code>. However, for this article, the important thing to remember about generators is that they allow a function to be started and stopped while maintaining its state!</p>

<h2 id="the-event-loop">The Event Loop</h2>

    <p>The event loop, which is in charge of running and managing all of the current tasks, is the core of asyncio and is the first thing we’ll recreate with generators. While the asyncio event loop is written in C, an easy way to think about it is as a list that holds all of the current tasks. For now, think of these tasks as just generator objects. The event loop manager will loop through each task in the list and use the <code>next(task)</code> function to run each of them. That task will then run, and when it's doing I/O-bound work like sleeping, it’ll use the <code>yield</code> keyword to pause its execution and give control back to this event loop, which will then go on to the next task in the loop.</p>
    <p>Here’s an example of that — we have two tasks that both print their task number and then yield, which stops their execution. Since the event loop manager is the one that calls <code>next()</code>, after the task yields, it gets back control and then goes to run the next task in the loop.</p>

    <pre><code>def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield

def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield

event_loop = [task1(), task2()]

while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp;for task in event_loop:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;next(task)</code></pre>

    <p>Subsequently, the output of this code is going to look like the following and will go on forever since both of the generator functions never finish due to the <code>while True</code> loops.</p>

    <pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 1
Task 2
…</code></pre>


<h2 id="sleeping">Sleeping</h2>

    <p>If we take the same code from above, we can add sub-generators to our tasks via the use of <code>yield from</code>. Below, I added a sleeping generator which will pause the execution of the tasks until the specified time is up. This works because <code>sleep</code> will keep yielding until a certain amount of seconds has passed, at which point it will leave the <code>while</code> loop. Since there are no more <code>yield</code> statements in <code>sleep</code>, a <code>StopIteration</code> exception is raised which signals to the <code>yield from</code> in the task functions to continue to the next line of code.</p>

    <pre><code>import time

def sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp;start_time = time.time()
&nbsp; &nbsp;while time.time() - start_time &lt; seconds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield

def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield from sleep(1)

def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp;while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;yield from sleep(5)

event_loop = [task1(), task2()]

while True:
&nbsp; &nbsp;for task in event_loop:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;next(task)</code></pre>

    <p>Output:</p>

    <pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 1
Task 1
Task 1
Task 1
Task 2
Task 1
…</code></pre>


<h2 id="yield-to-await">Yield to Await</h2>

    <p>We can now take the above code, and transition from using <code>yield</code> to <code>await</code> by using the <code>__await__</code> dunder method and the <code>async</code> keyword. When a class has the <code>__await__</code> method, we can use the <code>await</code> keyword in front of an instance of the class to call it. In asyncio, you are generally working with <code>Task</code> objects via a function like <code>asyncio.create_task</code>. These <code>Task</code> objects inherit from the asyncio <code>Future</code> object, which has the <code>__await__</code>  method. We can also use <code>await</code> in front of a coroutine, which is an object created when calling a function with the <code>async</code> keyword in front of it. Coroutines are similar to generator functions in the sense that a coroutine’s execution can also be paused and resumed.</p>
    <p>You can think of the <code>await</code> keyword as just a synonym for <code>yield from</code> with some extra validation rules. So, when writing the code <code>await object</code>, you are basically saying to either yield from the <code>__await__</code> method in the “object” class instance OR “object” could be another coroutine (like a sub-generator).</p>
    <p>You can actually look in the Asyncio <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/asyncio/futures.py" target="_blank">source code</a> and see that the <code>__await__</code> method inside of the <code>Future</code> object basically just calls <code>yield</code> if the future (or task) is not done completing:</p>

    
    <p><img src="https://jacobpadilla.com/articles/blog_posts/recreating-asyncio/static/images/yield-to-await-193740693.png" alt="Asyncio source code. The __await__ method in the Future object"></p><p>To move the code that we wrote in the above section to using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>, we first need to make our own <code>Task</code> class since a function can’t have the <code>__await__</code> dunder method. Below is a simple version that I came up with:</p>

    <pre><code>from queue import Queue


event_loop = Queue()

class Task():
&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.iter = generator
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.finished = False

&nbsp; &nbsp; def done(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.finished

&nbsp; &nbsp; def __await__(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while not self.finished:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield self


def create_task(generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = Task(generator)
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)

&nbsp; &nbsp; return task</code></pre>

    <p>This time, instead of using a Python list to create the event loop, we’re using a queue, which makes a bit more sense since we want to be able to add and delete tasks from the loop in constant time.</p>
    <p>For our <code>Task</code> class, we store the generator object in <code>self.iter</code> and also set <code>self.finished</code> to <code>False</code>, which will keep track of if the generator is done running (It’s done running when it raises <code>StopIteration</code>). Our <code>Task</code> object also has an <code>__await__</code> dunder method, which will just keep yielding control back to the event loop until the task is finished. Lastly, after creating the <code>Task</code> object with the <code>create_task</code> helper function, we add it to the event loop, which schedules it to be run.</p>
    <p>Now, let’s build the event loop manager, which will run the tasks:</p>

    <pre><code>def run(main):
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(Task(main))

&nbsp; &nbsp; while not event_loop.empty():
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task = event_loop.get()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.iter.send(None)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except StopIteration:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.finished = True
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)</code></pre>

    <p>You may notice that this is starting to mimic the actual asyncio API since to start the event loop, we need to call <code>run</code> with an initial function. The function first wraps the main function in a <code>Task</code> object and adds it to the event loop. The <code>while</code> loop will then run, and for each cycle, will get the next task to run via the queue. Instead of using <code>next(task.iter)</code>, we now need to use <code>task.iter.send(None)</code>, which is just a weird quirk of working with the async/await keywords, but it does the same thing. We also want to wrap this call in a try-except block since if a <code>StopIteration</code> exception is thrown, we can set <code>task.finished</code> to <code>True</code>, but if no exceptions are raised, the code will go to the <code>else</code> statement which adds the task back to the event loop to be run again.</p>
    <p>Next, we need to make the sleep function async-compliant. Before, we were using a generator function with a while-loop and one <code>yield</code> to handle the sleeping. I like this approach, but you can’t use the <code>await</code> keyword in combination with a generator function - it needs to be an object with the <code>__await__</code> dunder method or a coroutine function. So, to solve this, I moved the code to another function, and now the actual <code>sleep</code> function creates a task object and then awaits it. This <code>await</code> will call the <code>__await__</code> method inside of the Task object, which will then yield, letting the event loop move to another task. When the event loop gets to the new <code>_sleep</code> task, it will check the time, and if not enough has passed, will also call <code>yield</code> to give control back to the event loop. If the task that is sleeping is called via the event loop again, like how a generator stores its state, the coroutine would still be waiting for <code>sleep</code> to return, and since <code>sleep</code> would still be awaiting the <code>_sleep</code> task to finish, the <code>__await__</code> dunder method of the task will be called again and since the task isn't finished, the yield in the dunder method will be called.</p>

    <pre><code>import time

def _sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; start_time = time.time()
&nbsp; &nbsp; while time.time() - start_time &lt; seconds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield


async def sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = create_task(_sleep(seconds))
&nbsp; &nbsp; return await task</code></pre>

    <p>Here’s all of the code put together:</p>

    <pre><code>from queue import Queue
import time


event_loop = Queue()


def _sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; start_time = time.time()
&nbsp; &nbsp; while time.time() - start_time &lt; seconds:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield


async def sleep(seconds):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = create_task(_sleep(seconds))
&nbsp; &nbsp; return await task


class Task():
&nbsp; &nbsp; def __init__(self, generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.iter = generator
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; self.finished = False

&nbsp; &nbsp; def done(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return self.finished

&nbsp; &nbsp; def __await__(self):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; while not self.finished:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yield self


def create_task(generator):
&nbsp; &nbsp; task = Task(generator)
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)

&nbsp; &nbsp; return task


def run(main):
&nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(Task(main))

&nbsp; &nbsp; while not event_loop.empty():
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task = event_loop.get()
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; try:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.iter.send(None)
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; except StopIteration:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; task.finished = True
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; else:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; event_loop.put(task)</code></pre>

    <p>Now that we’ve built the event loop, a way to create tasks, and a sleep function, we can import the file (called “jacobio.py”) and take the code from back when we were using yields and replace all of the <code>yield from</code> statements with <code>await</code>, add <code>async</code> to the functions with the <code>await</code> keyword to signify that those functions can be awaited, and then create a main function, like you would in asyncio, to add the tasks to the event loop:</p>

    <pre><code>import jacobio

async def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(2):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await jacobio.sleep(1)

async def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(3):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await jacobio.sleep(0)

async def main():
&nbsp; &nbsp; one = jacobio.create_task(task1())
&nbsp; &nbsp; two = jacobio.create_task(task2())

&nbsp; &nbsp; await one
&nbsp; &nbsp; await two
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; print('done')


if __name__ == '__main__':
&nbsp; &nbsp; jacobio.run(main())</code></pre>

    <p>Output:</p>

    <pre><code>Task 1
Task 2
Task 2
Task 2
Task 1
done</code></pre>


<h2 id="await-with-asyncio">Await with AsyncIO</h2>

    <p>We can now take our code from above and replace all occurrences of “jacobio” with “asyncio” and we’re now fully using the asyncio package!</p>

    <pre><code>import asyncio

async def task1():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(2):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 1')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await asyncio.sleep(1)

async def task2():
&nbsp; &nbsp; for _ in range(3):
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print('Task 2')
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; await asyncio.sleep(0)

async def main():
&nbsp; &nbsp; one = asyncio.create_task(task1())
&nbsp; &nbsp; two = asyncio.create_task(task2())

&nbsp; &nbsp; await one
&nbsp; &nbsp; await two
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp; &nbsp; print('done')


if __name__ == '__main__':
&nbsp; &nbsp; asyncio.run(main())</code></pre>

    <p>Asyncio does a lot more behind the scenes, but we were able to go from basic generators to recreating the core parts of asyncio from scratch! I tried to make the event loop manager as simple as possible, and while this is the basic idea behind asyncio, given the scale and complexity of the actual package, my implementation is slightly different from the flow of the actual source code. Also, now that we have the full power of the real asyncio package, we don’t need to create two tasks just to await both; instead, we can use a function such as <code>asyncio.gather()</code>to handle multiple tasks.

<p>Proton Mail has come under scrutiny for its role in a legal request involving the Spanish authorities and a member of the Catalan independence organization, Democratic Tsunami.</p>



<p>Proton Mail is a <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/secure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure email</a> service based in Switzerland, renowned for its commitment to privacy through end-to-end encryption and a strict no-logs policy. In 2021, Proton Mail <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-logs-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced controversy</a> when it complied with a legal request that led to the arrest of a French climate activist. Under Swiss law, Proton Mail was compelled to collect and provide information on the individual’s IP address to Swiss authorities, who then shared it with French police.</p>



<p>The recent case involving the Spanish police this time, highlights privacy concerns and the limits of encrypted communication services under national security pretexts, and brings a long-debated subject to the forefront once again.</p>



<p>The core of the controversy stems from Proton Mail <a href="https://www.elnacional.cat/en/politics/judge-garcia-castellon-accuse-mossos-police-officer-tsunami_1202609_102.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">providing the Spanish police</a> with the recovery email address associated with the Proton Mail account of an individual using the pseudonym ‘Xuxo Rondinaire.’ This individual is suspected of being a member of the Mossos d’Esquadra (Catalonia’s police force) and of using their internal knowledge to assist the Democratic Tsunami movement. </p>



<p>Upon receiving the recovery email from Proton Mail, Spanish authorities <a href="https://www.vilaweb.cat/noticies/tsunami-democratic-xuxo-rondinaire-mossos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further requested Apple</a> to provide additional details linked to that email, leading to the identification of the individual.</p>



<p>This case is particularly noteworthy because it involves a series of requests across different jurisdictions and companies, highlighting the complex interplay between technology firms, user privacy, and law enforcement. The requests were made under the guise of anti-terrorism laws, despite the primary activities of the Democratic Tsunami involving protests and roadblocks, which raises questions about the proportionality and justification of such measures.</p>



<p>Like before, Proton Mail’s compliance with these requests is bound by Swiss law, which mandates cooperation with international legal demands that are formalized through proper channels (Swiss court system). </p>



<p>Last year, when we noted that <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-data-requests-user-logs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proton Mail complied with nearly 6,000 data requests</a> in 2022, Proton provided us with an explanation that inbox contents remain secure.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Please note that in all cases email content, attachments, files etc are always encrypted and cannot be read.</em></p>
<cite>Proton <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-data-requests-user-logs/">statement to RestorePrivacy last year</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Looking at Proton’s <a href="https://proton.me/legal/transparency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transparency report</a>, we find that Proton Mail complied with 5,971 data requests last year alone, up slightly from the year before.</p>

<p>With so many data requests going on in the background, it is all the more important to safeguard the data you share with various services. </p>



<h3 id="h-the-importance-of-good-opsec">The importance of good OPSEC</h3>



<p>This situation serves as a critical reminder of the importance of maintaining stringent OPSEC (operational security). One should always be aware of the potential vulnerabilities that come with linking recovery information or secondary services (like Apple accounts) that may not have the same privacy safeguards as a primary encrypted email service. </p>



<p>For users concerned about privacy, particularly those involved in sensitive or political activities, OPSEC should be a top concern when using <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/privacy-tools/">privacy tools</a>. It’s advisable to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Avoid linking recovery emails or phone numbers that can directly tie back to personal identities or primary business activities.</li>



<li>Consider using secondary, <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/email/temporary-disposable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disposable emails</a> or virtual phone numbers that offer an additional layer of anonymity.</li>



<li>Use a <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/vpn/best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good VPN service</a> to hide your IP address whenever possible. (Failure to do this is what <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/protonmail-logs-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compromised a Proton Mail user in France</a> who was arrested after after police obtained IP logs.)</li>



<li>Consider purchasing services using an <a href="https://restoreprivacy.com/private-anonymous-payment-methods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anonymous payment method</a>.</li>



<li>Stay informed about the legal obligations and policies of communication service providers, especially regarding their compliance with international law enforcement requests.</li>
</ul>



<p>While Proton Mail and similar services offer substantial protections and end-to-end encryption on their email platform, they are not immune to legal and governmental pressures. Users must navigate these waters carefully, balancing the need for security with the potential legal obligations of their service providers.</p>



<p>RestorePrivacy has reached out to Proton Mail for a comment on the case and their exact involvement, but a statement wasn’t immediately available. We will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>

  <p>Recently, we identified a novel network technique that bypasses VPN encapsulation. An attacker can use this technique to force a target user’s traffic off their VPN tunnel using built-in features of DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol). The result of this is the user transmits packets that are never encrypted by a VPN, and an attacker can snoop their traffic. We are using the term <strong>decloaking</strong> to refer to this effect. Importantly, the VPN control channel is maintained so features such as kill switches are never tripped, and users continue to show as connected to a VPN in all the cases we’ve observed. </p><p>We’ve spent extensive time exploring this capability and attempting to notify as many affected parties as possible. We also know it is our responsibility as security researchers to inform the security and privacy community, as well as the general public, about this threat. We also believe this technique may have been possible as far back as 2002 and could have already been discovered<strong>*</strong> and potentially used in the wild. For that reason, we believe it is critical for us to disclose publicly because notifying every VPN provider, operating system maintainer, self-hosted VPN admin, and VPN user is far beyond the capacity of our small research team.</p><p>We've seen one mitigation for this technique, as well as identified a fix that exists on Linux-based operating systems. However, the mitigation offers a side channel that could be used for targeted denial-of-service censorship, as well as to de-anonymize the destination of traffic via traffic analysis. In some places in the world, the side-channel alone could lead to imprisonment or death for those who rely on VPNs for safety such as journalists or whistleblowers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/07/19/1017774097/private-spyware-was-used-to-hack-cellphones-of-journalists-activists-worldwide" target="_blank">who are common targets of surveillance or spyware.</a> </p><p>It is not feasible to fix the issue by simply removing support for the DHCP feature because this could break Internet connectivity in some legitimate cases. The strongest recommendation we have is for VPN providers to implement network namespaces on operating systems that support them, similar to the method described in <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/netns/#the-new-namespace-solution" target="_blank">WireGuard’s documentation</a>. Network namespaces are a Linux feature that can segment interfaces and routing tables away from the local network’s control, and other operating system maintainers should consider whether namespaces are feasible to implement.</p><p>To help make this work accessible to as many people as possible, we are structuring this blog post to walk through the fundamentals of networking, VPN technology, and DHCP to fully explain the decloaking behavior. <strong>Advanced readers are welcome to jump straight to the proof-of-concept section.</strong></p><p> <strong>*</strong> After publication we’ve received notice that there are references to this decloaking behavior on <a href="https://mstdn.io/@jomo/98981403329690455" target="_blank">social media</a>. This further showcases the important of informing audiences outside of the technology sector of the existence of our technique.</p><h2>Decloaking Primer: Low-level Networking</h2><h3>What is a network?</h3><p>A computer network is a group of computer devices that are connected to each other and can send and receive data to and from one another. </p><p>A basic example of this is to connect two laptops with an Ethernet cable to network them together. However, there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to low-level networking that’s hidden from the average user. The laptops are using a system of rules to talk to each other, which we call <strong>protocols</strong>. Each protocol has its own purpose and operates at what we call a <strong>layer</strong>.</p><p>These layers are intended to solve different types of problems and are built such that they do not need to know what’s happening at a higher or lower layer. This is called <strong>encapsulation</strong>. For example, a user can trust that the layers lower than their browser (HTTP) are determining how to send electricity over a cable (Coax), knows who to talk to (Ethernet, IP), and ensure correct data delivery to the recipient server (TCP). This is like how someone writing a letter needs only to think about what they want to write or what the other person wrote. They do not need to care about how it got there.</p><p>When we’re referring to layers in this blogpost, we are talking about the practical <strong>TCP/IP model</strong>, which is implemented on almost every device and network. We also decided to use the 5-layer variant of the model because it doesn’t combine the lower layers together; this is why there might be a discrepancy when viewing other TCP/IP model diagrams. When we’re referring to data that’s been packaged by all these layers, we generally refer to it as a <strong>packet</strong>.</p>

  <h3>What is a network interface?</h3><p>The most basic example of a network interface is a physical device such as a wireless or network card attached to a computer's motherboard. These devices allow the computer to transmit bits of data over a physical medium (e.g., a copper wire, fiber optic cable, or radio frequency). They are a fundamental part of networking as they are what allows computers to talk to each other over a distance.</p><p>There are two types of network interfaces:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Physical Network Interfaces</p></li><li><p>Virtual Network Interfaces</p></li></ul><p>Importantly, both types of interfaces are designed for encapsulation so they can be interacted with by higher layers in the same way. </p><p>This is where Virtual Network Interfaces, a critical component of VPN clients and server, come in. Instead of using physical hardware, Virtual Network Interfaces create a <strong>file</strong> <strong>descriptor</strong> that can be read from or written to via software applications. Because file descriptors exist only in the memory of a host, Virtual Network Interfaces are especially useful for virtualized environments where traffic might never need to be transmitted over a physical medium.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_4403">

<p>However, there are use cases in which a user might want a virtual interface to be able to send traffic over a physical medium. For those cases, the virtual interface can also be backed by a physical network interface. Behind the scenes, the virtual interface forwards outbound traffic to a physical network interface.</p>

  <h3>What is a VPN?</h3><p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) allows users to create a <strong>tunnel</strong> for network traffic between their host device and a server on a different network. The resulting <strong>virtual network</strong> is not confined by geographic location while behaving identically to a physical network. </p><p>To achieve this, VPN clients create a virtual network interface and use the underlying file descriptor to encrypt/decrypt traffic at a higher layer before sending it to a physical network interface.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_18104">
  <p>VPN use is designed to be as simple as possible for a user. Often, they do not need to do much besides log in and click a button to connect to their server.</p><p>What a user does:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Select the settings they want on the VPN Client</p></li><li><p>Click a button to connect</p></li><li><p>Log in (optional in some cases, depending on the client)</p></li><li><p>Read the confirmation from the VPN they are connected</p></li><li><p>Use remote resources from the VPN</p></li></ol><p>Importantly, VPNs actually <em>increase </em>the host’s attack surface because traffic from lower networking layers is send over the Internet. VPNs work by encapsulating lower layers inside of higher layers to create local area networks (LAN) over the Internet. LAN traffic is considered to be more privileged than traffic that is intended to be sent over the Internet. Attackers with LAN access have many more passive and active attack options than an attacker outside of the LAN. By creating a LAN over the Internet, VPNs extend the LAN attack surface to external attackers. Commonly, VPNs mitigate this attack surface by using compensating controls such as packet encryption.</p><p>This is an often-misunderstood fact about VPNs. The reason for encryption is not to increase the security of using the physical LAN, but rather to mitigate the added risk that VPNs introduce when they create a virtualized LAN over the Internet. <strong><em>VPNs do not secure you from local network attacks on the physical LAN</em> <em>despite common VPN marketing material and widely given advice.</em></strong></p><h3>How do VPNs use virtual network interfaces?</h3><p>The VPN client process creates an encrypted version of the packet it originally received from the file descriptor associated with its virtual network interface. It places this encrypted <strong>payload</strong> in the layer for its underlying VPN protocol, then uses that protocol to talk to the VPN server.</p>

  <p>There’s quite a long process for how a VPN sends that packet to the VPN Server.

For that reason, we’ve made our own detailed diagram of a mental model we use for how a VPN client sends and receives information (Figure 4).</p>

  <h3>How do routing based VPNs configure a host?</h3><p>Once a user connects to a VPN server, their VPN client process will configure the host’s settings to route traffic through the tunnel that it established. If all traffic* is routed through the VPN, we refer to it as a “full-tunnel VPN”. &nbsp;If there are user-defined exceptions for traffic, such as local network traffic, we refer to it as a “split-tunnel VPN”. The VPN client can also configure other settings on the host, such as the host’s firewall. Later, we’ll discuss a mitigation we observed using the host-based firewall.</p><p>Commonly, these configuration changes are made by “up scripts” and “down scripts” when a connection is established or disconnected. The runtime process for a VPN client may also perform configuration changes, but this varies from vendor to vendor.</p><p>*Note: When we say, “all traffic”, we really mean “all traffic except the traffic necessary to keep the VPN in a working state.” For example, VPNs create an exception to their own previously configured routing rules. All traffic sent to the VPN servers IP address must be sent over a hardware backed interface instead of its own tunnel. Otherwise, it would break the hosts connection to the VPN server and the VPN client would be unable to send encrypted packets. In addition, there are other configuration exceptions made for DHCP traffic since the VPN must maintain its hosts IP address lease. </p><h3>What are routes and routing tables?</h3><p><strong>Routes</strong> are how we describe where to send traffic based on the destination. <strong>Routing tables</strong> are a collection of routes that are used by the <strong>network stack</strong>. Consider a network stack to just be all the code on an operating system that deals with sending and receiving data from a network.</p><p>A common route is sending all traffic (<code>0.0.0.0/0</code> in <strong>Classless</strong> Inter-Domain Routing [CIDR] notation) to your router (<code>192.168.1.1</code>) over the physical network interface (<code>eth0</code>).</p><p>An example of that rule in the table would be:</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_74810">
  <p>Another behavior of routing tables is that by default (in most network stacks) the most specific <strong>prefix length</strong> for the CIDR range has the highest priority. The prefix length for the range <code>192.168.1.1/32</code> is <code>32</code> and the prefix length for the range <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> is <code>0</code>. The highest numerical value of a prefix length will take priority for routing selection (unless configured otherwise).</p><p>For example:</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_76210">
  <p>In this situation, if we sent traffic to <code>10.10.10.2</code>, the most specific rule is the <code>/32</code> rule and it would therefore be the rule the network stack uses despite matching the other two rules above it.</p><p>Most full-tunnel VPNs use the least specific rule possible to capture all traffic. Note that the following example includes an exception route for the hypothetical VPN server address (<code>12.34.56.78</code>) as well.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_77388">

<p>Alternatively, providers may use two <code>/1</code> rules to gain priority over the default route. It's common in even non-adversarial environments for DHCP to set a default route to the physical gateway.</p>

  <h3>What is DHCP?</h3><p>DHCP was originally developed as a robust way to dynamically issue IP addresses to devices on a local network as opposed to manually addressing each device. All modern operating systems have their own DHCP client that will automatically request an IP address. </p><p>The main concept to understand is that DHCP provides a time-based <strong>lease</strong> for IP addresses, and it contains many additional features called <strong>options</strong> that allow you to adjust the configuration of devices remotely and dynamically. Some notable options include setting the <strong>default</strong> <strong>gateway</strong> that acts as the primary route to the Internet or DNS (Domain Name System) servers, which resolve domain names like “google.com” to an IP address.</p><p>A client who wants an IP address uses a <strong>broadcast</strong> to send a <strong>DHCPDISCOVER</strong> packet to the entire local subnet. Other hosts will ignore this, except for the server who will respond with a <strong>DHCPOFFER </strong>unicasted directly to the client to offer it a time-bound lease.</p><p>Alternatively, if a client knows who the DHCP server is, it has the option to unicast the DHCPDISCOVER to a DHCP server instead of broadcasting. Usually, this is used for renewing its lease.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_83258">
  <p>As seen in the above diagram, once a DHCP server makes an offer, the client can choose to accept or decline the offer. For example, if it receives multiple offers, it will choose the best one. The selection most often implemented by DHCP clients is “first come, first serve.” The servers that aren’t selected will be sent a <strong>DHCPDECLINE</strong> message from the client. Notably, the DHCPOFFER will include the options.</p><h3>What is DHCP option 121?</h3><p>In 1997, the DHCP <strong>RFC</strong> had option 33, which allowed network administrators to specify a static route to install into a client’s routing table. However, this used <em>classful</em> static routes, which fell out of favor over time as public IP space became limited. In 2002, RFC 3442 introduced option 121 classless static routes and obsoleted option 33 (which still should be supported, <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/7792#issuecomment-355068519" target="_blank">depending on who you ask</a>). Option 121 also allows administrators to add static routes to a client’s routing table, but with classless ranges instead. There is no limit besides packet size to how many different routes can be installed at once.</p><p>An interesting quirk of DHCP option 121 is that the network interface device for the route it installs cannot be specified by the DHCP server. Below you can see a DHCPOFFER packet that was captured in Wireshark. It specifies the <em>CIDR range </em>and the <em>router</em> to use but has no interface device.</p>

  <p>Instead, the DHCP client will implicitly choose the network interface that the client is talking to the DHCP server on when installing its routing rules for this option. </p><h2>Decloaking Attacks</h2>

  <h3>Requirements for decloaking VPN traffic</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The targeted host must accept a DHCP lease from the attacker-controlled server</p></li><li><p>The targeted host’s DHCP client must implement DHCP option 121</p></li></ul><p>We want to stress that <strong>there are ways an attacker who is on the same network as a targeted user might be able to become their DHCP server</strong>:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A rogue DHCP server using a DHCP starvation attack against the true DHCP, then responding to new clients. We have achieved this in lab environments and are working on a follow-up blog post.</p></li><li><p>A rogue DHCP server racing to respond to DHCPDISCOVER broadcasts to abuse DHCP clients’ common behavior where they implement first-offer lease selection.&nbsp; </p></li><li><p>ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between the true DHCP server and client, then waiting for a client to renew their lease. </p></li></ul><h3>Performing the attack</h3><p>Our technique is to run a DHCP server on the same network as a targeted VPN user and to also set our DHCP configuration to use itself as a gateway. When the traffic hits our gateway, we use traffic forwarding rules on the DHCP server to pass traffic through to a legitimate gateway while we snoop on it.</p><p>We use DHCP option 121 to set a route on the VPN user’s routing table. The route we set is arbitrary and we can also set multiple routes if needed. By pushing routes that are more specific than a <code>/0</code> CIDR range that most VPNs use, we can make routing rules that have a higher priority than the routes for the virtual interface the VPN creates. We can set multiple <code>/1</code> routes to recreate the <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> all traffic rule set by most VPNs.</p><p>Pushing a route also means that the network traffic will be sent over the same interface as the DHCP server instead of the virtual network interface. This is intended functionality that isn’t clearly stated in the RFC. Therefore, for the routes we push, it is never encrypted by the VPN’s virtual interface but instead transmitted by the network interface that is talking to the DHCP server. As an attacker, we can select which IP addresses go over the tunnel and which addresses go over the network interface talking to our DHCP server.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1714393040309_95776">
  <p>We now have traffic being transmitted outside the VPN’s encrypted tunnel. This technique can also be used against an already established VPN connection once the VPN user’s host needs to renew a lease from our DHCP server. We can artificially create that scenario by setting a short lease time in the DHCP lease, so the user updates their routing table more frequently. In addition, the VPN control channel is still intact because it already uses the physical interface for its communication. In our testing, the VPN always continued to report as connected, and the kill switch was never engaged to drop our VPN connection.</p><h3>Proof of Concept</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Video proof of concept:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajsLmZia6UU</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>Lab Setup Code:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://github.com/leviathansecurity/TunnelVision" target="_blank">https://github.com/leviathansecurity/TunnelVision</a></p></li></ul></li><li><p>DHCP Server image:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLJGs3ZUypf6hLh5WL4AJmsKdUOZo5yZ" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WLJGs3ZUypf6hLh5WL4AJmsKdUOZo5yZ</a></p></li></ul></li></ul><p><br>The lab scenarios are built to represent:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>An attacker compromises a DHCP server/access point</p></li><li><p>A rogue administrator owns the infrastructure themselves and maliciously configures it</p></li><li><p>An attacker sets up an evil twin wireless AP in a physical location such as a coffee shop or corporate office</p></li><li><p>One we release our tool, ArcaneTrickster, the lab can also be used to mimic an attacker who has an adjacent host on the network na dis otherwise not in a privileged network position</p></li></ul><h3>Fixes</h3><h4><strong>Network Namespaces</strong></h4><p>Using network namespaces on Linux can completely fix this behavior. However, in our experience, it is less commonly implemented.</p><p><a href="https://www.wireguard.com/netns/#the-new-namespace-solution" target="_blank">WireGuard’s documentation</a> shows how it’s possible to use a namespace for all applications with traffic that should be using a VPN before sending it to another namespace that contains a physical interface. However, this appears to be Linux-specific functionality and it’s not clear if there is a solution for Windows, MacOS, or other operating systems with the same amount of robustness.</p><h3>Mitigations</h3><h4><strong>Firewall Rules</strong></h4><p>We’ve observed VPN providers denying all inbound and outbound traffic to and from the physical interface via firewall rules. An exception was necessary for the DHCP and VPN server IPs because they are necessary to remain connected to the LAN and VPN server. Deep packet inspection could also allow only the DHCP and VPN protocols instead but would likely incur a performance penalty.</p><h4><strong>Problems with Firewall Rule Mitigations</strong></h4><p>Firewall mitigations create a selective denial of service for traffic using the DHCP route and introduce a side-channel. An attacker can use this side-channel to determine the destination of traffic. To determine the traffic’s destination, an attacker could perform traffic analysis on the volume of VPN encrypted traffic a user sends. The attacker would need a baseline volume of traffic where no malicious are installed. Then the attacker would need to modify the lease configuration to install routes that deny traffic and observe the difference in volume.</p><p>With enough samples, it would be possible to statistically prove whether the targeted user is sending traffic to a specific destination. For the average internet user, most internet traffic is already secured by TLS. Therefore, traffic intercepted by TunnelVision will mostly be unreadable except for the destination and protocols. This means that this side-channel has nearly the same impact and should be considered insufficient.</p><p>The side-channel is flexible in use:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The traffic can be checked against a predefined list.</p></li><li><p>The traffic can be selectively denied as a censorship mechanism.</p></li><li><p>The attacker can use IP space denial with binary search to determine all current connections in logarithmic time.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>Ignore Option 121</strong></h4><p>Another possible mitigation is ignoring option 121 while the VPN is on. We noted that because Android does not implement support for DHCP option 121, it was uniquely unaffected. The downside is that option 121 exists for a reason, and ignoring these routes can break network connectivity (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34145080" target="_blank">something that is frequently brought up as a reason to implement i</a>t on Android). If this mitigation is implemented, it must be mandatory because attackers could simply deny network access until the VPN or user re-enables option 121.</p><h4><strong>Use a Hot Spot or VM</strong></h4><p>Hot spots are temporary Wi-Fi networks controlled by a cellular device. They create a password-locked LAN with automatic network address translation. Because this network is completely controlled by the cellular device and requires a password, an attacker should not have local network access. A virtual machine would also work similarly as long as the VM’s network adapter is not in bridged mode.</p><h4><strong>Do not use untrusted networks if you need absolute confidentiality of your traffic</strong></h4><h2>Industry Impact</h2><h3>Is TunnelVision a vulnerability?</h3><p>This is debatable. We’re calling it a technique because TunnelVision doesn’t rely on violating any security properties of the underlying technologies. From our perspective, TunnelVision is how DHCP, routing tables, and VPNs are intended to work.</p><p>However, it contradicts VPN providers’ assurances that are commonly referenced in marketing materials; in our opinion, TunnelVision becomes a vulnerability when a VPN provider makes assurances that their product secures a customer from an attacker on an untrusted network. There’s a big difference between protecting your data in transit and protecting against all LAN attacks. VPNs were not designed to mitigate LAN attacks on the physical network and to promise otherwise is dangerous.</p><p>In our technique, we have not broken the VPN’s cryptographically secured protocol, and the VPN is still fully functional. An attacker is instead forcing a target user to not use their VPN tunnel. Regardless of whether we classify this as a technique, VPN users are affected when they rely on assurances that a VPN can secure them from attackers on their local network.</p><h3>Affected Operating Systems</h3><p>In our testing, we observed that any operating system that implements a DHCP client according to its RFC specification and has support for DHCP option 121 routes is affected. This includes Windows, Linux, iOS, and MacOS. Notably, it does not affect Android as they do not have support for DHCP option 121.</p><h3>Affected VPN Providers and VPN Protocols</h3><p>We found that VPNs that solely rely on routing rules to secure the host’s traffic are vulnerable. Those who are hosting their own VPN servers (e.g., system administrators) and are not hardening their VPN client configurations will likely be vulnerable as well. We have observed a mitigation from some VPN providers that drops traffic to non-VPN interfaces via firewall rules. It’s possible there are other methods that we did not encounter during testing to mitigate or fix this.</p><p>As previously mentioned, we observed the same behavior on each operating system we tested, save one. Furthermore, the strength of the encryption algorithm a VPN uses makes no difference. TunnelVision’s effect is independent of the underlying VPN protocol (e.g., WireGuard, OpenVPN, or IPsec) because it reconfigures the operating system network stack the VPN relies on.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><h3>Call to Action</h3><p>We have a limitation as a research team of two– there are simply too many VPNs on the market to test each one individually. The first approach we took was to notify companies via bug bounties or security disclosure email, but that quickly became unscalable. We’ve also engaged the EFF and CISA to help disclose as broadly as possible prior to publicly releasing this research. We thank them tremendously for their help. Our hope is that by publishing our work, we can reach more affected parties, especially because we believe the technique has been feasible since as early as 2002.</p><p>Although the public disclosure of this technique affects each party differently, ultimately there is a shared responsibility.</p><p>Users should be made aware of this technique and for sensitive traffic they should be warned against using untrusted networks. If they must use an untrusted network, they should use a VPN provider that has an effective mitigation against this technique. To determine if a provider has an effective mitigation or fix, our lab setup is available for testing and VPN providers themselves will be able to speak to the specifics of their existing mitigations in their documentation. If a VPN decloak does occur, most user data will not be visible to local network attackers assuming they are accessing websites with HTTPS, which has <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-httpsdefault" target="_blank">become increasingly common</a>.</p><p>It is common for corporate VPNs to be used in areas such as coffee shops, hotels, or airports. Network administrators should inform employees that working from such places carries risks and should be avoided when possible. If such a policy is not practical, then administrators should advise using VPNs that enable the previously mentioned mitigations or fixes. Some alternatives would be to use a trusted hot spot and then connect to the VPN. Lastly, running the VPN inside of a VM that obtains a lease from a virtualized DHCP server would prevent the local networks DHCP server from installing routes altogether.</p><p>Companies that control their own networks or have site-to-site VPNs should review the switches they use and enable features such as DHCP snooping and ARP protections.&nbsp; These layer 2 protections help prevent rogue DHCP servers but do not eliminate a rogue administrator scenario. In addition, implementing HTTPS or other protocols with encryption for internal resources will prevent data leakage from VPN users connecting from untrusted networks.</p><p>VPN providers can add features to clients to configure firewall rules that drop outbound packets to network interfaces. However, such a setting will mean that a VPN user will be isolated from interacting with local network resources. If the VPN client is for Linux and is intended to be a full tunnel, using network namespaces for isolation. As such, VPN providers should publicly provide documentation about any mitigations or fixes they have for TunnelVision and warn their end users about TunnelVision’s existence. We also recommend reviewing their marketing material and cease marketing claims that VPNs protect customers on untrusted networks until it can be proven.</p><p>Operating system maintainers (outside of Linux) should determine whether adding or enhancing features related to network namespaces is feasible. </p><h3>Upcoming Research</h3><p>During the disclosure process, we encountered multiple cases in which the entities we disclosed to did not see this as a serious problem. They assumed that the prerequisite conditions included privileged positions or accounts, despite the only prerequisite being local network access. This assumption was partially fueled by our intentionally simplistic lab setup where we were the only DHCP server, and what we perceive as the entity’s lack of familiarity with low-level networking.</p><p>With this feedback, we decided to develop a robust adversarial infrastructure library to enable further LAN security research and demonstrate practical attacks. For example, we can demonstrate that it’s possible to consistently perform TunnelVision while simply being adjacent to the target host on the same LAN. We’re calling it “ArcaneTrickster” and plan on releasing it at a later date. However, we feature a demo in our videos, which are available in the proof of concept section.</p>

However, it was implied that DHCP only pushed default routes and did not account for DHCP option 121.</p><p>In August 2023, <a href="https://tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com/#summary" target="_blank">a paper</a> was published demonstrating that routing rules can be attacked in different ways to leak VPN traffic. The paper details two methods of leaking VPN traffic:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Abusing non-RFC1918 IP ranges to leak traffic. </p></li><li><p>DNS spoofing the VPN server’s domain name to trick the VPN client into adding a routing rule exception for an IP address.</p></li></ul><p>However, neither technique described in the August 2023 paper leveraged DHCP option 121 to push routes. Pushing routes through DHCP has a significantly higher impact from the same attacker vantage point (the ability to hand out IP leases for a non-RFC1918 range or spoofing DNS replies).</p><h3>In-Depth Diagram Explanation</h3><p>For posterity and because we haven’t encountered another diagram like ours (Figure 4), below are the steps from the diagram in as much detail as we could reasonably provide.
