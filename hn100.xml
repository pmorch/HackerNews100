<h2 id="introductiona-idintroductiona">Introduction<a id="introduction"></a></h2>
<p>In this database design tutorial <em>(~9000 words)</em> I’m going to show how to design the database tables for a real-world project of substantial complexity.</p>
<p>We’ll design a clone of Google Calendar.&nbsp; We will model as much as possible of the functionality that is directly related to the calendar.</p>
<p>This series illustrates an approach explained in the book called “Database Design using Minimal Modeling”, scheduled to be released in Summer 2024.&nbsp; Here is the website of the book: <a href="https://databasedesignbook.com/">https://databasedesignbook.com/</a>.&nbsp; You can leave your email address to receive occasional updates on the book and related materials.</p>
<p>We will first build a complete logical model that describes the calendar data to be stored.&nbsp; This should take most of the effort (~80% of text by word count). After the logical model is finished, we’ll build table design directly based on the logical model.</p>
<h2 id="intended-audiencea-idintended-audiencea">Intended audience<a id="intended-audience"></a></h2>
<p>The goal of the book is to help you get from a vague idea of what you need to implement (e.g.: “I need to build a website to manage schedule and instructor appointments for our gym”), to the full and complete definition of database tables.</p>
<p>The first three quarters of the text require only a general understanding of what databases are and how information is stored there.&nbsp; Parts 1-6 only talk about logical models, that do not depend on the specific database that you use (MySQL, Postgres, other classic relational servers, NoSQL solutions, cloud databases, etc.).&nbsp; So the majority of the text describes how the business requirements are modeled.</p>
<p>The last quarter of the text shows how to get from the logical model to physical tables structure.&nbsp; This part is absolutely not comprehensive, it only shows one of many possible approaches to the database table design.&nbsp; This approach, however, is perfectly valid for not very demanding systems.&nbsp; Also, many existing systems are designed in part using this strategy. &nbsp; This part of the text requires more familiarity with common databases: how the tables are created, what physical data types exist, what is primary key and index, how the tables would be queried, and how to insert and update data.</p>

<h2 id="approach-of-this-booka-idapproach-of-this-booka">Approach of this book<a id="approach-of-this-book"></a></h2>
<p>Often people start with designing the tables right away, but we take a different approach.&nbsp; This tutorial is aimed at people who are new to database design.&nbsp; The goal of the process is to answer several important questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where to begin?&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to make sure that we did not miss anything?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how to ask for feedback on our database design;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>how to fix design mistakes;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We begin with a logical model, written in a simple tabular format.&nbsp; We use short formalized sentences to define data attributes and relationships between entities.&nbsp; This helps us to make sure that our logical model aligns with the actual business requirements. &nbsp; Logical model is independent from a specific database implementation.</p>
<p>As the second step, when the logical model is decided, we design the physical tables.&nbsp; This process is very straightforward.&nbsp; For each element of the logical model there would be a corresponding table or column.&nbsp; Physical models can be as dependent on a specific database implementation as you need.</p>
<h2 id="problem-descriptiona-idproblem-descriptiona">Problem description<a id="problem-description"></a></h2>
<p>We’re going to implement a big part of Google Calendar functionality.&nbsp; Some parts we’ll skip, but we’ll try and implement every feature of calendaring.&nbsp; Some areas we’ll implement just enough to be able to discuss the more interesting parts.&nbsp; In the end you will be able to add missing functionality to the schema, going through the same process.</p>
<p>Google Calendar is a multi-user system.&nbsp; For example, users can share the events with other people.&nbsp; We’re going to implement only a bare minimum of user-related data.</p>
<p>Events are the central part of Google Calendar, and we’re going to design them as closely as possible to the real thing.&nbsp; Events have title and description, as well as some other minor attributes such as location.</p>
<p>The most complex part of calendar events is times and dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“All day” events vs time-based;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both can be repeated and non-repeated;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All day events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can spread over multiple days;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time-based events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can have associated time zone;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have begin and end time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can happen on different days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can be in different timezones;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both all-day and time based events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated daily, or every N days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated weekly, on certain days of the week; again, it can be every two or more weeks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated monthly, on a certain day or day of the week;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can be repeated annually;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeating events can go on forever, until a certain date, or for a certain number of repetitions;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the repeating events, the specific instances can be moved to a different date/time.&nbsp; You can also delete some instances of the repeating events, for example, skipping a certain weekly meeting.</p>
<p>You can change the schedule of the repeated event, even if some of the events already happeneds.&nbsp; For example, you can switch from two project meetings every week on Tuesday and Thursday to one meeting every two weeks, on Fridays.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of a day event editing form:</p>

<h2 id="part-1-basic-all-day-eventsa-idpart-1-basic-all-day-eventsa">Part 1: Basic all-day events<a id="part-1-basic-all-day-events"></a></h2>
<h3 id="anchorsa-idanchorsa">Anchors<a id="anchors"></a></h3>
<p>First thing we need is to find some so-called anchors.&nbsp; Anchors are also known as entities.&nbsp; Anchors are usually nouns, such as <em>User</em> and <em>Event</em>.</p>
<p>Anchors are something that can be counted.&nbsp; “<em>No users</em>”, “<em>one user</em>”, “<em>two users</em>”, etc.&nbsp; Also, one defining characteristic of an anchor is that it can be added: “adds a user record to the database”.</p>
<p>Anchors are extremely obvious in simple cases, but may get tricky in non-obvious cases.&nbsp; We’re going to write down even the most obvious anchors, to get some experience with handling them.</p>
<p>The first two anchors that come to mind are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Basically the only thing that anchors handle is IDs and counting.&nbsp; All the data is handled by attributes, discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>So, for example, in our database tables there would be a User with, say, ID=23, and DayEvent with ID=100, etc.</p>
<p>We won’t be dealing with the last column (“Physical table”) for now, we’ll discuss the physical model in the “Creating SQL Tables” section below.</p>
<p>To validate that we have an anchor, we can write a sentence using the name of this anchor.&nbsp; If this sentence makes sense, then this is an anchor.&nbsp; Example sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 200 Users in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this form is submitted, a new User is added to the database</em>”;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Same for DayEvent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 3000 DayEvents in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this button is clicked, a new DayEvent is created</em>”;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such sentences will be useful later in more complicated cases.</p>
<p>If the sentence does not make sense, then it may be an attribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 400 Prices in our database</em>” (???);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this form is submitted, a new Price is added to the database</em>” (???).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="attributes-of-usera-idattributes-of-usera">Attributes of User<a id="attributes-of-user"></a></h3>
<p>Attributes store the actual information about anchors.</p>
<p>Which data about users should we model?&nbsp; Users are ubiquitous, and different systems may want to store a lot of information about users.&nbsp; For this post, we’re going to model just the bare minimum of user data: emails.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User</strong></td>
<td><strong>What is the email of this User?</strong></td>
<td><strong>string</strong></td>
<td><em>“cjdate@example.org”</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What can we see here?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This attribute belongs to the User <strong>anchor</strong> that was defined in the previous section;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use <strong>questions</strong> to describe all sorts of attributes.&nbsp; Later on we’ll discuss why we prefer this style over “User’s email” and such;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Logical type</strong> is quite simple.&nbsp; If you expected to see “<code>VARCHAR(128)</code>” here or something like that: no, we’ll discuss this much later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We show <strong>an example value</strong> that helps us to confirm our thinking.&nbsp; Again, in simple cases this is very obvious, but it would help reviewers to confirm that everyone is on the same page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We won’t be dealing with two last columns for now, we’ll discuss <strong>the physical model</strong> later in this post.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re going to see more examples of logical types later. We extensively discuss the logical types in the book.</p>
<p>Let’s skip ahead a little bit, and show how the table data about the users looks like.&nbsp; We’ll be using a simple strategy to design physical tables, so the result is going to be completely unsurprising:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Table <code>users</code></th>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>email</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td><em>“cjdate@example.org”</em></td>
<td><em>…</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><em>“someone@else.com”</em></td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is just to show the part of the final result so that you know where we’re heading to.&nbsp; Here, a user with ID=2 has email “<em>cjdate@example.org</em>”, and a user with ID=3 has email “<em>someone@else.com</em>”.</p>
<p>Except for this, we won’t be talking much about the users here.</p>
<h3 id="attributes-of-dayeventa-idattributes-of-dayeventa">Attributes of DayEvent<a id="attributes-of-dayevent"></a></h3>
<p>Suppose that we want to schedule a two-day company retreat that begins on January 14th, 2024.&nbsp; In terms of anchors, this is going to be a DayEvent.</p>
<p>Looking at the paragraph above, we can see that we need to store the following data about the DayEvents:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name of the event;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin date and end date of the event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s write that down in our table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>What is the name of this DayEvent?</strong></td>
<td><strong>string</strong></td>
<td><em>“Company retreat”</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>When does the DayEvent begin?</strong></td>
<td><strong>date</strong></td>
<td><em>2024-01-14</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>When does the DayEvent end?</strong></td>
<td><strong>date</strong></td>
<td><em>2024-01-15</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What can we see here?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We defined our first three attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We don’t have any short names for the attributes, and this may bother us a little.&nbsp; We’d expect to have something like “<em>DayEvent_name</em>” or some other identification to refer to the attribute later in the text.&nbsp; We’ll return to this topic later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have a new logical type: date. We won’t need to deal with timezones in this section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For most events in actual calendars the begin date and end date would probably be the same (most events are single-day).&nbsp; We’ll just store the same date in both attributes.&nbsp; This allows us to treat the special case (single-day events) as the general case (multi-day events).&nbsp; This is a general design strategy, but we’re going to investigate later if this line of thinking is always applicable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="linksa-idlinksa">Links<a id="links"></a></h3>
<p>Where do we store the information that this particular user has created this particular DayEvent?&nbsp; At the first glance, this may look like an attribute of DayEvent, right?&nbsp; (Actually, no).</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>Which User has created this DayEvent???</strong></td>
<td><strong>number???</strong></td>
<td><em>2???</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Attributes cannot contain IDs.&nbsp; Instead, when two anchors are involved, we need to use links.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub><br>* <br><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>
<th>Sentences (subject, verb, object, cardinality)</th>
<th>Cardinality (1:N, M:N, 1:1)</th>
<th>Physical table or column</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User &lt; DayEvent</strong></td>
<td>User creates <em>several</em> DayEvents DayEvent is created by <em>only one</em> User</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Links help to pin down the correct design for many complicated scenarios.&nbsp; To describe the link, you need to write down two sentences.&nbsp; If the sentences don’t make sense or do not match the reality of the business — you’ve just prevented a design mistake!</p>
<p>What do we see in this table?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Link connects <strong>two anchors</strong>.&nbsp; Anchors could be different, like here, or the same. For example, “<em>Employee is a manager of Employee</em>” is one example of one such link.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To specify <strong>cardinality</strong>, we use a custom notation with the “<strong>&lt;</strong>” character (other possibilities are: “<strong>—</strong>”, “<strong>=</strong>”, and “<strong>&gt;</strong>”).&nbsp; It is the same as “1:N”, but additionally it allows you to specify which anchor is “<em>only one</em>” and which is “<em>several</em>”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use <strong>two formalized sentences</strong> that involve two anchors, a verb, and information about cardinality.&nbsp; Those sentences allow us to validate and document our design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We write down the cardinality again, in a more familiar way in a separate column.&nbsp; Pinning down cardinality is essential, so we make a lot of fuss about it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(We’ll discuss the links much more, of course).</p>
<h3 id="a-peek-into-the-physical-modela-ida-peek-into-the-physical-modela">A peek into the physical model<a id="a-peek-into-the-physical-model"></a></h3>
<p>Again skipping ahead: if we would have stopped right now, and tried to write down the physical design for the schema that we have so far, here is what we’d see.&nbsp; This is just to confirm that we’re heading in a familiar direction.</p>

<p>We’ll discuss the physical model later in the “Creating SQL Tables” section.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-time-based-eventsa-idpart-2-time-based-eventsa">Part 2: Time-based events<a id="part-2-time-based-events"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous section, we discussed basic non-repeating date-based events.&nbsp; Let’s see how our modeling approach handles time-based events.</p>
<p>We modeled date-based events as the <em>DayEvent</em> anchor with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>What is the name of this DayEvent?</em>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When does the DayEvent begin?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>When does the DayEvent end?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we defined the link between User and DayEvent: “<em>User creates several DayEvents</em>”.</p>
<p>Let’s write down a quick draft of time-based events and see how it compares to date-based events.&nbsp; Quoting the “problem description” section:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Time-based events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Can have associated time zone;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have begin and end time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can happen on different days;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Begin and end time can be in different timezones;”</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="time-zonesa-idtime-zonesa">Time zones<a id="time-zones"></a></h3>
<p>Every country and territory uses one or more time zones. Time zone definitions occasionally change.&nbsp; Each country, being a sovereign state, can decide to change their time zone definition.</p>
<p>Time zones may use Daylight Savings Time, or can be uniform.&nbsp; New time zones may be introduced, or retired.&nbsp; In this text, we won’t go into complications of handling time zone definitions.&nbsp; If you were really implementing a serious global calendaring solution, you’d probably have a separate team dealing with such issues.</p>
<p>However, in this tutorial we will implement full timezone-aware events that are usable in practice.</p>
<p>We have one motivating example: <strong>plane tickets</strong>.&nbsp; Planes often cross time zone boundaries, and the take-off and landing times in your ticket would be in different time zones. Say, there is a flight from Amsterdam to London that departs on December 24, at 16:50 (Amsterdam time) and lands at 17:05 (London time).&nbsp; So, the flight duration is 1 hour 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Time zones inspire a lot of programming folklore.&nbsp; There are many blog posts, horror stories, “things every programmer should know” and other texts related to time zones, particularly in database context.&nbsp; Also, many systems keep breaking in various ways around the daylight switch time.&nbsp; We will discuss only as much as needed for our purposes, and briefly mention some important things to consider.</p>
<h3 id="anchorsa-idanchors-1a">Anchors<a id="anchors-1"></a></h3>
<p>Having said that, it seems that we need to add two anchors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Timezone</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>TimeEvent</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are dozens of time zones in the world. We can confirm the validity of the Timezone anchor by writing down example sentences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 120 Timezones in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this import script finishes, a new Timezone is added to our database</em>”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(Timezone data structure is discussed below.)</p>
<p>The sentences for TimeEvent are also straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“<em>There are 2500 TimeEvents in our database</em>”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<em>When this button is clicked, a new TimeEvent is created</em>”;</p>

<p>For the purposes of this text, we’ll do only a very minimal model of Timezone.&nbsp; Basically, the only attribute we’d introduce is:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Timezone</strong></td>
<td><strong>What is the human-readable name of this Timezone?</strong></td>
<td><strong>string</strong></td>
<td><em>“Europe/Kyiv”</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We won’t go into details of how the timezone is actually defined.&nbsp; We assume that there is a complementary logical model that describes the structure of timezones.&nbsp; Also, we assume that there is some function that takes a local time in the specified timezone and returns UTC time (and vice-versa).&nbsp; This will be discussed in more detail in the next section, when we will talk about repeating events.</p>
<p>For clarity, here is what else would be included into a time zone definition:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What is the UTC offset of this time zone?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does this time zone have Daylight Savings Time?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When does DST begin?&nbsp; When does DST end?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the UTC offset when DST is on?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We’d also need to model previous definitions of a time zone.&nbsp; For example, the government may decide to change the day when DST goes into force, or get rid of DST, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is this time zone active or retired?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an incomplete list.&nbsp; Modeling all of this data using our approach is possible, but is a separate, and quite technical exercise.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to events.</p>

<p>Note that we’re using local time here.&nbsp; You may have read that time should be stored in UTC time (without any time zones), and then formatted for human readability using a preferred time zone.</p>
<p>Here we have a different situation.&nbsp; Time zones can change.&nbsp; Suppose that we scheduled a billiard game on September 6, 2058, from 09:30 to 11:00, Cologne time.&nbsp; At the moment we don’t know what UTC offset is going to be in that time zone at that time.&nbsp; So we must store the data exactly as entered by the user, and then adjust it as the local legislation changes.</p>
<h3 id="linksa-idlinks-1a">Links<a id="links-1"></a></h3>
<p>We have two very similar links here.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The definitions of both links differ only in a single word (“start” vs “end”).</p>
<p>Most of the time-based events would have the same time zone for both start and end times.&nbsp; We design this as a general case: we always specify both, even if they are the same. This approach would help us to get used to handling more complicated cases.</p>
<h3 id="similarities-between-dateevent-and-timeeventa-idsimilarities-between-dateevent-and-timeeventa">Similarities between DateEvent and TimeEvent<a id="similarities-between-dateevent-and-timeevent"></a></h3>
<p>All-day events and time-based events look similar. Does it make sense to think about unification?</p>
<p>For example, both events have names.&nbsp; Also, how different are “date” and “date with time” from each other? We can also observe that both types of events would have more common data, such as “location”, list of invited guests, “description”, etc.&nbsp; Maybe we could extract that to some component shared between those two anchors?</p>
<p>Thankfully, logical modeling allows us to wait a little bit before making that decision.&nbsp; After all, it’s just simple tables that we can reshuffle before we commit to a physical table implementation.</p>
<p>For now, though, we want to gather more information on similarities (and, more important, dissimilarities) of two types of events that we’ve seen so far.&nbsp; Also, we want to see if there would be more types of events, and what attributes and links they have.</p>
<h2 id="part-3-repeated-all-day-eventsa-idpart-3-repeated-all-day-eventsa">Part 3. Repeated all-day events<a id="part-3-repeated-all-day-events"></a></h2>
<p>As we may remember from the initial problem description:</p>
<p><em>“Both all-day and time based events:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated daily, or every N days;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated weekly, on certain days of the week; again, it can be every two or more weeks;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated monthly, on a certain day or day of the week;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated annually;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Repeating events can go on either forever, or until a certain date, or for a certain number of repetitions;”</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section we’ll only talk about all-day events. Later we’ll see how the Minimal Modeling method handles commonalities between different anchors, in this case time-based events.&nbsp; Also, we’ll see how the logical schema gets changed: we would use this as an example of how the draft design is edited when a better design approach is introduced.&nbsp; Remember that all of this happens before we even start thinking about database tables, so this is a very smooth process: you don’t need to worry about table migrations yet.</p>
<p>If you think about the bullet points listed above, your reaction may be: “we probably need JSON for that”.&nbsp; That may well be true, but JSON belongs to the physical table design, so we won’t discuss this at this point.&nbsp; We’ll design everything that is needed on a logical level, and later on we’ll see what physical options we have.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-1-cadencea-idattribute-1-cadencea">Attribute #1, cadence<a id="attribute-1-cadence"></a></h3>
<p>So, let’s ask the first question, hoping that it would help us find an attribute: “<em>How often is that event repeated?</em>”&nbsp; Looking at event editing form we can see possible answers to that question: a) never; b) daily; c) weekly; d) monthly; e) annually.</p>
<p>We say that such attributes have an “either/or/or” type.&nbsp; Let’s write it down as an attribute.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>How often is that DayEvent repeated?</strong></td>
<td><strong>either/or/or</strong></td>
<td><em>daily weekly monthly annually</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For either/or/or attributes, we show the entire list of possible values in the “Example value” column.</p>
<p>What do we do with never-repeating events?&nbsp; On the logical level, <strong>an attribute can either be set to a specific value, or unset: this is a basic principle of minimal modeling</strong>.&nbsp; So if this attribute is not set then the event would be non-repeating.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-2-tangled-attributesa-idattribute-2-tangled-attributesa">Attribute #2, tangled attributes<a id="attribute-2-tangled-attributes"></a></h3>
<p>Reading further, we see that for all four frequencies, there is an additional possibility.&nbsp; The events can repeat every N days, N weeks, N months, and N years.&nbsp; Let’s write that down.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For repeated events: what is the repetition step?</strong></td>
<td><strong>integer</strong></td>
<td><em>2 (every two days/weeks/etc)</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is our first example of <strong>tangled attributes</strong>.&nbsp; Its value only makes sense when another attribute is set.&nbsp; We specify that by adding “<em>For repeated events:</em> ” as part of the question.</p>
<p>Note that this is only a human-readable notation, we’re not going to discuss here how to write a machine-readable logical schema.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-3a-idattribute-3a">Attribute #3<a id="attribute-3"></a></h3>
<p>When you specify a monthly event, you have two options: repeat on the same day of the month (say, every 16th of the month), or repeat on the same weekday of the month as the original date (say, every second Tuesday).&nbsp; The base date is taken from the normal “When does the DayEvent begin?” attribute that was discussed in the beginning.</p>
<p>Let’s try and define this attribute:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For monthly repeated events: which day of the month does it fall on?</strong></td>
<td><strong>either/or/or</strong></td>
<td><em>same_day</em><br><em>same_weekday</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="days-of-the-week-micro-anchorsa-iddays-of-the-week-micro-anchorsa">Days of the week: micro-anchors<a id="days-of-the-week-micro-anchors"></a></h3>
<p>Events can be repeated weekly, on certain days of the week.&nbsp; So, for example we can have a weekly event that happens on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.&nbsp; Where do we store this?</p>
<p>Let’s start with an attribute that may look like this:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>
<th>Physical column</th>
<th>Physical type</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For weekly repeated events: which days of the week does it fall on?</strong></td>
<td><strong>Array of strings???</strong></td>
<td><em>[“Mon”, “Wed”, “Fri”] ???</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Would it work? Modern database systems such as Postgres and MySQL natively support storing arrays: Postgres has an array type, also they both have JSON type, so you can store an entire array in a single table column.&nbsp; Even though we discuss the logical level, this parallel can help to at least confirm the plausibility of this approach.&nbsp; Also, it’s entirely possible that we’ll decide to store that information in exactly this way, when we will discuss the physical table schema.</p>
<p>However, the approach taken by Minimal Modeling demands that we introduce a new anchor called <em>DayOfTheWeek</em>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
<th>ID example</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayOfTheWeek</strong></td>
<td></td>
<td>“Mon”, “Tue”, “Wed”, “Thu”, “Fri”, “Sat”, “Sun”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is an example of a well-known anchor, similar to currencies, languages and countries.&nbsp; We discuss well-known anchors in <a href="https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/currencies-countries-and-languages">https://minimalmodeling.substack.com/p/currencies-countries-and-languages</a>.</p>
<p><em>DayOfTheWeek</em> may look a bit awkward because it is so tiny. There are only seven possible IDs here, and new ones will never be added. Also, the IDs are unusual because they are strings, and not the commonly used integer numbers. But introducing it helps keep the modeling approach simple.</p>
<p>You can also introduce attributes for this anchor, such as human-readable names of the days of the week.&nbsp; This is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>Now back to our task.&nbsp; We have two anchors: <em>DayEvent</em> and <em>DayOfTheWeek</em>.&nbsp; To connect them, we need a link.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub><br><strong>*</strong> <br><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>
<th>Sentences (subject, verb, object, cardinality)</th>
<th>Cardinality (1:N, M:N, 1:1)</th>
<th>Physical table or column</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent = DayOfTheWeek</strong></td>
<td>For weekly repeated DayEvents: DayEvent may happen on <em>several</em> DaysOfTheWeek DayOfTheWeek can contain <em>several</em> DayEvents</td>
<td><strong>M:N</strong></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This is a pretty normal link, but tangled, like the attributes we’ve seen above.&nbsp; This link only makes sense when it corresponds to the DayEvent that is repeated weekly.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="are-we-donea-idare-we-donea">Are we done?<a id="are-we-done"></a></h3>
<p>How can we make sure that we’re done with modeling?&nbsp; If we are not&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s revisit the original requirements again, and highlight the parts that we’ve covered so far:</p>
<p>“<em>Both</em> <strong><em>all-day</em></strong> <em>and time based events:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>daily</em></strong><em>, or</em> <strong><em>every N</em></strong> <em>days;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>weekly</em></strong><em>, on</em> <strong><em>certain days of the week</em></strong><em>; again, it can be</em> <strong><em>every two or more weeks</em></strong><em>;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>monthly</em></strong><em>, on a</em> <strong><em>certain day</em></strong> <em>or</em> <strong><em>day of the week</em></strong><em>;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Can be repeated</em> <strong><em>annually</em></strong><em>;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Repeating events can go on forever, until a certain date, or for a certain number of repetitions;"</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, we can now see that we forgot about the number of event repetitions.&nbsp; The corresponding part of requirements is not marked in any way. Let’s fix this.</p>
<h3 id="repeat-limit-more-tangled-attributesa-idrepeat-limit-more-tangled-attributesa">Repeat limit: more tangled attributes<a id="repeat-limit-more-tangled-attributes"></a></h3>
<p>“For how long do the periodic events repeat?” This looks like a plausible sentence to define the attribute.&nbsp; There are three possible answers: “forever”, “until a certain date”, and “for a certain number of reps”.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<td><strong>either/or/or</strong></td>
<td><em>forever</em><br><em>until_date</em><br><em>N_repetitions</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now we can add two final missing pieces: which date, and how many repetitions.</p>
<table>

<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent</strong></td>
<td><strong>For events repeated for a certain number of reps: how many reps?</strong></td>
<td><strong>integer</strong></td>
<td><em>10</em></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>We’re done.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly summarize the pieces of data that we defined here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>anchor: <em>DayEvent</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>attribute: How often is it repeated?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>attribute: (for monthly) Which day does it fall on?</p>

<p>attribute: (for number of reps) How many times is it repeated?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>

</ul>
<p>One extra anchor; six attributes, some of them tangled; one link.</p>
<h2 id="part-4-rendering-the-calendar-pagea-idpart-4-rendering-the-calendar-pagea">Part 4. Rendering the calendar page<a id="part-4-rendering-the-calendar-page"></a></h2>
<p>So far we’ve discussed the book-keeping part of the calendar. We have only one record for the entire series of events.&nbsp; Ten weekly project status meetings correspond to a <em>single</em> database record.&nbsp; Unlimited number of birthdays of our friend correspond to a <em>single</em> database record.</p>
<p>Let’s get back to the application that we’re working on: a calendar.&nbsp; We need to show a weekly view of the user’s calendar: say, seven days starting from 26th of Feb up to 3rd of Mar.&nbsp; Which events do we need to show on that page?&nbsp; Say, there is one of the weekly project status meetings (out of ten) happening that week. If the birthday (annual event) falls on that week we need to show it.</p>
<p>So, we need to write some sort of SQL query that looks like this pseudo-code:</p>
<pre><code>SELECT …
FROM …
WHERE &lt;date&gt; BETWEEN ‘2024-02-26’ AND ‘2024-03-26’;
</code></pre>
<p>Maybe this would even be several SQL queries, or even some code in a programming language.&nbsp; The data structure that we’ve considered so far is quite complicated.&nbsp; To find the events that must be shown on a certain week, you need to take a lot into account. This may quickly become impractical.</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-tempoa-ida-note-on-tempoa">A note on tempo<a id="a-note-on-tempo"></a></h3>
<p>I’ve been writing this chapter in the course of a few months.&nbsp; I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot.&nbsp; I have a quite clear understanding of the end state that I have in mind,&nbsp; I just need to write it down.</p>
<p>But if I were to present to you the complete table design right now, it wouldn’t be useful for our goal: to learn database design.&nbsp; You won’t understand why I made certain decisions.</p>
<p>At the same time, I don’t want to present very small incremental changes, so that text is not too long.&nbsp; So we need to find some middle ground.</p>
<p>We started this section with a question of how to render a weekly page.&nbsp; Let’s remember another requirement that our calendar application definitely has: <strong>changing and canceling some events from the series</strong>. Say, you have ten weekly project meetings, but you want to cancel one of them because the weather is very good. The existing book-keeping part of our database model won’t change.&nbsp; But we need to add some anchors, attributes and links for the second half: rendering and modification.</p>
<h3 id="general-ideaa-idgeneral-ideaa">General idea<a id="general-idea"></a></h3>
<p>We want to introduce a new anchor that would store the information about <em>each event in the series</em>.&nbsp; So, if we have 10 weekly project status meetings, we’re going to have ten rows in some table.&nbsp; Each record would correspond to a specific date (e.g., <em>2024-02-12</em>, <em>2024-02-19</em>, etc.).</p>
<p>First, this would make our rendering very simple.&nbsp; You have a very easy way to find all the events that fall on a specific day.</p>
<p>Second, this would allow us to reschedule and cancel some events in the series.&nbsp; If we have a project meeting at 12:00 normally, but on a certain week we want to move it to 14:00 (or even to a different day), we can do that. Data in the original book-keeping anchor, TimeEvent, that we defined previously, won’t change.</p>
<p>Also, if we just want to skip one project status meeting, we can mark this particular day as skipped.</p>
<h3 id="day-slotsa-idday-slotsa">Day slots<a id="day-slots"></a></h3>
<p>First, we have to find a name for those things.&nbsp; In some cases this may be a challenge.&nbsp; Just five minutes ago, having another cup of tea, I realized that a good word for this thing is “slot”.</p>
<p>Also, like before, we’re going to treat per-day and time-based events differently.&nbsp; So, we’re going to have <em>DaySlot</em> and <em>TimeSlot</em> anchors.&nbsp; Let’s discuss per-day slots first.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Anchor</th>
<th>Physical table</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>DaySlot</strong></td>
<td></td>

</tbody>

<p><em>DaySlot</em> needs a surprisingly small number of attributes:</p>
<table>
<thead>

<th>Question</th>
<th>Logical type</th>
<th>Example value</th>

<td><strong>Is this DaySlot skipped?</strong></td>
<td><strong>yes/no</strong></td>
<td><em>yes</em></td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that the user can change the date for a specific slot!&nbsp; So, we see that this requirement is handled cleanly.</p>
<p>Also, we need to establish a link between DaySlot and the corresponding DayEvent.</p>
<table>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Some things to note: first, <strong>we always create a DaySlot for every DayEvent, even for non-repeating ones</strong>.&nbsp; This is needed to simplify the rendering code.</p>
<p>Second, we have an interesting <strong>problem with “infinite” events</strong>.&nbsp; Suppose that we added our friend’s birthday to the calendar, repeating annually.&nbsp; How many corresponding DaySlots do we need to create?&nbsp; One possible solution would be to choose some arbitrary limit such as 100 years in the future, and create all the slots for that.&nbsp; Other solutions are possible, such as on-demand creation when user requests to show a calendar page in some distant future.</p>
<p>Third, if you think about this, it’s possible that more information could also be <strong>different for each slot</strong>.&nbsp; For example, it’s possible that some meetings will take place in different locations.&nbsp; Also, the guest list may change: you can invite extra people to a certain meeting.&nbsp; Also, the attendance would certainly be different.&nbsp; We won’t cover those aspects here, because modeling this it’s pretty straightforward: just add more links that connect DaySlot with other anchors.</p>
<p>Also, one thing to consider is that <strong>date arithmetics needs a bit of care</strong>.&nbsp; How do we deal with birthdays of people who were born on February 29?&nbsp; We will have to decide something.&nbsp; Maybe we’ll prohibit the user from creating such events?&nbsp; Maybe we’ll ask them where to move the slot: day earlier or day later?&nbsp; Similar problem also exists for monthly events that happen on the 31st day of the month.</p>
<h3 id="exercise-timeslotsa-idexercise-timeslotsa">Exercise: TimeSlots<a id="exercise-timeslots"></a></h3>
<p>Here is an exercise for the determined reader.&nbsp; Think about how you would model the <em>TimeSlot</em> anchor, its attributes and links.&nbsp; Fill in the tables with anchors, links and attributes, using the format explained above.&nbsp; Think about what role would time zones play.</p>
<h3 id="how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka-idhow-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-thinka">How far ahead do you need to think?<a id="how-far-ahead-do-you-need-to-think"></a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you can create a better design if you consider a slightly broader set of requirements.&nbsp; We did it in this chapter: we started thinking about rendering the page, but then we also considered the need to modify some events in the series.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can create a better design if you consider requirements independently.&nbsp; In the previous chapters, we looked at time-based and per-day events, and decided to handle them separately for now.</p>
<p>So far we did not even mention any hypothetical future requirements.&nbsp; We’ve only been designing stuff that we know is needed.&nbsp; Can we think up something that would be nice to have in the future, and design ahead? If you only include known requirements, there is a chance of overfitting design for known data points.</p>
<p>At the same time, people sometimes introduce considerations that never actually materialize.&nbsp; In this case design may introduce extra complexity that is not needed for the actual requirements, adding a bit of friction.</p>
<p>There is always a chance of leaning towards one of those traps, or even falling into them.</p>
<p>Logical design based on Minimal Modeling insists on modeling only the parts that we actually know are needed.&nbsp; We can afford that because Minimal Modeling treats changing requirements as a given.&nbsp; Also, Minimal Modeling discourages you from adding more abstract concepts, and this is intentional.</p>
<p>We’ll discuss this aspect of physical design later in the book. We’ll introduce the concept of Game of Tables, and the idea of Date’s Demon.</p>

<p>For repeated time-based events, we choose the same approach as with all-day events.&nbsp; We’re going to introduce an anchor called “<em>TimeSlot</em>”.&nbsp; <em>TimeSlot</em> corresponds to a specific event on a specific date and time.&nbsp; A repeated event corresponds to several <em>TimeSlots</em>.</p>
<p>Time slots can be rescheduled or canceled manually, just like all-day slots.</p>

<p>A specific time slot can generally be moved even to a different day, so we have to keep this information also.&nbsp; Which time zone shall we use for the begin/end time?&nbsp; As you may remember from Part 2, in Google Calendar you can have different time zones for begin and end time.&nbsp; If you think about that, it makes sense to keep it for the time slots also.</p>

<p>Finally, here is a diagram that shows all anchors and links (but not attributes):</p>
<p><img src="https://kb.databasedesignbook.com/posts/google-calendar-diagram.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="part-7-creating-sql-tablesa-idpart-7-creating-sql-tablesa">Part 7. Creating SQL tables<a id="part-7-creating-sql-tables"></a></h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we defined the complete logical model, so most of the work is actually already done. The rest is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>For teaching purposes we’re going to use one specific table design strategy: “one table per anchor”.&nbsp; It is one of the most common approaches to physical table design. There are several more possible strategies, we’re going to discuss them in a book.</p>
<p>We have 7 anchors, 21 attributes and 10 links so far.&nbsp; Given that we use “one table per anchor” strategy, we’re going to have 7 + 2 = 9 tables (number of anchors + number of M:N links), and 21 + 8 = 29 columns in total (number of attributes + number of 1:N links).</p>
<p>If our logical design correctly describes the business requirements then the tables will be automatically correct.&nbsp; We’ll talk about evolving requirements in the book.&nbsp; Also, we’ll discuss design mistakes and how to fix them.</p>
<p>We’re going to revisit the tables from the previous section, and fill in our choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For anchors, fill in “Physical table” columns;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each attribute, fill in “Physical column”, and choose the “Physical type”;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each M:N link, choose the name of the physical table;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each 1:N link, fill in the column name in the table that corresponds to the N-side anchor;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anchors-choose-names-for-tablesa-idanchors-choose-names-for-tablesa">Anchors: choose names for tables<a id="anchors-choose-names-for-tables"></a></h3>
<p>Here we just choose a straightforward plural name for each table.</p>

<p>Some companies or applications enforce different naming conventions (singular, camel case, etc.).&nbsp; In that case, you would just use the names that comply with the convention.</p>
<h3 id="attributes-choose-the-column-name-and-physical-typea-idattributes-choose-the-column-name-and-physical-typea">Attributes: choose the column name and physical type<a id="attributes-choose-the-column-name-and-physical-type"></a></h3>
<p>For the <strong>physical column name</strong>, we choose some sensible name.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>day_events.end_date</code> would be the column name for the “When does the DayEvent begin?” attribute;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>​​<code>time_slots.is_skipped </code>would be the column name for the “Is this TimeSlot skipped?” attribute</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.&nbsp; Due to the way relational databases work, you have to choose a very short name.&nbsp; In many cases this name by itself is not enough to fully explain the meaning of the data.&nbsp; That’s one of the reasons why we begin with the logical schema, and use longer human-readable questions to define the semantics of the attributes.</p>
<p>For the <strong>physical type</strong>, we choose a sensible type without much discussion.&nbsp; This topic is covered extensively in the book. There is also a list of recommended data types for each logical type in the book, and we just use that directly.</p>
<p>If you’re working with an existing system, you may be required to choose an alternative physical data type for the column.&nbsp; For example, your database server may support a better suited data type; or there could be some engineering guidelines that make you choose a different data type.</p>
<p>We’re going to discuss this variance in the book.&nbsp; However, full discussion of all physical design concerns is well outside of the scope of <em>any</em> book.&nbsp; This is the stuff that you spend your career on learning, and it changes as new technologies emerge.</p>

<p>For this problem, we’ve used around half of logical attribute types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>string: 4 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date: 4 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>either/or/or: 3 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integer: 2 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>date/time (local): 4 attributes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>yes/no: 2 attributes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that the physical definitions of attributes of the same logical type are almost the same.&nbsp; The only differences are: a) maximum length of strings; and b) <code>NULL</code> vs <code>NOT NULL</code>.</p>
<p>We choose “<code>NOT NULL</code>” for attributes where the value always needs to be there due to business requirements.&nbsp; For example, the name of the event, or the start date of the all-day event.&nbsp; For tangled attributes, we choose nullable physical types (“<code>NULL</code>”).&nbsp; We discuss nullability in the book, but note that “NULL” only exists in the physical schema.</p>
<p>Just as NULLs, so-called “sentinel values” also do not exist in logical modeling.</p>
<h3 id="1n-linksa-id1n-linksa">1:N Links<a id="1n-links"></a></h3>
<p>For 1:N links, we add a column to the N-side anchor table.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>1</sub><br>* <br><sup>⚓</sup>Anchor<sub>2</sub></th>
<th>Sentences (subject, verb, object, cardinality)</th>
<th>Cardinality (1:N, M:N, 1:1)</th>
<th>Physical table or column</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>User &lt; DayEvent</strong></td>
<td>User creates <em>many</em> DayEvents DayEvent is created by <em>only one</em> User</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>
<td><code>day_events.user_id</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>DayEvent &lt; DaySlot</strong></td>
<td>DayEvent may generate <em>several</em> DaySlots DaySlot corresponds to <em>only one</em> DayEvent</td>
<td><strong>1:N</strong></td>
<td><code>day_slots.day_event_id</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Choosing the column name is usually quite easy.&nbsp; The only complication could be when there are two and more different links between the same two anchors.&nbsp; We have that situation with the timezones, and we’ll use two different columns.</p>
<h3 id="mn-linksa-idmn-linksa">M:N links<a id="mn-links"></a></h3>
<p>For M:N links we must use a separate table for each link.&nbsp; Every such table will have almost identical structure, only the column names would be different.</p>
<p>We only need to find a good name for such a table.&nbsp; There is no naming method that works in all cases, you will have to try some combinations, looking for readability.&nbsp; For links this is especially difficult because it’s not clear which of the two anchors is more important and should come first.</p>
<p>Same as with attributes, due to the way relational databases work, the name of the table needs to be quite short.&nbsp; In many cases the name by itself is not enough to fully explain the meaning of the data.&nbsp; That’s one of the reasons why we prepare logical schema, and use human-readable sentences to define the semantics of the links.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is the full table of links with the names chosen for the tables and columns (see the last column).</p>

<p>Is that really it?&nbsp; Mostly, yes. Though we need to talk a bit about indexes and about the attributes that we’ve skipped for brevity.</p>
<p>Most experienced database developers would look at the schema above and immediately notice that some “obvious” indexes are missing.&nbsp; For example, <code>day_events.user_id</code> must certainly be indexed.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there is no hard and fast rule on what columns (and combinations of columns) need to be indexed.&nbsp; That depends on how the tables are going to be queried by the application.&nbsp; The best book about database indexes is called “Use The Index, Luke” (<a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/">https://use-the-index-luke.com/</a>).&nbsp; Go read it.&nbsp; We&nbsp; will also discuss indexes in a bit more detail in the book.</p>
<p>When we were talking about logical schema (especially in the beginning), we skipped some of the attributes, because they were very much similar to other attributes. For example, we would probably want to add the name of the user, and the column that stores the user’s password hash.&nbsp; Some of the data elements just don’t add anything new to this text, for example the event location, or the list of invited guests.&nbsp; As an exercise, you could go ahead and add the elements that we did not discuss, the ones that you’re interested in.&nbsp; Add a few rows to the catalog tables, fill in the contents of each cell, and then edit the schema definition above to include the missing pieces of data.</p>

            <h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Digital audio processing is a complex yet fascinating subject. Linux, known for its robust and flexible system architecture, runs a sophisticated audio stack that can be particularly daunting to understand. Grasping it properly requires knowledge in multiple technical disciplines, including physics, electrical/electronical engineering, and software engineering specific to the Linux ecosystem. This article aims to demystify the Linux audio stack by explaining the basics of sound, how humans perceive sound, and the workings of digital audio. We will then delve into the components that make up the Linux audio system and explore how these interact. Buckle up; it’s going to be a long and informative read.</p>
            <h2 id="Exclaimer"><a href="#Exclaimer" title="Exclaimer"></a>Exclaimer</h2>
            <p>In this article, I will simplify concepts and ideas to provide you with the basic knowledge needed to follow along. Each chapter could easily be expanded into a dedicated, lengthy blog post. However, for simplicity’s sake, I have refrained from doing so. If you would like further details about a specific chapter, please feel free to contact me or leave a comment. I’ll be happy to delve into more detail if needed.</p>
            <h2 id="Understanding-Sound-and-Sound-Waves"><a href="#Understanding-Sound-and-Sound-Waves" title="Understanding Sound and Sound Waves"></a>Understanding Sound and Sound Waves</h2>
            <p>Before delving into the technicalities of audio processing, it’s essential to understand what sound is. In a nutshell, sound is a vibration that propagates as an acoustic wave through a medium such as air. These waves are created by vibrating objects (such as speakers, headphones, piezo buzzers, etc.), causing fluctuations in air pressure that our ears can pick up and perceive as sound. Audio waves can have many shapes, the most common waveform is the sine wave. It is the fundamental building block for all other waves existing, and thus it’s important to learn about the sine wave first.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/sine-wave-fundamentals.svg" alt="Sine-Wave Fundamentals"></p>
            <p>All waveforms have 2 fundamental key properties:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>Period (duration)</code>: The time it takes the wave to perform a single oscillation.</li>
              <li><code>Amplitude</code>: This represents the wave’s strength or intensity, which we perceive as volume. Higher amplitudes generally correspond to louder sounds.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We can derive the <code>Frequency</code> from the period duration of a wave form. The frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz), and it represents the number of oscillations (waves) per second. Higher frequencies correspond to higher-pitched sounds. In other words, the shorter the period duration, the higher the pitch. The higher the frequency the higher the pitch. Thus, the frequency is the inverse of the period duration, or in mathematical terms:</p>
            <p><code>f = 1 / (period duration[s]) = (period duration[s])⁻¹</code>.</p>
            <p>Amplitudes can be measured as the pressure variation in the air - the so called Sound Pressure Level (SPL). The standard unit for pressure is Pascal (Pa). In audio contexts, we often deal with very small pressures, so micropascals (µPa) are typically used. However, the most common way of describing amplitude is Decibels (dB). Decibels are a logarithmic unit used to describe the ratio of a particular sound level to a given reference level. Decibels are the preferred unit, because the human ear perceives sound pressure levels logarithmically. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><code>dB SPL</code>: Sound pressure level in decibels. In air, the reference pressure is typically 20 µPa (typically referred to as <code>P0</code>), the threshold of human hearing. It is calculated using the formula <code>SPL = 20 * log₁₀(P/P0)</code>, where <code>P</code> is the measured pressure and <code>P0</code>​ is the reference pressure (20 µPa). </li>
              <li><code>dBV</code> and <code>dBu</code>: When sound is converted into an electrical signal by a microphone, the amplitude can be measured in volts (V). This is common in audio equipment and recording. <code>dBV</code> and <code>dBU</code> are units for voltage measurements in audio systems, referencing 1 volt for dBV or 0.775 volts for dBu. Similarily to <code>db SPL</code>, <code>dbV and dBu</code> can be calculated using the same formula, just exchange the reference pressure with a reference voltage. dBV = 20 * log₁₀(V/V0)<code>, where </code>V<code>is the measured voltage and</code>V0`​ is the reference voltage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You might wonder how a sine wave actually sounds like? Here’s an example of a sine wave at a frequency of 440 Hz. Please check your volume before you play!</p>
            
            <h2 id="How-humans-process-sound-waves"><a href="#How-humans-process-sound-waves" title="How humans process sound waves"></a>How humans process sound waves</h2>
            <p>Sound waves are captured by the <code>pinna</code>, the visible part of the outer ear. The pinna helps direct sound waves into the ear canal. The sound waves travel through the ear canal and reach the eardrum (tympanic membrane). The sound waves cause the eardrum to vibrate (very similar to sound waves bring microphone membranes to vibrate). These vibrations correspond to the frequency and amplitude of the incoming sound waves. The vibrations from the eardrum are transmitted to the three tiny bones in the middle ear, known as the ossicles (malleus, incus, and stapes). The ossicles amplify the vibrations and transmit them to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The vibrations pass through the oval window and enter the cochlea, a spiral-shaped, fluid-filled structure in the inner ear. Inside the cochlea, the vibrations create waves in the cochlear fluid, causing the basilar membrane to move. The movement of the basilar membrane stimulates tiny hair cells located on it. These hair cells convert mechanical vibrations into electrical signals through a process called transduction. Different frequencies of sound stimulate different parts of the basilar membrane, allowing the ear to distinguish between various pitches. The hair cells release neurotransmitters in response to their movement, which generates electrical impulses in the auditory nerve. These electrical signals travel along the auditory nerve to the brain. The auditory signals reach the auditory cortex in the brain, where they are processed and interpreted as recognizable sounds, such as speech, music, or noise.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/human-ear-anatomy.png" alt="Anatomy of the human ear"></p>
            <p>Hard facts to better understand the dimensions of sound waves:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The typical frequency range of human hearing is from ~20 Hz to ~20.000 Hz (20 kHz). This range can vary with age and exposure to loud sounds.</li>
              <li>The frequency of humans speaking typically falls within the range of ~300 Hz to ~3.400 Hz (3.4 kHz).</li>
              <li>Human ears are most sensitive to frequencies between 2,000 Hz and 5,000 Hz.</li>
              <li>The quietest sound that the average human ear can hear is around 0 dB SPL (sound pressure level), equivalent to 20 micropascals.</li>
              <li>The loudest sound that the average human ear can tolerate without pain is around 120-130 dB SPL. Sounds above this level can cause immediate hearing damage.</li>
              <li>The range between the threshold of hearing and the threshold of pain is known as the dynamic range of human hearing, which is approximately 120 dB.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="How-Digital-Audio-Works"><a href="#How-Digital-Audio-Works" title="How Digital Audio Works"></a>How Digital Audio Works</h2>
            <p>Now, that we got a rudimentary understanding of sound waves in the analog world work, let’s continue with sound waves in a world of zeroes and ones.<br>When we talk about audio in a digital context, we’re referring to sound that’s been captured, processed, and played back using computers.</p>
            <h3 id="Audio-Input-and-Sampling"><a href="#Audio-Input-and-Sampling" title="Audio-Input and Sampling"></a>Audio-Input and Sampling</h3>
            <p>Sampling to computers is what hearing is to humans. Sampling is the process of converting analog sound waves into digital data that a computer can process. This is done by taking regular measurements of the amplitude of the sound wave at fixed intervals. The rate at which these samples are taken is called the sampling rate and is measured in samples per second (Hz). Common sampling rates include 44.1 kHz (CD quality) and 48 kHz (professional audio).</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/sine-wave-sampling.svg" alt="Sampling rate on a sine wave"></p>
            <p>Each lollipop on the sine wave represents a single discrete sample/measurmeent. The first oscillation has a higher sample rate, the second oscillation has a lower sample rate for demonstration purposes only. Typically, the sample rate is constant, and more than double of the highest frequency humans can hear.</p>
            <h4 id="Nyquist-Shannon"><a href="#Nyquist-Shannon" title="Nyquist-Shannon"></a>Nyquist-Shannon</h4>
            <p>The Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem is a fundamental principle in the field of digital signal processing. It provides a criterion for determining the minimum sampling rate that allows a continuous signal to be perfectly reconstructed from its samples. A continuous-time signal that has been bandlimited to a maximum frequency fmax (meaning it contains no frequency components higher than fmax​) can be completely and perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling rate fs is greater than twice the maximum frequency of the signal.</p>
            <p>Mathematically, this can be expressed as: <code>fs &gt; 2 * fmax</code></p>
            <p>This nicely explains why common sampling rate are typically a little bit more than double of the human hearing range (e.g. 44.1 kHz for CD quality).</p>
            <h4 id="Quantization"><a href="#Quantization" title="Quantization"></a>Quantization</h4>
            <p>In the analog world, signals have infinite precision. For example, if you zoom in on a sine wave, you can always find more detail — the waveform continues to be smooth and precise no matter how closely you examine it. However, in the digital world, precision is limited. To understand this limitation, consider this question: “How many numbers can you represent between 0 and 1?” If you use 0.1 as the smallest possible increment value, you can only represent 10 discrete values between 0 and 1. If you refine the smallest increment to 0.01, you get 100 values between 0 and 1. In the analog realm, there’s no smallest possible increment; values can be infinitely precise. But in digital systems, precision is constrained by the number of bits used to represent the signal. Digital audio uses a fixed number of bits to encode each sample of sound. For instance, in a common 16-bit audio system, there are 65,536 discrete levels available to represent the amplitude of each sample. This means that the smallest difference between two levels, or the smallest possible increment, is approximately 0.000030518.</p>
            <p>The process of approximating each sample’s amplitude to the nearest value within these discrete levels is known as quantization. The number of discrete levels depends on the bit depth of the audio. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>16-bit audio provides 65.536 possible amplitude values.</li>
              <li>24-bit audio offers 16.777.216 possible amplitude values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Quantization is essential because it allows us to represent analog signals with a finite number of discrete values, making digital storage and processing feasible, even though we sacrifice some level of precision compared to the analog world. For all the audiophiles reading this: 24-bit resolution is enough! No, you don’t hear the difference between analog signals and 24-bit digital signals.</p>
            <h4 id="Storing-Digital-Audio-signals"><a href="#Storing-Digital-Audio-signals" title="Storing Digital Audio signals?"></a>Storing Digital Audio signals?</h4>
            <p>With an understanding of sampling and quantization, we can now explore how digital audio can be stored. For illustrative purposes, let’s consider designing a basic audio format to store digital audio, using the simplicity of the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format as our foundation. Although this proposed format would be inefficient compared to established audio formats like MP3, WAV, or FLAC, it serves as a useful exercise in understanding the principles behind audio file storage. CSV files are a familiar format for many, used to store tabular data in a straightforward, readable manner. They consist of rows and columns separated by commas, making them an ideal starting point for conceptualizing audio storage. The key here is to recognize that a sampled audio signal can be represented similarly to a table in a spreadsheet, where each row corresponds to a discrete sample in time.</p>
            <p>Let’s define a CSV-based audio format with the following structure:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sample Index: Each row represents a discrete sample point. For example, in the case of a sine wave, each row corresponds to a specific point along the waveform. Typically the sample index is just a self-incrementing number. </li>
              <li>Quantized Value: The second column contains the quantized amplitude value for each sample.</li>
              <li>for simplicity sake, we assume that the sample rate is 44.1 kHz (this information is needed for later playback) and the bit depth is statically set to 16 bit.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>a simple CSV file could like this:</p>
            <pre data-language="csv"><code>Sample Index, Quantized Value
1, 0.32767
2, 0.32780
3, 0.32809
4, 0.32853
...</code></pre>
            <p>While CSV is of course not a practical choice for real-world audio storage due to its inefficiency and lack of support for metadata, compression, multiple channels, and other critical features, this exercise helps illustrate the fundamental concepts of how digital audio data can be organized and stored. Real-world formats like MP3, WAV, and FLAC utilize more sophisticated techniques to handle audio data efficiently, like</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Compression, for reducing file size while maintaining audio quality.</li>
              <li>Metadata, for storing additional information about the audio file, such as title, artist, and duration, sample rate, bit-depth</li>
              <li>Error Correction for ensuring data integrity during storage and playback.</li>
              <li>as well as support for multiple channels (e.g. for stereo signals)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="Mono-and-Stereo"><a href="#Mono-and-Stereo" title="Mono and Stereo"></a>Mono and Stereo</h4>
            <p><code>Mono</code> (short for monaural) refers to audio that is recorded and played back through a single channel. In a mono audio setup, all sounds are combined into one channel, and this single channel is then played through one or more speakers or headphones. The primary advantage of mono audio is its simplicity and the uniformity it provides — sound is uniformly distributed regardless of how many speakers are used. This makes mono suitable for applications where spatial sound is not crucial, such as telephone conversations or certain types of spoken-word recordings. Even audio on bigger venues is typical in mono.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <code>stereo</code> (short for stereophonic) involves two audio channels: left and right. Stereo recording captures sound from two distinct channels, creating a sense of spatial separation between sounds. This allows for a more immersive listening experience because different sounds can be directed to different speakers or headphones. For instance, in a stereo mix, you might hear a guitar predominantly through the left speaker and a vocal through the right speaker. This spatial separation mimics the way humans naturally hear sounds in real life, making stereo particularly effective for music, movies, and other applications where a realistic sound field enhances the experience.</p>
            <h3 id="Audio-Output"><a href="#Audio-Output" title="Audio-Output"></a>Audio-Output</h3>
            <p>We’ve learned a lot about audio waves, and how audio waves can be captured and stored. Now it’s time to move forward and think about how digitally stored audio is played back. As we’ve discussed in the previous article, digital audio data is typically stored as a sequence of discrete samples that represent the amplitude of a sound wave at various points. This data is then streamed to your computers sound card. A DAC (Digital-To-Analog) converter converts these digital values into a continuous analog signal. This conversion process typically involves 2 steps. First, the digital samples are mapped to discrete voltage levels. In case your sound card outputs line-level, the highest possible digital representable value would map to 0.447V (447 mV). To smooth out the discrete steps and reconstruct a continuous waveform, the DAC uses a low-pass filter. This filter removes high-frequency artifacts (often referred to as “sampling noise”) that result from the discrete nature of the digital data. Finally, the filtered analog signal is sent to the output stage, which drives the speakers or headphones.</p>
            <h2 id="The-Role-of-a-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface"><a href="#The-Role-of-a-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface" title="The Role of a Sound Card / Audio Interface"></a>The Role of a Sound Card / Audio Interface</h2>
            <p>A sound card is a important component in a computer’s audio system. It handles the input and output of audio signals, converting between analog and digital forms. Sound cards typically include ADCs for recording, DACs for playback, and additional circuitry for audio processing.</p>
            <p>Typical Components of a Sound Card:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ADCs (Analog-to-Digital Converters): Converts analog signals from microphones or other input devices into digital data.</li>
              <li>DACs (Digital-to-Analog Converters): Converts digital audio data into analog signals for playback through speakers or headphones.</li>
              <li>Amplifiers: Boosts the audio signal to a level that can drive speakers or headphones.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="What-makes-a-good-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface"><a href="#What-makes-a-good-Sound-Card-x2F-Audio-Interface" title="What makes a good Sound Card / Audio Interface?"></a>What makes a good Sound Card / Audio Interface?</h3>
            <p>Often times I get the question what audio interface is a good audio interface. Typically I don’t want to recommend a particular brand, but explain people what they should look for when comparing audio interfaces. Here’s a short and opinionated set of aspects you should look out for.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): A high SNR indicates that the sound card produces clear audio with minimal background noise. Look for a sound card with a high SNR, typically 100 dB or higher.</li>
              <li>Total Harmonic Distortion (THD): Low THD means that the sound card introduces minimal distortion to the audio signal. Good sound cards often have THD ratings below 0.01%.</li>
              <li>Dynamic Range: A wide dynamic range allows the sound card to accurately reproduce both very quiet and very loud sounds without distortion or noise.</li>
              <li>Sampling Rate: A higher sampling rate allows for more accurate representation of audio. Common high-quality sound cards support rates up to 192 kHz or higher.</li>
              <li>Bit Depth: A higher bit depth enables better resolution of audio details. Good sound cards support 24-bit depth, providing a broader range of amplitudes and finer detail.</li>
              <li>Low Latency: Good sound cards have low latency, which is essential for real-time applications like gaming, live recording, and professional audio production. Latency is the delay between input and output, and lower latency ensures more immediate audio responses.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s delve into how Linux manages audio. The Linux audio system employs a modular and layered architecture to handle audio processing, which provides both abstraction and flexibility. Layering in Linux audio allows for a structured approach to audio management. By separating concerns into different layers, the system abstracts the complexities of lower-level operations, such as direct hardware interactions. This separation means that user-space applications do not need to deal with the specifics of hardware configurations, streamlining development and improving compatibility. Modularity complements this layered approach by allowing individual components to be swapped or reconfigured without disrupting the entire system. This means that different layers or components can be replaced or updated as needed. For example, if you plug in a headset, the system can dynamically switch from speaker output to headset output thanks to its modular design. Similarly, if you change your sound card or audio driver, the modular system can adapt without requiring extensive reconfiguration.</p>
            <h3 id="ALSA-Advanced-Linux-Sound-Architecture"><a href="#ALSA-Advanced-Linux-Sound-Architecture" title="ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)"></a>ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)</h3>
            <p>Let’s start with the foundation of all Linux systems when it comes to audio. ALSA is the core layer of the Linux audio stack. It provides low-level audio hardware control, including drivers for sound cards and basic audio functionality. ALSA provides a standardized interface for audio hardware, allowing applications to interact with sound cards and other audio devices without needing to know the specifics of the hardware. It includes a set of drivers for different types of sound cards and audio interfaces. These drivers translate the high-level audio commands from applications into low-level instructions understood by the hardware.</p>
            <p>ALSA operates in the kernel space, meaning it interacts directly with the Linux kernel. This position allows it to manage hardware resources and perform low-level audio operations efficiently. To allow the user space from profiting from ALSA, ALSA provides libraries and tools in user space, such as <code>libasound</code> (the ALSA library), which applications use to interface with the ALSA kernel drivers. This library offers functions for audio playback, recording, and control.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/alsamixer.png" alt="Alsa Mixer - an application to control ALSA from th user space"></p>
            <p>ALSA supports multi-channel audio, enabling configurations like 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. Additionally, it is designed to offer low-latency audio processing, which is essential for real-time applications like music production. Further, ALSA includes a mixer interface that allows users to control audio levels and settings, such as adjusting volume or muting channels.</p>
            <h3 id="JACK"><a href="#JACK" title="JACK"></a>JACK</h3>
            <p>JACK (the Jack Audio Connection Kit) is a professional-grade audio server designed for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It is tailored for real-time, low-latency audio processing and is widely used in professional audio production environments. JACK is designed to provide low-latency, real-time audio processing. This is essential for applications where timing and synchronization are critical, such as live music performance, recording, and audio production. It allows multiple audio applications to connect and communicate with each other. This means that the output of one application can be routed to the input of another, enabling complex audio processing chains.</p>
            <p>JACK excels in delivering minimal latency, which is crucial for real-time audio tasks. This ensures that audio signals are processed and transmitted with minimal delay, maintaining synchronization and responsiveness. It offers sample-accurate synchronization between audio streams, ensuring precise timing and phase alignment across different audio applications and devices. JACK uses a client-server model, where the JACK server manages audio data and clients (applications) connect to it for audio processing. This modular approach allows for flexibility and scalability in audio setups. JACK includes transport control features that allow users to synchronize playback and recording across multiple applications, making it easier to manage complex audio projects. JACK builds on top of ALSA and requires ALSA to be installed and configured correctly.</p>
            <h3 id="PulseAudio"><a href="#PulseAudio" title="PulseAudio"></a>PulseAudio</h3>
            <p>PulseAudio is a sound server for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that sits on top of lower-level sound systems such as ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). It provides a higher-level interface for audio management, offering additional features and flexibility beyond what is available directly through ALSA. PulseAudio acts as an intermediary between applications and the underlying sound hardware. It handles audio streams, mixing, and routing, allowing multiple applications to produce sound simultaneously and manage their audio independently. One of PulseAudio’s key features is its ability to stream audio over a network. This allows users to play audio from one machine on another machine or device connected to the same network.</p>
            <p>PulseAudio enables the mixing of multiple audio streams into a single output. This means you can listen to music while receiving notifications from other applications, all mixed seamlessly into your speakers or headphones. Additionally, it allows for independent volume control of each application. This means you can adjust the volume of your music player separately from your web browser or other applications. PulseAudio supports various audio effects and processing features, such as equalization, sound enhancements, and echo cancellation. Further, it manages audio devices and allows easy switching between them. For instance, you can switch audio output from speakers to headphones or to an external Bluetooth device without disrupting playback.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/pulseaudio-architecture.png" alt="PulseAudio Architecture"></p>
            <p>PulseAudio provides a more intuitive and user-friendly way to manage audio compared to working directly with ALSA. Its ability to handle various audio sources and outputs simultaneously, along with network capabilities, makes it versatile for different audio needs and setups. By providing advanced features such as audio mixing, device switching, and network streaming, PulseAudio contributes to a richer and more flexible audio experience on Linux systems - particularly the Linux Desktop. While it’s a little bit of a meme, PulseAudio made “the year of the Linux desktop” a lot more likely.</p>
            <h3 id="PipeWire"><a href="#PipeWire" title="PipeWire"></a>PipeWire</h3>
            <p>PipeWire is a modern multimedia framework designed for Linux systems that aims to unify and enhance the handling of both audio and video streams. Developed as a replacement for both PulseAudio and JACK, PipeWire provides a flexible and efficient infrastructure for managing complex multimedia tasks. PipeWire combines the capabilities of audio servers like PulseAudio and low-latency audio servers like JACK into a single framework. It also supports video processing and capture, making it a comprehensive solution for managing both audio and video streams. Like JACK, PipeWire offers low-latency audio processing, which is crucial for professional audio applications such as live music production and sound design.</p>
            <p>PipeWire is designed to be highly flexible, accommodating various use cases ranging from consumer audio and video to professional audio production and video conferencing. It provides a unified API that can handle both audio and video streams, simplifying development and integration for applications that need to process multimedia content.Further, PipeWire is engineered from the ground up to deliver low-latency audio and real-time performance, making it suitable for high-performance audio tasks and complex multimedia workflows. Finally, PipeWire includes features for improved security and sandboxing, allowing applications to access only the resources they need and protecting against potential security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/pipewire-qpwgraph.png" alt="qpwgraph, a graphical utility to understand/display audio routing with Pipewire"></p>
            <p>By combining audio and video management into a single framework, PipeWire provides a more integrated and cohesive approach to handling multimedia content. Its design incorporates modern requirements and use cases, including enhanced security, better real-time performance, and support for a wide range of multimedia applications. PipeWire also offers compatibility with existing audio and video servers, easing the transition from older systems and allowing for gradual adoption. To give an example, even if one of your applications is built to use PulseAudio, PipeWire supports a PulseAudio compatible input API, so that an application does not have to care if it’s PulseAudio or PipeWire. A similar input API exists also for JACK - PipeWire will emulate the Sound Server API of JACK. Ulike PuleAudio and JACK, PipeWire does not require ALSA on a system, in fact if ALSA is installed the output of ALSA is very likely pushed through PipeWire.</p>
            <h3 id="So-what-is-it-a-sound-server-does"><a href="#So-what-is-it-a-sound-server-does" title="So what is it a sound server does?"></a>So what is it a sound server does?</h3>
            <h4 id="Mixing-multiple-input-streams"><a href="#Mixing-multiple-input-streams" title="Mixing multiple input streams"></a>Mixing multiple input streams</h4>
            <p>In essence, a sound server acts as an intermediary that takes multiple audio input streams with varying sample rates and bit depths, mixes them into a single output signal, and sends it to the sound card. For example, imagine one application generating a sine wave and another producing a rectangular wave. In today’s world, it would be unimaginable not to be able to watch a video while simultaneously receiving notification sounds from your messenger (or more generally to receive audio from multiple input sources). This is where the sound server implementations such as PipeWire, JACK and PulseAudio come in — a sound server combines the two (or more) input signals into one output signal and outputs it to the sound card. The sound server achieves this by summing each sample of the input signals, effectively merging multiple inputs into a single output. The operation performed is sample-wise addition. In case a faster sampled signal needs to mixed with a lower-sampled signal, the audio server will also have to interpolate the values for the signal with the lower sample rate. All this is happening in real time with little to no latency introduced (depending on the buffer size of the mixer buffer).</p>
            <p><img src="https://blog.rtrace.io/images/linux-audio-stack-demystified/sum-of-2-input-signals-as-output-signal.png" alt="Mixing together 2 input signals to generate one output signal"></p>
            <h4 id="Multiple-Output-Streams-x2F-Mixes"><a href="#Multiple-Output-Streams-x2F-Mixes" title="Multiple Output Streams/Mixes"></a>Multiple Output Streams/Mixes</h4>
            <p>If you own a laptop, there’s high chance you have 2 audio output devices. One Headphone output if you connect your headphones to the audio output jack. And one for the built-in speakers in your laptop. A sound server can also output audio to multiple outputs at the same time. Let’s say you prefer listening to music through your headphones, and a friend is in your room and you’d like to show them a cool track you enjoy. So you decide to activate output on both devices at the same time.</p>
            <h4 id="Volume-Control-per-input-stream"><a href="#Volume-Control-per-input-stream" title="Volume Control per input stream"></a>Volume Control per input stream</h4>
            <p>Typically each input stream comes from different applications on your Linux Desktop. And sometimes you’d like to individually control volume for each of your applications. Let’s say you’re watching a movie and you’d like to mute all messengers in the meanwhile. You can configure the sound server to reduce/mute the volume of the corresponding input streams.</p>
            <h4 id="Virtual-Outputs"><a href="#Virtual-Outputs" title="Virtual Outputs"></a>Virtual Outputs</h4>
            <p>Not every signal needs to be routed to an actual output. Think about your microphone. Most of the time the microphone is not outputted on your speakers/headphones, yet the input stream is provided to applications such as your favorite VOIP/conferencing tool. The concept of virtual outputs allows you to create an arbitrary number of output streams that applications can consume. </p>
            <h4 id="Sound-effects-for-streams"><a href="#Sound-effects-for-streams" title="Sound effects for streams"></a>Sound effects for streams</h4>
            <p>A sound server allows to apply various effects to individual input streams or output streams using effect plugins. These plugins, available in formats such as LADSPA, CLAP, VST2, VST3, AU, and RTAS, allow you to integrate software effects into your audio routing chain seamlessly.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Using-a-Compressor"><a href="#Example-Using-a-Compressor" title="Example: Using a Compressor"></a>Example: Using a Compressor</h5>
            <p>One practical example of an effect plugin is a compressor. If you often find yourself adjusting the volume while watching movies—turning it down during loud action scenes and back up for quieter dialogue—a compressor can help. By adding a compressor to the input stream of your media player or browser, you can reduce the volume of the loud parts without affecting the quieter sections. Most compressors include a make-up gain feature to increase the overall volume after compression, ensuring a balanced listening experience.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Adding-Reverb"><a href="#Example-Adding-Reverb" title="Example: Adding Reverb"></a>Example: Adding Reverb</h5>
            <p>Another use case is enhancing your microphone input with a bright reverb effect, making it sound as though you’re speaking in a large room. This can add a sense of space and presence to your voice.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Applying-an-Equalizer"><a href="#Example-Applying-an-Equalizer" title="Example: Applying an Equalizer"></a>Example: Applying an Equalizer</h5>
            <p>You might also want to use an equalizer to adjust your output stream. For instance, if your speakers produce a muddy bass around 200Hz, you can use an equalizer to reduce the gain in that frequency range, resulting in clearer sound.</p>
            <h5 id="Example-Denoising"><a href="#Example-Denoising" title="Example: Denoising"></a>Example: Denoising</h5>
            <p>If your microphone has a lot of background noise, you can apply a denoising effect to clean up the signal before it reaches your VOIP tool. This ensures that your voice comes through clearly during calls.</p>
            <h5 id="Combining-Multiple-Effects"><a href="#Combining-Multiple-Effects" title="Combining Multiple Effects"></a>Combining Multiple Effects</h5>
            <p>For more advanced setups, you can combine multiple effects like reverbs, delays, compressors, and equalizers into your audio chain. Whether you need simple adjustments or complex processing, a robust sound server in the Linux audio stack provides the flexibility and control you need.</p>
            <p>The modular and layered design of the Linux audio stack, combined with the wide array of available plugins, allows you to customize your audio experience to suit your specific needs. Whether you’re looking to enhance your media playback, improve your microphone input, or create a unique sound environment, the Linux audio stack has the tools to make it happen.</p>
            <h4 id="Providing-an-API-for-application-developers"><a href="#Providing-an-API-for-application-developers" title="Providing an API for application developers"></a>Providing an API for application developers</h4>
            <p>A very important aspect of a sound server is to provide a convenient API for application developers to consume. The following Python script demonstrates how the ALSA API can be used to playback a *.wav file.</p>
            <pre data-language="python"><code>import audioop
import alsaaudio

# Initialize ALSA-Audio-Output
audio_output = alsaaudio.PCM(alsaaudio.PCM_PLAYBACK)
audio_output.setchannels(1) # mono

audio_output.setformat(alsaaudio.PCM_FORMAT_S32_LE)

with open('example-audio-file.wav', 'rb') as wav_file:
    try:
        audio_output.setperiodsize(160)
        data = wav_file.read(320)

        while data:
            # Write read bits of audio file to sound card
            audio_output.write(data)
            data = wav_file.read(320)

    except Exception as exc:

            <p>PipeWire is emerging as a versatile and powerful option that integrates the best features of both JACK and PulseAudio, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases from general desktop audio to professional audio and video production. JACK remains the best choice for specialized professional audio tasks requiring the lowest latency and real-time performance. PulseAudio continues to excel in general desktop and consumer audio applications, offering ease of use and broad compatibility.</p>
            <p>The Linux distribution you’re using likely employs either PipeWire or PulseAudio. RHEL-based are on PipeWire already (e.g. Fedora), most Debian-based are still on PulseAudio, but PipeWire is installable. If you’re satisfied with your current audio stack, there’s no need to change it. However, if you seek lower-latency capabilities, consider upgrading to PipeWire. Generally speaking I’d not recommend transitioning to JACK unless you’re already familiar with its configuration and setup. PipeWire will eventually completely replace PulseAudio and JACK, as from an architectural and technical view it is a lot more capable.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>This post is a response to <a href="https://bacardi55.io/2024/07/01/do-people-irl-know-you-have-a-blog/">Do people IRL know you have a blog?</a></em></p>



<p>A short while before I came across bacardi55’s call to conversation, I asked my wife if she wanted to see something cool. She said yeah. I showed her the <a href="https://lars-christian.com/book/">Reading</a> section, and explained that I was constructing the functionality to track my reading on my own website.</p>



<p>Her response was a blank stare. Nonplussed, she asked me why anyone would care about which books I was reading. I told her that it didn’t matter, because I <em>do</em>. And to do it on my own website — as opposed to Goodreads or some other such walled garden of a corporate behemoth — is a small act of defiance. It is to stand up to the tech overlords and cry “<em>No!</em>” It is one small step in the direction of preserving the independent web.</p>



<p>By the time I finished my speech, she had moved on with her life. I think she was in the next room, folding clothes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the usual response whenever I try to talk about my website — this website — in real life (IRL). In the nearly twenty years that’s passed since I first published this website, the times I’ve brought it up in conversation I’m usually confronted with why. People around me didn’t get why I wanted a personal website in 2005. With the rise of social media platforms, they certainly didn’t get it a decade later. And my feeling is that, as yet another decade has passed — with popularity of big tech platforms on the vane — they still don’t get it.</p>



<p>I’ve always thought of this as a kind of freedom. A licence to be myself. To explore my interests unapologetically and without having to explain myself. If nobody cares what I’m doing here, it means I’m free to do whatever I want. To say what I’m thinking about whatever I’m thinking about.</p>



<p>At the very top of my to-do list for my personal website, I have highlighted the following quote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No one else has anything invested in this. No one cares if you do it, or don’t do it. To the world this pursuit is just your cute little hobby.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My personal website has never been popular. No post I’ve written has ever gone viral. At most, an online acquaintance or two has responded in some way to anything I’ve published. Bar the odd exception, nobody I’ve met in real life has ever commented on something I wrote online. It is a form of anonymity through obscurity and disinterest, which I’ve grown to appreciate.</p>



<p>This has freed me from my website becoming a worry stone, as highlighted by Robin Rendle in his post <a href="https://robinrendle.com/notes/i-am-a-poem-i-am-not-software/">I am a poem I am not software</a>. He writes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There’s a constant tug of war between wanting to be professional and wanting to be cool online. Sometimes those things overlap and sometimes they don’t. And sometimes the folks who have the opportunities to make a weirdo website are doing so because they’re not financially dependent on their website selling a service or landing a new gig. Their economic livelihood isn’t at risk if someone is turned off by the strange fonts or experimental navigation on their website.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>My personal website has never been a source of income. It never will be. To the extent that it is boring, corporate-looking, it is just because I am a boring, perhaps slightly corporate guy. But through browsing the small and independent web, I pick up new inspiration all the time. Perhaps that will eventually see me become a more daring, more edgy person. I wouldn’t hold my breath. But if it does, you can be sure that my website will reflect it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Either way, I doubt the people around me IRL will take much notice.</p>

	</h2>
	<p>
	<abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> was initially standardised in <a href="https://www.sensitiveresearch.com/Archive/CharCodeHist/X3.4-1963/index.html">X3.4-1963</a> (which just rolls off the tongue, doesn’t it?) which assigned meanings to 100 of the

That’s why virtually every ASCII message you see starts every octet with a zero. 8-bits is a convenient number for transmission purposes (thanks mostly to being a power of two), but early 8-bit systems would be far more-likely to use the 8th bit as a parity check, to help detect transmission errors. Of course, there’s also nothing to say you can’t just transmit a stream of 7-bit characters back to back!">4</a></sup>

		Notably absent characters in this first implementation include… the entire lowercase alphabet! There’s also a few quirks that modern <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> fans might spot, like the curious “up” and “left” arrows at the bottom of column 101____ and the ACK and ESC control

	If you’ve already guessed where I’m going with this, you might be interested to look at the X3.4-1963 table and see that yes, many of the same elegant design choices I’ll be talking
	about later <em>already existed</em> back in 1963. That’s really cool!

	In case you’re not yet intimately familiar with it, let’s take a look at an <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> table. I’ve
	colour-coded some of the bits I think are most-beautiful:

	character, but we’re going to need some binary too, to really appreciate some of the things that make <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> sublime and clever.

	<h3>
	Control codes

	The first 32 “characters” (and, arguably, the final one) aren’t things that you can <em>see</em>, but commands sent between machines to provide additional instructions. You might be
	familiar with carriage return (<code>0D</code>) and line feed (<code>10</code>) which mean “go back to the beginning of this line” and “advance to the next line”,
	respectively<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-5" name="footnote-ref-23995-5" href="#footnote-23995-5" title="Back when data was sent to teletype printers these two characters had a distinct different meaning, and sometimes they were so slow at returning their heads to the left-hand-side of the paper that you’d also need to send a few null bytes e.g. 0D 10 00 00 00 00 to make sure that the print head had gotten settled into the right place before you sent more data: printers didn’t have memory buffers at this point! For compatibility with teletypes, early minicomputers followed the same carriage return plus line feed convention, even when outputting text to screens. Then to maintain backwards compatibility with those systems, the next generation of computers would&nbsp;also use both a carriage return and a line feed character to mean “next line”. And so, in the modern day, many computer systems (including Windows most of the time, and many Internet protocols) still continue to use the combination of a carriage return and a line feed character every time they want to say “next line”; a redundancy build for a chain of backwards-compatibility that ceased to be relevant decades ago but which remains with us forever as part of our digital heritage.">5</a></sup>.
	Many of the others don’t see widespread use any more – they were designed for very different kinds of computer systems than we routinely use today – but they’re all still there.
	</p>
	<p>
	32 is a power of two, which means that you’d rightly expect these control codes to mathematically share a particular “pattern” in their binary representation with one another, distinct
	from the rest of the table. And they do! <strong>All of the control codes follow the pattern <code>00_____</code>:</strong> that is, they begin with two zeroes. So when you’re reading
	7-bit <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr><sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-6" name="footnote-ref-23995-6" href="#footnote-23995-6" title="Got 8 binary digits in front of you? The first digit is probably zero. Drop it. Now you’ve got 7-bit ASCII. Sorted.">6</a></sup>, if it starts with
	<code><strong>00</strong></code>, it’s a non-printing character. Otherwise it’s a printing character.
	</p>
	<p>
	Not only does this pattern make it easy for humans to read (and, with it, makes the code less-arbitrary and more-beautiful); it also helps if you’re an ancient slow computer system
	comparing one bit of information at a time. In this case, you can use a decision tree to make shortcuts.

	<h3>
	Space
	</h3>
	<p>
	The first printing character is space; it’s an <em>invisible</em> character, but it’s still one that has meaning to humans, so it’s not a control character (this sounds obvious today,
	but it was actually the source of some semantic argument when the <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> standard was first being
	discussed).
	</p>
	<p>
	Putting it numerically <em>before any other printing character</em> was a very carefully-considered and deliberate choice. The reason: <em>sorting</em>. For a computer to sort a list
	(of files, strings, or whatever) it’s easiest if it can do so <em>numerically</em>, using the same character conversion table as it uses for all other purposes<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-7" name="footnote-ref-23995-7" href="#footnote-23995-7" title="I’m hugely grateful to section 13.8 of Coded Character Sets, History and Development by Charles E. Mackenzie (1980), the entire text of which is available freely online, for helping me to understand the importance of the position of the space character within the ASCII character set. While most of what I’ve written in this blog post were things I already knew, I’d never fully grasped its significance of the space character’s location until today!">7</a></sup>.
	The space character must naturally come before other characters, or else John Smith won’t appear before Johnny Five in a computer-sorted list as you’d expect him to.
	</p>
	<p>
	Being the first printing character, space also enjoys a beautiful and memorable binary representation that a human can easily recognise: <code><strong>0100000</strong></code>.

	Numbers

	The position of the Arabic numbers 0-9 is no coincidence, either. Their position means that they start with zero at the nice round binary value <code><strong>0110000</strong></code>
	(and similarly round hex value <code><strong>30</strong></code>) and continue sequentially, giving:

	The last four digits of the binary are a representation of the <em>value</em> of the decimal digit depicted. <strong>And</strong> the last digit of the hexadecimal representation
	<em>is</em> the decimal digit. That’s just brilliant!
	</p>
	<p>
	If you’re using this post as a way to teach yourself to “read” binary-formatted <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> in your head,
	the rule to take away here is: if it begins&nbsp;<code><strong>011</strong></code>, treat the remainder as a binary representation of an <em>actual number</em>. You’ll probably be
	right: if the number you get is above 9, it’s probably some kind of punctuation instead.
	</p>
	<h3>
	Shifted Numbers
	</h3>
	<p>
	Subtract <code><strong>0010000</strong></code> from each of the numbers and you get the <em>shifted numbers</em>. The first one’s occupied by the space character already, which is a
	shame, but for the rest of them, the characters are <em>what you get if you press the shift key and that number key at the same time</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
	“No it’s not!” I hear you cry. Okay, you’re probably right. I’m using a 105-key ISO/UK QWERTY keyboard and… only <em>four</em> of the nine digits 1-9 have their shifted variants
	properly represented in <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>.
	</p>
	<p>
	That, I’m afraid, is because <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> was based not on modern computer keyboards but on the shifted
	positions of a Remington No. 2 mechanical typewriter – whose shifted layout was the closest compromise we could find as a standard at the time, I imagine. But hey, you got to learn
	something about typewriters today, if that’s any consolation.

	<h3>
	Letters
	</h3>
	<p>
	Like the numbers, the letters get a <em>pattern</em>. After the <code>@</code>-symbol at <code><strong>1000000</strong></code>, the uppercase letters all begin
	<code><strong>10</strong></code>, followed by the <em>binary representation of their position in the alphabet</em>. 1 = A = <code><strong>10<span>00001</span></strong></code>, 2 = B = <code><strong>10<span>00010</span></strong></code>, and so on up to 26 = Z =
	<code><strong>10<span>11010</span></strong></code>. If you can learn the numbers of the positions of the letters in the alphabet, and you can count
	in binary, you now know enough to be able to read any <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr> uppercase letter that’s been encoded as
	binary<sup><a id="footnote-ref-23995-8" name="footnote-ref-23995-8" href="#footnote-23995-8" title="I’m sure you know this already, but in case you’re one of today’s lucky 10,000 to discover that the reason we call the majuscule and minuscule letters “uppercase” and “lowercase”, respectively, dates to 19th century printing, when moveable type would be stored in a box (a “type case”) corresponding to its character type. The “upper” case was where the capital letters would typically be stored.">8</a></sup>.
	</p>
	<p>
	And once you know the uppercase letters, the lowercase ones are easy too. Their position in the table means that they’re all exactly <code><strong>0100000</strong></code>
	<em>higher</em> than the uppercase variants; i.e. all the lowercase letters begin <code><strong>11</strong></code>! 1 = a = <code><strong>11<span>00001</span></strong></code>, 2 = b = <code><strong>11<span>00010</span></strong></code>, and 26 = z =
	<code><strong>11<span>11010</span></strong></code>.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you’re wondering why the uppercase letters come <em>first</em>, the answer again is sorting: also the fact that the <em>first</em> implementation of <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>, which we saw above, was put together before it was certain that computer systems would <em>need</em> separate
	character codes for upper and lowercase letters (you could conceive of an alternative implementation that instead sent control codes to instruct the recipient to switch case, for
	example). Given the ways in which the technology is now used, I’m glad they eventually made the decision they did.
	</p>
	<h2>
	Beauty
	</h2>
	<p>
	There’s a strange and subtle charm to <abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>. Given that we all use it (or things derived from it)
	literally <em>all the time</em> in our modern lives and our everyday devices, it’s easy to think of it as just some arbitrary encoding.
	</p>
	<p>
	But the choices made in <em>deciding what</em> streams of ones and zeroes would represent which characters expose a refined logic. It’s aesthetically pleasing, and littered with
	historical artefacts that teach us a hidden history of computing. And it’s built atop patterns that are sufficiently sophisticated to facilitate powerful processing while being coherent
	enough for a human to memorise, learn, and understand.

<p>[<strong>UPDATED VERSION</strong>] The Federation of American Scientists applauds the United States for <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/transparency-us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declassifying</a> the number of nuclear warheads in its military stockpile and the number of retired and dismantled warheads. The decision is consistent with America’s stated commitment to nuclear transparency, and FAS calls on all other nuclear states to follow this important precedent.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/transparency-us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information</a> published on the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) web site today shows that the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile as of September 2023 included 3,748 nuclear warheads, only 40 warheads off FAS’ <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2024.2339170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimate</a> of 3,708 warheads.</p>



<p>The information also shows that the United States last year dismantled only 69 retired nuclear warheads, the lowest number since 1994.</p>



<p>FAS has previously requested that the United States release the size of the US nuclear arsenal for FY2021, FY2022, and FY2023, but those requests were denied. FAS believes the information was wrongly withheld and that today’s declassification decision vindicates our belief that stockpile disclosures do not negatively affect U.S. security but should be provided to the public.</p>



<p>With today’s announcement, the Biden Administration has restored the nuclear stockpile transparency that was created by the Obama administration, halted by the Trump administration, revived by Biden administration in its first year, but then halted again for the past three years.</p>



<p>While applauding the U.S. disclosure, FAS also urged other nuclear-armed states to disclose their stockpile numbers and warheads dismantled. Excessive nuclear secrecy creates mistrust, fuels worst-case planning, and enables hardliners and misinformers to exaggerate nuclear threats.</p>



<h2><strong>What The Nuclear Numbers Show</strong></h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/transparency-us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declassified stockpile numbers</a> show that the United States maintained a total of 3,748 warheads in its military stockpile as of September 2023. The military stockpile includes both active and inactive warheads in the custody of the Department of Defense. The information also discloses weapons numbers for the previous two years, numbers that the U.S. government had previously declined to release.</p>



<p>Although there have minor fluctuations, the numbers show that the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile has remained relative stable for the past seven years. The fluctuations during that period do not reflect decision to increase or decrease the stockpile but are the result of warheads movements in and out of the stockpile as part of the warhead life-extension and maintenance work.</p>



<p>Although the warhead numbers today are much lower than during the Cold War and there have been reductions since 2000, the reduction since 2007 has been relatively modest. Although the New Start treaty has had some indirect effect on the stockpile size due to reduced requirement, the biggest reductions since 2007 have be caused by changes in presidential guidance, strategy, and modernization programs. The initial chart released by NNSA did not accurately show the 1,133-warhead drop during the period 2012-2023. NNSA later corrected the chart (see top of article). The chart below shows the number of warheads in the stockpile compared with the number of warheads deployed on strategic launchers over the years.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/transparency-us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information</a> also shows that the United States last year dismantled only 69 retired nuclear warheads. That is the lowest number of warheads dismantled in a year since 1994. The total number of retired nuclear warheads dismantled 1994-2023 is 12,088. Retired warheads awaiting dismantlement are not in the DOD stockpile but in the DOE stockpile.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/transparency-us-nuclear-weapons-stockpile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">information</a> disclosed also reveals that there are currently another approximately 2,000 retired warheads in storage awaiting dismantlement. This number is higher than our most recent <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2024.2339170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimate</a> (1,336) because of the surprisingly low number of warheads dismantled in recent years. Because dismantlement appears to be a lower priority, the number of retired weapons awaiting dismantlement today (~2,000) is only 500 weapons lower than the inventory was in 2015 (~2,500).</p>



<h2><strong>FAS’ Work For Nuclear Transparency</strong></h2>



<p>The Federation of American Scientists has worked since its creation to increase responsible transparency on nuclear weapons issues; in fact, the nuclear scientists that built the bomb created the “Federation of Atomic Scientists” to enable some degree of transparency to discuss the implications of nuclear weapons (see FAS newsletter from 1949). There are of course legitimate nuclear secrets that must remain so, but nuclear stockpile numbers are not among them.</p>

<p>One part of FAS’ efforts, spearheaded by Steve Aftergood who for many years directed the <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAS Project on Government Secrecy</a>, has been to report on the government’s <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/news/secrecy/2001/01/010401.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussions</a> about what needs to be classified and repeatedly request declassification of unnecessary secrets such as the stockpile numbers. This work yielded stockpile declassifications in <a href="https://fas.org/publication/nuclearstockpile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some years</a> (2012-<a href="https://fas.org/publication/stockpile-reduction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018</a>, 2021) while in other years (<a href="https://fas.org/publication/stockpilenumbersecret/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019</a>-2020 and <a href="https://fas.org/publication/while-advocating-nuclear-transparency-abroad-biden-administration-limits-it-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022-2024</a>) FAS’ declassified requests were initially denied. Most recently, in February 2024, an FAS declassification request for the stockpile numbers as of 2023 was denied, although the letter added: “If a different decision is made in the future, we will notify you of this decision” (see rejection letters). Given these denials, FAS in March 2024 sent a letter to President Biden outlining the important reasons for declassifying the numbers.</p>

<p>The other part of FAS’ efforts has been the <a href="https://fas.org/initiative/nuclear-information-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuclear Information Project</a>, which works to analyze, estimate, and publish information about the U.S. nuclear arsenal. In 2011, when the Obama administration first <a href="https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/defenseReviews/NPR/10-05-03_Fact_Sheet_US_Nuclear_Transparency__FINAL_w_Date.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declassified</a> the history of the stockpile, the FAS <a href="https://fas.org/publication/stockpilenumber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimate</a> was only 13 warheads off from the official number of 5,112 warheads. The Project also works to increase transparency of the other nuclear-armed states by providing the public with <a href="https://fas.org/initiative/status-world-nuclear-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimates</a> of their nuclear arsenals. The project <a href="https://fas.org/publication/plarf-jilantai-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described</a> the structures that enabled Matt Korda on our team and others to <a href="https://fas.org/publication/china-is-building-a-second-nuclear-missile-silo-field/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discover</a> the large missile silo fields China was building, and NATO officials say our data is “the best for open source information that doesn’t come from any one nation.”</p>



<h2><strong>Why Nuclear Transparency Is Important</strong></h2>



<p>FAS has since its founding years worked for maximum responsible disclosure of nuclear weapons information in the interest of international security and democratic values. In a letter to President Biden in March 2024 we outlined those interests.</p>



        <div>
                <p><img decoding="async" width="805" src="https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stockpile_FAS-2024.png" srcset="https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stockpile_FAS-2024-402x239.png 402w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stockpile_FAS-2024-462x275.png 462w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stockpile_FAS-2024-662x394.png 662w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stockpile_FAS-2024-722x430.png 722w, https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Stockpile_FAS-2024.png 805w" sizes="100vw, (min-width: 980px) 670px, (min-width: 1200px) 900px" alt=""></p>
                            </div>

    


<p>First, responsible transparency of the nuclear arsenal serves U.S. security interests by supporting deterrence and reassurance missions with factual information about U.S. capabilities. Equally important, transparency of stockpile and dismantlement numbers demonstrate that the United States is not secretly building up its arsenal but is dismantling retired warheads instead of keeping them in reserve. This can help limit mistrust and worst-case scenario planning that can fuel arms races.</p>



<p>Second, the United States has for years advocated and promoted nuclear transparency internationally. Part of its criticism of Russia and China is their lack of disclosure of basic information about their nuclear arsenals, such as stockpile numbers. U.S. diplomats have correctly advocated for years about the importance of nuclear transparency, but their efforts are undermined if stockpile and dismantlement numbers are kept secret because it enables other nuclear-armed states to dismiss the United States as hypocritical.</p>



<p>Third, nuclear transparency is important for the debate in the United States (and other Allied democracies) about the status and future of the nuclear arsenal and strategy and how the government is performing. Opponents of declassifying nuclear stockpile numbers tend to misunderstand the issue by claiming that disclosure gives adversaries a military advantage or that the United States should not disclose stockpile numbers unless the adversaries do so as well. But nuclear transparency is not a zero-sum issue but central to the democratic process by enabling informed citizens to monitor, debate, and influence government policies. Although the U.S. disclosure is not dependent on other nuclear-armed states releasing their stockpile numbers, Allied countries such as France and the United Kingdom should follow the U.S. example, as should Russia and China and the other nuclear-armed states.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Timeshift</h2><a id="user-content-timeshift" aria-label="Permalink: Timeshift" href="#timeshift"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Timeshift for Linux is an application that provides functionality similar to the <em>System Restore</em> feature in Windows and the <em>Time Machine</em> tool in Mac OS. Timeshift protects your system by taking incremental snapshots of the file system at regular intervals. These snapshots can be restored at a later date to undo all changes to the system.</p>
<p dir="auto">In RSYNC mode, snapshots are taken using <a href="https://rsync.samba.org/" rel="nofollow">rsync</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link" rel="nofollow">hard-links</a>. Common files are shared between snapshots which saves disk space. Each snapshot is a full system backup that can be browsed with a file manager.</p>
<p dir="auto">In BTRFS mode, snapshots are taken using the in-built features of the BTRFS filesystem. BTRFS snapshots are supported only on BTRFS systems having an Ubuntu-type subvolume layout (with @ and @home subvolumes).</p>
<p dir="auto">Timeshift is similar to applications like <a href="https://www.rsnapshot.org/" rel="nofollow">rsnapshot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bit-team/backintime">BackInTime</a> and <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeVault" rel="nofollow">TimeVault</a> but with different goals. It is designed to protect only system files and settings. User files such as documents, pictures and music are excluded. This ensures that your files remain unchanged when you restore your system to an earlier date. If you need a tool to back up your documents and files please take a look at the excellent <a href="https://github.com/bit-team/backintime">BackInTime</a> application which is more configurable and provides options for saving user files.</p>

<p dir="auto">Timeshift requires very little setup. Just install it, run it for the first time and take the first snapshot. Cron job can be enabled for taking automatic snapshots of the system at regular intervals. The backup levels can be selected from the <em>Settings</em> window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Snapshots are saved by default on the system (root) partition in path <strong>/timeshift</strong>. Other linux partitions can also be selected. For best results the snapshots should be saved to an external (non-system) partition.</p>

<p dir="auto">Multiple levels of snapshots can be enabled - Hourly, Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Boot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Number of snapshots to retain can be specified for each level</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Boot snapshots provide an additional level of backup and are created every time the system starts. Boot snapshots are created with a delay of 10 mins so that system startup is not affected.</p>
</li>

<p dir="auto">It is strongly recommended to use BTRFS snapshots on systems that are installed on BTRFS partition. BTRFS snapshots are perfect byte-for-byte copies of the system. Nothing is excluded. BTRFS snapshots can be created and restored in seconds, and have very low overhead in terms of disk space.</p>

<p dir="auto">Timeshift is designed to protect system files and settings. It is NOT a backup tool and is not meant to protect user data. Entire contents of users' home directories are excluded by default. This has two advantages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You don't need to worry about your documents getting overwritten when you restore a previous snapshot to recover the system.</li>
<li>Your music and video collection in your home directory will not waste space on the backup device.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">You can selectively include items for backup from the <em><strong>Settings</strong></em> window. Selecting the option "<em>Include hidden items</em>" from the <em><strong>Users</strong></em> tab will back up and restore the .hidden files and directories in your home folder. These folders contain user-specific config files and can be included in snapshots if required.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>Note</em>: It is not recommended to include user data in backups as it will be overwritten when you restore the snapshot.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift/blob/master/images/settings_users_rsync.png"><img src="https://github.com/linuxmint/timeshift/raw/master/images/settings_users_rsync.png" alt=""></a></p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Unlike similar tools that are scheduled to take backups at a fixed time of the day, Timeshift is designed to run once every hour and take snapshots only when a snapshot is due. This is more suitable for desktop users who keep their laptops and desktops switched on for few hours daily. Scheduling snapshots at a fixed time on such users will result in missed backups since the system may not be running when the snapshot is scheduled to run. By running once every hour and creating snapshots when due, Timeshift ensures that backups are not missed.</li>
<li>Applications like rsnapshot rotate a snapshot to the next level by creating a hard-linked copy. Creating a hard-linked copy may seem like a good idea but it is still a waste of disk space, since only files can be hard-linked and not directories. The duplicated directory structure can take up as much as 100 MB of space. Timeshift avoids this wastage by using tags for maintaining backup levels. Each snapshot will have only one copy on disk and is tagged as "daily", "monthly", etc. The snapshot location will have a set of folders for each backup level ("Monthly", "Daily", etc) with symbolic links pointing to the actual snapshots tagged with the level.</li>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Snapshots can be restored by selecting a snapshot from the main window and clicking <em>Restore</em> button on the toolbar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Snapshots can be restored either from the running system (online restore) or from another system that has Timeshift installed on it (offline restore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If the main system is not bootable, then it is possible to boot from an Ubuntu Live CD, install Timeshift on the live system, and restore a snapshot on the main system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Restoring backups from the running system requires a reboot to complete the restore process.</p>

<li>You can also Timeshift across distributions. Let's say you are currently using Xubuntu and decide to try out Linux Mint. You install Linux Mint on your system and try it out for a week before deciding to go back to Xubuntu. Using Timeshift you can simply restore the last week's snapshot to get your Xubuntu system back. Timeshift will take care of things like reinstalling the bootloader and other details.</li>
<li>Since installing a new linux distribution also formats your root partition you need to save your snapshots on a separate linux partition for this to work.</li>
<li>It is recommended to include hidden items in home directory by selecting the option "<em>Include  Hidden Items</em>" from <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Users</em>.</li>

						<p>No, they have not been completely open at all. That's why people are still speculating. They didn't explain exactly what is going on. They just said incorrect elevated voltages requested by the CPU microcode are the root cause. They didn't describe exactly which voltages they are talking about, and how exactly the elevated voltages caused the instability issue.</p><p>In particular, they didn't say if the elevated voltages caused irreversible degradation of the CPU, which in turn caused the stability issues. They didn't say if fixing the microcode will make the affected CPUs stable again, or if the fix just prevents further degradation of the CPU. They didn't say if the microcode update will reduce performance to restore stability.</p><p>It's very likely that there is permanent damage to the CPUs exposed to the excessive voltage. Even CPUs that are still stable now may have had their life significantly reduced already. My CPU is unstable, it became unstable after just a couple of months of use, and I had to reduce its maximum frequency repeatedly, every 3-4 months, to keep it stable. It's very likely that it has been permanently damaged by this issue, and it might have been affected by the oxidation issue too, and it will probably have to be replaced.</p><p>Even the oxidation question has only been answered on reddit after somebody asked, instead of adding this information here from the beginning. I mean, I appreciate we got some information, but considering the scale of the issues its less than I expected.</p><p>For the oxidation issue for example, we don't have the exact time range for the products affected, or other ways to identify if we are affected or not. I bought my CPU in December 2022, so since the oxidation issue was fixed in 2023, I'm almost certainly affected.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34375/" target="_blank">View attachment 34375</a></p><p>

A <a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?members/1486/" data-xf-init="member-tooltip" data-user-id="1486" data-username="@Wesk">@Wesk</a> and Yveltal collaboration!</p><p>

Last summer, while Wesk was developing the Final Destination OMEGA, he and I discussed creating a Wii micro build even smaller than the GC Nano.</p><p>

The first build to ever <b><span>FULLY</span> </b>utilize the OMEGA trim. The smallest functional Wii ever made, barely larger than the outline of the OMEGA trim itself. A literal <span><b>keychain </b></span><b><span><b>Wii!</b></span></b></p><p>

Back then, I was imagining a more traditional form factor, with a fan, 5mm heatsink, controller ports, and micro-HDMI out. Here are some of my early CAD mockups.</p><p>

<a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34376/" target="_blank">View attachment 34376</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34377/" target="_blank">View attachment 34377</a></p><p>

A few weeks later, I had the idea to replace the plastic shell and heatsink with a machined metal unibody. Also, I replaced the controller, A/V and power ports with magnetic pogo pin connectors, shrinking it even further. Wesk did some sweet renders of this design.</p><p>

<a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34378/" target="_blank">View attachment 34378</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34382/" target="_blank">View attachment 34382</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34383/" target="_blank">View attachment 34383</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34384/" target="_blank">View attachment 34384</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34385/" target="_blank">View attachment 34385</a></p><p>

As you can see, the regulators were still off-board at this point in time (on that triangular sub-PCB). This was all pre-undervolting and pre-Thundervolt! But just a few short weeks later, Wesk and Drew had cracked the code on Wii undervolting, and we started talking about <b><span>passively cooling</span></b> the Kawaii.</p><p>

Somehow nearly a year passed as I worked on Wii U trim development, and then Thundervolt development. Wesk and I realized that putting Thundervolt in Kawaii was a no-brainer, even if it meant we couldn't use an FD Omega and the unit had to grow a tiny bit, from <b><span>57x57mm</span></b> to <b><span>60x60mm</span></b>.</p><p>

Wesk took over MCAD duties and reworked the shell with new organic fins, and soon after a single magnetic pogo-pin connector.</p><p>

<a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34386/" target="_blank">View attachment 34386</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34387/" target="_blank">View attachment 34387</a></p><p>

He also designed a dock! Originally, I anticipated using a bunch of octopus adapter cables to connect everything to the unit. But this dock will keep the Kawaii vertically oriented for optimal heat convection through the fins, and means we don't need to lug around adapters for GC controllers.</p><p>

<a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34388/" target="_blank">View attachment 34388</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34389/" target="_blank">View attachment 34389</a><a href="https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?attachments/34390/" target="_blank">View attachment 34390</a></p><p>

That brings us to today! The final Kawaii shell will be machined from aluminum and anodized in a variety of gorgeous colors. The back will be laser-etched with the project logo and dope-looking fake compliance markings.</p><p>

Planned specs:</p><ul>
<li data-xf-list-type="ul"><b><span>60x60x16mm</span></b> CNC'd aluminum chassis (passively-cooled) with laser etched artwork</li>

Just in case the <b>60x60x16mm </b>size wasn't registering, here's how Kawaii compares to the GC Nano and Short Stack:<br>

        <p>
            <strong>Charles Eames</strong> said
            it best: “We don’t do ‘art’ — we solve problems.”<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            To buy furniture in 1950, you had to choose between affordable and
            enduring, between rugged and fashionable. Charles and Ray designed a
            chair that was all the above and sold it for $20.95.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup>
            They called it the LCW.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p>
            The LCW embodies the Eames’ obsession with simplicity in material
            and method. “We want to make the best for the most for the least,”
            they said.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup>
            The design was revolutionary: in 1999, <em>Time</em> magazine called
            the LCW “the best design of the century.”<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>
            Today, you can buy a brand new LCW from Herman Miller (the
            officially licensed manufacturer of Eames products) for $1,195.
        </p>
        <p>
            Or, you can buy a chair called the “Fathom” from a company called
            Modway for $145.
        </p>
        <p>Functionally and aesthetically, the chairs are identical.</p>

            There’s an LCW from 1946 in MOMA’s collection. It’s one of the very
            first ever made. Most people would call it the original LCW.
        </p>
        <p>
            Charles and Ray Eames sold the manufacturing rights for their
            furniture to Herman Miller in 1947. Collectors call the LCWs made in
            the ’40s and ’50s “originals.” But in some sense, these — and the
            more recently manufactured Herman Miller versions — are copies of
            that LCW in the MOMA collection.

            And then there’s the Modway Fathom. It’s clearly a copy, an
            unlicensed one at that. But at $145 (the equivalent of $12.78 in
            1947) it’s more affordable than the LCW was when it was first
            manufactured and sold. In spirit, it’s more of an original than any
            LCW: the best, for the most, for the least.

            I’m sharing this story because it demonstrates a surprising fact:
            what makes something “original” (the first, the best, the most
            famous, the most true) or a “copy” (an identical copy, an
            unauthorized replica, an interpretation or a remix) isn’t always
            obvious — or important.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m a designer. As a designer, I feel the need to be original. If
            you’re a designer, or even if you’re just interested in design, you
            probably feel the need to be original, too. We tend to worship
            inventors and originators, designers who were trailblazing and
            innovative. And we copy them.
        </p>
        <p>
            This oxymoron of a craft can drive a person crazy. There’s lots of
            space between originality and industry, authorship and
            acknowledgement, riffing and ripping. I wrote this very short book
            to explore that space.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people have been frustrated by copying, refused to accept it,
            and struggled with every ounce of their strength against it. Other
            people have used copying to their advantage, whether to improve
            themselves, build a community, or subvert authority.
        </p>
        <p>I’ve only been able to have a career in design because I copied.</p>
        <p>
            I hope that by the time you’ve finished reading, you’ll see how
            important copying is. Right or wrong, virtue or vice, copying is the
            way design works.

        <p>II</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Steve Jobs copied.</strong>
            “Great artists steal,” he said, quoting Pablo Picasso (or was it
            Stravinsky? T. S. Eliot?<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>). Jobs and Apple copied many designs in their early days, most
            notably from a Xerox research laboratory in Palo Alto. The story
            goes like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            In the early 20th century, Xerox was a pioneer of office technology.
            By the middle of the century, computers were getting smaller and
            more affordable, and Xerox knew they’d have to work hard to keep
            their market dominance. In 1970, The Xerox Palo Alto Research Center
            — Xerox PARC — was founded to explore the future of the “paperless
            office.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Within two years, Xerox PARC had designed a groundbreaking computer
            called the Alto. One of its innovations was a graphical user
            interface: programs and files were displayed in virtual windows
            which users navigated using a mouse. It was an eerily accurate
            picture of what personal computers would look like 30 years later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jef Raskin, leader of the Macintosh project at Apple, had seen
            Xerox’s work. He wanted Steve Jobs to see it for himself, and set up
            a meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I thought it was the best thing I’d ever seen in my life,” Jobs
            said of the Alto’s user interface. “Within ten minutes it was
            obvious to me that all computers would work like this some day.”
        </p>
        <p>
            When the Macintosh was released in 1984, it featured a graphical
            user interface. Programs and files were displayed in virtual windows
            which users navigated using a mouse.
        </p>
        <p>It was just like the Alto.</p>

        <p>Steve Jobs didn’t like to be copied.</p>
        <p>
            In 1985, a year after the Macintosh was launched, Apple sued a
            company called Digital Research Interactive for copying the
            Macintosh’s user interface. Digital Research settled out of court,
            and changed the appearance of its icons, windows, and mouse
            pointers.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1990, Apple sued both Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. The case was
            a repeat: Microsoft’s Windows and HP’s NewWave featured designs that
            Apple claimed were copies of the Macintosh’s operating system. But
            early licensing agreements between Apple and Microsoft made it
            unclear if any infringement took place; the case was thrown out.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of Apple’s case against Microsoft, Xerox sued Apple,
            hoping to establish its rights as the inventor of the desktop
            interface. The court threw out this case, too, and questioned why
            Xerox took so long to raise the issue.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup>
            Bill Gates later reflected on these cases: “we both had this rich
            neighbor named Xerox ... I broke into his house to steal the TV set
            and found out that [Jobs] had already stolen it.”<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The rampant copying fueling the explosive growth of consumer
            computers meant that by 1990, the desktop user interface was
            ubiquitous; it was impossible to determine who originated any part
            of it, or who copied who. The quest to stake their claim nearly
            consumed Apple. But when they emerged, they had learned a thing or
            two. Today, Apple holds more than 2,300 design patents.<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">10</a></sup>

            This story ends in 2011, with Apple suing Samsung for copying the
            design of its software and hardware products. One of the most
            remarkable claims: Samsung broke the law when it sold “a rectangular
            product with four evenly rounded corners.”<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">11</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The court rejected Apple’s claim to own rounded rectangles. But it
            upheld the other claims, fining Samsung a blistering $539 million
            for patent violations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Designers copy. We steal like great artists. But when we see a copy
            of our work, we’re livid. Jobs, on Google’s Android: “I will spend
            my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of
            Apple’s $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong. I’m going to
            destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product.”<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">12</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Steve Jobs was unmatched in his visionary dedication to innovation.
            But he never came to terms with the inevitability of copying.
        </p>
        <p>III</p>
        <p>
            <strong>John Carmack had </strong>a
            different relationship with copying. For him, copying was a way to
            learn, a challenge to overcome, and a source of new ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carmack was — still is — a brilliant coder. He’s best known for
            programming the ultraviolent and action-packed first-person shooters
            <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>. Those games pushed the limits of
            consumer computers and defined a genre. But his first real
            breakthrough game was simpler, cuter, more whimsical. It was called
            <em>Commander Keen</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Growing up in the early ’90s, I loved <em>Commander Keen</em>. It’s
            a goofy adventure game; you guide an eight-year-old boy wearing a
            football helmet and red Converses through alien planets, collecting
            candy bars and zapping monsters with a ray gun.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Keen</em> began life as a copy of another of my favorite games:
            <em>Super Mario&nbsp;Bros.&nbsp;3</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before <em>Keen</em>, Carmack was working for a subscription
            software company called Softdisk. Carmack and the other programmers
            at Softdisk churned out these games at a prodigious rate: today,
            blockbuster games can take more than five years to create;<sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">13</a></sup>
            Softdisk produced a brand-new full-length game every single month.
        </p>
        <p>
            In September 1990, Carmack decided that for his next game, he’d try
            to tackle a new and daunting challenge: scrolling. At the time, only
            consoles like the Nintendo had enough computing power to smoothly
            scroll scenery, characters, and enemies. The PCs were stuck to
            simple one-screen-at-a-time games. But if Carmack was going to sell
            millions of games like Nintendo had with <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>,
            he needed to figure out how to recreate the effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, on September 19, 1990, Carmack and another developer named Tom
            Hall decided to reverse-engineer the first level of
            <em> Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. Working through the night, Carmack
            coaxed his PC into scrolling and animating the world of
            <em>Super Mario</em>; Hall jumped back and forth between a TV screen
            and his computer, playing the Nintendo version, pausing to copy the
            images pixel-for-pixel.<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">14</a></sup>

        <p>
            The next day, their coworkers were floored. Nobody had ever seen a
            PC game work like this. John Romero, Carmack’s closest colleague and
            future collaborator on <em>Doom</em> and <em>Quake</em>, called it
            “the fucking coolest thing on the planet.”<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">15</a></sup>
            He insisted that they keep copying until they had finished an exact
            replica of the full game. They were going to send it to Nintendo.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Unfortunately for Carmack and his team, Nintendo wasn’t interested
            in a PC version of <em>Super Mario</em> (their console version was
            doing just fine, thank you very much).
        </p>
        <p>
            Disappointed, but not defeated, they resolved to build a better
            version of Mario. Starting with Carmack’s code for scrolling and
            animating the screen, the coders — calling themselves Ideas from the
            Deep, keeping the game a secret from their day jobs at Softdisk —
            put their <em>Super Mario</em> copy through a complete
            metamorphosis. In place of Mario, it starred eight-year-old Billy
            Blaze. Instead of turtles and mushrooms, the enemies were aliens
            called Yorps. Instead of eating a mushroom to jump higher, Billy
            Blaze hopped on a pogo stick.

        <p>
            The debut <em>Commander Keen</em> game,
            <em>Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons</em>, was a huge
            success. More than 50,000 copies were sold, making <em>Keen</em> one
            of the best-selling PC games of its time.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">16</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike Steve Jobs, John Carmack never changed his mind about
            copying. When his boss at Softdisk suggested that they patent
            Carmack’s PC scrolling technique, Carmack reeled. “If you ever ask
            me to patent anything,” he said, “I’ll quit.”
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            In a 2005 forum post, John Carmack explained his thoughts on
            patents. While patents are framed as protecting inventors, he wrote,
            that’s seldom how they’re used. Smart programmers working on hard
            problems tend to come up with the same solutions. If any one of
            those programmers patents their solution, the rest are screwed.
        </p>
        <p>
            He concluded: “I’ll have no part of it. Its [sic] basically mugging
            someone.”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">17</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In his games after <em>Keen</em>, Carmack would go beyond simply
            refusing to patent his inventions. He would release the source code
            to the biggest games of the ’90s, <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>,
            <em>Doom</em>, and <em>Quake</em>. Everyone is free to download,
            modify, or copy them.
        </p>
        <p>IV</p>
        <p>
            <strong>It’s one thing to copy.</strong>
            It’s another to encourage others to copy from you. Richard Stallman
            went even further — he made copying a right.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1983, Richard Stallman wanted to build a new operating system. At
            the time, Unix was the most popular and influential operating
            system, but it was expensive to license. Commercial licenses cost
            $20,000 — that’s $52,028 in 2020 money.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">18</a></sup>
            And Unix was closed-source.
        </p>
        <p>
            So on September 27, 1983, he wrote this message on the Unix Wizards
            message board:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            Free Unix!<p>
            Starting this Thanksgiving I am going to write a complete
            Unix-compatible software system called GNU (for Gnu's Not Unix), and
            give it away free to everyone who can use it. Contributions of time,
            money, programs and equipment are greatly needed.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">19</a></sup></p></blockquote>
        <p>
            That Stallman would write software and give it to others to use, for
            free, was a radical notion. To drive the point home, Stallman wrote
            a manifesto, defining the idea of
            <strong>free software</strong> (“Free software is software that
            users have the freedom to distribute and change.”<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">20</a></sup>) The manifesto kicked off the free software movement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The enduring innovation of Stallman’s movement was how he and his
            co-conspirators used software licenses. They flipped traditional
            licensing on its head: instead of prohibiting the copying or
            distribution of the software, a free software license guarantees the
            right of people to use, modify, distribute, and learn from its code.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        <figure>

        </figure>
    </p>
    <div>
        <p>
            New kinds of software licenses weren’t the only product of the free
            software movement. Ideological offshoots quickly spun out into new
            groups, like the <strong>open-source software</strong> movement.
            While Stallman’s free software faction was centered around a small
            group of hard-line progressive coders, the open-source movement was
            broad and inclusive, abandoning some of Stallman’s more political
            language to spread farther and find new audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Permissive licensing and distributed source control form the engine
            of modern software development. They create a feedback loop, or a
            symbiotic pair, or a living organism, or maybe even a virus: the
            tools that software developers use are themselves products of the
            open-source philosophy. Free and open-source code replicates itself,
            mutates, and spreads instantly across the world.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The free and open-source software movements (sometimes combined into
            a single acronym, FOSS) were echoed by another revolution in how
            creative works are licensed. In 2001, Lawrence Lessig, Hal Abelson,
            and Eric Eldred started Creative Commons, a non-profit and
            international network dedicated to enabling the sharing and reuse of
            “creativity and knowledge through the provision of free legal
            tools.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Nearly 20 years later, nearly half of a million images on Flickr
            have Creative Commons (or CC) licenses. Wikipedia uses CC licenses
            on all its photos and art. MIT provides more than 2,400 courses
            online for free under Creative Commons licenses. Countless millions
            of creative works have benefited from the open-source approach to
            licenses and permissions.

            A decade ago, the open-source movement came to design. Michael Cho
            created
            <a href="https://unsplash.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unsplash</a>
            in 2013 to share a few photographs he thought might be useful to
            designers at startups; as of September 2020, Unsplash hosts
            2,147,579 photos, and all-time photo downloads are well over 2
            billion.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">21</a></sup>
            Pablo Stanley recently released
            <a href="https://www.humaaans.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humaaans</a>, a collection of Creative Commons-licensed designs that can be
            re-assembled into editorial graphics.
            <a href="https://feathericons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feather icons</a>,
            <a href="https://heroicons.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Heroicons</a>, and
            <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bootstrap Icons</a>
            are all open-source and free-to-use collections of UI icons, used by
            designers to build websites and applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile, the explosion of open-source design resources has been
            bolstered by a new class of tools for sharing and collaborating on
            design.
            <a href="https://www.abstract.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abstract</a>
            is a version-control system for design that promises “collaboration
            without the chaos.” With Abstract, many designers can contribute to
            a single file, without worrying about overwriting each other's
            changes or always needing to download the latest versions. Figma,
            too, has just launched
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its community feature</a>
            , allowing designers to publish files and download each other’s
            projects. It’s not hard to imagine how this will evolve into a
            designer’s version of
            <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>
            in the near future. Other design tools have followed suit: both
            Sketch and Framer have launched community content hubs, laying the
            groundwork for distributed source control.<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">22</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Copying is fundamental to design, just as it is to software. The
            rise of permissive licenses and version control tools makes it seem
            like copying is a new idea, an innovative approach in an industry
            that thrives on novelty. But the truth is, copying has informed art
            and industry for thousands of years.
        </p>
        <p>V</p>
        <p>
            In China, there are many concepts of a copy, each with distinct
            subtext. Fangzhipin (仿製品) are copies that are obviously different
            from the original — like small souvenir models of a statue. Fuzhipin
            (複製品) are exact, life-size reproductions of the original.
            Fuzhipin are just as valuable as originals, and have no negative
            stigma.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1974, local farmers in the Xi’an region of China unearthed
            life-sized sculptures of soldiers made of terra cotta clay. When
            Chinese archeologists came to investigate the site, they uncovered
            figure after figure, including horses and chariots, all exquisitely
            detailed. All told, there were more than 8,000 terra cotta soldiers.
            They were dated to 210 BCE.
        </p>

            <figcaption>Terracotta warriors, Xi'an city</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            The terracotta warriors instantly became cultural treasures. A
            museum was built on the site of the excavation, but many of the
            statues were also exhibited in traveling shows. Hundreds of
            thousands of museumgoers all over the world lined up in galleries to
            see the soldiers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, in 2007, a revelation rocked the Museum für Völkerkunde in
            Hamburg, Germany: some of the terracotta warriors it had on display
            were not the originals that had been discovered in the field in
            Xi’an. They were copies.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Museum für Völkerkunde’s director became a pariah: “We have come
            to the conclusion that there is no other option than to close the
            exhibition completely, in order to maintain the museum’s good
            reputation.” The museum issued refunds to visitors. The event kicked
            off a rash of geopolitical finger-pointing: German officials cried
            foul, saying they were duped; Chinese officials washed their hands,
            since they never claimed the statues were originals to begin with.
        </p>
        <p>
            The statues in the Hamburg museum were fuzhipin, exact copies. They
            were equivalent to the originals. After all, the originals were
            themselves products of mass manufacturing, made with modules and
            components cast from molds. Almost as soon as the terracotta
            warriors were discovered, Chinese artisans began producing replicas,
            continuing the work that had started more than 2,000 years
            before.<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">23</a></sup>

            It’s easy to attribute this approach to copying as a cultural
            curiosity, an aberration particular to China. But copying was just
            as vital to Western artists.
        </p>
        <p>
            Japanese art was one of the main sources of inspiration for Vincent
            van Gogh, himself one of the most influential European painters of
            the 19th century, if not of all time. Van Gogh was fascinated by the
            woodblock prints of artists like Hiroshige: stylized and vivid, they
            captured dramatic moments within compelling stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            Van Gogh’s interest went beyond inspiration. To study the techniques
            mastered by Japanese artists, he copied prints by Keisei Eisen and
            Utagawa Hiroshige. He tried to replicate their bold lines, their
            energetic compositions, and their strong colors. For his copy of
            Eisen’s A courtesan, van Gogh started by tracing the outline of the
            courtesan’s figure directly from the May 1886 edition of Paris
            Illustré. For Flowering Plum Tree and The Bridge in the Rain, both
            copies of Hiroshige prints, he added borders of Japanese calligraphy
            he had seen on other prints.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">24</a></sup>

            His practice with Japanese styles provided a crucial breakthrough.
            Van Gogh began to flatten landscapes. He outlined his subjects in
            bold black strokes. He painted with eye-watering colors. His
            interpretations of reality lit the art world on fire, influencing
            artists and designers to this day.
        </p>
        <p>
            By copying directly from Japanese artists, van Gogh’s works became
            what we know today.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was clear about this influence. In a letter to his brother Theo,
            he wrote: “All my work is based to some extent on Japanese art.”<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">25</a></sup>

            There’s another word in Chinese for a copy: shanzhai (山寨). It’s
            translated to English as “fake,” but as with most Chinese words, the
            translation is lacking. Shanzhai literally means “mountain
            stronghold;” the word is a neologism, a recent invention, inspired
            by a famous novel in which the protagonists hide in a mountain
            stronghold to fight against a corrupt regime. Shanzhai products are
            playful, drawing attention to the fact that they aren’t original,
            putting their makers’ creativity on display.
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the popular shanzhai novel
            <em>Harry Potter and the Porcelain Doll</em>; in it, Harry goes to
            China to stop Voldemort and Voldemort’s Chinese counterpart. It
            doesn’t pretend to be an original. It plays on its fake-ness: Harry
            speaks Chinese fluently, but he has trouble eating with chopsticks.
        </p>
        <p>
            It’s easy to think of shanzhai as a Chinese quirk, but there are
            parallels in Western culture. One in particular, is a staple of the
            design community: the unsolicited redesign.
        </p>
        <p>
            An unsolicited redesign demonstrates a designer’s ideas for how a
            well-known website or app could be improved. They range from
            single-screen aesthetic tweaks (like
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/13154163-Instafresh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this take on Instagram</a>) to in-depth case studies in UX, IA, and content design (like
            <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/gmail-an-unsolicited-redesign-1-2b244886eef8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this redesign of Gmail’s mobile app</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
            Unsolicited redesigns copy the visual elements of the original as a
            starting point, then transform those elements to produce something
            new. Like van Gogh tracing Eisen, designers can pick up new
            techniques and approaches just by copying. But when a designer riffs
            on the original, they can create something new and inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design community has a complicated relationship with unsolicited
            redesigns. On the one hand, they’re the mainstay of talented young
            designers looking to demonstrate their ability to think critically
            about design and apply their skills. Companies have used the
            unsolicited redesign to position themselves as leaders: in 2003,
            37signals (creator of the popular project management tool Basecamp)
            created redesigns of PayPal, Google, and FedEx to critical acclaim:
            their redesign of an online car dashboard “could do for cars what
            TiVo did for television,” Jason Kottke proclaimed.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">26</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            In rare cases, unsolicited redesigns turn into solicited ones. In
            2018, Adam Fisher-Cox published a redesign of the digital signage of
            the AirTrain system at John F. Kennedy International Airport. The
            agency overseeing AirTrain saw the redesign and hired Fisher-Cox to
            implement it.<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">27</a></sup>

            On the other hand, unsolicited redesigns are often looked down on.
            In a 2013 essay titled “Keep Your Unsolicited Redesign to
            Yourself,”<sup><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">28</a></sup>
            Eric Karjaluoto argued that without acknowledging the constraints
            and incentives that guided an original design, the redesign is
            “utter fluff.” Those working on unsolicited redesigns “should know
            better than to waste their time.” There are countless other
            invectives against unsolicited redesign across the internet of
            design blogs.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2011,
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111208041110/https://andyrutledge.com/news-redux.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andy Rutledge’s unsolicited redesign of <em>The New York Times</em></a>
            drew the attention of design pundits in countless blog posts and
            tweets.<sup><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">29</a></sup>
            But if they disagreed with Rutledge’s conclusions, many defended his
            approach. “Sometimes we need to go crazy and mock up stuff that
            can’t absolutely work in its pure form,” wrote Stijn Debrouwere,
            because “a full-on rethink might be what we need to move
            forward.”<sup><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">30</a></sup>
            Even Khoi Vinh, previous design director for the Times, supported
            the practice: “Unsolicited redesigns are terrific and fun and
            useful, and I hope designers never stop doing them.”<sup><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">31</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            The shanzhai approach of copying — to learn, to invent, to comment,
            to make a statement — is just at home in the West as it is in China.
        </p>
        <p>VI</p>
        <p>
            Copying can be instructive, challenging, devious, or revolutionary.
            To me, copying is fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was young, I liked to trace. My mom would buy me tracing
            paper, and I’d copy comic book characters line for line. Pulling the
            paper back from the original was a rush. I drew this! With my hand!
            Sure, it was a copy, but once I signed my name in the corner, it was
            my copy.
        </p>
        <p>
            These days, there’s automatic copy protection on just about
            everything. You can’t easily pirate Netflix streams, copy Kindle
            books, or torrent Adobe Creative Cloud. But designs are different.
            To copy a design, all you need is tracing paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, you don’t even have to draw. Pull out your phone, take a
            picture, and save it to your Pinterest board. You can use a color
            picker to extract the exact shade from the design, use a physical or
            digital measuring tool to get the pixel-perfect dimensions, and use
            <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatTheFont</a>
            to learn the typefaces in the design.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you’re looking at a website, you can just click “view source” and
            see all the design decisions laid out in granular detail. That’s
            exactly how I went from tracing comic books to being a designer: I
            copied designs from websites I liked and pasted them onto my Xanga
            blog.
        </p>
        <p>I copied because I could.</p>
        <p>
            In my first design job, I copied relentlessly. I had created a music
            magazine with friends and tried to recreate the layouts I saw in my
            favorite mags. Wired was a constant source of inspiration: I
            obsessed over their typography. When I figured out that they were
            using Joshua Darden’s Freight Micro, I switched our magazine to use
            it, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Copying helped me develop as a designer without needing to go to
            design school. For lots of people too young for college-level design
            programs, or without the means to attend these schools or bootcamps,
            copying serves the same function.
        </p>
        <p>
            And then, when folks like me wind up in a career in design, we find
            that copying is still useful. I eyedropper colors from Apple’s
            marketing websites. I start my color palettes from Google’s Material
            Design examples. I screenshot and recreate components from
            Facebook’s new redesign.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don’t fancy myself to be the van Gogh of design, to be anywhere on
            the level of Stallman or Carmack in my approach to copying,
            possessing even one-one-hundredth of Steve Jobs’ ability to steal
            artfully, or to be in any way comparable to Charles or Ray Eames.
            But I can certainly copy all of their work. I can copy their
            mindset, their process, and their designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can make cheap, small-scale facsimiles, fangzhipin, to demonstrate
            some quality of the original. I can make exact replicas,
            pixel-perfect fuzhipin, to learn how the originals and their
            creators work. Or I can create shanzhai, unsolicited redesigns,
            commenting and riffing on the work of others. All these copies have
            an important role to play in the process of design.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you believe that it’s worthwhile or worthless to copy,
            whether you think that copies are a valuable part of the design
            community or a scourge, you are using software, hardware, websites
            and apps that all owe their existence to copying.
        </p>
        <p>As long as there is design, there will be copying.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page">
				<p>I wrote a little book about entropy; here’s the current draft:</p>
<p>• <em><a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/what_is_entropy.pdf">What is Entropy?</a></em></p>
<p>If you see typos and other mistakes, or have trouble understanding things, please let me know!</p>
<p>An alternative title would be <em>92 Tweets on Entropy</em>, but people convinced me that title wouldn’t age well: in decade or two few people may remember what ‘tweets’ were.</p>
<p>Here is the foreword, which explains the basic idea.</p>
<h4> Foreword</h4>
<p>Once there was a thing called Twitter, where people exchanged short messages called ‘tweets’.    While it had its flaws, I came to like it and eventually decided to teach a short course on entropy  in the form of tweets.    This little book is a slightly expanded version of that course.</p>
<p>It’s easy to wax poetic about entropy, but what is it?   I claim it’s the amount of information we don’t know about a situation, which in principle we could learn.     But how can we make this idea precise and quantitative?  To focus the discussion I  decided to tackle a specific puzzle: why does hydrogen gas at room temperature and pressure have an entropy corresponding to about 23 unknown bits of information per molecule?   This gave me an excuse to explain these subjects:</p>
<p>• information<br>
• Shannon entropy and Gibbs entropy<br>
• the principle of maximum entropy<br>
• the Boltzmann distribution<br>
• temperature and coolness<br>
• the relation between entropy, expected energy and temperature<br>
• the equipartition theorem<br>
• the partition function<br>
• the relation between expected energy, free energy and entropy<br>
• the entropy of a classical harmonic oscillator<br>
• the entropy of a classical particle in a box<br>
• the entropy of a classical ideal gas.</p>
<p>I have largely avoided the second law of thermodynamics, which says that entropy always increases.  While fascinating, this is so problematic that a good explanation would require another book!   I have also avoided the role of entropy in biology, black hole physics, etc.   Thus, the aspects of entropy most beloved by physics popularizers will not be found here.  I also never say that entropy is ‘disorder’.</p>
<p>I have tried to say as little as possible about quantum mechanics, to keep the physics prerequisites low.   However, Planck’s constant shows up in the formulas for the entropy of the three classical systems mentioned above.  The reason for this is fascinating:  Planck’s constant provides a unit of volume in position-momentum space, which is necessary to define the entropy of these systems.  Thus, we need a tiny bit of quantum mechanics to get a good approximate formula for the entropy of hydrogen, even if we are trying our best to treat this gas classically.</p>
<p>Since I am a mathematical physicist, this book is full of math.  I spend more time trying to make concepts precise and looking into strange counterexamples than an actual ‘working’ physicist would.   If at any point you feel I am sinking into too many technicalities, don’t be shy about jumping to the next tweet. The really important stuff is in the boxes.  It may help to reach the end before going back and learning all the details.  It’s up to you.</p>

Please visit the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Maestro GitHub repository</a> to get started. If you find it useful, please <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">give us a star</a>.</p><h2 id="2bef">What is Maestro</h2><p id="3756">Maestro is a general-purpose, horizontally scalable workflow orchestrator designed to manage large-scale workflows such as data pipelines and machine learning model training pipelines. It oversees the entire lifecycle of a workflow, from start to finish, including retries, queuing, task distribution to compute engines, etc.. Users can package their business logic in various formats such as Docker images, notebooks, bash script, SQL, Python, and more. Unlike traditional workflow orchestrators that only support Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Maestro supports both acyclic and cyclic workflows and also includes multiple reusable patterns, including foreach loops, subworkflow, and conditional branch, etc.</p><h2 id="6c09">Our Journey with Maestro</h2><p id="f334">Since we first introduced Maestro in <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/orchestrating-data-ml-workflows-at-scale-with-netflix-maestro-aaa2b41b800c">this blog post</a>, we have successfully migrated hundreds of thousands of workflows to it on behalf of users with minimal interruption. The transition was seamless, and Maestro has met our design goals by handling our ever-growing workloads. Over the past year, we’ve seen a remarkable 87.5% increase in executed jobs. Maestro now launches thousands of workflow instances and runs half a million jobs daily on average, and has completed around 2 million jobs on particularly busy days.</p><h2 id="fd3e">Scalability and Versatility</h2><p id="5f06">Maestro is a fully managed workflow orchestrator that provides Workflow-as-a-Service to thousands of end users, applications, and services at Netflix. It supports a wide range of workflow use cases, including ETL pipelines, ML workflows, AB test pipelines, pipelines to move data between different storages, etc. Maestro’s horizontal scalability ensures it can manage both a large number of workflows and a large number of jobs within a single workflow.</p><p id="c621">At Netflix, workflows are intricately connected. Splitting them into smaller groups and managing them across different clusters adds unnecessary complexity and degrades the user experience. This approach also requires additional mechanisms to coordinate these fragmented workflows. Since Netflix’s data tables are housed in a single data warehouse, we believe a single orchestrator should handle all workflows accessing it.</p><p id="986e">Join us on this exciting journey by exploring the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Maestro GitHub repository</a> and contributing to its ongoing development. Your support and feedback are invaluable as we continue to improve the Maestro project.</p><h2 id="7110">Introducing Maestro</h2><p id="4941">Netflix Maestro offers a comprehensive set of features designed to meet the diverse needs of both engineers and non-engineers. It includes the common functions and reusable patterns applicable to various use cases in a loosely coupled way.</p><p id="1921">A workflow definition is defined in a JSON format. Maestro combines user-supplied fields with those managed by Maestro to form a flexible and powerful orchestration definition. An example can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/wiki/Workflow-definition-example" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Maestro repository wiki</a>.</p><p id="2ac0">A Maestro workflow definition comprises two main sections: properties and versioned workflow including its metadata. Properties include author and owner information, and execution settings. Maestro preserves key properties across workflow versions, such as author and owner information, run strategy, and concurrency settings. This consistency simplifies management and aids in trouble-shootings. If the ownership of the current workflow changes, the new owner can claim the ownership of the workflows without creating a new workflow version. Users can also enable the triggering or alerting features for a given workflow over the properties.</p><p id="656f">Versioned workflow includes attributes like a unique identifier, name, description, tags, timeout settings, and criticality levels (low, medium, high) for prioritization. Each workflow change creates a new version, enabling tracking and easy reversion, with the active or the latest version used by default. A workflow consists of steps, which are the nodes in the workflow graph defined by users. Steps can represent jobs, another workflow using subworkflow step, or a loop using foreach step. Steps consist of unique identifiers, step types, tags, input and output step parameters, step dependencies, retry policies, and failure mode, step outputs, etc. Maestro supports configurable retry policies based on error types to enhance step resilience.</p><p id="cf60">This high-level overview of Netflix Maestro’s workflow definition and properties highlights its flexibility to define complex workflows. Next, we dive into some of the useful features in the following sections.</p><h2 id="5be6">Workflow Run Strategy</h2><p id="ae40">Users want to automate data pipelines while retaining control over the execution order. This is crucial when workflows cannot run in parallel or must halt current executions when new ones occur. Maestro uses predefined run strategies to decide whether a workflow instance should run or not. Here is the list of predefined run strategies Maestro offers.</p><p id="a617"><strong>Sequential Run Strategy</strong><br>This is the default strategy used by maestro, which runs workflows one at a time based on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. With this run strategy, Maestro runs workflows in the order they are triggered. Note that an execution does not depend on the previous states. Once a workflow instance reaches one of the terminal states, whether succeeded or not, Maestro will start the next one in the queue.</p><p id="9d17"><strong>Strict Sequential Run Strategy<br></strong>With this run strategy, Maestro will run workflows in the order they are triggered but block execution if there’s a blocking error in the workflow instance history. Newly triggered workflow instances are queued until the error is resolved by manually restarting the failed instances or marking the failed ones unblocked.</p><figure></figure><p id="8320">In the above example, run5 fails at 5AM, then later runs are queued but do not run. When someone manually marks run5 unblocked or restarts it, then the workflow execution will resume. This run strategy is useful for time insensitive but business critical workflows. This gives the workflow owners the option to review the failures at a later time and unblock the executions after verifying the correctness.</p><p id="b23e"><strong>First-only Run Strategy</strong><br>With this run strategy, Maestro ensures that the running workflow is complete before queueing a new workflow instance. If a new workflow instance is queued while the current one is still running, Maestro will remove the queued instance. Maestro will execute a new workflow instance only if there is no workflow instance currently running, effectively turning off queuing with this run strategy. This approach helps to avoid idempotency issues by not queuing new workflow instances.</p><p id="eaa2"><strong>Last-only Run Strategy</strong><br>With this run strategy, Maestro ensures the running workflow is the latest triggered one and keeps only the last instance. If a new workflow instance is queued while there is an existing workflow instance already running, Maestro will stop the running instance and execute the newly triggered one. This is useful if a workflow is designed to always process the latest data, such as processing the latest snapshot of an entire table each time.</p><p id="7523"><strong>Parallel with Concurrency Limit Run Strategy</strong><br>With this run strategy, Maestro will run multiple triggered workflow instances in parallel, constrained by a predefined concurrency limit. This helps to fan out and distribute the execution, enabling the processing of large amounts of data within the time limit. A common use case for this strategy is for backfilling the old data.</p><h2 id="3d04">Parameters and Expression Language Support</h2><p id="7591">In Maestro, parameters play an important role. Maestro supports dynamic parameters with code injection, which is super useful and powerful. This feature significantly enhances the flexibility and dynamism of workflows, allowing using parameters to control execution logic and enable state sharing between workflows and their steps, as well as between upstream and downstream steps. Together with other Maestro features, it makes the defining of workflows dynamic and enables users to define parameterized workflows for complex use cases.</p><p id="efd3">However, code injection introduces significant security and safety concerns. For example, users might unintentionally write an infinite loop that creates an array and appends items to it, eventually crashing the server with out-of-memory (OOM) issues. While one approach could be to ask users to embed the injected code within their business logic instead of the workflow definition, this would impose additional work on users and tightly couple their business logic with the workflow. In certain cases, this approach blocks users to design some complex parameterized workflows.</p><p id="ef02">To mitigate these risks and assist users to build parameterized workflows, we developed our own customized expression language parser, a simple, secure, and safe expression language (SEL). SEL supports code injection while incorporating validations during syntax tree parsing to protect the system. It leverages the Java Security Manager to restrict access, ensuring a secure and controlled environment for code execution.</p><p id="3a2f"><strong>Simple, Secure, and Safe Expression Language (SEL)<br></strong>SEL is a homemade simple, secure, and safe expression language (SEL) to address the risks associated with code injection within Maestro parameterized workflows. It is a simple expression language and the grammar and syntax follow JLS (<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Java Language Specifications</a>). SEL supports a subset of JLS, focusing on Maestro use cases. For example, it supports data types for all Maestro parameter types, raising errors, datetime handling, and many predefined utility methods. SEL also includes additional runtime checks, such as loop iteration limits, array size checks, object memory size limits and so on, to enhance security and reliability. For more details about SEL, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/blob/main/netflix-sel/docs/index.md#welcome-to-sel" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Maestro GitHub documentation</a>.</p><p id="0162"><strong>Output Parameters</strong><br>To further enhance parameter support, Maestro allows for callable step execution, which returns output parameters from user execution back to the system. The output data is transmitted to Maestro via its REST API, ensuring that the step runtime does not have direct access to the Maestro database. This approach significantly reduces security concerns.</p><p id="e293"><strong>Parameterized Workflows</strong><br>Thanks to the powerful parameter support, users can easily create parameterized workflows in addition to static ones. Users enjoy defining parameterized workflows because they are easy to manage and troubleshoot while being powerful enough to solve complex use cases.</p><ul><li id="ecc7">Static workflows are simple and easy to use but come with limitations. Often, users have to duplicate the same workflow multiple times to accommodate minor changes. Additionally, workflow and jobs cannot share the states without using parameters.</li><li id="26fe">On the other hand, completely dynamic workflows can be challenging to manage and support. They are difficult to debug or troubleshoot and hard to be reused by others.</li><li id="2cc0">Parameterized workflows strike a balance by being initialized step by step at runtime based on user defined parameters. This approach provides great flexibility for users to control the execution at runtime while remaining easy to manage and understand.</li></ul><p id="76e0">As we described in <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/orchestrating-data-ml-workflows-at-scale-with-netflix-maestro-aaa2b41b800c#360e">the previous Maestro blog post</a>, parameter support enables the creation of complex parameterized workflows, such as backfill data pipelines.</p><h2 id="03a6">Workflow Execution Patterns</h2><p id="7289">Maestro provides multiple useful building blocks that allow users to easily define dataflow patterns or other workflow patterns. It provides support for common patterns directly within the Maestro engine. Direct engine support not only enables us to optimize these patterns but also ensures a consistent approach to implementing them. Next, we will talk about the three major building blocks that Maestro provides.</p><p id="f47a"><strong>Foreach Support</strong><br>In Maestro, the foreach pattern is modeled as a dedicated step within the original workflow definition. Each iteration of the foreach loop is internally treated as a separate workflow instance, which scales similarly as any other Maestro workflow based on the step executions (i.e. a sub-graph) defined within the foreach definition block. The execution of sub-graph within a foreach step is delegated to a separate workflow instance. Foreach step then monitors and collects the status of these foreach workflow instances, each managing the execution of a single iteration. For more details, please refer to <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/orchestrating-data-ml-workflows-at-scale-with-netflix-maestro-aaa2b41b800c#360e">our previous Maestro blog post</a>.</p><p id="d95e">The foreach pattern is frequently used to repeatedly run the same jobs with different parameters, such as data backfilling or machine learning model tuning. It would be tedious and time consuming to request users to explicitly define each iteration in the workflow definition (potentially hundreds of thousands of iterations). Additionally, users would need to create new workflows if the foreach range changes, further complicating the process.</p><p id="5686"><strong>Conditional Branch Support</strong><br>The conditional branch feature allows subsequent steps to run only if specific conditions in the upstream step are met. These conditions are defined using the SEL expression language, which is evaluated at runtime. Combined with other building blocks, users can build powerful workflows, e.g. doing some remediation if the audit check step fails and then run the job again.</p><p id="9e17"><strong>Subworkflow Support<br></strong>The subworkflow feature allows a workflow step to run another workflow, enabling the sharing of common functions across multiple workflows. This effectively enables “workflow as a function” and allows users to build a graph of workflows. For example, we have observed complex workflows consisting of hundreds of subworkflows to process data across hundreds tables, where subworkflows are provided by multiple teams.</p><p id="7d57">These patterns can be combined together to build composite patterns for complex workflow use cases. For instance, we can loop over a set of subworkflows or run nested foreach loops. One example that Maestro users developed is an auto-recovery workflow that utilizes both conditional branch and subworkflow features to handle errors and retry jobs automatically.</p><figure></figure><p id="add9">In this example, subworkflow `job1` runs another workflow consisting of extract-transform-load (ETL) and audit jobs. Next, a status check job leverages the Maestro parameter and SEL support to retrieve the status of the previous job. Based on this status, it can decide whether to complete the workflow or to run a recovery job to address any data issues. After resolving the issue, it then executes subworkflow `job2`, which runs the same workflow as subworkflow `job1`.</p><h2 id="dd55">Step Runtime and Step Parameter</h2><p id="8600"><strong>Step Runtime Interface<br></strong>In Maestro, we use step runtime to describe a job at execution time. The step runtime interface defines two pieces of information:</p><ol><li id="2de4">A set of basic APIs to control the behavior of a step instance at execution runtime.</li><li id="7fbd">Some simple data structures to track step runtime state and execution result.</li></ol><p id="e253">Maestro offers a few step runtime implementations such as foreach step runtime, subworkflow step runtime (mentioned in previous section). Each implementation defines its own logic for start, execute and terminate operations. At runtime, these operations control the way to initialize a step instance, perform the business logic and terminate the execution under certain conditions (i.e. manual intervention by users).</p><p id="17d4">Also, Maestro step runtime internally keeps track of runtime state as well as the execution result of the step. The runtime state is used to determine the next state transition of the step and tell if it has failed or terminated. The execution result hosts both step artifacts and the timeline of step execution history, which are accessible by subsequent steps.</p><p id="ddb1"><strong>Step Parameter Merging<br></strong>To control step behavior in a dynamic way, Maestro supports both runtime parameters and tags injection in step runtime. This makes a Maestro step more flexible to absorb runtime changes (i.e. overridden parameters) before actually being started. Maestro internally maintains a step parameter map that is initially empty and is updated by merging step parameters in the order below:</p><ul><li id="8853"><strong>Default General Parameters</strong>: Parameters merging starts from default parameters that in general every step should have. For example, workflow_instance_id, step_instance_uuid, step_attempt_id and step_id are required parameters for each maestro step. They are internally reserved by maestro and cannot be passed by users.</li><li id="4d0d"><strong>Injected Parameters</strong>: Maestro then merges injected parameters (if present) into the parameter map. The injected parameters come from step runtime, which are dynamically generated based on step schema. Each type of step can have its own schema with specific parameters associated with this step. The step schema can evolve independently with no need to update Maestro code.</li><li id="54c3"><strong>Default Typed Parameters</strong>: After injecting runtime parameters, Maestro tries to merge default parameters that are related to a specific type of step. For example, foreach step has loop_params and loop_index default parameters which are internally set by maestro and used for foreach step only.</li><li id="0a3b"><strong>Workflow and Step Info Parameters</strong>: These parameters contain information about step and the workflow it belongs to. This can be identity information, i.e. workflow_id and will be merged to step parameter map if present.</li><li id="0292"><strong>Undefined New Parameters</strong>: When starting or restarting a maestro workflow instance, users can specify new step parameters that are not present in initial step definition. ParamsManager merges these parameters to ensure they are available at execution time.</li><li id="d548"><strong>Step Definition Parameters</strong>: These step parameters are defined by users at definition time and get merged if they are not empty.</li><li id="3f46"><strong>Run and Restart Parameters</strong>: When starting or restarting a maestro workflow instance, users can override defined parameters by providing run or restart parameters. These two types of parameters are merged at the end so that step runtime can see the most recent and accurate parameter space.</li></ul><p id="7dbf">The parameters merging logic can be visualized in the diagram below.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="d5a8">Step Dependencies and Signals</h2><p id="9493">Steps in the Maestro execution workflow graph can express execution dependencies using step dependencies. A step dependency specifies the data-related conditions required by a step to start execution. These conditions are usually defined based on signals, which are pieces of messages carrying information such as parameter values and can be published through step outputs or external systems like SNS or Kafka messages.</p><p id="5a67">Signals in Maestro serve both signal trigger pattern and signal dependencies (a publisher-subscriber) pattern. One step can publish an output signal (<a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/blob/main/maestro-common/src/testFixtures/resources/fixtures/instances/sample-step-instance-failed.json#L151-L215" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">a sample example</a>) that can unblock the execution of multiple other steps that depend on it. A <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/blob/main/maestro-common/src/main/java/com/netflix/maestro/models/definition/SignalOutputsDefinition.java" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">signal definition</a> includes a list of mapped parameters, allowing Maestro to perform “signal matching” on a subset of fields. Additionally, Maestro supports <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/blob/main/maestro-common/src/main/java/com/netflix/maestro/models/parameter/SignalOperator.java" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">signal operators</a> like &lt;, &gt;, etc., on signal parameter values.</p><p id="652d">Netflix has built various abstractions on top of the concept of signals. For instance, a ETL workflow can update a table with data and send signals that unblock steps in downstream workflows dependent on that data. Maestro supports “signal lineage,” which allows users to navigate all historical instances of signals and the workflow steps that match (i.e. publishing or consuming) those signals. Signal triggering guarantees exactly-once execution for the workflow subscribing a signal or a set of joined signals. This approach is efficient, as it conserves resources by only executing the workflow or step when the specified conditions in the signals are met. A signal service is implemented for those advanced abstractions. Please refer to the <a rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://netflixtechblog.com/orchestrating-data-ml-workflows-at-scale-with-netflix-maestro-aaa2b41b800c#1fdf">Maestro blog</a> for further details on it.</p><h2 id="28e5">Breakpoint</h2><p id="8764">Maestro allows users to set breakpoints on workflow steps, functioning similarly to code-level breakpoints in an IDE. When a workflow instance executes and reaches a step with a breakpoint, that step enters a “paused” state. This halts the workflow graph’s progression until a user manually resumes from the breakpoint. If multiple instances of a workflow step are paused at a breakpoint, resuming one instance will only affect that specific instance, leaving the others in a paused state. Deleting the breakpoint will cause all paused step instances to resume.</p><p id="cace">This feature is particularly useful during the initial development of a workflow, allowing users to inspect step executions and output data. It is also beneficial when running a step multiple times in a “foreach” pattern with various input parameters. Setting a single breakpoint on a step will cause all iterations of the foreach loop to pause at that step for debugging purposes. Additionally, the breakpoint feature allows human intervention during the workflow execution and can also be used for other purposes, e.g. supporting mutating step states while the workflow is running.</p><h2 id="7ab1">Timeline</h2><p id="ed4f">Maestro includes a step execution timeline, capturing all significant events such as execution state machine changes and the reasoning behind them. This feature is useful for debugging, providing insights into the status of a step. For example, it logs transitions such as “Created” and “Evaluating params”, etc. An example of a timeline is included <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/blob/main/maestro-common/src/testFixtures/resources/fixtures/instances/sample-step-instance-failed.json#L137-L150" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for reference. The implemented step runtimes can add the timeline events into the timeline to surface the execution information to the end users.</p><h2 id="461d">Retry Policies</h2><p id="33ba">Maestro supports retry policies for steps that reach a terminal state due to failure. Users can specify the number of retries and configure retry policies, including delays between retries and exponential backoff strategies, in addition to fixed interval retries. Maestro distinguishes between two types of retries: “platform” and “user.” Platform retries address platform-level errors unrelated to user logic, while user retries are for user-defined conditions. Each type can have its own set of retry policies.</p><p id="46fa">Automatic retries are beneficial for handling transient errors that can be resolved without user intervention. Maestro provides the flexibility to set retries to zero for non-idempotent steps to avoid retry. This feature ensures that users have control over how retries are managed based on their specific requirements.</p><h2 id="ef2f">Aggregated View</h2><p id="4c03">Because a workflow instance can have multiple runs, it is important for users to see an aggregated state of all steps in the workflow instance. Aggregated view is computed by merging base aggregated view with current runs instance step statuses. For example, as you can see on the figure below simulating a simple case, there is a first run, where step1 and step2 succeeded, step3 failed, and step4 and step5 have not started. When the user restarts the run, the run starts from step3 in run 2 with step1 and step2 skipped which succeeded in the previous run. After all steps succeed, the aggregated view shows the run states for all steps.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="0eeb">Rollup</h2><p id="6431">Rollup provides a high-level summary of a workflow instance, detailing the status of each step and the count of steps in each status. It flattens steps across the current instance and any nested non-inline workflows like subworkflows or foreach steps. For instance, if a successful workflow has three steps, one of which is a subworkflow corresponding to a five-step workflow, the rollup will indicate that seven steps succeeded. Only leaf steps are counted in the rollup, as other steps serve merely as pointers to concrete workflows.</p><p id="4d8c">Rollup also retains references to any non-successful steps, offering a clear overview of step statuses and facilitating easy navigation to problematic steps, even within nested workflows. The aggregated rollup for a workflow instance is calculated by combining the current run’s runtime data with a base rollup. The current state is derived from the statuses of active steps, including aggregated rollups for foreach and subworkflow steps. The base rollup is established when the workflow instance begins and includes statuses of inline steps (excluding foreach and subworkflows) from the previous run that are not part of the current run.</p><p id="957b">For subworkflow steps, the rollup simply reflects the rollup of the subworkflow instance. For foreach steps, the rollup combines the base rollup of the foreach step with the current state rollup. The base is derived from the previous run’s aggregated rollup, excluding the iterations to be restarted in the new run. The current state is periodically updated by aggregating rollups of running iterations until all iterations reach a terminal state.</p><p id="2610">Due to these processes, the rollup model is eventually consistent. While the figure below illustrates a straightforward example of rollup, the calculations can become complex and recursive, especially with multiple levels of nested foreaches and subworkflows.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="fb0a">Maestro Event Publishing</h2><p id="8676">When workflow definition, workflow instance or step instance is changed, Maestro generates an event, processes it internally and publishes the processed event to external system(s). Maestro has both internal and external events. The internal event tracks changes within the life cycle of workflow, workflow instance or step instance. It is published to an internal queue and processed within Maestro. After internal events are processed, some of them will be transformed into external event and sent out to the external queue (i.e. SNS, Kafka). The external event carries maestro status change information for downstream services. The event publishing flow is illustrated in the diagram below:</p><figure></figure><p id="8ae3">As shown in the diagram, the Maestro event processor bridges the two aforementioned Maestro events. It listens on the internal queue to get the published <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/tree/main/maestro-engine/src/main/java/com/netflix/maestro/engine/jobevents" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">internal events</a>. Within the processor, the internal job event is processed based on its type and gets converted to an <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/maestro/tree/main/maestro-common/src/main/java/com/netflix/maestro/models/events" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">external event</a> if needed. The notification publisher at the end emits the external event so that downstream services can consume.</p><p id="da33">The downstream services are mostly event-driven. The Maestro event carries the most useful message for downstream services to capture different changes in Maestro. In general, these changes can be classified into two categories: workflow change and instance status change. The workflow change event is associated with actions at workflow level, i.e definition or properties of a workflow has changed. Meanwhile, instance status change tracks status transition on workflow instance or step instance.</p><h2 id="9ed3">Get Started with Maestro</h2><p id="5db4">Maestro has been extensively used within Netflix, and today, we are excited to make the Maestro source code publicly available.

<p>I’m sorry, Dell. This is 2024, not 2014. Now that people have gotten a taste of working from home, they’re not going back to the office. You’d think that would be clear by now — now just at Dell, but almost everywhere.</p>

		
		
			


<p>Why? Let me count the reasons:</p>



<ol>
<li>&nbsp;No commute on crowded highways;</li>



<li>&nbsp;A better life/work balance;</li>



<li>&nbsp;Cost savings;</li>



<li>&nbsp;Flexibility to choose where to live (and work).</li>



<li>&nbsp;More control over your workplace.</li>
</ol>



<p>I’ve been working from home for decades, which makes me something of an exception compared to a lot of workers. But my experience holds for people who got their work-from-home start during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column1 -->
								
					<div>


<p>I used to work out of a Manhattan office, but I lived in New Carrollton, Maryland. How did I do it? I took Amtrak to work on Monday and returned home on Friday. I’d joke that I walked to work — first to my local train station and then from Penn Station to the office. There were just a few hours in the middle when I’d work from the dining car.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More often than not, though, I’d just work from home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I decided to move to Asheville, NC, in 2001, my bosses agreed to let me move because, as I told them then, I could always catch a same-day flight if they really needed me in the office. But, as I told them, I doubted there would be any reason I’d need to be there.</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column2 -->
								
					<div>


<p>I was right. While I still fly to New York City occasionally for work, I never had to be there for the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Better still. I had more time to be home — and I saved money to boot. It’s cheaper to make a sandwich in my kitchen than to get lunch at a deli near the office in midtown Manhattan. Finally, I love living in mountainous and green Asheville rather than the flat and asphalt-covered area inside the Washington, DC beltway.</p>



<p>In short, I’m happy working at home and have been for more than two decades. Most <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075520/why-even-hybrid-return-to-office-mandates-are-hurting-overall-job-satisfaction.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2075520/why-even-hybrid-return-to-office-mandates-are-hurting-overall-job-satisfaction.html">people who work from home feel the same</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column3 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Companies might want people’s rumps back in office chairs, but according to a recent&nbsp;Gartner&nbsp;report,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-01-30-gartner-hr-research-finds-high-performers-women-millennials-are-greatest-flight-risks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">48% of employees say their company’s mandates prioritize what leaders want</a>&nbsp;rather than what employees need to do good work.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s right. At far too many companies, the desire for control trumps what people really need to do their best work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In particular, Caitlin Duffy, the Gartner HR practice director, said: “High-performing employees are more easily able to pursue opportunities at organizations that offer hybrid or fully remote policies.”&nbsp;</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column4 -->
								
					<div>


<p>If they don’t get those work-from-home opportunities, they’ll leave. That, in turn, “means <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2138277/senior-employees-ordered-back-to-the-office-are-jumping-ship.html">losing high-performers to attrition</a>, costs organizations in terms of productivity, [can cause] difficulty in backfilling the role, and the overall loss of high-quality talent available to fill critical positions,” Duffy said.</p>



<p>Ding! Ding! Ding!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s another piece of evidence that people are not, in capital letters, returning to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the latest Moody’s commercial real estate analysis,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/09/office-vacancy-rate-record-high" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">office vacancy rates have never been higher</a>. Just over one in five offices is now vacant. (The only reason that percentage isn’t higher is that companies have yet to be able to get out of long-term leases.)</p>
</div> <!-- Closing grid grid--cols-10@md grid--cols-8@lg article-column5 -->
								
					<div>


<p>Might I note that once that lease has ended, companies&nbsp;&nbsp;won’t have to pay for that office space. It’s a win-win  —unless your business is commercial real estate.</p>



<p>Put it all together, and what do you get? You get the new work culture of the early-mid-21st century and beyond. It’s all work from home from here on out, folks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deal with it. And enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/a-gentle-intro-to-saml/">https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/a-gentle-intro-to-saml/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41036982">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
            The SAML spec is an absolute beast. We've each read it multiple times. Here's a simpler explanation.
        </p><div>
            <p>I recently attended an open-source event in San Francisco. Introducing myself to random strangers – as one does at such events – I soon met a true hacker, a dyed-in-the-wool computer fanatic, the kind of person who’d have worked as a software engineer before it was cool. We chatted for a bit about random projects.</p>
<p>Upon discovering that my company works on SAML single sign-on, this person’s eyes lit up. <em>Oh, oh no, you’re in SAML hell</em>, they exclaimed, obviously recalling some technical side quest gone awry. <em>I’m so sorry,</em> they continued, laughing. <em>I don’t ever want to touch SAML again.</em></p>
<p>This is a common experience for me. Most developers know basically nothing about SAML at all. On rare occasions, I’ll meet someone like my acquaintance from the meetup, someone who knows a little bit about SAML … and actively avoids it.</p>
<p>And honestly, I think that’s reasonable. SAML occupies an arcane little corner of the B2B internet, and there’s not a lot of coherent information out there. Guides seem either to bury the reader in obscure technical details or vomit AI-generated SEO spam with virtually no useful detail.</p>
<p>I’ve written this post for curious developers who want a foundational understanding of SAML without wading too deeply into the details.</p>
<p>I don’t intend this post as a comprehensive explanation. I’ll elide some important facts and even get things technically incorrect in the hopes of illustrating ideas. I’d analogize the approach to introductory mechanics courses: <em>imagine the object as a sphere and ignore air resistance</em>.</p>
<p>Moreover, I welcome critique and correction here. Reach out at <a href="mailto:ned.oleary@ssoready.com">ned.oleary@ssoready.com</a> with any comments. (Thank you to those of you who helpfully flagged some typos for me! Markdown doesn’t have spellcheck.)</p>
<h2 id="saml-as-a-standard">SAML as a standard</h2>
<p>SAML (or Security Assertion Markup Language), defines a flexible set of rules for exchanging security-related messages in XML.</p>
<p>We typically use SAML to exchange messages in settings that involve three or more independent-ish entities. A very common scenario involves two software systems – made by two different companies – and a user. The two software systems need to exchange information about the user. One system might query the other: <em>what’s this user’s email address?</em> The other might respond: <em>this user’s email address is <a href="mailto:edwardkoleary@gmail.com">edwardkoleary@gmail.com</a></em>.</p>
<p>The two software companies could collaborate on a bespoke integration. But doing so can get really unwieldy. Imagine what happens if you need to build and maintain a lot of bespoke integrations that follow their own rules; it’s kind of a nightmare.</p>
<p>SAML erects scaffolding around the kinds of messages that systems can pass to one another.  It exists to help us all follow the same rules, speak the same language. By following standardized SAML rules, we don’t have to invent new, convoluted rules.</p>
<p>So even though SAML can feel really complicated, remember that things could be worse!</p>
<h2 id="what-does-a-saml-message-look-like">What does a SAML message look like?</h2>
<p>Here’s an example of a SAML message. Let’s not worry about the details.</p>
<p>All SAML basically looks like this. We’re just moving XML messages around.</p>
<p>SAML defines a syntax for our message and tells us how we can safely process other SAML messages’ contents.</p>
<p>If we receive a <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code>, we know a few things about how it’ll look. We know to look for an <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> within the <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code>. We know how to interpret the <code>&lt;AuthnContext&gt;</code> data within an <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code>. We can anticipate what the digital signature will look like. We have guidelines on how to process the message in order to avoid security lapses.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility-in-saml">Flexibility in SAML</h2>
<p>SAML’s design emphasizes flexibility; at least in principle, you can do an awful lot of different stuff with SAML. Unfortunately, that flexibility results in complexity.</p>
<p>If you read the SAML specification front to back, you will stumble across countless asides. Here’s one that’s not even that bad (don’t worry about what it actually means):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it chooses to proxy to a SAML identity provider, when creating the new <code>&lt;AuthnRequest&gt;</code>, the proxying identity provider MUST include equivalent or stricter forms of all the information included in the original request (such as authentication context policy). Note, however, that the proxying provider is free to specify whatever <code>&lt;NameIDPolicy&gt;</code> it wishes to maximize the chances of a successful response.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If the authenticating identity provider is not a SAML identity provider, then the proxying provider MUST have some other way to ensure that the elements governing user agent interaction (<code>&lt;IsPassive&gt;</code>, for example) will be honored by the authenticating provider.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot of <em>if</em>s and <em>for example</em>s here – every one of which adds at least one edge case. We’re talking about hundreds of pages of this stuff.</p>
<p>Now, SAML’s been around for a while, so some people capitalize on its flexibility. In the wild, especially in legacy systems, you will occasionally encounter SAML doing unusual things.</p>
<p>Nearly all of us can make our lives easier. We’ll ignore most of SAML and focus only on the tiny subset that people typically use.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-really-use-saml-for">What we really use SAML for</h2>
<p>We most commonly use SAML for single sign-on (hereafter abbreviated as SSO). For what it’s worth, SAML actually defines a few weird flavors of SSO, but we generally use the simplest of these, the Web Browser SSO Profile (see 4.1 <a href="https://groups.oasis-open.org/higherlogic/ws/public/document?document_id=35389">here</a> for details). We won’t concern ourselves with the more complicated stuff.</p>
<p>Under the Web Browser SSO Profile, end users will access any number of software applications by authenticating first into one centralized system, which then communicates users’ authentication status to the desired software applications. Users don’t authenticate directly with the applications themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/a-gentle-intro-to-saml/saml-sso-concept.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you have ever used a service like Okta to access your email, you’ve likely used the Web Browser SSO Profile.</p>
<h2 id="entities-involved-in-sso">Entities involved in SSO</h2>
<p>For simplicity, let’s imagine you make application software, and your users want to sign in via SAML SSO. You have to figure out how to support SAML SSO in your software.</p>
<p>We care about three entities in SSO:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user: someone that wants to use your application</li>
<li>A service provider (SP): your application</li>
<li>An identity provider (IDP): the centralized service your user will use to authenticate</li>
</ol>
<p>We can imagine each customer’s IDP as a database. It keeps track of data about people and their credentials, e.g. hashed passwords, email addresses, names, departments, etc. Companies often use identity providers to assign employees to different departments and assign them different privileges; for instance, the Accounting department will have access to the general ledger, but they won’t have access to AWS.</p>
<p>Every time we want a user to sign in via SAML, we’ll have to get information from their IDP; in SSO, we’re mostly just asking the IDP to confirm the user’s identity.</p>
<p>In order to do so, we will always need a pre-configured trust relationship with the IDP. Every customer that uses SAML SSO will require its own set-up in your application. It doesn’t matter which IDP your customers use – if you have 10 Okta customers, you will need to set up 10 different trust relationships.</p>
<p>Although you will need to establish trust relationships with the IDP, you won’t actually pass messages to/from the IDP directly. In SAML SSO, the service provider and the identity provider communicate via the user’s browser.</p>
<h2 id="how-saml-entities-interact">How SAML entities interact</h2>
<p>Here’s a typical SAML SSO process:</p>
<ol>
<li>A user attempts to access part of your application in their web browser.</li>
<li>You check whether the user has a valid security context.</li>
<li>The user doesn’t have a valid security context, so you present a login page.</li>
<li>The user fills in some information (e.g. an email address), which you use to determine the appropriate login method. You have pre-set records that tell you (1) that the user requires SAML SSO for authentication and (2) which IDP the user needs to use.</li>
<li>You redirect the user to the IDP’s web address, passing a SAML message to the IDP via the user’s browser.</li>
<li>The IDP prompts your user for credentials. The user successfully authenticates.</li>
<li>The IDP redirects the user back to your application along with a SAML message communicating information about the user’s authentication.</li>
<li>You process the SAML message and determine that you should, in fact, establish a security context for the user.</li>
<li>You grant the user access to the desired part of your application.</li>
</ol>
<p>A successful login process basically looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/a-gentle-intro-to-saml/saml-sso-flow.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Note that it’s also possible for the user to initiate a SAML SSO process from the identity provider. When this happens, mostly everything works the same way, except the service provider receives an authentication response without having sent an authentication request. If you are implementing SAML SSO support, <strong>make sure</strong> you’re prepared for IDP-initiated SSO.</p>
<h2 id="messages-exchanged-in-saml">Messages exchanged in SAML</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that we basically have two messages of interest in SAML SSO: a message from the service provider to the IDP; and then the corresponding message back from the IDP to the service provider.</p>
<p>We call this first message – from the service provider to the IDP – a SAML <em>request</em>. We call the other message – from the IDP to the service provider – a SAML <em>response</em>.</p>
<p>SAML requests aren’t too complicated in practice. We can do a bunch of stuff with them, but it’s often fine simply to send the following XML via HTTP redirect:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="xml"><span><span><span>&lt;AuthnRequest</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"</span> <span>ID=</span><span>"saml_flow_1bkwa10x7lhmh1zvrnhnj76r3"</span> <span>Version=</span><span>"2.0"</span> <span>IssueInstant=</span><span>"2024-05-28T19:18:54.805967185Z"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>&lt;Issuer</span> <span>xmlns=</span><span>"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span>        https://auth.ssoready.com/v1/saml/saml_conn_8ufe2hyst7s2jdovzdvd53ldm
</span></span><span><span>    <span>&lt;/Issuer&gt;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>&lt;/AuthnRequest&gt;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We’re just sending a message to an IDP URL that we already know. We include an ID in the <code>&lt;AuthnRequest&gt;</code> tag; this allows the IDP to share a <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code> that we can link back to our original request. We also send the IDP some data wrapped up in an <code>&lt;Issuer&gt;</code> tag. The <code>&lt;Issuer&gt;</code> data tells the IDP who we are. When our user authenticates, the IDP will return the user back to us with a <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code>. Remember, we’re passing this data via the user’s browser, so the IDP won’t know what application the user wants access to unless we specify.</p>
<p>SAML responses are trickier. They usually look something like this, sent via a POST:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="xml"><span><span><span>&lt;samlp:Response</span> <span>ID=</span><span>"id-9c961a70-708d-497d-8d51-1f8110600838"</span> <span>Version=</span><span>"2.0"</span> <span>IssueInstant=</span><span>"2024-05-28T19:23:17.443Z"</span> <span>InResponseTo=</span><span>"saml_flow_1bkwa10x7lhmh1zvrnhnj76r3"</span> <span>Destination=</span><span>"https://auth.ssoready.com/v1/saml/saml_conn_8ufe2hyst7s2jdovzdvd53ldm/acs"</span> <span>xmlns:samlp=</span><span>"urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:protocol"</span><span>&gt;</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Conceptually, the <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code> just wraps up a few <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> tags. An <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> just wraps up claims about our user, e.g. who this is and how they authenticated with the IDP. We process the assertions to determine whether we should log in our user.</p>
<p>SAML <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code> messages seem simple at first glance. Conceptually, they aren’t too complicated. In practice, though, they’re pretty frustrating. You see, the IDP will sign its <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code> and will often sign each <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> too. The signature just assures us that the message actually originated from the IDP and that no one has tampered with it. And <strong>SAML digital signatures are weird.</strong></p>
<p>The IDP builds messages (or nested components within a message) first by piling in the data it wants you to interpret. For instance, it will create the <code>&lt;AttributeValue&gt;</code>, my email address in this case. Then it’ll wrap up the <code>&lt;AttributeValue&gt;</code> in an <code>&lt;Attribute&gt;</code> tag, and so on until it completes its <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> data. Then the IDP signs the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code>. It converts the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> into bytes, then signs the bytes with its private key.</p>
<p>Critically, it then <strong>inserts the signature back into the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code></strong>. So the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> you receive as a service provider isn’t the same <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> that the IDP signed. The IDP signed a message that didn’t yet have a signature embedded inside. In order to trust the SAML message you’ve received, you need very carefully to remove the digital signature from the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code>, then convert the modified <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> to bytes and verify the digital signature.</p>
<p>Because you need to convert the <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> into bytes, even the smallest error – e.g. forgetting to clear some whitespace – will cause you not to process the message properly. And given all the flexibility in SAML, this can be pretty hard. Moreover, you can accidentally expose yourself to severe security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Assuming you’ve correctly processed the <code>&lt;Response&gt;</code> signature and any <code>&lt;Assertion&gt;</code> signatures, you can proceed to log your user in. In the example I’ve given, the IDP confirms that I, <em><a href="mailto:ned.oleary@ssoready.com">ned.oleary@ssoready.com</a></em>, have authenticated using PingOne. Because you have confirmed that PingOne sent the message (and because you have a pre-configured trust relationship with PingOne that entitles it to make claims about my authentication status), you can proceed to log me in.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-of-caution">A word of caution</h2>
<p>I’ve omitted a lot of details here, some of which matter <strong>greatly</strong> for security reasons. Unless you find SAML personally interesting or have some professional reason to investigate deeply, I do not recommend trying to implement SAML-based login yourself. It’s just not a good use of time.</p>
<p>If you’re curious, we post about auth stuff on our <a href="https://ssoready.com/blog">engineering blog</a> from time to time.</p>
<p>If you’re not especially curious and just want to set up SAML as soon as possible, our company makes a free, <a href="https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready">open-source</a> service that abstracts all the SAML away. It’ll save you a lot of time and grief.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A newly discovered hormone that keeps the bones of breastfeeding women strong could also help bone fractures heal and treat osteoporosis in the broader population. Researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Davis showed that in mice, the hormone known as Maternal Brain Hormone (CCN3) increases bone density and strength.</p>

<p>Their results, published July 10 in <em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07634-3">Nature</a></em>, solve a long-standing puzzle about how women’s bones remain relatively robust during breastfeeding, even as calcium is stripped from bones to support milk production.</p>

<p>“One of the remarkable things about these findings is that if we hadn’t been studying female mice, which unfortunately is the norm in biomedical research, then we could have completely missed out on this finding,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/holly.ingraham">Holly Ingraham</a>, PhD, the senior author of the new paper and a professor cellular molecular pharmacology at UCSF. “It underscores just how important it is to look at both male and female animals across the lifespan to get a full understanding of biology.”</p>

<p>More than 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis, a severe weakening of the bones that can cause frequent fractures. Women are at particularly high risk of osteoporosis after menopause because of declining levels of the sex hormone estrogen, which normally promotes bone formation. Estrogen levels are also low during breastfeeding, yet osteoporosis and bone fractures are much rarer during this time, suggesting that something other than estrogen promotes bone growth.</p>

<h2>A hormone that is only produced during lactation</h2>

<p>Ingraham’s lab <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a15f8a6-ac1d-44ac-bde0-ba4d117aecda" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2019/01/413001/ultra-sturdy-bones-surprising-origin-suggest-new-osteoporosis-approach" title="Ultra-Sturdy Bones, with a Surprising Origin, Suggest New Osteoporosis Approach ">previously discovered</a> that in female mice, but not male mice, blocking a particular estrogen receptor found in select neurons in a small area of the brain led to huge increases in bone mass. They suspected that a hormone in the blood was responsible for the super-strong bones but, at the time, could not find it – a quest that was further protracted during the worldwide pandemic.</p>

<p>In the new work, Ingraham and collaborators carried out an exhaustive search for this bone-building hormone and finally pinpointed CCN3 as the factor responsible in mutant females. Initially, the team was surprised by this result, as CCN3 did not fit the typical profile of a secreted hormone from neurons.</p>

<p>Their doubts vanished after they found CCN3 in the same brain region in lactating female mice. Without the production of CCN3 in these select neurons, lactating female mice rapidly lost bone, and their babies began to lose weight, confirming the importance of the hormone in maintaining bone health during lactation. Based on this discovery, they now refer to CCN3 as Maternal Brain Hormone (MBH).</p>

<h2>Hormone strengthens bones in young, old, male and female mice</h2>



<p>When strategies to increase circulating CCN3 were implemented in young adult and older female or male mice, their bone mass and strength increased dramatically over the course of weeks. In some female mice who lacked all estrogen or were very old, CCN3 was able to more than double bone mass.</p>

<p>When Ingraham’s scientific collaborator, <a href="https://profiles.ucdavis.edu/thomas.ambrosi">Thomas Ambrosi</a>, PhD, an assistant professor of orthopaedic surgery at UC Davis, tested these bones, he was surprised by their strength.</p>

<p>“There are some situations where highly mineralized bones are not better; they can be weaker and actually break more easily,” he explained. “But when we tested these bones, they turned out to be much stronger than usual.”</p>

<p>Ambrosi looked closely at the stem cells within the bones that are responsible for generating new bone and found that when these cells were exposed to CCN3, they were much more prone to generate new bone cells.</p>

<h2>A hydrogel patch heals fractures in mice</h2>

<p>To test the ability of the hormone to assist in bone healing, the researchers created a hydrogel patch that could be applied directly to the site of a bone fracture, where it would slowly release CCN3 for two weeks. In elderly mice, bone fractures don’t usually heal well. However, the CCN3 patch spurred the formation of new bone at the site of the fracture, contributing to youthful healing of the fracture.</p>

<p>“We’ve never been able to achieve this kind of mineralization and healing outcome with any other strategy,” Ambrosi said. “We’re really excited to follow it up and potentially apply CCN3 in the context of other problems, such as regrowing cartilage.”</p>

<p>The researchers plan to carry out future studies on the molecular mechanisms of CCN3, its levels in breastfeeding women, as well as the potential of the hormone to treat a variety of bone conditions.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/muriel.babey">Muriel Babey</a>, MD, a co-first author and mentored physician-scientist in the Division of Endocrinology at UCSF, is keen to begin asking how CCN3 impacts bone metabolism in clinically relevant disease settings. Partnering with the UCSF Catalyst program, <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/william.krause">William Krause</a>, PhD, a senior scientist and co-lead on this project will begin translating these new results.</p>

<p>“Bone loss happens not only in post-menopausal women but often occurs in breast cancer survivors that take certain hormone blockers; in younger, highly trained elite female athletes; and in older men whose relative survival rate is poorer than women after a hip fracture,” Ingraham said. “It would be incredibly exciting if CCN3 could increase bone mass in all these scenarios.”</p>

            <p>Hello brr readers!</p>
            <p>It’s been an absolute delight keeping in touch with y’all during my ~8 months post-Antarctica.</p>
            <p>I’ve connected with folks all over the world – at remote outposts, on ships, at other Antarctic (and Arctic!)
              stations, and in all sorts of fascinating life circumstances. People have shared their stories, asked insightful
              questions, and compared notes about remote infrastructure, itinerant “gig” work, and the vastness of human
              experience.</p>
            <p>Now, it’s time for me to commit to something new, build connections in a new place, and find new things to
              work on that bring me joy and fulfillment.</p>
            <p>Maybe some of you can help!</p>
            <p><strong><em>tl;dr:</em></strong> <em>Please reach out to me if you know of work opportunities, primarily (but not exclusively) in Denver, that
                I might enjoy, as a mid-career IT and infrastructure generalist with an interest in clean energy and electrical grids.
                Also, separate from work and jobs, I’d love to meet people who are local to the Denver area!</em></p>
            <p><em>You can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:hello@brr.fyi">hello@brr.fyi</a>.</em></p>

            <h2 id="adventures">What I’ve been up to</h2>
            <p>In the 8 months since leaving the South Pole in November 2023, I’ve done a fair bit of exploring, and a bit of
              short-term contract IT work.</p>
            <p>After returning from my post-ice vacation in New Zealand, I visited friends and family in the US Midwest,
              then took the meandering route back to San Francisco using an
              <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/tickets/departure-rail-pass.html">Amtrak USA Rail Pass</a>:
              10 rail segments, 30 days, and a great way to see the United States.</p>
            <p>I spent a few months doing a fixed-term IT contract with some friends, at a radio astronomy observatory in rural
              Northern California. We got to witness the auroras caused by
              the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2024_solar_storms">May 2024 solar storms</a>.</p>
            
            <p>And finally – I recently relocated to the Denver Metro Area, where I’m writing this post.</p>
            <p>And that brings us to now. It’s time for me to get a job. Based on my past communications with brr readers,
              I think some of you might have ideas or recommendations.</p>
            <h2 id="anonymity">Who I am</h2>
            <p>When I started this blog, for my friends and family, I was “anonymous” only on paper. Sure, the blog
              didn’t give away my identity, but people who I knew in real life were well aware that I was running it.
              I was writing for an audience of just a handful of people.
              Anonymity was just a technical feature, one that I chose to implement for fun. It
              wasn’t something that I felt strongly about.</p>
            <p>But in late October / early November 2022, shortly after I wrote about
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/wastewater-plant">The McMurdo Wastewater Treatment Plant</a>, I noticed that brr had been picked up by a
              handful of online message boards. There’s no stopping Internet momentum once it starts.</p>
            <p>
              <a href="https://brr.fyi/media/brr-wants-a-job/blog-traffic-01.png">

                </picture>
                <em>oh no</em>
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>It was fun to discover that there was an audience hungry
              for this type of writing, but it was also terrifying to realize that every word I wrote, from then on,
              would be combed over and scrutinized by Internet strangers. I knew this to be true, because I
              watched it happen, in real time, across message boards.</p>
            <p>I have a distinct memory of sitting in the
              Crary IT office in McMurdo, on a Sunday afternoon, feeling a mix of shock and horror as thousands of
              Internet strangers read my post. I remember reading along as dozens of commenters picked apart the technical
              minutiae of wastewater treatment processing across online message boards.</p>
            <p>I combed through my posts over and over, trying to reassure myself that I hadn’t gotten anything
              factually wrong, disclosed any restricted information, or otherwise made any mistakes that would stick out
              with this newfound attention.</p>
            <p>At this point, I decided to 1.) lean into the momentum and continue writing, 2.) be precise and careful,
              3.) tailor my writing to my newly-expanded audience, and 4.) commit to staying anonymous.</p>
            <p>And the blog continued to grow in popularity. When I published <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/last-flight-out">Last Flight Out</a> in
              February 2023, I surpassed 1TB of monthly CloudFront egress for the first time, as tens of thousands
              of people around the world read about how we prepared South Pole Station for the long winter.</p>
            <p>When I published <a href="https://brr.fyi/posts/engineering-for-slow-internet">Engineering for Slow Internet</a> in late May 2024, I found myself
              at the top of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2024-05-31">Hacker News</a> for the day, and the post
              received about 200,000 non-bot pageviews in the first 48 hours.</p>
            <p>Throughout this adventure, anonymity was a helpful tool, and I was glad I had built it in from the start.
              Anonymity kept the focus on my experience <em>in Antarctica</em>. It allowed Antarctic Infrastructure to
              stay front and center, just as I had originally intended. It helped me, my colleagues, and my back-home friends
              stay out of a personal spotlight that none of us had signed up for.</p>
            <p>Antarctica is vast, and the people who work there have a variety of opinions about a variety of topics.
              I was extremely wary of thrusting any person, team, or project into the spotlight.
              Some people explicitly cultivate real-name publicity associated with their time in Antarctica;
              others recoil in horror at the slightest risk of being Perceived™.</p>
            <p>Some “ice people” love that the brr blog took off the way it did, and they believe it’s a wholesome and good-natured
              way to share a love of infrastructure with fellow enthusiasts around the world. Others are
              baffled that thousands of Internet strangers care about wastewater treatment at all.</p>
            <p>Still others find the tone of this blog to be
              off-putting, either because they believe that nothing should be said in public at all, or because
              they believe I have drastically mis-represented the day-to-day experience of working within the program. This is
              an entirely valid critique, and it’s one that I fully accept.</p>
            <p>Brr is primarily an infrastructure blog. If you are interested in the United States Antarctic Program in more
              detail, I recommend reading
              Nicholas Johnson’s <a href="https://feralhouse.com/big-dead-place/">Big Dead Place</a>. I have done so, and it resonates
              strongly with me. Johnson cared deeply about Antarctica, and
              I appreciate that he was willing to write candidly about its shortcomings.
              I can’t recommend this book highly enough if
              you’re interested in getting a more holistic picture about the day-to-day sociological context of Antarctic
              contract work. Johnson wrote about this topic more eloquently
              than I could ever hope to accomplish. His insights are as valid today as they were in 2005.</p>
            <p>Anonymity was also helpful due to my status as a worker on
              the United States Antarctic Program’s Antarctic Support Contract.
              For the firms that administer these large contracts, one aspect of the job
              is to keep an eye on staff members’ social media activity. This is especially true for
              contracts associated with subjects of high public interest such as Antarctica.</p>
            <p>Nothing in my employment contract prohibited
              me from maintaining this blog, as long as I complied with the relevant
              <a href="https://www.usap.gov/technology/1563/">policies</a>. But – I’m sure that
              some folks at <a href="https://www.leidos.com/capabilities/mission-operations/antarctic-support-contract">Leidos</a> and
              the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=OPP">NSF Office of Polar Programs</a> were
              monitoring this blog, because I know with certainty that they were
              monitoring (and, in some cases, actively intervening with) colleagues’ social media.</p>
            <p>For people inside the
              Antarctic program, it would have been trivial to work out who I was.
              For example, just the two datapoints
              <em>“flew to McMurdo on August 28, 2022”</em> and <em>“flew to Pole on December 15, 2022”</em> are
              enough for anyone with access to the flight manifests to narrow it down to just me.</p>
            <p>Staying officially anonymous sent a signal that I wasn’t live-blogging my experience for real-world
              professional gain while I was still employed in Antarctica. This is a big no-no according to the policies.
              This was also one of the reasons I turned down higher-profile inquiries, such as newspapers or documentaries.</p>
            <p>But now that I’m 1.) no longer in Antarctica, 2.) a healthy 8 months removed from the experience, and
              3.) starting to look for non-Antarctica things to do next, I don’t feel that anonymity is necessary or helpful
              anymore.</p>
            <p>Brr is the only thing I’ve ever written on the Internet, and it grew beyond my expectations.
              You’ve all been so kind, and I’ve truly enjoyed every connection, however small,
              that I’ve been able to make with fascinating people around the world.</p>
            <p>Hi – my name is <a href="https://paulcoldren.org/">Paul Coldren</a>, and it has been quite an adventure keeping this blog
              anonymously
              for the past 2 years.</p>

            </p>
            <p>So, now that I’m a Real Person™️ instead of an anonymous blogger, I’d like some help finding a new project to
              work on. Thanks in advance!</p>
            <h2 id="job">Help me find a job</h2>
            <p>I’ve always been interested in infrastructure and systems. Working at the South Pole was a
              fantastic way to see a bunch of this up close.</p>
            <p>I’m not just referring to technological infrastructure
              (<em>how exactly</em> <strong><em>do</em></strong> <em>you run server infrastructure at the South Pole?</em>). I’m also referring
              to organizational infrastructure. I got to see the ins and outs of government employment, contracting,
              procurement, supply chains, budgeting, and military logistics.</p>
            <p>I also got to meet a bunch of new people, and I got to explore the world of
              itinerant, gig-chasing contract work. This was all new to me, and I found it all
              to be fascinating and fulfilling.</p>
            <p>For this next phase, I’d like to try establishing a home base, finding a community, and working on something new.</p>
            <p>For the rest of this post, I’ll be describing my skills and interests. My hope is that brr readers who
              are hiring or are aware of openings will reach out.</p>
            <h3 id="skills">What I’m good at</h3>
            <p>I come from a high tech background.
              I have a computer science degree, and just over a decade of experience doing a variety of high tech work.</p>
            <p>I’ve worked at FAANG and FAANG-adjacent megacorps, tiny 10-person startups, and everything in between. I’ve worked
              on software applications, consumer electronics, and business hardware products. My 14 months in Antarctica
              gave me exposure to the world of regulated government engineering. I spent approximately two years
              as a self-employed IT and infrastructure consultant. I’ve worked in individual contributor and tech lead roles.</p>
            <p>My expertise these days is primarily as an IT engineering and infrastructure engineering generalist.
              That being said, go back about ~8 years, and my job title was “Senior Software Test Engineer”. So – there
              is some pure software experience in there.</p>
            <p>In Antarctica, they called me “Senior Systems Administrator, South Pole Station”. Prior to that, I’ve worn a
              variety of hats, including “IT Director”, “Senior Infrastructure Engineer”, “IT Engineering Consultant”, and
              “Senior Software Test Engineer”.</p>
            <p>I work best in a high-trust environment, where I’m accountable for an outcome instead of a series of
              predetermined steps. I’m a systems thinker, and I feel most at home when I’m bringing order, robustness,
              determinism, and risk characterization to an ad-hoc system. I’m precise and detail-oriented, when such traits
              are warranted for the task at hand.
              I enjoy working on resilience engineering, contingency planning, workflow automation, and monitoring projects.</p>
            <p>For example, from day one, I’ll think about
              building and securing out-of-band administrative access for important services. I’ll be the one
              documenting service owners, runbooks, and recovery playbooks. Or, depending on risk tolerance, it means
              I’ll at least explicitly document our decision to defer building these items.</p>
            <p>It also means I’m the person who grabs the RJ45 crimper “just in case”. I’m
              the person who remembers to photograph the inside of the junction box, before we seal it up and stuff it back in
              the attic. I’m the person who maintains the wiki page listing all our vendor contacts.</p>
            <h3 id="goals">What I’m looking for</h3>
            <p>I’m passionate about physical, civil infrastructure, so I’m hoping my next role will be <strong>tangible</strong>. I’m interested
              in working on a team and in a role where I routinely interact with tangible facets of our built environment.</p>
            <p>I am especially interested in clean energy, electrification, and power grid engineering. Some of my past jobs
              have been on grid analytics, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and battery engineering. I’d love to continue
              working in this field.</p>
            <p>As a hobby, I hold an <a href="https://abycinc.org/marine-electrical-certification/">ABYC</a> marine electrical certification,
              and I’ve built small-scale solar + storage energy projects for off-grid installations.</p>
            <p>I’m particularly interested in solar, wind, and hydro developers. Grid resiliency engineering companies.
              Home and commercial electrification companies. Anything where I can help push the industry forward, get more
              renewable energy online, build a robust electrical grid, and electrify everything.</p>
            <p>I’m also interested in Internet accessibility and reliability. I spend time with the
              <a href="https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/">FCC Broadband map</a> and the <a href="https://atlas.ripe.net/">RIPE Atlas</a>
              portal for fun, and in past jobs I’ve worked on connectivity tools and services.</p>
            <p>I’m mostly interested in IT and infrastructure roles. I am qualified, but not particularly interested, in pure
              software roles. I did those for the first ~5 years of my career, before beginning to transition over more to
              the IT and infrastructure side.</p>
            <p>Is your growing company hiring its first IT Administrator? Are you looking for someone to handle
              your 50+ SaaS applications, identity challenges, office IT, compliance, and corporate hardware management tasks?
              Let’s talk.</p>
            <p>Do you have a fleet of systems, services, and workloads, running in an onprem, cloud, or hybrid environment, and
              you need a competent Systems Administrator generalist to help tame the chaos? Let’s talk.</p>
            <p>Is your growing engineering team facing engineering workflow, testing, staging, productionization, or
              monitoring challenges? Are you looking for a competent Infrastructure Engineer? Let’s talk.</p>
            <p><em>And of course, as a wildcard –</em> <strong><em>do you work on something that someone who geeks out about Antarctic Infrastructure
                  might enjoy, even if it doesn’t neatly fall into one of the above categories?</em></strong> <em>Let’s talk!</em></p>
            <p>Again, I’m <a href="https://paulcoldren.org/">Paul Coldren</a>, and you can find relevant professional information about me
              on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/coldren-paul/">LinkedIn</a>.
              You can reach me via email at <a href="mailto:hello@brr.fyi">hello@brr.fyi</a>.</p>
            <p><em>Also, I’m just starting to socialize and meet new people here. I’d love to meet up
                with brr readers in the Denver area! I need to find groups for lap swimming and day hikes. And, of course,
                I’ll need to get connected with local Denver infrastructure enthusiasts…
                <a href="https://www.metrowaterrecovery.com/community/tours/">wastewater treatment plant tour</a>, anyone?</em></p>
            <p>Thank you for your help!</p>
