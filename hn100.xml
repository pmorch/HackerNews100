"ICEBlock is designed to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs, and violence against law enforcement is an intolerable red line that cannot be crossed.

Note the form of the ‘g’ in ‘imago leonis’ at the top…</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>English spelling has a reputation. And it’s not a good one. </p><p><span>It’s full of silent letters, as in </span><em><span>num</span><strong>b</strong></em><span>, </span><em><strong>k</strong><span>nee</span></em><span>, and </span><em><strong>h</strong><span>onour</span></em><span>. A given sound can be spelled in multiple ways (</span><em><strong>f</strong><span>arm</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><strong>ph</strong><span>oto</span></em><span>), and many letters make multiple sounds (</span><em><strong>g</strong><span>et</span></em><span>, </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ist</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>mira</span><strong>g</strong><span>e</span></em><span>).</span></p><p>English spelling is so complex that we’ve made mastering it into a competitive sport: what would be the point of a spelling bee in a language with a predictable spelling system? Where’s the fun unless you have to sweat a little as you struggle to recall whether this particular word is one where “‘i’ before ‘e’ except after ‘c’” doesn’t apply?</p><p>In short, English has a complicated writing system.</p><p><span>I’ve written about the origin of some of this complexity before, blaming everyone from </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/why-english-doesnt-use-accents" rel="">the French</a><span> to </span><a href="https://colingorrie.substack.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">stingy printers</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-invention-that-ruined-english" rel="">late medieval yuppies</a><span>. But I’ve not yet plumbed the depths of this complexity. To do so, I will need to tell you the story of </span><strong>yogh</strong><span>,</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-1-172153870" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> an obscure medieval letter whose rise and fall allows us to peer into this abyss.</span></p><p>But like an Icelandic family saga, we begin not with the story of yogh, but with the story of its parent. So allow me to introduce you to the letter ‘g,’ which, as you’ll soon see, is a complicated letter in its own right, dating back to Old English.</p><p>It starts with the shape of the letter. When modern editors print Old English today, they print nice, modern-looking ‘g’s — that is, the ones we use today, with an open or closed loop on the bottom, depending on the typeface.</p><p><span>This modern form of ‘g’ is called the </span><strong>Carolingian</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> It had its origin in the Carolingian minuscule, the script used by the scribes of the Carolingian Renaissance, the great revival of learning which flourished in the vast realm of Charlemagne (reigned 768–814).</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-2-172153870" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p><span>But Old English scribes didn’t write their </span><em>g</em><span>-sounds with a Carolingian ‘g.’ The Old English letter ‘g’ was written in a form called the </span><strong>insular</strong><span> </span><strong>‘g.’</strong><span> Here’s what it looked like: ‘ᵹ.’ It’s like a mix between a ‘z’ and a ‘3.’</span></p><p><span>Let’s see it in action. When the first lines of </span><em>Beowulf</em><span> are written in a modern edition, they look like this:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>Hwæt, we Gardena in geardagum</span><br><span>þeodcyninga þrym gefrunon,</span></em></p><p>‘How we have heard of the glory of the kings of the spear-Danes in days of old’ </p><p><span>(</span><em>Beowulf </em><span>1–2)</span></p></blockquote><p>But in the manuscript, they’re written like this:</p><blockquote><p><em><span>HǷÆT ǷE GARDE</span><br><span>na in</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear da</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>um þeod cynin</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>a</span><br><span>þrym </span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>efrunon</span></em></p><p><em>London, British Library, Cotton MS Vitellius A XV, f. 132r.</em></p></blockquote><p>Now, there’s clearly lots of other weird stuff going on in the manuscript, but focus on how the ‘g’ is represented. While the majuscule (capital) ‘G’ in ‘gardena’ is spelled more like a modern ‘g,’ all the others are insular ‘ᵹ.’</p><p><span>Interestingly, the Anglo-Saxons </span><em>did</em><span> use the Carolingian ‘g’ — just not for Old English. They used it when writing Latin, at least after the late 10th century.

But they were very different from the way they had written Old English, especially in the ‘g’ department.</p><p>But that wasn’t so much of an issue, since these Norman-trained scribes, and those of the generations that came after them, didn’t write much English at all. In fact, writing in English of any kind was very scarce up until the end of the 12th century.</p><p>Over the course of that tumultuous — and, for English, silent — century, the language had changed a great deal. All the scribes trained in the old, Anglo-Saxon traditions were long dead, so when a new generation of scribes turned their attention once again to English, they had to devise some new strategies for writing it.</p><p>And this, after a surprisingly long delay, is where we first meet the star of today’s issue: ‘ȝ,’ also known as yogh. </p><p><span>Yogh is descended from a variant form of the old insular ‘ᵹ.’ But, while the insular ‘ᵹ’ was thought of as the same letter as the Carolingian ‘g’ in Anglo-Saxon times, the yogh ‘ȝ’ of the 12th century was an </span><em>entirely different letter</em><span> from the Carolingian-derived ‘g.’</span></p><p><span>And, stranger still, ‘ȝ’ was used to write two completely different sounds in Middle English, the form of English spoken from around 1100–1450: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound as in </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>oung </span></em><span>or </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>esterday</span></em><span>, and another sound that English has lost altogether.</span></p><p><span>The other sound that ‘ȝ’ once spelled is the “harsh” or “guttural” sound made in the back of the mouth, which you hear in Scots </span><em><span>lo</span><strong>ch</strong></em><strong> </strong><span>or German </span><em><span>Ba</span><strong>ch</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-4-172153870" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> This sound is actually the reason for the most famous bit of English spelling chaos: the sometimes-silent, sometimes-not sequence ‘gh’ that you see in </span><em><span>lau</span><strong>gh</strong></em><span>, </span><em><span>cou</span><strong>gh</strong></em><strong>,</strong><em><span> ni</span><strong>gh</strong><span>t</span></em><span>, and </span><em><span>dau</span><strong>gh</strong><span>ter</span></em><span>.

So perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us that we too have a very yogh-like situation with two of our letters: ‘c’ and — wait for it — ‘g.’</p><p><span>Each of these regularly represents two not particularly similar sounds. The letter ‘c’ sometimes represents a </span><em>k</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>at</span></em><span>, and sometimes an </span><em>s</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>c</strong><span>ity</span></em><span>. The letter ‘g’ is similar: sometimes it writes a true </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span>, but other times, what it represents is a </span><em>j</em><span>-sound, like in </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>em</span></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>If these sounds seem similar to you, pay attention to your tongue as you make each one: the </span><em>k</em><span>-sound and the true </span><em>g-</em><span>sound are made with the back of your tongue hitting against your soft palate. The </span><em>s</em><span>-sound and the ‘j’ sound are made in slightly different places, but in both cases, they use the tip of your tongue coming up against (or close to) just behind your upper teeth.</span></p><p><span>Each of our two double-sounding letters, ‘c’ and ‘g,’ has two variants, which are made at completely different ends of the mouth. This is how yogh worked too: it had one variant made at the back of the mouth (the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound) and the other made towards the front (that’s the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound).</span></p><p><span>There’s actually a good linguistic reason why this pattern keeps happening. It’s a sound change called </span><strong>palatalization</strong><span>: this happens when a sound made towards the back of the mouth, like a </span><em>k</em><span>- or </span><em>g</em><span>-sound, gets pulled forward because it’s next to another sound made at the front of the mouth. Often, these front-of-the-mouth sounds are vowels.</span></p><p><span>In Old English, these front-of-the-mouth vowels (</span><strong>front vowels</strong><span> for short) included the ones spelled ‘i’ and ‘e,’ which sounded like the vowels in </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ee</strong><span> </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>b</span><strong>ay</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-5-172153870" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span> Sometime in the deep prehistory of the English language, the ‘g’ sound got pulled forward in the mouth to sound like ‘y’ whenever it was next to these front vowels.</span></p><p><span>But when it came time to spell these ‘y’ sounds in the Latin alphabet, they still seemed to the Anglo-Saxon scribes to be versions of ‘g’ sounds. So they spelled them ‘ᵹ’ just like they spelled other ‘g’ sounds. This is why, when you read Old English, you can often replace ‘ᵹ’ (or ‘g’ in modern editions) with ‘y’ and get recognizable Modern English words: </span><em><strong>ᵹ</strong><span>ear</span></em><span> is </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ear</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>dæ</span><strong>ᵹ</strong></em><span> is </span><em>day</em><span>, </span><em><span>we</span><strong>ᵹ</strong><span> </span></em><span>is </span><em><span>wa</span><strong>y</strong></em><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-6-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-6-172153870" target="_self" rel="">6</a></span></p><p>A process like this happened in the ancestor of French too, just slightly differently. Instead of the ‘g’ being pulled forward into a ‘y’ sound before ‘i’ and ‘e,’ it got pulled forward into a ‘j’ sound. </p><p><span>This is why the Modern English ‘g’ represents two sounds, one before the letters ‘i’ and ‘e’, and the other before the other letters. It’s because we took our spelling conventions from how the Norman scribes wrote their language, which was an old form of French.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-7-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-7-172153870" target="_self" rel="">7</a></span></p><p><span>While the Norman scribes, and the later English scribes they trained, were used to the letter ‘g’ writing two different sounds, neither was a </span><em>y</em><span>-sound. They needed another letter for that, and they found one: the old insular ‘ᵹ,’ or rather, its descendant, the yogh ‘ȝ.’</span></p><p><span>So that’s why ‘ȝ’ spelled a ‘y’ sound. To understand why ‘ȝ’ also spelled that vanished ‘gh’ sound, however, we need to go back into the distant history of English, long before it was ever written down. Actually, long before there even </span><em>was</em><span> an English. </span></p><p>Back then, there was just one single language, which would later split into English, Dutch, German, Swedish, and all the other Germanic languages.</p><p><span>In this Proto-Germanic language (as it’s called today), the sound that would become the English </span><em>g</em><span>-sound — which the Anglo-Saxons would later spell ‘ᵹ’ — was not the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we have today in words like </span><em><strong>g</strong><span>ood</span></em><span> or </span><em><span>ba</span><strong>g</strong></em><span>. That came later.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the Proto-Germanic ancestor of words like </span><em>good</em><span> had a sound very similar to the later Middle English </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound at the start.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-8-172153870" href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/history-of-letter-yogh#footnote-8-172153870" target="_self" rel="">8</a></span><span> Only later would English harden that </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound into the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound we know today. But this only happened in certain places in the word, especially at the start. At the end of the word, the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound remained. In Old English, both versions were spelled the same: ‘ᵹ.’</span></p><p><span>This means that ‘ᵹ’ actually had </span><strong>three</strong><span> pronunciations in Old English, not two: the </span><em>y</em><span>-sound (next to front vowels), the </span><em>g</em><span>-sound (at the start of words), and the </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound (in the middle of words).

But you just have to know the words in order to figure that out.</span></p><p><span>As inconvenient as this confusion is for us </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-case-for-middle-english" rel="">modern readers of Middle English</a><span>, that isn’t the reason yogh disappeared from the English language. The fate of yogh was sealed by a conspiracy of factors.</span></p><p><span>One is that yogh was never the only alternative for writing the sounds it wrote. The </span><em>y</em><span>-sound could also be written in the way the French wrote it, that is, ‘i’ or ‘y.’ The latter is the spelling that English ended up using for this sound, hence </span><em><strong>y</strong><span>ourself </span></em><span>instead of </span><em><strong>ȝ</strong><span>ourself</span></em><span>. The </span><em>gh</em><span>-sound could also be written ‘h,’ ‘ȝh,’ or ‘gh.’ The last of these, of course, is what English ended up adopting.</span></p><p><span>But the death blow dealt to yogh was the printing press. The earliest printing press in England was a Flemish import, as were the typefaces. But the yogh letter was unique to English, and like the </span><a href="https://www.deadlanguagesociety.com/p/the-lost-letters-of-the-english-alphabet" rel="">other letters unique to English</a><span>, it would be expensive to print. And, as we just saw, there were ready alternatives, so yogh disappeared without a trace… from English.</span></p><p><span>In Scotland, on the other hand, it stuck around for longer. Scots used the combination ‘lȝ’ to represent an ‘ly’ sequence like we have in </span><em><span>mi</span><strong>lli</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> and ‘nȝ’ to represent either the ‘ny’ sequence like in </span><em><span>ca</span><strong>ny</strong><span>on,</span></em><span> or an ‘ng’ sound like in </span><em><span>si</span><strong>ng</strong><span>er</span></em><span>. </span></p><p>And Scottish printers were more eager to keep it than English printers were. So they took advantage of the visual similarity between ‘ȝ’ and ‘z’ — most forms of cursive writing in English still write ‘z’ like ‘ȝ’ — to write their yoghs with ‘z’s.</p><p><span>You still see the results of this substitution, ‘lz’ and ‘nz,’ in certain Scottish names. But the ‘z’ has led them to be pronounced in ways that have nothing to do with their traditional forms. So </span><em>Menzies</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenzie</em><span> were meant to spell things that sounded more like </span><em>Mingus</em><span> and </span><em>Mackenyie</em><span>.</span></p><p>And that’s how one single letter of the Middle English alphabet ended up being pronounced like ‘y,’ ‘gh,’ or even eventually like ‘z.’ I warned you it would be complicated. </p><p>But the journey through the history of yogh has allowed us to peer down some interesting side alleys of the history of writing, from Carolingian scribal practices to the compromises of Scottish printers.</p><p>I don’t lament the loss of yogh myself, not nearly as much as I lament the fate of other lost letters. But if the cause of yogh is one ȝou fancy taking up ȝourself, there’s nothing standing in ȝour waȝ (it’s included in many modern fonts), althouȝ I can imagine hiȝer causes to aspire to.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Chinese scientists have genetically engineered stem cells capable of rejuvenating the health, including the cognition, of aged macaque</p><div>
<p>Key Points:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>“Super stem cells” improve the memory of monkeys while protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The super stem cells prevent age-related bone loss while rejuvenating over 50% of the 61 tissues analyzed.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Treatment with stem cells reduces inflammation and senescent cells (cells that accumulate to promote aging).</li>
</ul>



<p>While small in number, our adult stem cells play a crucial role in regenerating our lost or damaged tissues, rebuilding our body cell by cell. However, with age, our bodies become riddled with inflammation, hardly providing an environment capable of keeping our stem cells healthy. Eventually, our stem cells lose their regenerative capacity, contributing to degenerative aging.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Fox, O, Three&nbsp;</h2>



<p><em>Hydra</em> are a genus of immortal beings that live forever in freshwater environments like lakes and ponds. What scientists have called “<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1440-169X.2009.01143.x">nothing but an active stem cell community</a>,” <em>Hydra</em> can escape death by infinitely regenerating. Their stem cells can continuously proliferate and renew by producing FoxO, a protein they share with humans.&nbsp;</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="808" height="476" src="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra.jpeg 808w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra-300x177.jpeg 300w, https://cms.nad.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Hydra-768x452.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 808px) 100vw, 808px"><figcaption>(Image: <a href="https://www.aip.org/inside-science/how-hydra-regrow-their-heads">aip.org</a>) <strong>The Immortal Hydra.</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In humans, the FoxO protein, specifically the FoxO3 isoform, responds to cellular stress by binding to DNA and turning genes on and off. These genes are involved in numerous cellular processes that promote healthy aging and extended lifespan. This is why the FoxO3 protein’s corresponding gene, <em>FOXO3</em>, is considered a longevity gene.</p>





<h2>Experimenting with SRCs&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As FoxO3 assists cells in resisting stressful environments, such as inflamed tissue, Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers engineered human stem cells to have enhanced FoxO3 activity. As published in <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2825%2900571-9"><em>Cell</em></a>, these senescence-resistant stem cells (SRCs) were designed to exhibit greater resistance to age-related stress. To test this, cynomolgus monkeys, also known as crab-eating macaques, were first stratified into four groups based on age:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>A1: 3-5 years (approximately equivalent to 9-15 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A2: 10-12 years (approximately equivalent to 30-36 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A3: 16-19 years (approximately equivalent to 48-57 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li>A4: 19-23 years (approximately equivalent to 57-69 human years)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>







<p>The oldest of the monkeys, the A4 group, were the focus of the study and were subdivided into three groups. One group was injected with saline (salt and water), another group with normal stem cells, and the third with SRCs. The aged monkeys were injected every two weeks for 44 weeks, approximately equivalent to the duration of three human years. On safety, there were no serious adverse events, such as immune system rejection or tumor growth.&nbsp;</p>

The WTCs are human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) harboring two copies of normal/wild-type <em>FOXO3 </em>(<em>FOXO3</em><sup>+/+</sup>), while the SRCs are edited. The genetically edited <em>FOXO3</em> gene (<em>FOXO3</em><sup>2SA/2SA</sup>) produces a modified FoxO3 protein that stays in the nucleus of cells to increase the transcriptional activity of protective genes. &nbsp;</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>SRCs Improve Cognition&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>



<p>After 44 weeks of biweekly injections, a suite of biological indices was measured from the aged monkeys to assess whether SRCs slow down biological aging. One of these indices was memory retention. To assess memory, the researchers conducted a common experiment called the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA).&nbsp;</p>



<p>For this experiment, each monkey was trained to retrieve food located <em>outside</em> of one of two identical boxes. During the test session, after each monkey was trained, food was placed next to one of the boxes to keep it hidden. Subsequently, a flap was placed in front of the monkey to block the boxes from view. Three seconds later, when the flap was reopened, each monkey had to remember which of the two boxes contained the food.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remarkably, the monkeys injected with SRCs remembered the location of the food with higher accuracy than the monkeys injected with saline. Moreover, the monkeys injected with normal stem cells exhibited the same level of accuracy as the monkeys injected with saline. These findings suggest that SRCs, and not normal stem cells, improve the memory of aged monkeys.&nbsp;</p>

The difference in accuracy between the saline-injected (black) and normal/wild-type stem cell-injected (blue) monkeys was not significant (ns).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, MRI-based structural analysis showed that treatment with SRCs mitigated age-related brain shrinkage. MRI-based experiments also revealed that brain connectivity was restored to that of young (A1 group) monkeys. Namely, the structural connectivity between seven brain regions, including those important for working memory (prefrontal cortex), was rejuvenated with SRC treatment. Overall, these findings suggest that SRC injections improve memory by protecting against neurodegeneration.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Rejuvenate Many Organs and Tissues</h2>



<p>In addition to the brain, the Academy researchers found that SRC treatment rejuvenated multiple organs and tissues. This is important because the rejuvenation of a given organ or tissue could lead to the reduced risk of its corresponding age-related chronic diseases. For example, the rejuvenating effects of SRCs on the brain could reduce the risk of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>One common age-related disease is osteoporosis, characterized by brittle and weak bones that make patients more prone to fractures and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10338097/">deadly falls</a>. Using an X-ray imaging technique called micro-CT, the researchers found evidence for the reversal of age-related bone loss. Namely, while the aged monkeys treated with saline exhibited dental bone loss, the aged monkeys treated with SRCs had teeth more similar to those of young monkeys.&nbsp;</p>


<div>

However, aged monkeys treated with wild-type stem cells (A4-WTC) show less bone loss, while aged monkeys treated with SRCs (A4-SRC) show even less bone loss.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To conduct a body-wide assessment, the researchers measured the up- and down-regulation of genes from 10 systems and 61 tissues. Elevations and reductions in gene activation reflect the function (or dysfunction) of cells, tissues, and organ systems. With that said, SRC treatment was shown to rejuvenate over 50% of the tissues examined, with maximal rejuvenation achieved in areas like the hippocampus (the memory consolidation center of the brain), fallopian tubes, and colon. In contrast, the regular stem cells rejuvenated about 30% of the tissues examined.</p>

Treatment with wild-type stem cells (WTC) rescued 31.15% of genes, while SRCs rescued 54.10% of genes altered by aging.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Confirming some of the rejuvenating effects inferred by the gene experiments, the researchers also observed structural changes to various organs and tissues from aged monkeys treated with SRCs. For example, the vascularity of the lung and heart was improved while the thickening of the aorta was reduced. Neurons had longer projections and fewer proteins associated with Alzheimer’s disease (e.g., beta-amyloid and phosphorylated-tau), and the kidney and brain showed less mineralization [abnormal mineral (usually calcium) deposits].&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SRCs Reduce Cellular Senescence and Inflammation</h2>



<p>Modern scientists have begun to unravel the underlying causes of aging by identifying commonalities between age-related diseases at the cellular level. Two of the most prominent purported underlying causes of aging are chronic inflammation and <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/what-are-senescent-cells-and-how-do-they-drive-aging">senescent cells</a>. With age, senescent cells accumulate throughout the body, promoting inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminating senescent cells, which can be achieved through genetic manipulation or compounds called senolytics, ameliorates age-related diseases and even extends the lifespan of model organisms. Now, the Academy researchers demonstrate that SRCs reduce senescent cells, measured using a blue dye called SA-β-Gal, in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and lungs. Along those lines, SRC treatment also reduced markers of inflammation and other underlying causes of aging, like DNA damage.&nbsp;</p>

In the lung and brain, the number of senescent cells in aged monkeys treated with SRCs (green) was similar to that of young monkeys (pink). Moreover, compared to saline-treated aged monkeys (black), wild-type stem cell-treated aged monkeys (blue) exhibited less senescence in the lungs but not the brain, suggesting normal stem cells affect the lung but not the brain.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2>Stem Cells Make Sense&nbsp;</h2>



<p>When it comes to combating degenerative aging, it makes sense that regenerative stem cells are a promising solution. In fact, one of the <a href="https://www.nad.com/news/hallmarks-of-aging-reversed-therapy">underlying causes of aging</a> is stem cell exhaustion, whereby stem cells lose their regenerative capacity. While normal stem cells have anti-aging effects, as shown by the Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers, they are not protected against stressors like age-related inflammation. This explains why SRCs provide enhanced regenerative capacity (they withstand the harsh microenvironments induced by aging and cellular senescence).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no serious safety concerns were raised during the study, it would seem that SRCs are well tolerated. However, the long-term effects of the SRC treatment will need further evaluation. The primary concern with injecting stem cells into the bloodstream is that they can trigger the spread of cancer almost anywhere in the body. Nevertheless, the SRCs possess tumor suppression properties, suggesting they may not induce tumor growth. If this ends up being true, we may soon see SRCs being tested in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><span>TL;DR:</span><span> We tried OKRs, they created more ceremony than clarity. Our solution: Problem Driven Development, a 4-day quarterly process focused on identifying problems (not solutions), prioritizing as a team, and committing publicly. It's kept us shipping at velocity even as we've scaled to 1.7M+ users.</span></p><p><span>For most of my friends and colleagues at mature software companies, there are usually three ways for an item of work to get put on the board to eventually be done.</span></p><ol><li><span>There is a giant ceremony that determines what gets done by a grab bag of metrics.</span></li><li><span>A deal gets blocked by a missing feature, and the engineering team scrambles jets to eliminate the blocker.</span></li><li><span>Founder feels like we have to build something.</span></li></ol><p><span>Thats not to say that every company is a disorganized mess or a bureaucratic hell scape but, I have never met any engineer who said: “Wow, I just love my company planning process.” </span></p><p><span>These words are seldom spoken in the english language. </span></p><p><span>Railway, was fast approaching 1. and 2. at the same time. </span></p><p><span>Despite us using excellent tools (shoutout Linear) planning is much as a cultural phenomena as well as an interesting engineering problem. From our perspective, we would finalize the features and the requirements what we would want to build once every 3 months and then at times get blindsided every now and then from a new business priority or an incident. Especially now serving 1.7M+ customers, we have to aggregate our taste, feedback, and opportunities and make a roadmap that will get us everything we ever wanted.</span></p><p><span>This was an issue.</span></p><p><span>Why write about something that you would read in Rand’s? It’s Q4 for those who celebrate, and we felt that reigniting the agile vs. waterfall armistice needed to be torn up. (Besides, we’re blogging like it’s 2005.)</span></p><p><span>…and we have spent the better part of 18 months to improve our planning so that we finally get to a process that is not bad, and if you’d like, you can steal it, so that you can deliver excellent products.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#why-is-most-planning-bad,-you-say"><h2><span>Why is most planning bad, you say?</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Mike Tyson asked about his fight plan against Evander Holyfield responded with; “Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.”</span></p><p><span>And that quote ever since would be used out of context to fight the implementation of Objectives, Key Results across the world. At Railway, we aren’t Anti-Planning, we are Anti-Bad-Planning and as such, we used to avoid a lot of it because we always felt that a bad process is massively negative to the status quo. However, we did get to the point where we needed to finally harness the collective attention spans of the company and work towards a goal.</span></p><p><span>Railway at the time was (and is) a vision led company. We fundamentally believe that most infrastructure boilerplate shouldn’t exist so that you can work on what matters. Back in ‘21, we went from a world where we could do our work in weeks, to work that required us to think in months. I implemented a somewhat lighter form of SAFE which splits work between “sprints”, which were short pieces of work, then initiatives which helped grouped “epics” which are long running work-streams to deliver a feature. </span></p><p><span>Despite us having a strong founder, we still wanted the ability to have employees bring projects that they would be excited to work on. </span></p><p><span>As with most young companies, we found quickly that new work would come in and unseat the old work and we would begin anew. </span></p><p><span>So then we turned to OKRs.</span></p><p><span>We thought that having some long term objectives will help us focus the company.</span></p><p><span>We implemented them faithfully, we all read the John Doer book. …and it worked… somewhat. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#okrs-and-software;-water-and-vinegar"><h2><span>OKRs and software; water and vinegar</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We can make this a whole blog post on OKRs. But, trying to hold back here from just ranting and to give you the relevant information. </span></p><p><span>OKRs work REALLY well when you have concrete goals and really simple ways to measure them. Its why they belong at their primary birthplace, the factory. Objectives work when you have something binary or “limited”, like a product existing… or not. Or a product meeting a benchmark… or not. It’s easy to rally a team around them and conquer the world. </span></p><p><span>Where OKRs start to falter, are when you need to use them to prioritize work to meet a “unlimited” objective. Like: “Increase conversion rate of landing page”</span></p><p><span>OKRheads will notice that’s a particularly weak objective, however, teaching an entire organization to all of a sudden be great goal setters, which is what OKRs require you to do made it difficult for engineers to 1) bring them and then 2) plan work around them. Which leads to the first big issue of OKRs- which is that it really depends on the human psychology of the team. Engineers straddle the line between concrete numbers such as uptime, and more creative endeavors such as figuring out how to get a feature implemented right. Whenever the work enters the creative realm, the wheels come off.</span></p><p><span>Which is why outside of the factory, OKRs are great for Sales. You set a number, you get alignment on hitting that number, and then you pick up the phone, email, or LinkedIn until you hit it. The psychology of an account executive matches the planning process.</span></p><p><span>Where OKRs work great, is for alignment. If you are able to set great goals and if you wanted to prescribe a bunch of work toward said goal. …and most startups reach for the High Output Management book (which I love) because there is the lack of alignment between different orgs at a startup. Which is to say, I don’t shame any company reaching for them, the same way newborns have the palmar grasp reflex. We yearn for the alignment.</span></p><p><span>The second big issue for OKRs is that they are, by design, inflexible, once you commit to them. If you spend a week or two planning for them for the year or quarter, and you are midway through realizing that the “KR” part is incorrect, thats a one way door. </span></p><p><span>So we felt pressure into making sure that the OKRs were indeed correct. Which is where you enter the issues of the performative aspects of planning. It felt “mature” for Railway to be having these discussions, even though… it wasn’t productive.</span></p><p><span>At Railway, we would spend a significant amount of time discussing what is a valid OKR, only for us to realize we were two days into the planning process and we’ve yet to decide what we should build for the OKR. </span></p><p><span>This is when Christian, our Head of Operations had an answer for us.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#good-ole-projects"><h2><span>Good Ole Projects</span></h2></a></p><p><span>Instead of crowd sourcing the OKRs from the company and bubbling them up per function Jake and Christian would work on some top level guidance that would provide a macro view of our finances, priorities, and strategy that we have to keep in mind. </span></p><p><span>We then have a Hex dashboard with topline metrics from different sides of the product and business. From a GTM perspective, it’s engagement, signups, and revenue. From an Engineering perspective, it’s support tickets, uptime, and feature performance. </span></p><p><span>This data would give us a “theme”. (You may have seen them in our launch weeks.)</span></p><p><span>Whenever someone goes on Central Station and requests a feature, depending on how large the work is, that usually determines if that request becomes a “Project”. </span></p><p><span>Then around the start of 2024, Christian spun up a Notion DB, and punched in a simple template for each new entry.</span></p><div><p><img alt=""

Product Engineering which delivers features and value to our customers via the UI and terminal. Platform which supports the product with the Infrastructure and the APIs to control that Infrastructure. Then Logistics, which is a synthetic team which includes the Support, Marketing, and Sales function working to be the voice of the customer. </span></p><p><span>We would then fill out a “Project Candidate” and then go to bat on trying to figure out if was a priority that tied to the “theme” that was presented. </span></p><p><span>If something is a P0: it’s an existential company risk, we MUST deliver it.</span></p><p><span>Then, a P1: something we need to deliver for this quarter</span></p><p><span>Lastly, P2: a nice to have.</span></p><p><span>This worked well until some cracks formed.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#99-problems"><h2><span>99 Problems</span></h2></a></p><p><span>At the start of this new process, our team was small enough to list maybe 50 project candidates, discuss as a group and then be on with it but with 200. Spending all day on a call with your co-workers to discuss if something was worth it isn’t the best use of time. </span></p><p><span>Second, Project Candidates would sometimes have full on fleshed out RFC style sections where the author would have a solution ready to go. When a candidate got deprioritized, it’s understandable why someone would feel not great about their hard effort not being reciprocated. </span></p><p><span>Third, to deal with the larger amount of project candidates and additional sources of project candidates, we would set up additional meetings before the planning week that would eat into our engineering cycles. Not that we want to squeeze every engineer for what they are worth, but these negotiation calls would take longer than the main call sometimes. Worse even, was that we would completely reset the board quarter after quarter. </span></p><p><span>Lastly, which was starting to be a bigger issue, was that having Project Candidates being a bottom up process was great when the people who knew that work they needed to do can fit the whole work-stream in their head. But… we were about to embark on a multi-quarter effort that would span all parts of the business to deliver Railway Metal. This system was not great for uncovering planning gaps that required attention from a different team.</span></p><p><span>(With that said, we did ship some really good software thanks to this planning process.)</span></p><p><span>However, Jake, the team, aren’t ones to sit on their laurels so we refined it until we have our current process. </span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#%E2%80%A6and-a-process-ain%E2%80%99t-one."><h2><span>…and a process ain’t one.</span></h2></a></p><p><span>So we flipped the project system on it’s head. </span></p><p><span>Instead, we practice what I call: “Problem Driven Development”</span></p><p><span>Rather than spending a loaded amount of time picking feedback items from our feedback systems, and spending a loaded amount of time on trying to flesh out requirements. We collect problems on a continuous process that begins in earnest on the Friday before our planning week.</span></p><p><span>We stopped asking people to propose solutions and started asking them to articulate problems. </span><span>No more half-baked RFCs that people felt attached to. No more solution-first thinking that locked us into approaches before we understood what we were solving. Just clear problem statements.</span></p><p><span>Here's what a problem looks like in our system:</span></p><p><span>Problem Title:</span><span> "Users can't debug failed deployments without SSHing into containers"</span></p><p><span>Notice what's missing? Any mention of </span><span>how</span><span> we'd solve it. That comes later, after we've committed to solving the problem. Then we turned the two week ceremony into a lightning 4 day sprint.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#the-four-day-process"><h2><span>The Four-Day Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>After the problems are listed and filled out fully, each team on </span><span>Day 1</span><span> enters problems on their own. If a problem isn't fleshed out, it's put in the Parking Lot and we kindly nudge the idea person to fill the template.</span></p><p><span>By the time we get into a room together, everyone's had time to process what's on the board.</span></p><p><span>Then on </span><span>Day 2,</span><span> the planning captain will have a closed session with the team (with spectators from other teams) to put a best guess priority from P0, P1, and P2. If we find that a problem is contentious or requires an external dependency, we mark it so the day after, we can discuss it.</span></p><p><span>By having each team prioritize independently first, we avoid the tragedy of the commons where everything becomes P0 because someone shouted loudest on the call. Platform can look at their problems and say "yes, API reliability is more important than API versioning right now" without having to negotiate with Product in real-time.</span></p><p><span>(We have spent countless hours talking about difficult questions on a call when we have been able to diffuse rough conversations ahead of time.)</span></p><p><span>On </span><span>Day 3</span><span>, we get to a 95 percent certainty on the priorities listed and tie break the dependencies. We also confirm that we have the capacity and staffing to deal with the problems listed on the board. If not, we add a problem for hiring for a specific role.</span></p><p><span>This is where cross-team dependencies surface naturally. When Platform marks "Multi-mount volumes" as P1 and Product marks "HA DBs" as P1, we can see that one blocks the other. We're not discovering this mid-quarter when someone's already three weeks into building the wrong thing.</span></p><p><span>The capacity check is crucial too. We look at people's current commitments, oncall rotations, and whether anyone's about to take parental leave. If we have eight P1 problems and capacity for five, we have an honest conversation about what drops to P2 or what we need to hire for.</span></p><p><span>Then lastly, </span><span>Day 4</span><span>, commitment. Everyone looks at the whole list, mention final objections if we should be working on something that we aren't— or vice versa. After we confirm priorities, we assign problems to people by giving them a DRI (Directly Responsible Individual).</span></p><p><span>Then, we look into each other's eyes, as much as anyone can on a video call, and commit.</span></p><p><span>After the starting gun is off, we then write RFCs on problems to see how we can best solve them which eventually become Linear tickets.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/product-planning-improvement#steal-this-process"><h2><span>Steal This Process</span></h2></a></p><p><span>We're working on open-sourcing our Notion templates because honestly, this isn't rocket science. It's just:</span></p><ol><li><span>Cataloguing your problems, not solutions</span></li><li><span>Let teams prioritize independently before negotiating</span></li><li><span>Front-load the hard conversations</span></li><li><span>Commit publicly</span></li><li><span>Then, </span><span>and only then</span><span>, figure out how to solve it</span></li></ol><p><span>But the real hard part was building a culture where people feel safe bringing up problems without having to defend their pet solutions.</span></p><p><span>Keep process to a minimum, focus on performance of shipping, not performative work.</span></p><p><span>And like any good product, our planning process will keep evolving. Maybe in six months we'll realize Problem Driven Development has its own cracks. </span><span>Theres always plenty to do on planning and I think we generally know how it’ll need to evolve, but we try to take small steps from cycle to cycle.  </span><span> If that happens, we'll write another blog post about what we learned and what we changed.</span></p><p><span>Until then, we're shipping.</span></p></section></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
Every time I look at someone’s simple static site generation setup for their
blog, I feel a pang of envy. I’m sure I could make a decent blogging engine in
2,000 lines of code, and it would be something I’d understand, be proud over,
able to extend, and willing to share with others.
</p>

<p>
Instead, I write these articles in Org mode, and use mostly the standard Org
publishing functions to export them to <abbr>html</abbr>. This is <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/long-hiatus-emacs-upgrades.html">sometimes brittle</a>, but
most annoyingly, I don’t understand it. I have been asked for details on how my
publishing flow works, but the truth is I have no idea what happens when I run
the <code>org-publish-current-file</code> command.
</p>

<p>
I could find out by tracing the evaluation of the Lisp code that runs on export,
but I won’t, because just the <abbr>html</abbr> exporting code (<code>ox-html.el</code>) is 5,000
lines of complexity. The general exporting framework (<code>ox-publish.el</code> and
<code>ox.el</code>) is 8,000 lines. The framework depends on Org parsing code
(<code>org-element.el</code>) which is at least another 9,000 lines. This is over 20,000
lines of complexity I’d need to contend with.
</p>

<p>
It might seem like a no-brainer to just write that 2,000 line custom static
generator and use that instead.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
Except one thing: Babel.
</p>

<p>
Any lightweight markup format (like Markdown or ReStructuredText or whatever)
allows for embedding code blocks, but Org, through Babel, can <i>run</i> that code on
export, and then display the output in the published document, <i>even when the
output is a table or an image</i>. It supports sessions that lets code reuse
definitions from earlier code blocks. It allows for injecting variables from the
markup into the code, and vice versa. As a bonus, Org doesn’t require a
JavaScript syntax highlighter, because it generates inline styles in the source
code.
</p>

<p>
It does this for a large number of languages, although I mainly use it with R
for drawing plots. Being able to do this is incredibly convenient, because it
makes it trivial to <a href="https://entropicthoughts.com/intention-to-treat-experiments.html">draft data, illustrations, and text at the same time</a>,
adjusting both until the article coheres. Having tried it, I cannot see myself
living without it.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
A simple 2,000 line blogging engine would be a fun weekend project. Mirroring
the features of Babel I use would turn it into a multi-month endeavour for
someone with limited time such as myself. Not going to happen, and I will
continue to beat myself up for overcomplicating my publishing workflow.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/not-written-with-ai/">https://www.fastmail.com/blog/not-written-with-ai/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453135">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body="" data-cms-edit="content"> <p>It’s all the rage right now. Everyone is scrambling to put AI into their products. The uncanny valley is shrinking enough that it’s hard to see how much AI was used to write something.</p> <p>This isn’t entirely new, auto-complete on my phone already suggests the most likely word when I’m typing. AI writing tools are an extension of this, but they’re also much more capable.</p> <h2 id="your-electronic-memory" tabindex="-1">Your electronic memory</h2> <p>I stand by one of the most important truths about email. It’s not only the largest and most diverse social network, <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/email-is-your-electronic-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email is your electronic memory</a>.</p> <p>In the novel 1984, the “Ministry of Truth” has a whole massive department which rewrites history. In a world where there’s enough AI capability to process the entire web and rewrite every page to remove something, the cost of “changing history” is much reduced, so we can expect more of it.</p> <p>This is where the immutability of email really shines. An email is your copy, and the sender can’t revise it later. This is frustrating when you’ve sent the wrong thing and have to send a separate correction later, but in the long term it’s insanely valuable.</p> <p>It makes a huge difference to be able to go back and double-check your memory against an email you saw years ago and know that if they disagree, the email is correct. This is already not the case with web pages — they change, and it’s only becoming worse.</p> <h2 id="adapting-to-a-changing-world" tabindex="-1">Adapting to a changing world</h2> <p>My son is studying at University now, and he’s one of a few students in his class who refuses to use AI to write his assignments. As he said “what’s the point of paying to be here if I’m not going to build the knowledge and skills for myself, and come out knowing how to do the thing” (near enough… I didn’t write the exact words down in an email, so I’m going off my own fallible memory!) I am so proud of him for having that attitude.</p> <p>I’m also pleased to see that Fastmail’s staff, and many of our customers, are wary of AI tools.</p> <p>But they are that, tools. The world is changing, and we need to adapt and understand it.</p> <h2 id="our-service-your-data" tabindex="-1">Our service, your data</h2> <p>For our service, we want you to be able to do what you desire with your own email, calendars, and contacts. We will continue to build tools and integrations to make that easier.</p> <p>You are welcome to operate your Fastmail account with AI tools, so long as that usage doesn’t otherwise breach our <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/policies/terms-of-service/">Terms of Service</a>, or degrade the performance of our systems for other customers.</p> <h2 id="our-staff-your-privacy" tabindex="-1">Our staff, your privacy</h2> <p>For our staff, we encourage understanding the tools that exist in the world, and how to use them safely. Our policy makes it clear that any use of tools, including tools with AI in them, must follow clear privacy-preserving principles:</p> <ul> <li>Data Protection: All data protection, confidentiality, and privacy policies must be followed (our vendors for things like anti-abuse and support are moving towards using AI for translation, categorization, abuse detection – and we are ensuring that their policies continue to provide protection for our customers)</li> <li>Accountability for work: Any AI generated writing or code must be reviewed and understood by a human being, and go through our regular second-set-of-eyes processes before being used</li> <li>Bias awareness: Actively look for biases or hallucinations in AI output</li> <li>Human authority: Always have a path for appeal to a human from any decision that is made by automated tools</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-future" tabindex="-1">The future</h2> <p>Who knows what the future will bring, but we continue to be guided by the principles that we first <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/fastmails-values/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">publicly articulated in 2016</a> and have held even longer. The data is yours, and we will be good stewards and good internet citizens, helping enable you to use your data in the ways you choose.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div itemprop="articleBody">
          
          
          
<p>This blog used to run using with a stack based on <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a> using <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/">Pollen</a> and <a href="https://andregarzia.com/2022/05/How-this-blog-works-or-embracing-chaos.html">lots of hacks on top of it</a>. At some point I realised that my setup was working against me. The moving parts and workflow I created added too much friction to keep my blog active. That happened mostly because it was a static generator trying to behave as if it was dynamic website with an editing interface. That can be done really well — cue <a href="https://getgrav.org/">Grav CMS</a> — but that was not the case for me.</p>
<p>Once I decided to rewrite this blog as a simpler system, I faced the dilema of what stack to choose. The obvious choice for me would be Javascript, it is the language I use more often and one that I am quite confortable with. Still, I don't think it is a wise choice for the kind of blog I want to maintain.</p>
<p>Talking to some friends recently, I noticed that many people I know that have implemented their own blogging systems face many challenges keeping them running over many years. Not because it is hard to keep software running, but because their stack of choice is moving faster than their codebase.</p>
<p>This problem is specially prevalent in the Javascript world. It is almost a crime that JS as understood by the browser is this beautiful language with extreme retrocompatibility, while JS as understood and used by the current tooling and workflows is this mess moving at lightspeed. Let me unpack that for a bit.</p>
<p>You can open a web page from 1995 on your browser of choice and it will just work because browser vendors try really hard to make sure they don't break the web.</p>
<p>Developers who built the whole ecosystem of NodeJS, NPM, and all those libraries and frameworks don't share the same ethos. They all make a big case of semantic versioning and thus being able to handle breaking changes, but they have breaking changes all the time. You'd be hardpressed to actually run some JS code from ten years ago based on NodeJS and NPM. There is a big chance that dependencies might be gone, broken, or it might be incompatible with the current NodeJS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know this sounds like FUD, and that for many many projects, maybe even most projects, that will not be the case. But I heard from many people that keeping their blogging systems up to date requires a lot more work than they would like to do and if they don't, then they're screwed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is also true about other languages even though many of them move at a slower speed. A friend recently complained about a blogging system he implemented that requires Ruby 2.0 and that keeping that running sucks.</p>
<p>I want a simpler blogging system; one that requires minimal changes over time.</p>
<h3>Now we talk about Lua</h3>
<p><a href="https://lua.org/">Lua</a> is a wonderful and nimble language that is <a href="https://andregarzia.com/2021/01/lua-a-misunderstood-language.html">often misunderstood</a>.</p>
<p>One characteristic that I love about it, is that is evolves very slowly. Lua 5.1 was introduced in 2006, Lua 5.4 which is the current version initial release was in 2020. Yes, there are point released in between, but you can see how much slower it moves when compared to JS.</p>
<p>The differences between Lua 5.1 and Lua 5.4 are minimal when compared with how much other languages changed in the same time period.</p>
<p>Lua only requires a C89 compiler to bootstrap itself. It is very easy to make Lua work and even easier to make it interface with something.</p>
<p>JS is a lot larger than Lua, there is more to understand and more to remember. My blog needs are very simple and Lua can handle them with ease.</p>
<h2>How this blog works</h2>
<p>This is an old-school blog. I uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">cgi-bin</a> — aka Comon Gateway Interface — scripts to run it. It is a dynamic website with a <a href="https://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database holding its data. When you open a page, it fetches the data from a database and assembles a HTML to send to the browser using <a href="https://luarocks.org/modules/olivine-labs/lustache">Mustache</a> templates.</p>
<p>One process per request. Like the old days.</p>
<p>You might argue that if I went with NodeJS, I'd be able to serve more requests using fewer resources. That is true. I don't need to serve that many requests though. My peak access was a couple years ago with 50k visitors on a week, even my old Racket blog could handle that fine. The Lua one should handle it too; and if it breaks it breaks. I'm a flawed human being, my code can be flawed too, we're in this together, holding hands.</p>
<p>Your blog is your place to experiment and program how you want it. You can drop the JS fatigue, you can drop your fancy Haskell types, you can just do whatever you find fun and keep going (and that includes JS and Haskell if that's your thing. You do you).</p>
<p>Cause I'm using Lua, I don't have as many libraries and frameworks available to me as JS people have, but I still have quite a large collection via <a href="https://luarocks.org/">Luarocks</a>. I try not to add many dependencies to my blog. At the moment there are about ten and that is mostly because Lua is a batteries-not-included language so you start from a minimal core and build things up to suit your needs.</p>
<p>For a lot of things I went with the questionable choice of implementing things myself. I got my own little CGI library. It is 200 lines long and does the bare minimum to make this blog work. I got my own little libraries for many things. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/micropub/">Micropub</a> and <a href="https://indieauth.net/">IndieAuth</a> were all implemented by hand.</p>
<p>At the moment I'm <strike>despairing</strike> <strike>frustrated</strike> having a lot of fun implementing <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">WebMentions</a>. Doing the <a href="https://microformats.org/wiki/microformats2">Microformats2</a> <strike>exorcism</strike> extraction on my own is teaching me a lot of things.</p>
<p>What I want to say is that by choosing a small language that moves very slowly and very few dependencies, I can keep all of my blogging system in my head. I can make sure it will run without too much change for the next ten or twenty years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lua is a lego set, a toolkit, it adapts to you and your needs. I don't need to keep chasing the new shiny or the latest framework du jour. I can focus on making the features I want and actually understanding how they work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of installing a single dependency in another language and it pulling a hundred of other small dependencies all of which were transpiled into something the engine understands to the point that understanding how all the pieces work and fit together takes more time than to learn a new language, I decided to keep things simple.</p>
<p>I got 29 Luarocks installed here and that is for all my Lua projects in this machine. That is my blog, my game development, my own work scripts for my day job. Not even half of those are for my blog.</p>
<p>I often see wisdom in websites such as Hacker News and Lobsters around the idea of "choosing boring" because it is proven, safe, easier to maintain. I think that boring is not necessarily applicable to my case. I don't find Lua boring at all, but all that those blog posts talk about that kind of mindset are all applicable to my own choices here.</p>
<p>Next time you're building your own blogging software, consider for a bit for how long do you want to maintain it. I first started blogging on macOS 8 in 2001. I choose badly many times and in the end couldn't keep my content moving forward in time with me as softwares I used or created became impossible to run. The last two changes: from JS to Racket and from Racket to Lua have been a lot safer and I managed to carry all my content forward into increasingly simpler setups and workflows.</p>
<p>My blogging system is not becoming more complex over the years, it is becoming smaller, because with each change I select a stack that is more nimble and smaller than the one I had before. I don't think I can go smaller than Lua though.</p>
<p>By small I mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>A language I can fully understand and keep on my head.</li>
<li>A language that I know how to build the engine and can do it if needed.</li>
<li>An engine that requires very few resources and is easy to interface with third-party libraries in native code.</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose Lua because of all that, and I'm happy with it and hope this engine will see me through the next ten or so years.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:06:10 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://signal.org/blog/spqr/">https://signal.org/blog/spqr/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45451527">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-header.png" alt="A stylized Signal logo inscribed with mathematical symbols representing a qubit."></p><p>We are excited to announce a significant advancement in the security of the Signal Protocol: the introduction of the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet (SPQR). This new ratchet enhances the Signal Protocol’s resilience against future quantum computing threats while maintaining our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security.</p><p>The Signal Protocol is a set of cryptographic specifications that provides end-to-end encryption for private communications exchanged daily by billions of people around the world. After its publication in 2013, the open source Signal Protocol was adopted not only by the Signal application but also by other major messaging products. Technical information on the Signal Protocol can be found in the specifications section of our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">docs</a> site.</p><p>In a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">previous blog post</a>, we announced the first step towards advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an upgrade called PQXDH that incorporates quantum-resistent cryptographic secrets when chat sessions are established in order to protect against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_now%2C_decrypt_later">harvest-now-decrypt-later</a> attacks that could allow current chat sessions to become compromised if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer is developed in the future. However, the Signal Protocol isn’t just about protecting cryptographic material and keys at the beginning of a new chat or phone call; it’s also designed to minimize damage and heal from compromise as that conversation continues.</p><p>We refer to these security goals as Forward Secrecy (FS) and Post-Compromise Security (PCS). FS and PCS can be considered mirrors of each other: FS protects past messages against future compromise, while PCS protects future messages from past compromise. Today, we are happy to announce the next step in advancing quantum resistance for the Signal Protocol: an additional regularly advancing post-quantum ratchet called the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR. On its own, SPQR provides secure messaging that provably achieves these FS and PCS guarantees in a quantum safe manner. We mix the output of this new ratcheting protocol with Signal’s existing Double Ratchet, in a combination we refer to as the Triple Ratchet.</p><p>What does this mean for you as a Signal user? First, when it comes to your experience using the app, nothing changes. Second, because of how we’re rolling this out and mixing it in with our existing encryption, eventually all of your conversations will move to this new protocol without you needing to take any action. Third, and most importantly, this protects your communications both now and in the event that cryptographically relevant quantum computers eventually become a reality, and it allows us to maintain our existing security guarantees of forward secrecy and post-compromise security as we proactively prepare for that new world.</p><h2 id="the-current-state-of-the-signal-protocol">The Current State of the Signal Protocol</h2><p>The original Signal ratchet uses hash functions for FS and a set of elliptic-curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) secret exchanges for PCS. The hash functions are quantum safe, but elliptic-curve cryptography is not. An example is in order: our favorite users, Alice and Bob, establish a long-term connection and chat over it regularly. During that session’s lifetime, Alice and Bob regularly agree on new ECDH secrets and use them to “ratchet” their session. Mean ol’ Mallory records the entire (encrypted) communication, and really wants to know what Alice and Bob are talking about.</p><p>The concept of a “ratchet” is crucial to our current non-quantum FS/PCS protection. In the physical world, a ratchet is a mechanism that allows a gear to rotate forward, but disallows rotation backwards. In the Signal Protocol, it takes on a similar role. When Alice and Bob “ratchet” their session, they replace the set of keys they were using prior with a new set based on both the older secrets and a new one they agree upon. Given access to those new secrets, though, there’s no (non-quantum) way to compute the older secrets. By being “one-way”, this ratcheting mechanism provides FS.</p><p>The ECDH mechanism allows Alice and Bob to generate new, small (32 bytes) data blobs and attach them to every message. Whenever each party receives a message from the other, they can locally (and relatively cheaply) use this data blob to agree on a new shared secret, then use that secret to ratchet their side of the protocol. Crucially, ECDH also allows Alice and Bob to both agree on the new secret without sending that secret itself over their session, and in fact without sending anything over the session that Mallory could use to determine it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange">This description of Diffie-Hellman key exchange</a> provides more details on the concepts of such a key exchange, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic-curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">this description of ECDH</a> provides specific details on the variant used by the current Signal protocol.</p><p>Sometime midway through the lifetime of Alice and Bob’s session, Mallory successfully breaches the defences of both Alice and Bob, gaining access to all of the (current) secrets used for their session at the time of request. Alice and Bob should have the benefits of Forward Secrecy - they’ve ratcheted sometime recently before the compromise, so no messages earlier than their last ratchet are accessible to Mallory, since ratcheting isn’t reversible. They also retain the benefits of Post-Compromise Security. Their ratcheting after Mallory’s secret access agrees upon new keys that can’t be gleaned just from the captured data they pass between each other, re-securing the session.</p><p>Should Mallory have access to a quantum computer, though, things aren’t so simple. Because elliptic curve cryptography is not quantum resistant, it’s possible that Mallory could glean access to the secret that Alice and Bob agreed upon, just by looking at the communication between them. Given this, Alice and Bob’s session will never “heal”; Mallory’s access to their network traffic from this point forward will allow her to decrypt all future communications.</p><h2 id="mixing-in-quantum-security">Mixing In Quantum Security</h2><p>In order to make our security guarantees stand up to quantum attacks, we need to mix in secrets generated from quantum secure algorithms. In PQXDH, we did this by performing an additional round of key agreement during the session-initiating handshake, then mixing the resulting shared secret into the initial secret material used to create Signal sessions. To handle FS and PCS, we need to do continuous key agreement, where over the lifetime of a session we keep generating new shared secrets and mixing those keys into our encryption keys.</p><p>Luckily there is a tool designed exactly for this purpose: the quantum-secure Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). KEMs share similar behavior to the Diffie-Hellman mechanisms we described earlier, where two clients provide each other with information, eventually deciding on a shared secret, without anyone who intercepts their communications being able to access that secret. However, there is one important distinction for KEMs - they require ordered, asymmetric messages to be passed between their clients. In ECDH, both clients send the other some public parameters, and both combine these parameters with their locally held secrets and come up with an identical shared secret. In the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final">standardized</a> ML-KEM key-encapsulation mechanism, though, the initiating client generates a pair of encapsulation key (EK) and decapsulation key (DK) (analogous to a public and private key respectively) and sends the EK. The receiving client receives it, generates a secret, and wraps it into a ciphertext (CT) with that key. The initiating client receives that CT and decapsulates with its previously generated DK. In the end, both clients have access to the new, shared secret, just through slightly different means.</p><p>Wanting to integrate this quantum-secure key sharing into Signal, we could take a simple, naive approach for each session. When Alice initiates a session with Bob,</p><ul><li>Alice, with every message she sends, sends an EK</li><li>Bob, with every message he receives, generates a secret and a CT, and sends the CT back</li><li>Alice, on receiving a CT, extracts the secret with her DK and mixes it in</li></ul><p>This initially simple-looking approach, though, quickly runs into a number of issues we’ll need to address to make our protocol actually robust. First, encapsulation keys and CTs are large - over 1000 bytes each for ML-KEM 768, compared to the 32 bytes required for ECDH. Second, while this protocol works well when both clients are online, what happens when a client is offline? Or a message is dropped or reordered? Or Alice wants to send 10 messages before Bob wants to send one?</p><p>Some of these problems have well-understood solutions, but others have trade-offs that may shine in certain circumstances but fall short in others. Let’s dive in and come to some conclusions.</p><h2 id="who-wants-what-when">Who Wants What When</h2><p>How does Alice decide what to send based on what Bob needs next, and vice versa? If Bob hasn’t received an EK yet, she shouldn’t send the next one. What does Bob send when he hasn’t yet received an EK from Alice, or when he has, but he’s already responded to it? This is a common problem when remote parties send messages to communicate, so there’s a good, well-understood solution: a state machine. Alice and Bob both keep track of “what state am I in”, and base their decisions on that. When sending or receiving a message, they might also change their state. For example:</p><ul><li>Alice wants to send a message, but she’s in a StartingA state, so she doesn’t have an EK. So, she generates an EK/DK pair, stores them locally, and transitions to the SendEK state</li><li>Alice wants to send a message and is in the SendEK state. She sends the EK along with the message</li><li>Alice wants to send another message, but she’s still in the SendEK state. So, she sends the EK with the new message as well</li><li>Bob receives the message with the EK. He generates a secret and uses the EK to create a CT. He transitions to the SendingCT state.</li><li>Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the message</li><li>Bob wants to send a message and he’s in the SendingCT state. He sends the CT along with the message</li><li>… etc …</li></ul><p>By crafting a set of states and transitions, both sides can coordinate what’s sent. Note, though, that even in this simple case, we see problems. For example, we’re sending our (large) EK and (large) CT multiple times.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-3.png" alt="SPQR State Machine Diagram"></p><h2 id="say-or-send-less">Say (or Send) Less</h2><p>We’ve already mentioned that the size of the data we’re sending has increased pretty drastically, from 32 bytes to over 1000 per message. But bandwidth is expensive, especially on consumer devices like client phones, that may be anywhere in the world and have extremely varied costs for sending bytes over the wire. So let’s discuss strategies for conserving that bandwidth.</p><p>First, the simplest approach - don’t send a new key with every message. Just, for example, send with every 50 messages, or once a week, or every 50 messages unless you haven’t sent a key in a week, or any other combination of options. All of these approaches tend to work pretty well in online cases, where both sides of a session are communicating in real-time with no message loss. But in cases where one side is offline or loss can occur, they can be problematic. Consider the case of “send a key if you haven’t sent one in a week”. If Bob has been offline for 2 weeks, what does Alice do when she wants to send a message? What happens if we can lose messages, and we lose the one in fifty that contains a new key? Or, what happens if there’s an attacker in the middle that wants to stop us from generating new secrets, and can look for messages that are 1000 bytes larger than the others and drop them, only allowing keyless messages through?</p><p>Another method is to chunk up a message. Want to send 1000 bytes? Send 10 chunks of 100 bytes each. Already sent 10 chunks? Resend the first chunk, then the second, etc. This smooths out the total number of bytes sent, keeping individual message sizes small and uniform. And often, loss of messages is handled. If chunk 1 was lost, just wait for it to be resent. But it runs into an issue with message loss - if chunk 99 was lost, the receiver has to wait for all of chunks 1-98 to be resent before it receives the chunk it missed. More importantly, if a malicious middleman wants to stop keys from being decided upon, they could always drop chunk 3, never allowing the full key to pass between the two parties.</p><p>We can get around all of these issues using a concept called erasure codes. Erasure codes work by breaking up a larger message into smaller chunks, then sending those along. Let’s consider our 1000 byte message being sent as 100 byte chunks again. After chunk #10 has been sent, the entirety of the original 1000 byte message has been sent along in cleartext. But rather than just send the first chunk over again, erasure codes build up a new chunk #11, and #12, etc. And they build them in such a way that, once the recipient receives any 10 chunks in any order, they’ll be able to reconstruct the original 1000 byte message.</p><p>When we put this concept of erasure code chunks together with our previous state machine, it gives us a way to send large blocks of data in small chunks, while handling messages that are dropped. Crucially, this includes messages dropped by a malicious middleman: since any N chunks can be used to recreate the original message, a bad actor would need to drop all messages after #N-1 to disallow the data to go through, forcing them into a complete (and highly noticeable) denial of service. Now, if Alice wants to send an EK to Bob, Alice will:</p><ol><li>Transition from the StartingA state to the SendingEK state, by generating a new EK and chunking it</li><li>While in the SendingEK state, send a new chunk of the EK along with any messages she sends</li><li>When she receives confirmation that the recipient has received the EK (when she receives a chunk of CT), transition to the ReceivingCT state</li></ol><p>On Bob’s side, he will:</p><ol><li>Transition from the StartingB state to the ReceivingEK state when he receives its first EK chunk</li><li>Keep receiving EK chunks until he has enough to reconstruct the EK</li><li>At that point, reconstruct the EK, generate the CT, chunk the CT, and transition to the SendingCT state</li><li>From this point on, he will send a chunk of the CT with every message</li></ol><p>One interesting way of looking at this protocol so far is to consider the messages flowing from Alice to Bob as potential capacity for sending data associated with post-quantum ratcheting: each message that we send, we could also send additional data like a chunk of EK or of the CT. If we look at Bob’s side, above, we notice that sometimes he’s using that capacity (IE: in step 4 when he’s sending CT chunks) and sometimes he’s not (if he sends a message to Alice during step 2, he has no additional data to send). This capacity is pretty limited, so using more of it gives us the potential to speed up our protocol and agree on new secrets more frequently.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-1.png" alt="SPQR Flow Diagram illustrating how bandwidth consumption is optimized"></p><h2 id="a-meditation-on-how-faster-isnt-always-better">A Meditation On How Faster Isn’t Always Better</h2><p>We want to generate shared secrets, then use them to secure messages. So, does that mean that we want to generate shared secrets as fast as possible? Let’s introduce a new term: an epoch. Alice and Bob start their sessions in epoch 0, sending the EKs for epoch 1 (EK#1) and associated ciphertext (CT#1) to each other. Once that process completes, they have a new shared secret they use to enter epoch 1, after which all newly sent messages are protected by the new secret. Each time they generate a new shared secret, they use it to enter a new epoch. Surely, every time we enter a new epoch with a new shared secret, we protect messages before that secret (FS) and after that secret (PCS), so faster generation is better? It seems simple, but there’s an interesting complexity here that deserves attention.</p><p>First, let’s discuss how to do things faster. Right now, there’s a lot of capacity we’re not using: Bob sends nothing while Alice sends an EK, and Alice sends nothing while Bob sends a CT. Speeding this up isn’t actually that hard. Let’s change things so that Alice sends EK#1, and once Bob acknowledges its receipt, Alice immediately generates and sends EK#2. And once she notices Bob has received that, she generates and sends EK#3, etc. Whenever Alice sends a new message, she always has data to send along with it (new EK chunks), so she’s using its full capacity. Bob doesn’t always have a new CT to send, but he is receiving EKs as fast as Alice can send them, so he often has a new CT to send along.</p><p>But now let’s consider what happens when an attacker gains access to Alice. Let’s say that Alice has sent EK#1 and EK#2 to Bob, and she’s in the process of sending EK#3. Bob has acknowledged receipt of EK#1 and EK#2, but he’s still in the process of sending CT#1, since in this case Bob sends fewer messages to Alice than vice versa. Because Alice has already generated 3 EKs she hasn’t used, Alice needs to keep the associated DK#1, DK#2, and DK#3 around. So, if at this point someone maliciously gains control of Alice’s device, they gain access to both the secrets associated with the current epoch (here, epoch 0) and to the DKs necessary to reconstruct the secrets to other epochs (here, epochs 1, 2, and 3) using only the over-the-wire CT that Bob has yet to send. This is a big problem: by generating secrets early, we’ve actually made the in-progress epochs and any messages that will be sent within them less secure against this single-point-in-time breach.</p><p>To test this out, we at Signal built a number of different state machines, each sending different sets of data either in parallel or serially. We then ran these state machines in numerous simulations, varying things like the ratio of messages sent by Alice vs Bob, the amount of data loss or reordering, etc. And while running these simulations, we tracked what epochs’ secrets were exposed at any point in time, assuming an attacker were to breach either Alice’s or Bob’s secret store. The results showed that, in general, while simulations that handled multiple epochs’ secrets in parallel (IE: by sending EK#2 before receipt of CT#1) did generate new epochs more quickly, they actually made more messages vulnerable to a single breach.</p><h2 id="but-lets-still-be-efficient">But Let’s Still Be Efficient</h2><p>This still leaves us with a problem, though: the capacity present in messages we send in either direction is still a precious resource, and we want to use it as efficiently as possible. And our simple approach of Alice’s “send EK, receive CT, repeat” and Bob’s “receive EK, send CT, repeat” leaves lots of time where Alice and Bob have nothing to send, should that capacity be available.</p><p>To improve our use of our sending capacity, we decided to take a harder look into the ML-KEM algorithm we’re using to share secrets, to see if there was room to improve. Let’s break things down more and share some actual specifics on the ML-KEM algorithm.</p><ol><li>Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DK</li><li>Bob receives the EK</li><li>Bob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice</li><li>Alice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secret</li></ol><p>Diving in further, we can break out step #3 into some sub-steps</p><ol><li>Alice generates an EK of 1184 bytes to send to Bob, and an associated DK</li><li>Bob receives the EK</li><li>Bob samples a new shared secret (32 bytes), which he encrypts with EK into a CT of 1088 bytes to send to Alice<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><ol type="a"><li> Bob creates a new shared secret S and sampled randomness R by sampling entropy and combining it with a hash of EK</li><li>Bob hashes the EK into a Hash</li><li>Bob pulls 32 bytes of the EK, a Seed</li><li>Bob uses the Seed and R to generate the majority of the CT</li><li>Bob then uses S and EK to generate the last portion of the CT</li></ol></li><li>Alice receives the CT, uses the DK to decrypt it, and now also has access to the 32 byte shared secret</li></ol><p>Step 3.d, which generates 960 bytes of the 1088-byte CT, only needs 64 bytes of input: a Seed that’s 32 of EK’s bytes, and the hash of EK, which is an additional 32. If we combine these values and send them first, then most of EK and most of the CT can be sent in parallel from Alice to Bob and Bob to Alice respectively. Our more complicated but more efficient secret sharing now looks like this:</p><ol><li>Alice generates EK and DK. Alice extracts the 32-byte Seed from EK</li><li>Alice sends 64 bytes EK<sub>1</sub> (Seed + Hash(EK)) to Bob. Bob sends nothing during this time.</li><li>Bob receives the Seed and Hash, and generates the first, largest part of the CT from them (CT<sub>1</sub>)</li><li>After this point, Alice sends EK<sub>2</sub> (the rest of the EK minus the Seed), while Bob sends CT<sub>1</sub></li><li>Bob eventually receives EK<sub>2</sub>, and uses it to generate the final portion of the CT (CT<sub>2</sub>)</li><li>Once Alice tells Bob that he has received all of CT<sub>1</sub>, Bob sends Alice CT<sub>2</sub>. Alice sends nothing during this time.</li><li>With both sides having all of the pieces of EK and the CT that they need, they extract their shared secret and increment their epoch</li></ol><p>There are still places in this algorithm (specifically steps 2 and 6) where one side has nothing to send. But during those times, the other side has only a very small amount of information to send, so the duration of those steps is minimal compared to the rest of the process. Specifically, while the full EK is 37 chunks and the full CT is 34, the two pieces of the new protocol which must be sent without data being received (EK<sub>1</sub> and CT<sub>2</sub>) are 2 and 4 chunks respectively, while the pieces that can be sent while also receiving (EK<sub>2</sub> and CT<sub>1</sub>) are the bulk of the data, at 36 and 30 chunks respectively. Far more of our sending capacity is actually used with this approach.</p><p><img src="https://signal.org/blog/images/spqr-2.png" alt="SPQR Flow Diagram showing improved bandwidth efficiency"></p><p>Remember that all of this is just to perform a quantum-safe key exchange that gives us a secret we can mix into the bigger protocol. To help us organize our code, our security proofs, and our understanding better we treat this process as a standalone protocol that we call <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/mlkembraid/">the ML-KEM Braid</a>.</p><p>This work was greatly aided by the authors of the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/libcrux-ml-kem">libcrux-ml-kem</a> Rust library, who graciously exposed the APIs necessary to work with this incremental version of ML-KEM 768. With this approach completed, we’ve been able to really efficiently use the sending capacity of messages sent between two parties to share secrets as quickly as possible without exposing secrets from multiple epochs to potential attackers.</p><h2 id="mixing-things-up---the-triple-ratchet">Mixing Things Up - The Triple Ratchet</h2><p>There are plenty of details to add to make sure that we reached every corner - check those out in our <a href="https://signal.org/docs/">online protocol documentation</a> - but this basic idea lets us build secure messaging that has post-quantum FS and PCS without using up anyone’s data. We’re not done, though! Remember, at the beginning of this post we said we wanted post-quantum security without taking away our existing guarantees.</p><p>While today’s Double Ratchet may not be quantum safe, it provides a high level of security today and we believe it will continue to be strong well into the future. We aren’t going to take that away from our users. So what can we do?</p><p>Our answer ends up being really simple: we run both the Double Ratchet and the Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet alongside each other and mix their keys together, into what we’re calling the Triple Ratchet protocol. When you want to send a message you ask both the Double Ratchet and SPQR “What encryption key should I use for the next message?” and they will both give you a key (along with some other data you need to put in a message header). Instead of either key being used directly, both are passed into a Key Derivation Function - a special function that takes random-enough inputs and produces a secure cryptographic key that’s as long as you need. This gives you a new “mixed” key that has hybrid security. An attacker has to break both our elliptic curve and ML-KEM to even be able to distinguish this key from random bits. We use that mixed key to encrypt our message.</p><p>Receiving messages is just as easy. We take the message header - remember it has some extra data in it - and send it to the Double Ratchet and SPQR and ask them “What key should I use to decrypt a message with this header?” They both return their keys and you feed them both into that Key Derivation Function to get your decryption key. After that, everything proceeds just like it always has.</p><h2 id="heterogeneous-rollout">Heterogeneous Rollout</h2><p>So we’ve got this new, snazzy protocol, and we want to roll it out to all of our users across all of their devices… but none of the devices currently support that protocol. We roll it out to Alice, and Alice tries to talk to Bob, but Alice speaks SPQR and Bob doesn’t. Or we roll it out to Bob, but Alice wants to talk to Bob and Alice doesn’t know the new protocol Bob wants to use. How do we make this work?</p><p>Let’s talk about the simplest option: allowing downgrades. Alice tries to establish a session with Bob using SPQR and sends a message over it. Bob fails to read the message and establish the session, because Bob hasn’t been upgraded yet. Bob sends Alice an error, so Alice has to try again. This sounds fine, but in practice it’s not tenable. Consider what happens if Alice and Bob aren’t online at the same time… Alice sends a message at 1am, then shuts down. Bob starts up at 3am, sends an error, then shuts down. Alice gets that error when she restarts at 5am, then resends. Bob starts up at 7am and finally gets the message he should have received at 3am, 4 hours behind schedule.</p><p>To handle this, we designed the SPQR protocol to allow itself to downgrade to not being used. When Alice sends her first message, she attaches the SPQR data she would need to start up negotiation of the protocol. Noticing that downgrades are allowed for this session, Alice doesn’t mix any SPQR key material into the message yet. Bob ignores that data, because it’s in a location he glosses over, but since there’s no mixed in keys yet, he can still decrypt the message. He sends a response that lacks SPQR data (since he doesn’t yet know how to fill it in), which Alice receives. Alice sees a message without SPQR data, and understands that Bob doesn’t speak SPQR yet. So, she downgrades to not using it for that session, and they happily talk without SPQR protection.</p><p>There’s some scary potential problems here… let’s work through them. First off, can a malicious middleman force a downgrade and disallow Alice and Bob from using SPQR, even if both of them are able to? We protect against that by having the SPQR data attached to the message be MAC’d by the message-wide authentication code - a middleman can’t remove it without altering the whole message in such a way that the other party sees it, even if that other party doesn’t speak SPQR. Second, could some error cause messages to accidentally downgrade sometime later in their lifecycle, due either to bugs in the code or malicious activity? Crucially, SPQR only allows a downgrade when it first receives a message from a remote party. So, Bob can only downgrade if he receives his first message from Alice and notices that she doesn’t support SPQR, and Alice will only downgrade if she receives her first reply from Bob and notices that he doesn’t. After that first back-and-forth, SPQR is locked in and used for the remainder of the session.</p><p>Finally, those familiar with Signal’s internal workings might note that Signal sessions last a really long time, potentially years. Can we ever say “every session is protected by SPQR”, given that SPQR is only added to new sessions as they’re being initiated? To accomplish this, Signal will eventually (once all clients support the new protocol) roll out a code change that enforces SPQR for all sessions, and that archives all sessions which don’t yet have that protection. After the full rollout of that future update, we’ll be able to confidently assert complete coverage of SPQR.</p><p>One nice benefit to setting up this “maybe downgrade if the other side doesn’t support things” approach is that it also sets us up for the future: the same mechanisms that allow us to choose between SPQR or no-SPQR are designed to also allow us to upgrade from SPQR to some far-future (as yet unimagined) SPQRv2.</p><h2 id="making-sure-we-get-it-right">Making Sure We Get It Right</h2><p>Complex protocols require extraordinary care. We have to ensure that the new protocol doesn’t lose any of the security guarantees the Double Ratchet gives us. We have to ensure that we actually get the post-quantum protection we’re aiming for. And even then, after we have full confidence in the protocol, we have to make sure that our implementation is correct and robust and stays that way as we maintain it. This is a tall order.</p><p>To make sure we got this right, we started by building the protocol on a firm foundation of fundamental research. We built on the years of research the academic community has put into secure messaging and we collaborated with researchers from PQShield, AIST, and NYU to explore what was possible with post-quantum secure messaging. In <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/078">a paper at Eurocrypt 25</a> we introduced erasure code based chunking and proposed the high-level Triple Ratchet protocol, proving that it gave us the post-quantum security we wanted without taking away any of the security of the classic Double Ratchet. In <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity25-auerbach.pdf">a follow up paper at USENIX 25</a>, we observed that there are many different ways to design a post-quantum ratchet protocol and we need to pick the one that protects user messages the best. We introduced and analyzed six different protocols and two stood out: one is essentially SPQR, the other is a protocol using a new KEM, called Katana, that we designed just for ratcheting. That second one is exciting, but we want to stick to standards to start!</p><h2 id="formal-verification-from-the-start">Formal Verification From the Start</h2><p>This research gave us the framework to think about protocol design and prove protocols are secure, but there is a big leap from an academic paper to code. Already when designing <a href="https://signal.org/blog/pqxdh/">PQXDH</a> - a much simpler protocol! - <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity24-bhargavan.pdf">we found that formal verification was an important tool for getting the details right</a>. With the Triple Ratchet we partnered with Cryspen and made formal verification part of the process from the beginning.</p><p>As we kept finding better protocol candidates - and we implemented around a dozen of them - we modeled them in <a href="https://bblanche.gitlabpages.inria.fr/proverif/">ProVerif</a> to prove that they had the security properties we needed. Rather than wrapping up a protocol design and performing formal verification as a last step we made it a core part of the design process. Now that the design is settled, this gives us machine verified proof that our protocol has the security properties we demand from it. We wrote our Rust code to closely match the ProVerif models, so it is easy to check that we’re modeling what we implement. In particular, ProVerif is very good at reasoning about state machines, which we’re already using, making the mapping from code to model much simpler.</p><p>We are taking formal verification further than that, though. We are using <a href="https://github.com/cryspen/hax">hax</a> to translate our Rust implementation into <a href="https://fstar-lang.org/">F*</a> on every CI run. Once the F* models are extracted, we prove that core parts of our highly optimized implementation are correct, that function pre-conditions and post-conditions cannot be violated, and that the entire crate is panic free. That last one is a big deal. It is great for usability, of course, because nobody wants their app to crash. But it also matters for correctness. We aggressively add assertions about things we believe must be true when the protocol is running correctly - and we crash the app if they are false. With hax and F*, we prove that those assertions will never fail.</p><h2 id="formal-verification-doesnt-freeze-our-progress">Formal Verification Doesn’t Freeze Our Progress</h2><p>Often when people think about formally verified protocol implementations, they imagine a one-time huge investment in verification that leaves you with a codebase frozen in time. This is not the case here. We re-run formal verification in our CI pipeline every time a developer pushes a change to GitHub. If the proofs fail then the build fails, and the developer needs to fix it. In our experience so far, this is usually as simple as adding a pre- or postcondition or returning an error when a value is out of bounds. For us, formal verification is a dynamic part of the development process and ensures that the quality is high on every merge.</p><h2 id="tldr">TLDR</h2><p>Signal is rolling out a new version of the Signal Protocol with the Triple Ratchet. It adds the Sparse Post-Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR, to the existing Double Ratchet to create a new Triple Ratchet which gives our users quantum-safe messaging without taking away any of our existing security promises. It’s being added in such a way that it can be rolled out without disruption. It’s relatively lightweight, not using much additional bandwidth for each message, to keep network costs low for our users. It’s resistant to meddling by malicious middlemen - to disrupt it, all messages after a certain time must be dropped, causing a noticeable denial of service for users. We’re rolling it out slowly and carefully now, but in such a way that we’ll eventually be able to say with confidence “every message sent by Signal is protected by this.” Its code has been formally verified, and will continue to be so even as future updates affect the protocol. It’s the combined effort of Signal employees and external researchers and contributors, and it’s only possible due to the continued work and diligence of the larger crypto community. And as a user of Signal, our biggest hope is that you never even notice or care. Except one day, when headlines scream “OMG, quantum computers are here”, you can look back on this blog post and say “oh, I guess I don’t have to care about that, because it’s already been handled”, as you sip your Nutri-Algae while your self-driving flying car wends its way through the floating tenements of Megapolis Prime.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>Autism should not be viewed as a single condition with a unified underlying cause, according to scientists who found that those diagnosed early in childhood typically have a distinct genetic profile to those diagnosed later.</p><p>The international study, based on genetic data from more than 45,000 autistic people in Europe and the US, showed that those diagnosed in early childhood, typically before six years old, were more likely to show behavioural difficulties from early childhood, including problems with social interaction, but remain stable.</p><p>Those diagnosed with autism later, typically after the age of 10, were more likely to experience increasing social and behavioural difficulties during adolescence and also had an increased likelihood of mental health conditions such as depression.</p><p>“The term ‘autism’ likely describes multiple conditions,” said Dr Varun Warrier, from Cambridge’s department of psychiatry, senior author of the research. “For the first time, we have found that earlier and later diagnosed autism have different underlying biological and developmental profiles.”</p><p>The scientists are not advocating for a move towards two diagnostic categories, saying that this could be unhelpful for the many who fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>“It is a gradient,” said Warrier. “There are also many other factors that contribute to age of diagnosis, so the moment you go from averages to anything that is applicable to an individual, it’s false equivalency.”</p><p>The findings come at a time when autism diagnosis has risen steeply, with a nearly <a href="https://acamh.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcpp.13505" data-link-name="in body link">800% increase in diagnoses in the UK</a> between 1998 and 2018. Experts say this is due largely to a widening of the diagnostic criteria and greater recognition of the condition.</p><p>And, while autism is defined by having challenges with social communication, sensory processing and restrictive behaviours, there is huge variability in how these difficulties present between individuals. Scientists have been looking at whether the population clusters into subgroups, with shared traits or trajectories, that could make studying autism more tractable.</p><p>The latest study used behavioural data from four birth cohorts, ranging from 89 to 188 people, and genetic data from two large studies, with more than 45,000 participants.</p><p>Previously, it was generally assumed that those diagnosed earlier tended to be those with more marked autistic traits, underpinned by people carrying a higher proportion of autism-linked gene variants. However, the latest study revealed a different pattern.</p><figure id="84037ab2-e09e-4580-a076-837487e8ab1e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:10,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Autistic people could teach Donald Trump a thing or two about focus, facts and empathy | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;84037ab2-e09e-4580-a076-837487e8ab1e&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/28/autistic-people-donald-trump-autism-us-president-rfk-jr&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The analysis,<em> </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09542-6" data-link-name="in body link">published in Nature</a><em>,</em> found that the underlying genetic profiles differed between those diagnosed with autism earlier and later in life, with only a modest overlap.

      <p>For 16+ years, we master the rules of school. Study hard, get good grades, follow the formula and ultimately merit wins. Then we enter the workforce and none of it works quite like we thought.&nbsp;This becomes painfully obvious as you rise higher in the org. </p><p>Even seasoned veterans forget this. Recently, a director-level client hit a minor career bump and spiraled into crisis mode, their expectations still anchored in what I call "school rules".</p><p><strong>Organizations don't run purely on merit or even clear criteria. Although they claim otherwise using buzzwords like “merit” and “data”.</strong> That’s only one part of the story, and also what’s visible.&nbsp;</p><p>The other part, often more consequential, runs on flawed psychology, imperfect decisions, and competing interests. <mark>You can call it<strong>&nbsp;organizational absurdities. Or more bluntly, institutional stupidity.</strong></mark></p><p>What follows is a reality check. It’s a “letter to frustrated high-performers” who keep bumping up against these unwritten rules of work. Consider it your guide to staying sane while playing the long game.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#if-you-have-to-blame-stupidity-not-malice">If you have to, blame stupidity not malice</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#organizations-are-anything-but-meritocracies">Organizations are anything but meritocracies</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#perception-matters-as-much-as-performance">Perception matters as much as performance</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#don%E2%80%99t-waste-time-fighting-for-%E2%80%9Cobjective-fairness%E2%80%9D" rel="noreferrer">Don’t waste time fighting for “objective fairness.”</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#positioning-what-you-offer">Positioning what you offer</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#mind-the-gap-your-standards-vs-their%E2%80%99s" rel="noreferrer">Mind the gap: your standards vs their’s</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#higher-you-go-more-it%E2%80%99s-an-inverted-funnel" rel="noreferrer">Higher you go, more it’s an inverted funnel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#know-which-game-you%E2%80%99re-choosing-to-play" rel="noreferrer">Know which game you’re choosing to play</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#watching-your-circle-of-control">Watching your circle of control</a></li><li><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/surviving-institutional-stupidity/#keep-a-balanced-portfolio">Keep a balanced portfolio</a></li></ul><div><p>💡</p><p><i><em>Before diving in, a quick note: This piece deliberately spotlights the subjective aspects of organizational life. While companies strive for objectivity in all areas, there's an overlooked undercurrent of subjectivity that significantly impacts work, and careers. By highlighting this less-discussed dimension, I hope to provide a more complete picture and prevent unnecessary frustration. You won’t avoid it completely, but at least you’ll be better equipped.</em></i></p></div><hr><h2 id="if-you-have-to-blame-stupidity-not-malice"><strong>If you have to, blame stupidity not malice</strong></h2><p>Most of what we chalk up to “politics” or “backstabbing”, aka bad intent, is often better explained by stupidity, inertia, bad incentives, fragmented attention, and misaligned maps of reality.</p><p>People are juggling too much, thinking too little, and rarely stepping back to ask, “What actually makes sense here?”</p><p>When you assume stupidity instead of malice, you stay above the fray, stop taking slights personally, or turning misjudgments into betrayals. This way we retain agency and choice.</p><p><mark><strong>Assuming malice turns you into a cynic. In contrast, assuming stupidity keeps you curious.</strong>&nbsp;</mark> Instead of fighting ghosts, you study the system and ask better questions:</p><ul><li>What pressures is that person responding to?</li><li>What game are they trying to win?</li><li>What am I assuming as rational that’s not?</li></ul><p>No one is out to get you; they’re just out to get through the week. The shift from malice to stupidity gives you just enough distance to be curious instead of reactive.</p><h2 id="organizations-are-anything-but-meritocracies"><strong>Organizations are anything but meritocracies</strong></h2><p>Managers will claim they are, and we want to believe them. But the reality is that the best don’t always rise. At least not as easily or automatically as we think they should.</p><p>Sometimes they do. But often, what gets rewarded isn’t performance but proximity to power, timing, perception, and political usefulness.</p><p><mark>This doesn’t mean performance doesn’t matter.&nbsp;<strong>It means performance is necessary but not sufficient.</strong></mark>&nbsp;It is the entry ticket&nbsp;that gets you through the door, but does not guarantee a seat at the table.</p><p><strong>Assuming that excellence is obvious is the fatal error of the conscientious expert. </strong>Although it creates value, performance doesn’t automatically generate visibility, influence, or narrative. And those are the currencies that get traded when decisions are made by humans.</p><p>Merit matters, but it needs a stage and a spotlight. It doesn’t mean becoming a shameless self-promoter. Rather,<mark>&nbsp;<strong>your work needs a distribution strategy.&nbsp;</strong></mark></p><h2 id="perception-matters-as-much-as-performance"><strong>Perception matters as much as performance</strong></h2><p>In school, everyone was evaluated against an objective criteria by someone paid to assess fairly.&nbsp;</p><p>In organizations, no such thing exists.<mark>&nbsp;<strong>Instead, perception&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;the “data”.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></mark>And this data is constructed often haphazardly by busy people working off limited inputs. You have to manage the story by<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/impression-management/" rel="noreferrer">&nbsp;shaping impressions intentionally</a>.</p><p>Not only does perception matter as much as performance but <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/schrodingers-cat-at-work/" rel="noreferrer">who’s doing the perceiving</a> matters even more.&nbsp;</p><p>Not all perceivers are created equal. A peer may love your work but they might not be a critical node in the web of influence. Who gets consulted? Do they know what you’ve built, and have they heard your name in relevant contexts?</p><p><strong><mark>It’s not just “do great work.”; it’s also “do the work that’s perceived as valuable.” </mark></strong>This means translating your work’s significance up the chain and shape its interpretation. If not, others will do it for you and they may not be generous, or even accurate.</p><p>For more, see my last two articles:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/schrodingers-cat-at-work/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Schrodinger’s Cat at Work Part I</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/schrodingers-cat-building-the-box-of-limitations/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Schrodinger’s Cat at Work Part II</a>.</p><h2 id="don%E2%80%99t-waste-time-fighting-for-%E2%80%9Cobjective-fairness%E2%80%9D"><strong>Don’t waste time fighting for “objective fairness.”</strong></h2><p>On paper, organizations love metrics: KPIs, OKRs, dashboards. They create the appearance of detached objectivity.</p><p>Meanwhile, subjective decisions are constantly happening behind the scenes. The decisions about who to trust, or who gets a shot are made through informal reputations and shared stories about your value. Then the “data” is used to justify them in retrospect.</p><p>Rather than rant against the system,&nbsp;<strong>get good at reading the underlying subjective logic</strong>:</p><ul><li>Who does this person trust, and why?</li><li>What do they consider strategic vs tactical?</li><li>What would make them feel safe betting on me?</li></ul><p>Subjectivity isn’t the enemy. It’s the underlying physics of it.</p><h2 id="positioning-what-you-offer"><strong>Positioning what you offer</strong></h2><p>You may have had the right message but at the wrong moment, or in the wrong wrapper.</p><p>Positioning is the context around your contributions:&nbsp;<em>Why now? Why you? Why this way?</em>&nbsp;A good idea, or stellar performance, poorly positioned can seem irrelevant. In contrast, a mediocre one nicely positioned is deemed visionary.</p><p>It’s not just&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;you say but also&nbsp;<em>when</em>,&nbsp;<em>how</em>, and&nbsp;<em>through whom</em>&nbsp;you say it.</p><p>Persistence matters as well.&nbsp;<strong><mark>Think in campaigns, not just one-time efforts. </mark></strong>In my piece on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/effective-leadership-as-effective-conversations/" rel="noreferrer">effective conversations</a>&nbsp;I wrote:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><em>It is the series of messages in different forms that over time makes the difference. More akin to waves shaping the shoreline rather than the occasional once in a lifetime tsunami.</em></blockquote><p>What messages are you sending, are they varied, and are you doing it consistently? <strong>This is as true for marketing products as it is for positioning yourself inside organizations.</strong></p><h2 id="mind-the-gap-your-standards-vs-their%E2%80%99s">Mind the gap: your standards vs their’s</h2><p>Another obvious but forgotten reality of organizational life:&nbsp;<strong>Not everyone operates by the same playbook.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You prioritize substance and direct contribution, while others focus on visibility and relationship-building in ways that are uncomfortable to you. It’s that colleague who excels at positioning routine work as “strategic”, or the peer who builds influence through cultivating key relationships.</p><p>And yes, these approaches do yield results.</p><p>But this doesn’t mean dismissing it as pure politics or simply abandoning your principles. It means understanding the landscape you're operating in.&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t effectively participate in a game you refuse to see clearly.&nbsp;You're not at a disadvantage because you choose to act with integrity. It’s because you fail to recognize that influence flows through multiple channels and&nbsp;others are willing to play differently.&nbsp;</p><p><mark><strong>The key is not to match their behavior but to factor it in</strong>.&nbsp;Instead of expecting fairness,&nbsp;<strong>anticipate asymmetry</strong>.</mark>&nbsp;And then get creative about how you play.&nbsp;</p><p>Being ethical <strong>doesn’t mean being passive but  tactically awake.&nbsp;</strong></p><h2 id="higher-you-go-more-it%E2%80%99s-an-inverted-funnel"><strong>Higher you go, more it’s an inverted funnel</strong></h2><p>Perhaps the most obvious point but also<strong>&nbsp;easy to forget especially if your career has been on autopilot so far.</strong></p><p>There’s a bottleneck up top: fewer seats, more ambiguity, less structure and high subjectivity. It’s not just hard to get in but even harder to stay clear on what “good” even looks like.</p><p>This means you can do everything right and still get passed over. <strong>That’s not a verdict on your worth or ability, just geometry.</strong></p><p>It also means that staying the course when things don’t go your way isn’t just a virtue but a practice. To play the long game, you have to keep showing up even after crushing disappointment without getting cynical of the process. Put differently, <strong>you need high levels of </strong><a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/frustration-tolerance/" rel="noreferrer"><strong>frustration tolerance</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Cliched? Yes, very much so, but also uncommon. It means if you can pull it off, it’s a <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/sources-of-power-in-organizations/" rel="noreferrer">source of power</a>.</p><h2 id="know-which-game-you%E2%80%99re-choosing-to-play"><strong>Know which game you’re choosing to play</strong></h2><p>There is no one game being played. There are multiple, overlapping games with different scoring systems. Some are playing to build long-term credibility; others for short-term visibility.&nbsp;</p><p>You can’t play them all and neither should you try.</p><p><strong><mark>The real problem is we slide into playing someone else's game without realizing it.</mark></strong>&nbsp;We adopt the norms and metrics of others without checking if that’s the game we actually want to play, let alone win. So we end up optimizing for a role we don’t respect, or chasing promotions that hollow us out.</p><p>Whatever you’re doing, own it outright. Not just the upside but also the downside. If you're focused on building something lasting like developing others, or robust systems, you need to accept that visible status markers (titles, promotions, recognition) might not happen right away.</p><p>The danger isn't which path you pick, whether it's chasing promotions or maintaining your autonomy.&nbsp;<strong><mark>The real disaster is to sleepwalk down a path while pretending you had no choice in the matter.</mark></strong></p><h2 id="watching-your-circle-of-control">Watching your circle of control</h2><p>An easy way to burn out is to focus relentlessly on<strong> things you care about but cannot actually influence</strong>. Over time, especially in large organizations, it's tempting to attribute everything to forces outside yourself. This induces <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/locus-of-control/#locus-of-control-and-learned-helplessness-in-organizations" rel="noreferrer">organizational helplessness</a>. A sense that nothing you do matters unless someone above says so.</p><p>Fight that, not with bluster, but with deliberate ownership of <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/circle-of-control-influence-concerns/" rel="noreferrer">the space you control and influence</a>.&nbsp;While experienced professionals often have more influence than they think, it's distributed differently than they expect.&nbsp;</p><p>The key is maintaining <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/locus-of-control/" rel="noreferrer">an internal locus of control</a> which includes your positioning, relationships, and what you are building.</p><h2 id="keep-a-balanced-portfolio"><strong>Keep a balanced portfolio</strong></h2><p>This is a well-understood concept in investing but often missing in the context of long careers. If all your identity is wrapped up in organizational validation, you're fragile. This means setbacks&nbsp;don't just rattle your job, it rattles your sense of self.</p><p>Many mid-career professionals learn this the hard way. To state the obvious: you are not your title, or your most recent performance review.</p><p><strong><mark>The anti-dote is diversification not of money, but meaning.</mark></strong></p><p>Rebalancing here means investing in other sources of connection and community. This includes:</p><ul><li>Developing a craft that exists beyond a given employer.</li><li>Investing in communities that outlast org charts.</li><li>Projects, relationships, and sources of learning that replenish.</li></ul><p>You are building <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/adaptive-capacity/" rel="noreferrer">adaptive capacity</a>.</p><p>A balanced portfolio also helps to play the long game with more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/courage-modern-leadership-organizations/" rel="noreferrer">psychological courage</a>&nbsp;because your whole life isn't riding on the next promotion cycle or external validation.</p><h2 id="in-closing"><strong>In closing</strong></h2><p>By recognizing the subjective currents that shape work environments, we can operate within them more skillfully.</p><p>This isn't cynicism or gaming the system. Rather, it's developing a nuanced understanding of how organizations actually function. This stance equips us to make more intentional choices about how to engage, contribute, and create meaning.</p><p>As ideal as it sounds, the goal isn't to eliminate organizational absurdities, but to work effectively within and around them. By staying in the game, you find ways to gradually improve the system from within.&nbsp;</p><p><mark>Organizations are ultimately human constructs.<strong>&nbsp;Imperfect, but not immutable.</strong></mark></p>

</p>

<p>Since the very beginning of n8n we’ve heard many of you mention the need for a proper table inside n8n to store data between workflow executions without needing to switch platforms or setting up credentials and now it’s finally here.</p>
<p>With data tables you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Save specific data from your workflow runs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep data around between multiple executions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid duplicate runs by tracking execution status</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store reusable prompts for different workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collect evaluation data for your AI workflows</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do lookups, merges, enhancements…</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>…and honestly, probably 100 other creative things we haven’t even thought of yet  <img src="https://community.n8n.io/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=14" title=":smiley:" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

If you’re self-hosting (and know what you’re doing), you can change that via the ENV variable <code>N8N_DATA_TABLES_MAX_SIZE_BYTES</code></p>

            <p>This is absolutely awesome to see, I can’t wait to use these! It’s probably been my number one frustration that saving even a small amount of data between executions for all sorts of purposes requires either integrating PostgreSQL and dealing with schemas, using a third party database or API like Supabase (as handy as they are), or using variables that are powerful but are somewhat clumsy to instantiate and track since they only work in Code nodes and only save data for production executions, making testing hard. Hoping data-tables makes a ton of these things easier! Probably won’t run the new version until it’s in final release rather than pre-release, but this is awesome to see!</p>

            <p>This is really great - when I migrated from “the other platform” almost 4 years ago, I really felt the pain of not having a simple in-app data storage. I played around with Data tables this weekend and it’s just SUCH a good and fast experience! Kudos to our Product and Engineering teams <img src="https://community.n8n.io/images/emoji/twitter/clap.png?v=14" title=":clap:" alt=":clap:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

              <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is an issue with very large SQLite databases that is causing instances to slow down. Out of an abundance of caution, we are unfortunately removing version 1.113.0 until we fix this issue. We hope to have this released again with a fix within the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Very sorry about this!</p>

              <p>This is great!</p>
<p>It´d be cool for self hosting to be able to add a second DB, where n8n pulls the data from. So one could have performance without having to set up each time a postgres connection.</p>

              <p>Very happy to see this feature. I’ve been testing it out, and was commenting feedback on Reddit but someone in the Discord server said the forums is the best place to post this instead.  Here’s my list(so far)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When going to the Data Tables tab, “Create Table” is not default on the upper right button, it’s defaulted to “Create Workflow” instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot change the data type after a column is created.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cannot set any of the column’s as primary or unique such as the ID column (To prevent duplicates)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some odd reason, setting a column data type to “number” then pushing data from JSON array into the table, physically opening the table and looking at the rows, the numbers in the “number” data type column are not all together. For example “29683389” shows in the table as “29 683 389”. This isn’t a one off either, ALL rows exhibit the same behavior and ALL columns set as “numbers” too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Table page can only show 50 rows per page. Which I understand is probably for performance reasons. However, there really needs to be a “search” function for the table to search for data.</p>

1, 2 and 5 are all planned. For (4), I think that is just a highlighting to make it easier to read that it’s actually 29M. So the number should still be correct.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Meta, having committed hundreds of billions to AI infrastructure and talent, says it will start using people's conversations and interactions with its AI services to create personalized content and advertising.</p>
<p>This applies to <a href="https://www.meta.ai/">Meta AI</a>, the company's web-based chat interface, and apps that integrate Meta AI, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.</p>
<p>Meta intends to begin using people's text exchanges and voice conversations with its AI service to generate personalized posts, reels, and other attention lures starting on December 16, 2025.</p>

    

<p>"For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page," the company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/">explained</a> in its announcement. "As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots."</p>

        


        

<p>A notification campaign about the change begins October 7, 2025.</p>
<p>There's no opt-out, but Meta has spared those who live in the EU, the UK, and South Korea for the time being.</p>

        

<p>The social networking giant and metaverse money-burner will let users make some adjustments to its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/introducing-vibes-ai-videos/">slop</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Force-feeding&amp;oldid=1311058453">gavage</a> loop with its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053">Ads Preferences</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/new-ways-to-customize-your-facebook-feed/">feed customization</a> controls.</p>
<p>Meta insists it won't personalize ads based on conversations that touch on religion, sexual orientation, politics, health, race, ethnicity, philosophical belief, or trade union membership.</p>
<p>That list of untouchable topics suggests canny Meta users could stymie the personalization plan by prefixing every interaction with a suitably sensitive term – for example, start every interaction with "Pray tell..." or “Oh, Lord, Meta really thought this was a good idea?”</p>

</ul>
<p>Known as Facebook until brand damage from incessant privacy scandals inspired <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">a name change in 2021</a>, Meta was notionally focused on the metaverse – an ill-defined term for immersive digital experiences that may or may not involve goggles. Having spent something like <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/metas_metaverse_mention/">$60 billion on its Reality Labs group</a> without much to show for it (apart from the privacy-invading Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses), Meta lately has taken to talking up AI.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month told President Trump that Meta plans to invest $600 billion on AI investment through 2028 – and surely that will happen because Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DORJoYgkXUH?xmt=AQF0CNIpSRsk_HIXDmfYchDE46PSmeeKhR344m0c25Bl-A">said it</a>, even if other massive AI spending projects like Stargate’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/softbank-openai-a3dc57b4">promised $500 billion AI infrastructure investments</a> don’t quite add up.</p>

        

<p>Meta's interest in AI, however, is really about ads – using AI to encourage exposure to and engagement with ads, some of which may be generated by AI. The company has already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/01/meta_ai_investments/">said</a> AI has helped boost engagement with ads posted to its platforms. Execs also see AI as making it easier to advertisers to create and manage campaigns.</p>
<p>As noted by the UK's Open Rights Group, 98 percent of Meta’s <a href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/">$165 billion of revenue in 2024</a> came from advertising, resulting in net income of $62.4 billion.</p>
<p>Iesha White, director of intelligence for marketing watchdog Check My Ads, told <em>The Register</em> in an email that several AI companies like Perplexity and OpenAI have integrated advertising into their AI products.</p>
<p>"But this is different – Meta’s core business is monetizing ad space across its owned and operated sites and apps, in addition to ad placements on external publisher partnerships via its Facebook Audience Network product," said White. "By harvesting data from its AI chats across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, Meta gains yet another closed-loop data source, meaning Meta could reduce transparency of the targeting inputs across its advertising products, in the name of privacy.</p>
<p>"It also provides an opportunity for Meta to further shape and obfuscate its attribution models using its own source of truth, with brands unable to independently audit a campaign’s true effectiveness."</p>
<p>Meta coincidentally is fighting a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://searchengineland.com/supreme-court-meta-ad-fraud-case-proceed-450504">$7 billion class action</a> <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/03/21/22-15916.pdf">lawsuit</a> [PDF] brought by advertisers who claim that Meta fraudulently represented the potential reach of its ads by citing user accounts rather than actual people – a charge Meta disputes. ®</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/eu_spyware_funding/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/02/eu_spyware_funding/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448825">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>An arsenal of angry European Parliament members (MEPs) is demanding answers from senior commissioners about why EU subsidies are ending up in the pockets of spyware companies.</p>
<p>The group of 39 politicians referred to recent investigations that revealed countries such as Italy, Greece, Hungary, and Spain have funnelled millions of taxpayer euros at a time to help support commercial spyware-makers' finances.</p>
<p>They wrote: "According to these findings, entities such as Intellexa, Cy4Gate, Verint and Cognyte – whose technologies have been linked to unlawful surveillance of journalists, human rights defenders and political actors in the EU, as well as in third countries with dreadful human rights records – have benefitted from public financing, including EU programmes.</p>

    

<p>"This raises serious questions about the governance, transparency, and accountability of the Union's funding mechanisms. In the light of the scandals uncovered in Italy, Greece, Poland, Hungary, and Spain, among others, and of the recommendations of the PEGA inquiry, it is deeply troubling that the Union is directly or indirectly enabling tools that erode democracy, fundamental rights, and the rule of law."</p>

        


        

<p>MEPs cited investigative journalism from <a href="https://www.ftm.eu/articles/spyware-industry-eu-subsidies-surveillance-concers" rel="nofollow">Follow The Money</a>, which revealed in September that institutions such as Spain's public-funded Centre for the Development Of Industrial Technology (CDTI) handed over €1.3 million (c $1.5 million) to now-shuttered spyware peddler Mollitiam Industries.</p>

<p>Likewise, Italy's state-owned bank, <a target="_blank" href="https://youreurope.europa.eu/business/finance-funding/getting-funding/access-finance/en/content/mediocredito-centrale-spa">Mediocredito Centrale</a>, was found to have acted as a guarantor to a €2.5 million (c $2.9 million) loan to Dataflow Security, an Italy-based commercial spyware developer.</p>
<p>FTM said that it did not prove that any of the money, in any of the cases it found, was used to directly fund spyware development, although funding was provided in several instances.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/HNeumannMEP/status/1973321519548997804/photo/1" rel="nofollow">letter</a> addressed to senior commissioners Henna Virkkunen (Finland), Michael McGrath (Ireland), and Piotr Serafin (Poland) – who oversee tech, justice, and anti-fraud respectively – requested greater transparency over how EU funds were distributed, among other matters.</p>

        

<p>Various questions were raised by the MEPs, such as how the European Commission verifies the integrity of the entities that receive EU funds, whether any risk assessments are carried out before investments are made to spyware companies, and how much money in total has been awarded to these organizations.</p>
<p>They also asked for answers on how the Commission plans to ensure its funding mechanisms align with its stances on matters such as human rights and digital resilience, and why it has not implemented the recommendations made by the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/09/pega_commitee_report/">PEGA inquiry</a>.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> approached the European Commission for a response to the letter.</p>

        

<p>For the uninitiated, the PEGA inquiry was launched in 2022 following reports of several EU governments using <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/19/pegasus_spyware_met_police_complaint/">NSO Group's Pegasus spyware</a> a year earlier, and three years after Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/03/01/in_brief_security/">Jamal Khashoggi's murder</a>.</p>
<p>The results were published in 2023, branding the pervasive spyware use "Europe's Watergate" and a "severe violation of all the values of the European Union."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-9-2023-0189_EN.html#_section2" rel="nofollow">report</a> stated: "The spyware scandal is not a series of isolated national cases of abuse, but a full-blown European affair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"EU Member State governments have been using spyware on their citizens for political purposes and to cover up corruption and criminal activity. Some went even further and embedded spyware in a system deliberately designed for authoritarian rule."</p>
<p>Among the main recommendations made by the PEGA committee were to restrict law enforcement's use of spyware only to exceptional cases, protect sensitive targets like politicians, lawyers, and doctors, and to set the conditions for legal use.</p>
<p>The 39 MEPs asked the European Commission to additionally commit to launching an immediate public review of EU subsidies flowing into spyware companies.</p>
<p>In that review, the politicians specifically requested details on all funds issued and awarded to spyware companies since 2015, a commitment to excluding all spyware vendors from future EU funding instruments, and a follow-up on the PEGA recommendations.</p>
<p>"Citizens of the Union have the right to know whether their taxes are being used to finance technologies that endanger their fundamental rights," they wrote.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>"As Members of the European Parliament, we expect your full cooperation in ensuring accountability and restoring public trust."</p>
<p>Rebecca White, researcher and advisor on targeted surveillance at Amnesty Tech's Security Lab, said she and Amnesty support the letter, and highlighted the Commission's lack of communication on the matter.</p>
<p>She told <em>The Register</em>: "At Amnesty, we've documented for many years how spyware has enabled human rights abuses in Europe and beyond, and how the surveillance industry is under-regulated and thriving.</p>
<p>"The European Commission has remained silent. These latest allegations should alarm all of us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"They suggest that not only is the EU failing to put out the fire, they're fanning the flames. We welcome this collective call for transparency and explanations – the Commission can no longer wash its hands of Europe's complicity in the spyware crisis, which is fuelling human rights abuses across the world."</p>
<p>Aljosa Ajanovic Andelic, policy advisor at European Digital Rights (EDRi), echoed the MEPs' request for a ban on spyware.</p>
<p>He said: "The lack of action by the Commission when it comes to spyware is appalling and dangerous. In fact, not only have they not done anything to stop the proliferation of shady spyware vendors in the EU, they actually used EU taxpayers' money to directly fund the industry. This has to stop, and we are calling for a full ban on commercial spyware in the EU."</p>
<p>"As the largest digital rights network in Europe, our position is firm: the use of spyware is inherently incompatible with fundamental rights, and therefore should be banned, as well as the market of private companies that are profiting from human rights violations." ®</p>

<p><img alt="Red Hat logo" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2025/10/02/redhat-header-vign.jpg" width="1600"></p>

<p>An extortion group calling itself the Crimson Collective claims to have breached Red Hat's private GitHub repositories, stealing nearly 570GB of compressed data across 28,000 internal projects.</p>

<p>This data allegedly includes approximately 800 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs), which can contain sensitive information about a customer's network and platforms.</p>

<p>A CER is a&nbsp;consulting document prepared for clients that often contains infrastructure details, configuration data, authentication tokens, and other information that could be abused to breach customer networks.</p>

<p>Red Hat confirmed that it suffered a security incident related to its consulting business,&nbsp;but would not verify any of the attacker's claims regarding the stolen GitHub repositories and customer CERs.</p>

<p>"Red Hat is aware of reports regarding a security incident related to our consulting business and we have initiated necessary remediation steps," Red Hat told BleepingComputer.</p>

<p>"The security and integrity of our systems and the data entrusted to us are our highest priority. At this time, we have no reason to believe the security issue impacts any of our other Red Hat services or products and are highly confident in the integrity of our software supply chain."</p>

<p>While Red Hat did not respond to any further questions about the breach, the hackers told BleepingComputer that the intrusion occurred approximately two weeks ago.</p>

<p>They allegedly found authentication tokens, full database URIs, and other private information in Red Hat code and CERs, which they claimed to use to gain access to downstream customer infrastructure.</p>

<p>The hacking group also published a complete directory listing of the allegedly stolen GitHub repositories&nbsp;and a list of CERs from 2020 through 2025 on Telegram.</p>

<p>The directory listing of CERs include a wide range of sectors and well known organizations such as Bank of America, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, Fidelity, Kaiser, Mayo Clinic, Walmart, Costco,&nbsp;the U.S. Navy’s Naval Surface Warfare Center, Federal Aviation Administration, the House of Representatives, and many others.</p>

<p>If you have any information regarding this incident or any other undisclosed attacks, you can contact us confidentially via Signal at 646-961-3731 or at tips@bleepingcomputer.com.</p>

<p>The hackers stated that they attempted to contact Red Hat with an extortion demand but received no response other than a templated reply instructing them to submit a vulnerability report to their security team.</p>

<p>According to them, the created ticket was repeatedly assigned to additional people, including Red Hat's legal and security staff members.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer sent Red Hat additional questions, and we will update this story if we receive more information.</p>

<p>The same group also claimed responsibility for briefly <a href="http://x.com/pirat_nation/status/1970821013559538141" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">defacing Nintendo’s topic page</a> last week to include contact information and links to their Telegram channel</p>

				<p>Bits of Freedom sued Meta for a breach of the Digital Services Act (DSA). This European legislation is intended to give users more autonomy and control over the major online platforms. One of the core elements of the DSA is that users must have greater influence over the information they see.</p>
<p>For many people, and especially for young people, social media platforms are a major source of news and information. Therefore it is crucial that users themselves can decide which content appears on their feed. Without that freedom of choice, participation in the public debate is seriously hampered. That is problematic at any time, but especially so during election periods. In the Netherlands, national elections will be held at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The judge states that Meta is indeed acting in violation of the law. He says that “a non‑persistent choice option for a recommendation system runs counter to the purpose of the DSA, which is to give users genuine autonomy, freedom of choice, and control over how information is presented to them.” The judge also concludes that the way Meta has designed its platforms constitutes “a significant disruption of the autonomy of Facebook and Instagram users.” The judge orders Meta to adjust its apps so that the user’s choice is preserved, even when the user navigates to another section or restarts the app.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are pleased that the judge now makes clear that Meta must respect the user’s choice,” says Maartje Knaap, spokesperson for Bits of Freedom. “It is absolutely unacceptable that a handful of American tech billionaires determine how we see the world. That concentration of power poses a risk to our democracy. At the same time, it is regrettable that we need to go to court to ensure Meta complies with the law.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta has an interest in steering users toward a feed where it can show as many interest‑ and behavior‑based ads as possible. That is the core of Meta’s revenue model. Subtle design techniques push users toward that feed, while the non‑profiled feed is hidden behind a logo, making it hard to find. Users who do choose the alternative timeline also lose direct access to features such as Direct Messages. Moreover, when you open the app, it always starts with Meta’s feed, even if the user selected a different one before. Because of the judge’s ruling, Meta must change its behavior.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This ruling shows that Meta is not untouchable,” continues Maartje Knaap. “But we are also realistic, this is just a drop in the ocean. There’s still a long way to go. We hope the decision will inspire individuals, civil society organisations, regulators and lawmakers worldwide around the world who are working to rein in Meta’s power. Together we can stand up to a company that has become overwhelmingly powerful.”</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find the ruling <a href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251002-vonnis-kort-geding.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251002-vonnis-kort-geding.pdf">here</a> (in Dutch).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Some people think artificial intelligence will be the most important technology of the 21st century. Others insist that it is an obvious economic bubble. I believe both sides are right. Like the 19th century railroads and the 20th century broadband Internet build-out, AI will rise first, crash second, and eventually change the world. </p><p><span>The numbers just don’t make sense. Tech companies are projected to spend about $400 billion this year on infrastructure to train and operate AI models. By nominal dollar sums, that is more than any group of firms has ever spent to do just about anything. The Apollo program allocated about $300 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars to get America to the moon between the early 1960s and the early 1970s. The AI buildout requires companies to collectively fund a new Apollo program, not every 10 years, but </span><em>every 10 months.</em></p><p><span>It’s not clear that firms are prepared to earn back the investment, and yet by their own testimony, they’re just going to keep spending, anyway. Total AI capital expenditures in the U.S. are projected to exceed $500 billion in 2026 and 2027—roughly the annual GDP of Singapore. But the </span><em>Wall Street Journal</em><span> has reported that American consumers spend only $12 billion a year on AI services. That’s roughly the GDP of Somalia. If you can grok the economic difference between Singapore and Somalia, you get a sense of the economic chasm between vision and reality in AI-Land. Some reports </span><a href="https://futurism.com/ai-hype-automation-decline#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20might%20be%20booming,began%20in%20November%20of%202023." rel="">indicate</a><span> that AI usage is actually declining at large companies that are still trying to figure out how large language models can save them money.</span></p><p><span>Every financial bubble has moments where, looking back, one thinks: </span><em>How did any sentient person miss the signs?</em><span> Today’s omens abound. Thinking Machines, an AI startup helmed by former Open AI executive Mira Murati, just raised the largest seed round in history: $2 billion in funding at a $10 billion valuation. The company has not released a product and has refused to tell investors what they’re even trying to build. “It was the most absurd pitch meeting,” one investor who met with Murati </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/newsletters/2025-09-29/the-perfect-ai-startup" rel="">said</a><span>. “She was like, ‘So we’re doing an AI company with the best AI people, but we can’t answer any questions.” Meanwhile, a recent analysis of stock market trends found that </span><a href="https://x.com/modestproposal1/status/1973045734401282343" rel="">none of the typical rules for sensible investing</a><span> can explain what’s going on with stock prices right now. Whereas equity prices have historically followed earnings fundamentals, today’s market is driven overwhelmingly by momentum, as retail investors pile into meme stocks and AI companies because they think everybody else is piling into meme stocks and AI companies.</span></p><p><span>Every economic bubble also has tell-tale signs of financial over-engineering, like the collateralized debt obligations and subprime mortgage-backed securities that blew up during the mid-2000s housing bubble. Ominously, AI appears to be entering its own phase of financial wizardry. As the </span><em>Economist</em><span> has pointed out, the AI hyperscalers—that is, the largest spenders on AI—are </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud" rel="">using accounting tricks</a><span> to depress their reported infrastructure spending, which has the effect of inflating their profits</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-174944187" href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/this-is-how-the-ai-bubble-will-pop#footnote-1-174944187" target="_self" rel="">1</a><span>. As the investor and author </span><a href="https://paulkedrosky.com/" rel="">Paul Kedrosky</a><span> told me on my podcast </span><em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/plain-english-with-derek-thompson/id1594471023" rel="">Plain English</a></em><span>, the big AI firms are also shifting huge amounts of AI spending off their books into SPVs, or special purpose vehicles, that disguise the cost of the AI build-out. </span></p><p>My interview with Kedrosky received the most enthusiastic and complimentary feedback of any show I’ve done in a while. His level of insight-per-minute was off the charts, touching on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>How AI capital expenditures break down</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why the AI build-out is different from past infrastructure projects, like the railroad and dot-com build-outs</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How AI spending is creating a black hole of capital that’s sucking resources away from other parts of the economy</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>How ordinary investors might be able to sense the popping of the bubble just before it happens</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Why the entire financial system is balancing on big chip-makers like Nvidia</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>If the bubble pops, what surprising industries will face a reckoning</strong></p></li></ul><p>Below is a polished transcript of our conversation, organized by topic area and adorned with charts and graphs to visualize his points. I hope you learn as much from his commentary as much as I did. From a sheer economic perspective, I don’t think there’s a more important story in the world.</p><p><strong>Derek Thompson:</strong><span> How big is the AI infrastructure build-out?</span></p><p><strong>Paul Kedrosky:</strong><span> There’s a huge amount of money being deployed and it’s going to a very narrow set of recipients and some really small geographies, like Northern Virginia. So it’s an incredibly concentrated pool of capital that’s also large enough to affect GDP. I did the math and found out that in the first half of this year, the data-center related spending—these giant buildings full of GPUs [graphical processing units] and racks and servers that are used by the large AI firms to generate responses and train models—probably accounted for half of GDP growth in the first half of the year. Which is absolutely bananas. This spending is huge.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png" width="707" height="484" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:484,&quot;width&quot;:707,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:141165,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.derekthompson.org/i/174944187?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ClnP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc8b22759-21ee-4b1a-afcc-9d1bfd53c11d_707x484.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>JP Morgan chart showing the rising contribution to GDP growth from tech capex</figcaption></figure></div><p><strong>Thompson:</strong><span> Where is all this money going?</span></p><p><strong>Kedrosky:</strong><span> For the biggest companies—Meta and Google and Amazon—a little more than half the cost of a data center is the GPU chips that are going in. About 60 percent. The rest is a combination of cooling and energy. And then a relatively small component is the actual construction of the data center: the frame of the building, the concrete pad, the real estate.</span></p><p><strong>Thompson:</strong><span> How do you see AI spending already warping the 2025 economy?</span></p><p><strong>Kedrosky</strong><span>: Looking back, the analogy I draw is this: massive capital spending in one narrow slice of the economy during the 1990s caused a diversion of capital away from manufacturing in the United States. This starved small manufacturers of capital and made it difficult for them to raise money cheaply. Their cost of capital increased, meaning their margins had to be higher. During that time, China had entered the World Trade Organization and tariffs were dropping. We’ve made it very difficult for domestic manufacturers to compete against China, in large part because of the rising cost of capital. It all got sucked into this “death star” of telecom.</span></p><p>So in a weird way, we can trace some of the loss of manufacturing jobs in the 1990s to what happened in telecom because it was the great sucking sound that sucked all the capital out of everywhere else in the economy.</p><p>The exact same thing is happening now. If I’m a large private equity firm, there is no reward for spending money anywhere else but in data centers. So it’s the same phenomenon. If I’m a small manufacturer and I’m hoping to benefit from the on-shoring of manufacturing as a result of tariffs, I go out trying to raise money with that as my thesis. The hurdle rate just got a lot higher, meaning that I have to generate much higher returns because they’re comparing me to this other part of the economy that will accept giant amounts of money. And it looks like the returns are going to be tremendous because look at what’s happening in AI and the massive uptake of OpenAI. So I end up inadvertently starving a huge slice of the economy yet again, much like what we did in the 1990s.</p><p><strong>Thompson: </strong><span>That’s so interesting. The story I’m used to telling about manufacturing is that China took our jobs. “The China shock,” as economists like David Autor call it, essentially took manufacturing to China and production in Shenzhen replaced production in Ohio, and that’s what hollowed out the Rust Belt. You’re adding that telecom absorbed the capital. </span></p><p>And now you fast-forward to the 2020s. Trump is trying to reverse the China shock with the tariffs. But we’re recreating the capital shock with AI as the new telecom, the new death star that’s taking capital that might at the margin go to manufacturing.</p><p><strong>Kedrosky:</strong><span> It’s even more insidious than that. Let’s say you’re Derek’s Giant Private Equity Firm and you control $500 billion. You do not want to allocate that money one $5 million check at a time to a bunch of manufacturers. All I see is a nightmare of having to keep track of all of these little companies doing who knows what.</span></p><p>What I’d like to do is to write 30 separate $50 billion checks. I’d like to write a small number of huge checks. And this is a dynamic in private equity that people don’t understand. Capital can be allocated in lots of different ways, but the partners at these firms do not want to write a bunch of small checks to a bunch of small manufacturers, even if the hurdle rate is competitive. I’m a human, I don’t want to sit on 40 boards. And so you have this other perverse dynamic that even if everything else is equal, it’s not equal. So we’ve put manufacturers who might otherwise benefit from the onshoring phenomenon at an even worse position in part because of the internal dynamics of capital.</p><p><strong>Thompson</strong><span>: What about the energy piece of this? Electricity prices rising. Data centers are incredibly energy thirsty. I think consumers will revolt against the construction of local data centers, but the data centers have enormous political power of their own. How is this going to play out?</span></p><p><strong>Kedrosky</strong><span>: So I think you’re going to rapidly see an offshoring of data centers. That will be the response. It’ll increasingly be that it’s happening in India, it’s happening in the Middle East, where massive allocations are being made to new data centers. It’s happening all over the world. The focus will be to move offshore for exactly this reason. Bloomberg had a great story the other day about an exurb in Northern Virginia that’s essentially surrounded now by data centers. This was previously a rural area and everything around them, all the farms sold out, and people in this area were like, wait a minute, who do I sue? I never signed up for this. This is the beginnings of the NIMBY phenomenon because it’s become visceral and emotional for people. It’s not just about prices. It’s also about: If you’ve got a six acre building beside you that’s making noise all the time, that is not what you signed up for.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

Day 9 of the trial of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried trial, heard testimony from Nishad Singh, who joined the business as a software engineer, and later became an engineering director. Here is software engineer and writer Molly White <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/the-ftx-trial-day-nine-nishad-singh?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">summarizes of his evidence</a>:</p><div><p>“To hear Singh tell it, he didn’t even really realize what was going on at FTX and Alameda Research until September 2022 — only a month or two before everything came crashing down. (...) Several times throughout various testimonies, we’ve seen a document written by Sam Bankman-Fried, in which he describes his thinking that Alameda Research should be shut down. That document was, ultimately, how Singh learned in September 2022 that Alameda Research had taken billions of dollars of customer funds from FTX.&nbsp;</p><p>This was when Gary Wang told Singh that Alameda was borrowing massive amounts of customer money from FTX — at the time, around $13 billion of it. Singh testified that he felt ‘really afraid’, and called an in-person meeting immediately. Bankman-Fried, who was sitting next to Singh at the time, ‘seemed unsurprised and made up what I understood to be a false excuse for dodging the meeting.’ Singh, Ellison, and Wang met without him, and Singh confirmed his fears: that he had not misunderstood Wang, and that Alameda had actually taken customer funds to that extent.”</p></div><p>Okay, so in September 2022, Singh had confirmation that something illegal was happening at the company, which he had no direct knowledge of, <em>until then</em>. At that point, if he wanted to avoid being an accomplice to potentially illegal activity, his options were:</p><ol><li>Talk to a lawyer on how to avoid assisting a crime</li><li>Turn whistleblower. See the <a href="https://thesignalsnetwork.org/twh/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">tech whistleblower guide</a></li><li>Quit the company, ensuring he did not further aid this activity&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The smart thing would have been to do #1. The profitable thing could have been to do #2 because in the US, a whistleblower may receive a <a href="https://www.phillipsandcohen.com/whistleblower-rewards?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">whistleblower reward</a> of between 10-30% of what the government recovers from fraudulent activities. The final choice #3 is hard, but could have meant Singh would not have had to plead guilty as he did.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s what Singh did instead: he asked for a personal meeting with Bankman-Fried and confronted him about the missing funds. However, Bankman-Fried replied there not much to worry about, and that they’d repay the funds by raising more money from investors (!!) This should have been the point at which Singh quit. Instead:</p><blockquote>“He thought about leaving the company then, he testified, but worried that his departure could cause everything to fall apart. He felt that if he stayed, maybe he could help the companies make back what they owed.”</blockquote><p>For the next two months, Singh tried to make things better, but it was fruitless. FTX collapsed in November 2022.</p><p><strong>Lesson #1: when you discover fraud may be happening, do not “stay around to fix it.” </strong>Any other approach would have been better for Singh; seeking legal advice, turning whistleblower, or quitting on the spot.</p><p>To be fair, Singh didn’t seen <em>totally</em> clueless, and it seems he decided to profit on the developments. Days after he found about this fraud, he took a $3.7M loan from FTX (!!) to buy a house, The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/17/23921745/sam-bankman-fried-nishad-singh-house-loan?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">pointed out</a>. It’s exactly the type of thing you don’t want to do after you discover fraud.</p><p>Now, Singh is facing up to 75 years in jail thanks to his decision to aid the company after discovering the fraud. His sentence will most likely be reduced due to his plea deal, but any course of action which leads to a criminal conviction is surely a grave error of judgment.</p><h4 id="frank-a-software-engineer-refuses-to-fake-customer-data">Frank: a software engineer refuses to fake customer data</h4><p>Frank was a student loan startup founded by Charlie Javice in 2016. In 2019, Javice was featured on the Forbes “30 under 30” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30/2019/finance/?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com#67e877a27e80" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">finance list</a>, suggesting she was a high-flying founder:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/content/images/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-09-at-11.46.08.png" alt="How Charlie Javice appeared on the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2019.

We now know the 300,000 user number was fake. Source: Forbes</span></figcaption></figure><p>It certainly seemed like Charlie Javice was a standout founder; in 2021, JP Morgan purchased Frank for $175M. However, things turned sour quickly. JP Morgan thought it bought a startup with 5 million customers, which worked with 6,000 schools. But after the purchase, this data was found to be mostly fake.</p><p>Let’s get to a software engineer’s involvement. This April, founder Charlie Javice was arrested, and a lawsuit is ongoing between her, former Chief Growth Officer Olivier Amar, and JP Morgan. From to this lawsuit, we get an inside look at how events unfolded inside Frank.</p><p><strong>In 2021, an engineer was asked to produce fake data for 4.2M non-existent customers. </strong>As acquisition talks were ongoing, JP Morgan wanted to validate that Frank had the nearly 5M customers it claimed. In reality, Frank had 293,000 customers, so the CEO asked an engineer to fake the data and turn this list into 4.2M members. Here’s what happened next – from<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23570243-frank_suit?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com#document/p21" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"> the lawsuit</a>:</p><div><p>“[In 2021] Javice [CEO], Amar [Chief Growth Officer] and the Director of Engineering then had a Zoom meeting during which Javice and Amar asked the Director of Engineering to help them create a synthetic list of customer data. She asked the Director of Engineering if he could help take a known set of FAFSA application data and use it to artificially augment a much larger set of anonymous data tht her systems had collected over time.</p><p>The Director of Engineering questioned whether creating and using such a data set was legal, but Javice tried to assure the engineer by claiming that this was perfectly acceptable in an investment situation and she did not believe that anyone would end up in an ‘orange jumpsuit’ over this project.”</p></div><p><strong>Lesson #2: when your manager claims they don’t believe anyone would end up in an “orange jumpsuit,” assume that someone definitely could. </strong>The engineering director’s next step? They refused:</p><p>“The Director of Engineering was not persuaded and told Javice and Amar that he would not perform the task, and only would send them the file containing Frank’s actual users, which amounted to approximately 293,000 individuals at the time.”</p><p>And this engineering director played it right, as the people who are likely to go to jail and end up in orange jumpsuits are the other two people on the call, who knowingly went along with the illegal.</p><h4 id="pollen-an-engineer-told-to-double-charge-customers-by-the-ceo">Pollen: an engineer told to double charge customers by the CEO</h4><p>Last year, I published my first – and to date only– investigative article on <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/pollen?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">how events tech startup Pollen raised $200M and then collapsed</a>, owing months of wages to staff. In the investigation, I focused on an unusual detail: $3.2M worth of funds taken months early from customers. The incident was described internally by Pollen as a mistake, and an incident review <em>should</em> have followed. Even more confusing, the company blamed the payments processor Stripe for the incident.</p><p>The reality was that this was a very deliberate double charge. I could not share this fact at the time – as the company threatened me with libel after I informed them of this detail – but the BBC has now produced a documentary <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m001n327/crashed-800m-festival-fail?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">revealing details</a> about this deliberate double charge that was covered up as an outage. From <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001n327?ref=blog.pragmaticengineer.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the documentary</a>:</p><p>[Narrator] “Pollen initially told some customers that the problem was with their payments provider. Later, Callum [the CEO] addressed his staff who were demanding to know what happened.”</p><p>[CEO of Pollen talking] “All that happened was that a couple millions of dollars of payment plans that were due to be paid at a later month were then paid earlier. It’s being investigated. We’ve committed already that once that investigation is done, it will be shared with the company so that people understand what happened.”</p><p>[Narrator] “With over 1,500 customers impacted, rumors began to circulate about the causes of the incident.”</p><p>[Dan Taylor, managing editor at Tech.eu] “From my understanding, there was a creative code ‘malfunction’ that all of the sudden, double charged customers. But that double charge magically happened to meet Pollen’s payroll, that month. Hmm! Odd, don’t you think?”</p><p>[Narrator] “The internal investigation due to be shared with the company was never completed, but a group of Pollen staff did their own, unofficial digging. (...) The code contained in the report confirms that the customer's monthly payment plans had been manually altered, which meant that double or triple charges will take place on a single day, without the customer’s authorization.”</p><p>The engineer making this change even did a test run the day before, to ensure that this code change “correctly” double charges customers! A former Pollen software engineer appearing in the documentary also makes the point that any code changing production code in payments needs to go through code review, so whoever made this change could have not been acting alone.</p><p>Two days after the incident, a senior engineering team member sent an internal chat message to 3 colleagues, where they admit that they had run the script at the request of the CEO. Here is what this message said:</p><blockquote>“Also want to come clean that it was me who ran a bad script - in hindsight I wasn’t knowledgeable enough to alter a subset of payment plans for Balvin [one of the events organized by Pollen]. I did this as a special request from Callum and didn’t want to raise on call to handle. It’s been a long week and I displayed a very poor form of judgement.”</blockquote><p>In the video, a Pollen software engineer is shown the message, and he says: “I’m not sure I buy this. It seems a bit fishy.”</p><p><strong>Lesson #3: if the CEO asks you to do something potentially illegal – document it, and consider not doing it. </strong>We don’t know what happened with the senior engineering member who carried out the code changes, following a request from the CEO. This person could have said no, like the engineering director at Frank did. The message sent a few days ago already said that this person regretted doing so, and it’s unlikely that this action was worth the risk it carried.</p><p><strong>If you take one lesson from this, it’s that you can always say no. </strong>In these three stories, the only engineer who’s legally safe is the former engineering director at Frank who point blank refused to assist what could be an illegal request. The engineering director at FTX who stayed after he confirmed fraud was occurring is now facing jail time, while the senior engineering member at Pollen is at the mercy of the UK police, and how they deal with what could be a potential wire fraud case.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="auto">We are thrilled to announce the <strong>stable release of Immich!</strong> 🎉</p>
<p dir="auto">This has been a journey long in the making. So much has changed since the first commit on the project, all the way back in February, 2022. The project and team continue to grow, and today we’re proud to announce <code>v2.0.0</code>, our stable release. Stable signifies that we have now resolved a significant amount of technical debt. It also means we will be prioritizing compatibility and less effort will be required to keep Immich up-to-date. Finally, it means that the warning banner on the website has been removed! Along with this, we’re happy to announce a new version of the <a href="https://immich.app/" rel="nofollow">https://immich.app/</a> website.</p>
<p dir="auto">For more specifics about the stable release, see our <a href="#user-content-faqs">FAQs</a> below.</p>

<h2 dir="auto">Future plans</h2>
<p dir="auto">Now that Immich is stable, here are some of the things that we will be focusing on:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Roadmap</strong> — There are still a few items on our roadmap that we want to complete before the year ends such as auto-stacking, and achieving feature parity between the web and mobile app. We also have plans to start work on improved stack support, better sharing, group management, and ownership improvements, as well as many other enhancements.</li>
<li><strong>Usage data</strong> — The team wants to understand how the software is used, so that we can make better, informed decisions as we design and build Immich. We want to collect that information in a non-invasive and transparent way. We plan to discuss it with the community and gather feedback from everyone to come up with the best solution.</li>
<li><strong>Backup services</strong> — We aim to introduce additional paid services (<em>not paywalled features, as we will never implement paywalled features</em>), which will help support the project and that enhance self-hosting, making it easier and more reliable. First among the many services already planned is an end-to-end encrypted, off-site backup and restore feature, built directly into Immich. This will enable a buddy backup feature as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Thank you</h2>
<p dir="auto">We cannot thank you enough for the support over the past three years. Community participation, from the first comments on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/si5lp6/i_am_building_a_selfhosted_alternative_version_of/" rel="nofollow">original reddit post</a>, to the feedback when we joined FUTO, have contributed to the awesome product Immich is today. Thank you for joining us and believing in our mission to regain control over your most precious data. Here’s to many more years!</p>
<p dir="auto">We'll also be hosting a Q&amp;A livestream tomorrow, <strong>October 2nd, 2025 at 6 PM UTC</strong>. You can submit your questions <a href="https://www.live-ask.com/event/01K6GFKQGJSB1GQC086ZJW6F6R" rel="nofollow">here</a> and subscribe for notifications when the livestream starts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/qgQ4ci2hRMQ" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="user-content-faqs" dir="auto">FAQs</h2>
<h2 dir="auto">Will there be a live stream?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Yes. We'll be hosting a Q&amp;A livestream tomorrow, <strong>October 2nd, 2025 at 6 PM UTC</strong>. You can submit your questions <a href="https://www.live-ask.com/event/01K6GFKQGJSB1GQC086ZJW6F6R" rel="nofollow">here</a> and subscribe for notifications when the livestream starts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/qgQ4ci2hRMQ" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Do I still need backups?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Yes! A 3-2-1 backup strategy is still crucial. The team has the responsibility to ensure that the application doesn’t cause loss of your precious memories; however, we cannot guarantee that hard drives will not fail, or an electrical event causes unexpected shutdown of your server/system, leading to data loss. Therefore, we still encourage users to follow best practices when safeguarding their data. Keep multiple copies of your most precious data: at least two local copies and one copy offsite in cold storage. Additionally, we are starting to work on a cloud backup service to make backups easier.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">When will <code>v2.0.0</code> be available?</h2>
<p dir="auto">The Docker images for <code>v2.0.0</code> will be pushed out a few hours after this post is released.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">How can I update to <code>v2.0.0</code>?</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can follow the upgrade documentation, <a href="https://docs.immich.app/install/upgrading" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">What versioning strategy will Immich use?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Starting with <code>v2.0.0</code>, we will now follow <a href="https://semver.org/" rel="nofollow">semantic versioning</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">What mobile app versions will work with <code>v2.0.0</code>?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Any <code>v2.x.x</code> version of the mobile app will work with any <code>2.x.x</code> version of the server. For example, a mobile app on version <code>v2.9.0</code> will continue to work with server versions: <code>v2.0.0</code>, <code>v2.1.0</code>, <code>v2.3.1</code>, etc.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Will new features continue to be released?</h2>
<p dir="auto">Yes. Immich will continue to build, develop, and release new features.</p>
