<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running Linux on a Commodore C-64</h2>
<p dir="auto">"But does it run Linux?" can now be finally and affirmatively answered for the Commodore C64!</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/blob/master/booted.jpeg"><img src="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/raw/master/booted.jpeg" alt="Booted"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">There is a catch (rather: a couple) of course: It runs <em>extremely</em> slowly and it needs a RAM Expansion Unit (REU), as there is no chance to fit it all into just 64KiB.</p>
<p dir="auto">It even emulates virtual memory with an MMU.</p>
<p dir="auto">I have <strong>not</strong> tested it on <strong>real hardware yet</strong>, that's the next challenge .. for you. So please send me a link to a timelapse video of an original unit with REU booting Linux :D</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building it</h2>
<p dir="auto">Just use <code>make</code>. You need <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mos/"><code>mos-c64-clang</code></a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Change the single <code>C64</code> variable at the top of the Makefile and you should be able to switch between a <code>x86_64</code> and an <code>llvm-mos-6502</code> build of the code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The notes from the <a href="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/blob/master/README.original.md">original README</a> apply for the most part. The kernel configuration is different, though, as the kernel from the original <code>semu</code> is too bloated with huge section alignments. A more fitting kernel configuration can be found in the <code>config</code> subfolder. Finally, to assemble it all into the REU image needed for the VICE emulator, use the <code>mk_linux_reu.py</code> script. It still uses the original <code>initrd</code> image, as that works just well.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Running it</h2>
<p dir="auto">To run it, simply create a <code>.d64</code> file containing the compiled <code>semu</code> executable (or simply select the correct path for a virtual disk drive in the emulator). Then (in VICE EMU), go to Preferences | Settings | Cartridges | RAM Expansion Module, enable it and select the file <code>reufile.linux</code>, and make sure to select the correct size (16MiB) as well. If you started <code>x64</code> from the console, a message that it loaded successfully should appear.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, do <code>LOAD "SEMU",8,1</code> and <code>run</code> and ... <em>wait</em> ... (hours!). With "warp mode" enabled in the emulator, the first boot messages should appear within a few minutes, though.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can also use the PC <code>semu</code> binary with the <code>-k</code> option to load the reufile.linux into the PC emulator and you should get a 100% identical boot sequence, as everything should be deterministic until the first keypress.</p>
<p dir="auto">I plan to add an archive with all the neccessary premade binaries as soon as I figured out how to do that on github. Look for something on the "Releases" tab.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Further notes</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">The screenshots took VICE <em>a couple hours</em> in "warp mode" (activate it with Alt-W) to generate. So, as is, a real C64 should be able to boot Linux within a week or so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The compiled 6502 code is not really optimized yet, and it might be realistic to squeeze a factor 10x of performance out of this. Maybe even a simple form of JIT compilation? It should also be possible to implement starting a checkpointed VM (quickly precomputed on <code>x86-64</code>) to avoid the lengthy boot process. Maybe <code>X</code> on an emulated framebuffer device in 320x200 graphics mode? VIC-II DRI? :D</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">I also tested a minimal micropython port (I can clean it up and post it on github if there is interest), that one does not use the MMU and is almost barely remotely usable with lots of optimism at 100% speed...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The generated <code>semu</code> executable is a generic RISCV32 emulator and it simply assumes that the REU maps to the address range 0x00000000 .. 0x01000000. You should be able to compile any (embedded, bare-bones) RISCV32 executable that uses just the emulated UART, fill it up to a size of 16MiB, load it as a REU-image into VICE and run it using the same <code>semu</code> 6510 binary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Likewise, I made a simple <a href="https://github.com/mist64/kernalemu">kernalemu</a> fork with "REU support" which seems to run a lot faster than Vice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">The emulated UART does upper-/lowercase PETSCII&lt;-&gt;ASCII translation. That could use a lot of improvement, though ...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Thanks</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is in essence a fork of the very nicely minimalist RISC-V32 emulator named <a href="https://github.com/sysprog21/semu">semu</a>, compiled and ported using the new <a href="https://github.com/llvm-mos/">llvm-mos</a> and would not have been so possible without all that previous work.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">(Boot animation)</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/blob/master/boot_anim.gif"><img src="https://github.com/onnokort/semu-c64/raw/master/boot_anim.gif" alt="(Boot animation)" data-animated-image=""></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/11saoz0/new_update_from_court_in_ongoing_case_airbnb/"><strong>Second Update (by OOP)</strong></a> March 15 2023</p>

<p>If you're just looking for the story without the commentary, the Second Update has it all.</p>

<p>Reminder that OP is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/u/AtypicalCommonplace">u/AtypicalCommonplace</a>. I am not OP. I've tried to hyperlink all of the resources/links from the post as is.</p>

<p>Quick Summary of previous events: OOP is a woman and a lawyer. She stayed at an AirBnB in NYC in 2022. Upon completing the initial booking, the owner revealed the property had cameras monitoring the <em>inside</em> of the studio apartment. OOP sought to cancel and get refunded. Her other posts describe her attempts to receive the refund, suing AirBnB and taking them to arbitration and the process leading up to the arbitration itself over the course of several months in 2023.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AtypicalCommonplace/comments/15np1c3/case_closed_airbnb_cameras_yadda_yadda_yadda/"><strong>Case Closed (Airbnb, Cameras, Yadda Yadda Yadda)</strong></a> Aug 10 2023</p>

<p>TLDR: Our hearing was held Aug 1st, the arbitrator has 30 days to decide. Arbitration turned out to be a pretty awful experience and I'm not very hopeful but still glad I fought!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/11saoz0/new_update_from_court_in_ongoing_case_airbnb/">For the latest full case update you can go here -ish</a></p>

<p>I've been writing this post in my head in the two seconds I have each day now that I've morphed from single woman to mom of two (I met a single dad on reddit - RIP R4R - and my life is now utterly changed and I'm happier and more exhausted than I have ever been!) but now that I am over a week out I figured I'd post an update for anywhere who is still here!</p>

<p>As noted above, our hearing was finally held on August 1st and lasted SIX (6!!!) hours so was pretty mentally and emotionally exhausting. I keep thinking of things I should have said (of course now after the fact) but the long and short of the argument I was trying to make was that, look, if Airbnb is basically saying that you CAN have a camera in a private space then it COULD record the bed and, um, that's bad (and reminder, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/3061">against Airbnb's policies</a>).</p>

<p>But because Airbnb conceded that they would pay me what I was promised on September 26th, 2022 (almost a year ago! fun!) the hearing itself got super bogged down into the weeds of whether I had PROOF that there was a camera (reminder, I didn't because the first customer service rep told me that the hosts' acknowledgment that there was one wasn't enough). Their contention from the start has been that the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/2908">Terms of Service</a> basically make you sign away all of your rights and even if the company itself erred they aren't liable for anything. Side note - have y'all watched "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jY1ecibLYo">Joan is Awful</a>" because the whole ToS madness reminded me of that.</p>

<p>Of course, my whole issue here is that it SHOULDN'T take someone 12+ hours, months of time, and filing a case in arbitration to get what was promised to them, and which they relied on, from a corporation that obviously has the time and resources to squash me like a little bug. They also argued that while the terms of service SAY that cameras can't be "inside" what they REALLY mean is "inside and monitoring" so, if that is the case , why not just remove the "inside" piece from the ambiguous language? I continue to be baffled why they fought this so hard but I digress. Here's what I wrote regarding that in my opening argument,</p>

<p>When I began this case I was a single woman. I’m have a partner and am the mother to two small children. Truth be told, if this were to happen today, I wouldn’t have had the time or energy to spend a week of my vacation fighting customer service representatives, nor would I have had the ability to attempt to seek resolution or argue this matter in arbitration. I would have had to give up even though the law of promissory estoppel, as I will argue today, make it plainly clear that I was owed what I was promised.</p>

<p>Thus, should this case only result in my recouping of the $1,502.78, it, in effect, means that in order for a consumer to be able to effectively rely upon a promise made by a company, they must also be willing to jump through hours of time, months of effort, and eventually litigation in order to receive what was promised. The impact is a chilling effect - consumers are forced to choose between expending time and energy or simply “giving up.” What of consumers who don’t have the privilege of time? Where would their justice be?</p>

<p>I think what was most surprising to me, though perhaps it shouldn't be, was the way in which the lawyers tried to attack my character. Saying I was doing this for youtube views (did I bring up the fact that the youtube video has since been removed by myself? lol no) or for a "reddit following." They dug up reddit posts that I had made about this case in the heat of anger that I almost immediately realized were mean and unfair and so I took them down - but wayback is a thing and everything can be found and I guess they wanted to show that, yes, this case kind of turned me into an asshole at times. I kind of lost in in a tumbling bridge of sadness way at this point. We had already played recordings of me crying with customer service (embarrassing) and in order to "prove" that I was impacted by this I had to submit anxiety medications my doctor had prescribed me that I was then cross-examined on (double embarrassing), so I don't really get the point that was other than to try and kick me while I was down. Of course, I know the lawyers are only doing their jobs but I guess I felt sad that that is a job anyone would choose to do.</p>

<p>So - why am I still posting here, knowing that it could get me in trouble? Well, first I would argue to whoever is checking these posts that the hearing itself was never ordered to be confidential and I am not sharing anything deemed confidential but, more than that, I think that people have a right to know what they will be up against if they try and challenge a large corporation in arbitration which is meant to be a "fair and efficient hearing." Unfortunately, my experiences in arbitration didn't feel that way at all. I suppose I could delightfully be proven wrong but, sadly, the moral of the story here, to me, is that it isn't worth it. Which, you know, is what corporations WANT us to think and feel so we DO give up. When both arbitration rules and a company's own terms of service (23.3 here) say you are supposed to enter into good faith negotiations before moving forward, and when a company fails to enter into these in any way shape or form - I think the rule should just be that the consumer wins. Otherwise we are enabling a massive imbalance of power that will only lead to the further erosion of fairness and consumer rights.</p>

<p>But who cares what I think ;)</p>

<p>The one silver lining in all of this has been receiving more mental health support. As y'all know, part of what frustrated me so much about this was the very real knowledge I have those cameras in private areas can and will ultimately lead to victimization from already marginalized people. And I've begun talking to my therapist about <a href="https://www.brainline.org/article/secondary-ptsd-or-secondary-traumatic-stress-should-not-be-underestimated">secondary PTSD</a> and am looking into talking to psychology students who may be interested in a dissertation specifically on how 2PTSD impacts lawyers representing survivors.</p>

<p>Oh, and, of course, had I never received as much support from reddit I may never have turned my dating life over to the wonders of the anonymous internet (I used a throwaway account for my R4R post) and <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/LGRDtPI">wouldn't now have this in my life.</a> (OP's note. The link is to an image of a child's hand or hands intertwined with that of two adults.)</p>

<p>So, in the end.....</p>

<ul>
<li>Audre Lorde was right, the master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house,</li>
<li>Arbitration is not as pro se and consumer-friendly as it is made out to be</li>
<li>If you're reading this airbnb, which I know you are, please please please please please please please don't allow cameras inside any private area. <a href="https://osce.usmission.gov/taking-a-lesson-from-traffickers-harnessing-technology-to-further-the-anti-trafficking-movement/">The risk is, truly, too great.</a></li>
<li>But reddit remains a pretty cool place. Thanks y'all &lt;3</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AtypicalCommonplace/comments/15v6cab/airbnb_camera_arbitration_case_update_we/"><strong>Airbnb Camera Arbitration Case Update: WE WON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... thirty five dollars.</strong></a> August 19 2023</p>

<p>The day after I made my last post I woke up with a pit in my stomach and just had a feeling the decision was going to come out. And, low and behold, on August 7th, the arbitrator made their decision.</p>

<p>In short, Airbnb made a promise and they should keep that promise because I relied on it. So I am owed the money promised ($1502 in total - and yes, that is the actual number) - But it was my fault for not doing more research on the property before booking and I had no proof that there actually WAS a camera there was no deceptive language or material omission in the listing. And because I didn't lose money over this case (meaning I didn't like quit my job, though I have had to take on fewer clients in general) and I didn't have any out of pocket medical expenses, and because I agreed to the ToS which doesn't make airbnb liable anyways, I'm basically SOOL. And I wasn't going to try and push MAKING UP a fee I incurred just for the right thing to happen. The judge DID apply interest between Sept when I was told that I would get the refund and March when a "Selttlement" of that amount was made.</p>

<p>Reminder here, if I HADN'T brought this to arbitration then airbnb was just going to KEEP my money because I refused to stay at a place once they told me, AFTER I BOOKED, there were cameras INSIDE a PRIVATE BOOKING. AFTER I also relied on airbnb confirming it was not ok! And confirming I didn't need to go there to verify the camera was inside because the listing was enough!</p>

<p>It;s wild to me that the end result, given these very facts alone (that there was a promise made that I relied on and was reassured I could rely on - (y'all in the recordings I even ask exactly when I will get the refund due to a concern about my credit card balance since I'd need to go book at a hotel before airbnb reimbursed me) - that I wasn't awarded any compensation for being put through the ringer to actually GET THAT. It honestly blows my mind that because "all I lost was time" then that isn;t worth anything. And yet, the lawyers, the arbitrator, everyone but me is MAKING MONEY off of the fact that I have to work this hard to get the $1500. The arbitrator made more than I did in this case. The lawyers made more than I did in this case. Like, for that reason alone I am just......fuming.</p>

<p>But ADD TO THE FACT that this is about cameras! Not hidden cameras that airbnb doesn't know about. No. We are talking cameras inside spaces. And this is where I get even angrier. Because airbnb is making the MOST off of this because hey won't have to piss off hosts with cameras inside studios by making it explicit they can't have them. I literally cannot imagine any other reason why they still would not have clarified the policy to this day (even their own employees were confused as per our phone calls) - side note, reminder, I was on these phone calls so these were not confidential nor is this hearing- sorry I am paranoid they are going to try and sue me lol!) So that is what is getting at the root of what is eating me alive in this case. Because I wasn't given a fair shot at this,</p>

<p>For example, I was supposed to be afforded the right to discovery. I asked for, for example, notes about the creation of the policy itself. So that I could, you know, show there is a REASON this is against their policy!!</p>

<p>I asked for copies of internal emails sent about me so that I could, you know, show they knew about me trying to reach out and willfully didn't attempt a settlement in good faith which is, against their own terms of service (see pgh 23.3).</p>

<p>I asked for internal notes from the customer service reps to each other about my calls, etc. I asked for notes from a meeting I know incurred internally about my case because a friend of mine was at it. I asked for reasons behind why I was later told the unit was taken down two months after I reported it.</p>

<p>I won't get too into the weeds but, basically Airbnb objected to everything except recordings of my phone calls (which they had verbally agreed to at a previous hearing) but they did not submit their objections to the arbitrator on the due date of June 21. I asked literally half a dozen times where my discovery was, as there was no ruling to be made on an unfiled objection and I received nothing other than my recorded calls. I get no answer until mid July when I write an email demanding to receive discovery. The arbitrator only orders discovery on notes about the host. Airbnb asks for an extension and gets one after it is now weeks after discovery was due. I get only notes of the listing and call recordings with my host and airbnb and nothing internal. It is now july 22 and the hearing is on August 1t. I still have nothing internal from airbnb to prepare with and request a delay in hearing for arguments to be made on discovery. I bring up the fact California law outlines that discovery must at least 15 days before the hearing for full fairness. My request to delay was denied.</p>

<p>Instead we have a phone call where Airbnb basically says it would be too burdensome to have to look through emails with my name because airbnb has "6,000 employees" (I truly feel this was made for me to feel small.) They claimed they had no record of a meeting I know occurred because my friend was there but I wasn't willing to sell out my friend to "prove" it (the judge wanted to see the email I had - wasn't going to do that.) ANd on and on. And all my requests for discovery were denied and the hearing happened the next day. I was NOT prepared to move forward with basically nothing, but I did what I could with what I had. But I honestly couldn't believe that basically no discovery was allowed.</p>

<p>Anyways, this has already gotten incredibly way too long but I continue to think it's important to know just how wild arbitration is. Some folks called out in the BORU update that I am a lawyer and should have known that but I am one of those wild people who, while I have heard the most horrible stories from the depths of humanity, I still just have a fundamental belief that folks are going to do the right thing. There;s definitely an amount of white, cis, and socioeconomically hangin- in-there privilege there too, I know. But I just didn't actually believe I would wind up with......nothing. And I can't believe I had to fight it this hard to not end up in the negative and just end up.....neutral. And to see how little my time is worth in a court of law, how little anyone's would be. And you're, really, the only one with anything to lose.</p>

<p>It;s been a bit of a mindfuck.</p>

<p>But what REALLY REALLY REALLY kills me. Is that the decision didn't even get things right. There are things I could ARGUE with, yes, (they argue the camera could have been in the kitchen and there was a partition there and the photos I have showing only one door doesn't "prove" that was the door that was being talked about and thus I didn't KNOW it was in a room with a bed), sure. But there were fundamental basic things about the case that objectively were or were not true that the arbitrator gets wrong. Like the timeline in when I canceled the booking and what langauge was told to me after i booked v. before.</p>

<p>But there is NO right to appeal EVEN IF the arbitrator gets the facts wrong.</p>

<p>No y'all. I kid you not. This is real. If an arbitrator gets the law wrong, or gets the facts wrong, you're SOOL. It;s wild.</p>

<p>Something else that's wild?</p>

<p>One reason that you can, however, get a case booted from arbitration to court is if the arbitrator refuses to delay the hearing thus prejudicing the rights of either party. And guess what happened in this case....</p>

<p>Oh, and also, Airbnb's ToS 23.5 states that there's an exception to arbitration for public injunctions - here's how that reads:</p>

<p>You and Airbnb each agree that the following causes of action and/or claims for relief are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction (as defined by Section 22):.....(iii) a request for the remedy of public injunctive relief; .........You and Airbnb agree that the remedy of public injunctive relief will proceed after the arbitration of all arbitrable claims, remedies, or causes of action, and will be stayed pending the outcome of the arbitration pursuant to section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

<p>So.....</p>

<p>What the heck do I do? I've contacted a few lawyers and keep getting the "that's a great argument, but it will be a heck of a fight" so, while I have a few willing to take this on on an hourly basis, none so far would do so on a contingency basis (meaning I wouldn't pay them they would just get a percentage of whatever I win monetarily.") And I don't have the money to do that and I do not have the personal energy to go it alone.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I am in a really solid place in life at the moment. Questioning a lot, as always, feeling stuck on my career and figuring out what is next, but in love and building a home and making a family feels fulfilling in ways I never imagined. And it's ok if I want to put down this weight as well. I have the hope that maybe I will find someone whose fire is lit by this. Maybe someone who does want to file a suit on contingency. Maybe someone is starting a class action so the US can be like Canada and realize the absurdity of forced arbitration clauses. Maybe a reporter wants to write about this so someone ELSE will be inspired to do something. But it's out of my hands at this point - other than my experience and passion I've not much else to offer so I'm passing the baton.</p>

<p>Thanks, all, for being on this wild ride with me and making me feel a little less alone when it felt like a whole lot of others were trying to make me feel pretty insignificant. And who knows...</p>

<p>After about 7 months of math circles
with a group of 7- turning 8-year-old boys and girls,
I decided to take a break to breathe
and reflect on what worked and what didn't.</p>
<p>It's interesting how big a gulf there is
between what math topic you think will be interesting
to a 7-year-old
and what actually captures their attention.
Let me start by giving some examples
of things I <em>thought</em> would catch their interest
but flopped.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3DiBtPY" target="_blank">The game SET</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold-and-cut_theorem" target="_blank">Fold-and-cut puzzles</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3DeG9X5" target="_blank">Geometry snacks</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKV0GYvR2X8" target="_blank">Cutting a Mobius strip</a>.</li>
<li>Tessellations (<a href="https://momath.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ChaimGoodman-Strauss2021RosenthalPrizeLessonPlan.pdf" target="_blank">Tooti Tooti</a>, pdf link).</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ko8m1F" target="_blank">Prime Climb</a>.</li>
<li>Making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexagon" target="_blank">flexagons</a>.</li>
<li>Ruler and compass constructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I didn't think they'd like but they loved:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_and_Knaves" target="_blank">Knights and Knaves puzzles</a>,
  and more generally any topic about propositional logic (blue-eyed islanders.</li>
<li>Manually scheduling a round-robin tournament's worth of sports games,
  trying to minimize the latency of the entire tournament. (I originally phrased it as a soccer tournament, but that week the kid who loves soccer the most didn't show up, and so it turned into a DANCE competition, which was much more fun)</li>
<li>Seven bridges problems, and trying to find the smallest "impossible" bridge problem.</li>
<li>Trying to figure out who is better at penalty kicks based on counts of scores/misses.</li>
<li>Coming up with your own Pascal's triangle-type pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there were the problems
I thought they would love, and they did.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Function Machine game (guess a function given the ability to query it as a black-box)</li>
<li>Variations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim" target="_blank">Nim</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/43odWrr" target="_blank">The Turing Tumble</a>.</li>
<li>Fair cake cutting (with real cookies and oddly-distributed toppings).</li>
<li>Game theory games like Prisoner's dilemma and Chicken.</li>
<li>Making mocktails for 3 people, given a recipe for 1 drink, and again with a recipe that serves 5. (fractions practice). Measurements were in quarters of ounces.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="cookies with oddly distributed toppings" src="https://buttondown.imgix.net/images/281bd56a-61a7-4e26-84c1-98dfd6638c8b.jpg?w=960&amp;fit=max">

<p>Back in 2019 I wrote an article,
<a href="https://github.com/j2kun/essays/blob/main/attention-spans-for-math-and-stories.md" target="_blank">Attention spans for math and stories</a>
in which I described how I have used storytelling
with kids of various ages
(not in a math context)
to get them participating in activities and feeling welcome in a group.
I tied it back to math,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To have good mathematical content revolving around stories,
mathematicians should learn to tell stories well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow, though, my story-telling game
was off during some of my math circles.
I think through all my reading and learning about math circles,
I had internalized a different viewpoint.
That viewpoint, roughly speaking,
is that the math should speak for itself.
Much math circle literature
seems to suggest that a facilitator
should start with an open-ended mystery
(like, "can you draw a perfect shape?")
and then sit quiet until the participants
start asking questions and exploring on their own
(in this example, maybe discovering ruler and compass constructions).</p>
<p>I suspect this might work
with an older group of students,
or a group of students who have already bought into math
in some sense.
I know, for example, that many parents
who find math circles are desperately
searching for resources because their kid's
math ability is beyond their comprehension.
Some of these kids are believed to be on the autism spectrum as well.</p>
<p>The group I worked with were as typical
upper middle class kids as you could find.
They came to math circle after soccer practice.
When they got bored during the circle they
goofed off and roughhoused.
Though they had never played "Among Us,"
they constantly called things "sus."
More importantly,
they just didn't care about number patterns
unless it was couched in a more engaging format.
Geometry was a complete dud,
because it's even harder to come up with stories
about arbitrary figures with shaded regions you want to find the area of.
They didn't think tessellations were pretty.
And they didn't have the dexterity required
to make enough cuts and folds
to construct objects out of paper,
so they ended the fold-and-cut
and flexagon activities feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>But the idea that there are two people,
one of whom is a ROTTEN LIAR,
and you have to figure out who is the liar
based on the clues in what they say?
That's gold.
For that knights and knaves puzzle,
I wrote down the phrases Alice and Bob
said on pieces of paper,
taped them to plastic straws,
and held them up like signs.
The first puzzle was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alice: Bob is a liar!</li>
<li>Bob: Neither of us are liars.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids all jumped to say who they thought was the most "sus",
and they predicted that Alice was suspicious for blaming Bob.
With a bit of discussion,
they realized that they can't both be telling the truth
because their claims are mutually contradictory
(though they didn't have the word for this and often called it "opposites").
Then we talked about how many possibilities there are.
First they thought 2, then 4.
It's 4: two liars, liar truth-teller,
truth-teller liar, and two truth-tellers.
Then we proceeded to inspect each option,
and after a while they agreed
that the only possibility was that
Alice was telling the truth and Bob was lying (correct!).</p>
<p>Then an interesting thing happened.
As I moved on to the next knights-and-knaves puzzle they asked if they got the first one right.
And I said, "well, do you think you got it right?"
One boy admitted he wasn't entirely certain,
and then we all agreed to keep thinking about it
until we were convinced by the proof.
So it was planting the seed:
how do you know if you've truly proved something?
Later in that session he remarked to one of the girl's comments,
"No, we already proved that case!"</p>
<p>After the months of weekly sessions, however,
I think the kids are warming up to the idea
of the math speaking for its own sake.
While I led the Seven Bridge of Konigsberg
problem with a story,
they quickly discarded the story and focused on the challenge.
And in a later session they asked to revisit it
because they wanted to try to find the "smallest impossible bridges problem."
Indeed, they did!
While we didn't solve the original problem,
the idea of simplifying a problem,
making it smaller and smaller until you can solve it,
and then gradually adding back complexity,
was clearly on display those weeks.</p>
<p>And though they hated flexagons,
for an "end of the session" gift
I made them each a hexaflexagon
from a <a href="https://thinkzone.wlonk.com/Flexagon/Flexagon.htm" target="_blank">printed template</a>
which critically had bright, distinct pictures on each face.
Weeks later, one girl's dad
told me that she is obsessed with it,
only recently discovering the sixth face.
I let him know that you can draw a map of the flexagon's movements,
much like the Seven Bridges maps we drew,
to get a clear picture of the whole configuration space.
I have yet to hear back whether they were able to figure it out.</p>
<p>So I have hope that this group can graduate to appreciating
the math for its own sake.
But if I were to start with a new group
of kids who had no <em>a priori</em> love of math,
I'd have to be a bit more deliberate in framing
the problems in engaging stories.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span><span>W</span></span>hen he was nine years old, my godson Adam developed a brief but freakishly intense obsession with Elvis Presley. He took to singing Jailhouse Rock at the top of his voice with all the low crooning and pelvis-jiggling of the King himself. One day, as I tucked him in, he looked at me very earnestly and asked: “Johann, will you take me to Graceland one day?” Without really thinking, I agreed. I never gave it another thought, until everything had gone wrong.</p><p>Ten years later, Adam was lost. He had dropped out of school when he was 15, and he spent almost all his waking hours alternating blankly between screens – a blur of YouTube, WhatsApp and porn. (I’ve changed his name and some minor details to preserve his privacy.) He seemed to be whirring at the speed of Snapchat, and nothing still or serious could gain any traction in his mind. During the decade in which Adam had become a man, this fracturing seemed to be happening to many of us. Our ability to pay attention was cracking and breaking. I had just turned 40, and wherever my generation gathered, we would lament our lost capacity for concentration. I still read a lot of books, but with each year that passed, it felt more and more like running up a down escalator. Then one evening, as we lay on my sofa, each staring at our own ceaselessly shrieking screens, I looked at him and felt a low dread. “Adam,” I said softly, “let’s go to Graceland.” I reminded him of the promise I had made. I could see that the idea of breaking this numbing routine ignited something in him, but I told him there was one condition he had to stick to if we went. He had to switch his phone off during the day. He swore he would.</p><p>When you arrive at the gates of Graceland, there is no longer a human being whose job is to show you around. You are handed an iPad, you put in little earbuds, and the iPad tells you what to do – turn left; turn right; walk forward. In each room, a photograph of where you are appears on the screen, while a narrator describes it. So as we walked around we were surrounded by blank-faced people, looking almost all the time at their screens. As we walked, I felt more and more tense. When we got to the jungle room – Elvis’s favourite place in the mansion – the iPad was chattering away when a middle-aged man standing next to me turned to say something to his wife. In front of us, I could see the large fake plants that Elvis had bought to turn this room into his own artificial jungle. “Honey,” he said, “this is amazing. Look.” He waved the iPad in her direction, and began to move his finger across it. “If you swipe left, you can see the jungle room to the left. And if you swipe right, you can see the jungle room to the right.”</p><p>His wife stared, smiled, and began to swipe at her own iPad. I leaned forward. “But, sir,” I said, “there’s an old-fashioned form of swiping you can do. It’s called turning your head. Because we’re here. We’re in the jungle room. You can see it unmediated. Here. Look.” I waved my hand, and the fake green leaves rustled a little. Their eyes returned to their screens. “Look!” I said. “Don’t you see? <em> </em>We’re <em>actually there. </em>There’s no need for your screen. <em>We are in the jungle room.</em>” They hurried away. I turned to Adam, ready to laugh about it all – but he was in a corner, holding his phone under his jacket, flicking through Snapchat.</p><p>At every stage in the trip, he had broken his promise. When the plane first touched down in New Orleans two weeks before, he took out his phone while we were still in our seats. “You promised not to use it,” I said. He replied: “I meant I wouldn’t make phone calls. I can’t not use Snapchat and texting, obviously.” He said this with baffled honesty, as though I had asked him to hold his breath for 10 days. In the jungle room, I suddenly snapped and tried to wrestle his phone from his grasp, and he stomped away. That night I found him in the Heartbreak Hotel, sitting next to a swimming pool (shaped like a giant guitar), looking sad. I realised as I sat with him that, as with so much anger, my rage towards him was really anger towards myself. His inability to focus was something I felt happening to me too. I was losing my ability to be present, and I hated it. “I know something’s wrong,” Adam said, holding his phone tightly in his hand. “But I have no idea how to fix it.” Then he went back to texting.</p><figure id="f8286d25-ef9d-44b0-b3ea-5a908860b483" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Johann Hari at his home in London." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56e6443b4e0e6055b0fc5482d5d11176e1debb42/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.66666666666663" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Johann Hari at his home in London.</span> Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</figcaption></figure><p>I realised then that I needed to understand what was really happening to him and to so many of us. That moment turned out to be the start of a journey that transformed how I think about attention. I travelled all over the world in the next three years, from Miami to Moscow to Melbourne, interviewing the leading experts in the world about focus. What I learned persuaded me that we are not now facing simply a normal anxiety about attention, of the kind every generation goes through as it ages. We are living in a serious attention crisis – one with huge implications for how we live. I learned there are twelve factors that have been proven to reduce people’s ability to pay attention and that many of these factors have been rising in the past few decades – sometimes dramatically.</p><p>I went to Portland, Oregon, to interview Prof Joel Nigg, who is one of the leading experts in the world on children’s attention problems, and he told me we need to ask if we are now developing “an attentional pathogenic culture” – an environment in which sustained and deep focus is harder for all of us. When I asked him what he would do if he was in charge of our culture and he actually wanted to destroy people’s attention, he said: “Probably what our society is doing.” Prof Barbara Demeneix, a leading French scientist who has studied some key factors that can disrupt attention – she is an expert on the effects of chemical pollution – told me bluntly: “There is no way we can have a normal brain today.” We can see the effects all around us. A small study of college students found they now only focus on any one task for 65 seconds. A different study of office workers found they only focus on average for three minutes. This isn’t happening because we all individually became weak-willed. Your focus didn’t collapse. It was stolen.</p><hr><p><span><span>W</span></span>hen I first got back from Graceland, I thought my attention was failing because I wasn’t strong enough as an individual and because I had been taken over by my phone. I went into a spiral of negative thoughts, reproaching myself. I’d say – you’re weak, you’re lazy, you’re not disciplined enough. I thought the solution was obvious: be more disciplined, and banish your phone. So I went online and booked myself a little room by the beach in Provincetown, at the tip of Cape Cod. I announced triumphantly to everyone – I am going to be there for three months, with no smartphone, and no computer that can get online. I’m done. I’m tired of being wired. I knew I could only do it because I was very lucky and had money from my previous books. I knew it couldn’t be a long-term solution. I did it because I thought that if I didn’t, I might lose some crucial aspects of my ability to think deeply. I also hoped that if I stripped everything back for a time, I might start to be able to glimpse the changes we could all make in a more sustainable way.</p><p>In my first webless week, I stumbled around in a haze of decompression. Provincetown is a little gay resort town with the highest proportion of same-sex couples in the US. I ate cupcakes, read books, talked with strangers and sang songs. Everything radically slowed down. Normally I follow the news every hour or so, getting a drip-feed of anxiety-provoking facts and trying to smush them together into some kind of sense. Instead, I simply read a physical newspaper once a day. Every few hours, I would feel an unfamiliar sensation gurgling inside me and I would ask myself: what is that? Ah, yes. Calm.</p><p>Later, I realised when I interviewed the experts and studied their research that there were many reasons why my attention was starting to heal from that first day. Prof Earl Miller, a neuroscientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, explained one to me. He said “your brain can only produce one or two thoughts” in your conscious mind at once. That’s it. “We’re very, very single-minded.” We have “very limited cognitive capacity”. But we have fallen for an enormous delusion. The average teenager now believes they can follow six forms of media at the same time. When neuroscientists studied this, they found that when people believe they are doing several things at once, they are actually juggling. “They’re switching back and forth. They don’t notice the switching because their brain sort of papers it over to give a seamless experience of consciousness, but what they’re actually doing is switching and reconfiguring their brain moment-to-moment, task-to-task – [and] that comes with a cost.” Imagine, say, you are doing your tax return, and you receive a text, and you look at it – it’s only a glance, taking three seconds – and then you go back to your tax return. In that moment, “your brain has to reconfigure, when it goes from one task to another”, he said. You have to remember what you were doing before, and you have to remember what you thought about it. When this happens, the evidence shows that “your performance drops. You’re slower. All as a result of the switching.”</p><p>This is called the “switch-cost effect”. It means that if you check your texts while trying to work, you aren’t only losing the little bursts of time you spend looking at the texts themselves – you are also losing the time it takes to refocus afterwards, which turns out to be a huge amount. For example, one study at the Carnegie Mellon University’s human computer interaction lab took 136 students and got them to sit a test. Some of them had to have their phones switched off, and others had their phones on and received intermittent text messages. The students who received messages performed, on average, 20% worse. It seems to me that almost all of us are currently losing that 20% of our brainpower, almost all the time. Miller told me that as a result we now live in “a perfect storm of cognitive degradation”.</p><p>For the first time in a very long time, in Provincetown I was doing one thing at a time, without being interrupted. I was living within the limits of what my brain could actually handle. I felt my attention growing and improving with every day that passed, but then, one day, I experienced an abrupt setback. I was walking down the beach and every few steps I saw the same thing that had been scratching at me since Memphis. People seemed to be using Provincetown simply as a backdrop for selfies, rarely looking up, at the ocean or each other. Only this time, the itch I felt wasn’t to yell: You’re wasting your lives, put the damn phone down. It was to yell: Give <em>me </em>that phone! <em>Mine! </em>For so long, I had received the thin, insistent signals of the web every few hours throughout the day, the trickle of likes and comments that say: I see you. You matter. Now they were gone. Simone de Beauvoir said that when she became an atheist, it felt like the world had fallen silent. Losing the web felt like that. After the rhetorical heat of social media, ordinary social interactions seemed pleasing but low volume. No normal social interaction floods you with hearts.</p><figure id="635f2691-8217-41c0-a752-a7cfbd80e21f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Provincetown: a place to switch off." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ab661c6dd26e979e40e05619298040a51876ed/0_141_4222_2534/master/4222.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="267.08432022738043" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Provincetown: a place to switch off.</span> Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I realised that to heal my attention, it was not enough simply to strip out distractions. That makes you feel good at first – but then it creates a vacuum where all the noise was. I realised I had to fill the vacuum. To do that, I started to think a lot about an area of psychology I had learned about years before – the science of flow states. Almost everyone reading this will have experienced a flow state at some point. It’s when you are doing something meaningful to you, and you really get into it, and time falls away, and your ego seems to vanish, and you find yourself focusing deeply and effortlessly. Flow is the deepest form of attention human beings can offer. But how do we get there?</p><p>I later interviewed Prof Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in Claremont, California, who was the first scientist to study flow states and researched them for more than 40 years. From his research, I learned there are three key factors which you need to get into flow. First you need to choose <em>one</em> goal. Flow takes all your mental energy, deployed deliberately in one direction. Second, that goal needs to be meaningful to you – you can’t flow into a goal that you don’t care about. Third, it helps if what you are doing is at the edge of your abilities – if, say, the rock you are climbing is slightly higher and harder than the last rock you climbed. So every morning, I started to write – a different kind of writing from my earlier work, one that stretched me. Within a few days, I started to flow, and hours of focus would pass without it feeling like a challenge. I felt I was focusing in the way I had when I was a teenager, in long effortless stretches. I had feared my brain was breaking. I cried with relief when I realised that in the right circumstances, its full power could come back.</p><p>At the end of every day, I would sit on the beach and watch the light slowly change. The light on the cape is unlike the light anywhere else I have ever been and in Provincetown, I could see more clearly than I ever had before in my life – my own thoughts, my own goals, my own dreams. I was living in the light. So when the time came to leave the beach house and come back to the hyperlinked world, I became convinced I had cracked the code of attention. I returned to the world determined to integrate the lessons I had learned in my everyday life. When I was reunited with my phone and laptop after taking a ferry back to where they were stashed in Boston, they seemed alien, and alienating. But within a few months, my screen time was back to four hours a day, and my attention was fraying and breaking again.</p><hr><p><span><span>I</span></span>n Moscow, the former Google engineer James Williams – who has become the most important philosopher of attention in the western world – told me I had made a crucial mistake. Individual abstinence is “not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution. It might, for a short period of time, keep certain effects at bay, but it’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.” He said that our attention is being deeply altered by huge invasive forces in wider society. Saying the solution was to just adjust your own habits – to pledge to break up with your phone, say – was just “pushing it back on to the individual” he said, when “it’s really the environmental changes that will really make the difference”.</p><p>Nigg said it might help me grasp what’s happening if we compare our rising attention problems to our rising obesity rates. Fifty years ago there was very little obesity, but today it is endemic in the western world. This is not because we suddenly became greedy or self-indulgent. He said: “Obesity is not a medical epidemic – it’s a social epidemic. We have bad food, for example, and so people are getting fat.” The way we live changed dramatically – our food supply changed, and we built cities that are hard to walk or cycle around, and those changes in our environment led to changes in our bodies. We gained mass, en masse. Something similar, he said, might be happening with the changes in our attention.</p><p>I learned that the factors harming our attention are not all immediately obvious. I had been focused on tech at first, but in fact the causes range very widely – from the food we eat to the air we breathe, from the hours we work to the hours we no longer sleep. They include many things we have come to take for granted – from how we deprive our children of play, to how our schools strip learning of meaning by basing everything on tests. I came to believe we need to respond to this incessant invasion of our attention at two levels. The first is individual. There are all sorts of changes we can make at a personal level that will protect our focus. I would say that by doing most of them, I have boosted my focus by about 20%. But we have to level with people. Those changes will only take you so far. At the moment it’s as though we are all having itching powder poured over us all day, and the people pouring the powder are saying: “You might want to learn to meditate. Then you wouldn’t scratch so much.” Meditation is a useful tool – but we actually need to stop the people who are pouring itching powder on us. We need to band together to take on the forces stealing our attention and take it back.</p><figure id="43c0ea5b-1633-4a0b-a24c-c03d20aba213" data-spacefinder-role="immersive" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1300&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1140&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=1125&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 740px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 740px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=965&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 740px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=725&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=645&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Illusration of a man with a magnet for a head pulling social media logos towards him" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01455678a4bb646a319e2dcfa238ddfd9dc19570/0_0_2480_1550/master/2480.jpg?width=465&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="465" height="290.625" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Illustration by Eric Chow.</span></figcaption></figure><p>This can sound a bit abstract – but I met people who were putting it into practice in many places. To give one example: there is strong scientific evidence that stress and exhaustion ruin your attention. Today, about 35% of workers feel they can never switch off their phones because their boss might email them at any time of day or night. In France, ordinary workers decided this was intolerable and pressured their government for change – so now, they have a legal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/dec/31/french-workers-win-legal-right-to-avoid-checking-work-email-out-of-hours" data-link-name="in body link">“right to disconnect”</a>. It’s simple. You have a right to defined work hours, and you have a right to not be contacted by your employer outside those hours. Companies that break the rules get huge fines. There are lots of potential collective changes like this that can restore part of our focus. We could, for example, force social media companies to abandon their current business model, which is specifically designed to invade our attention in order to keep us scrolling. There are alternative ways these sites could work – ones that would heal our attention instead of hacking it.</p><p>Some scientists say these worries about attention are a moral panic, comparable to the anxieties in the past about comic books or rap music, and that the evidence is shaky. Other scientists say the evidence is strong and these anxieties are like the early warnings about the obesity epidemic or the climate crisis in the 1970s. I think that given this uncertainty, we can’t wait for perfect evidence. We have to act based on a reasonable assessment of risk. If the people warning about the effects on our attention turn out to be wrong, and we still do what they suggest, what will be the cost? We will spend less time being harassed by our bosses, and we’ll be tracked and manipulated less by technology – along with lots of other improvements in our lives that are desirable in any case. But if they turn out to be right, and we don’t do what they say, what’s the cost? We will have – as the former Google engineer Tristan Harris told me – downgraded humanity, stripping us of our attention at the very time when we face big collective crises that require it more than ever.</p><p>But none of these changes will happen unless we fight for them. Just as the feminist movement reclaimed women’s right to their own bodies (and still has to fight for it today), I believe we now need an attention movement to reclaim our minds. I believe we need to act urgently, because this may be like the climate crisis, or the obesity crisis – the longer we wait, the harder it will get. The more our attention degrades, the harder it will be to summon the personal and political energy to take on the forces stealing our focus. The first step it requires is a shift in our consciousness. We need to stop blaming ourselves, or making only demands for tiny tweaks from our employers and from tech companies. We own our own minds – and together, we can take them back from the forces that are stealing them.</p><p><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> The above is an edited extract from <em>Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention</em> by Johann Hari, published by Bloomsbury on 6 January.

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Status</h2>
<p dir="auto">This project works on the GitHub Pages sites that I and other contributors care
about. It looks credible on a spot-check of other Jekyll sites.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current Limitations</h3>
<p dir="auto">Missing features:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Pagination</li>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Plugin system. (<a href="https://github.com/osteele/gojekyll/blob/main/docs/plugins.md">Some individual plugins</a> are emulated.)</li>
<li>Liquid filter <code>sassify</code> is not implemented</li>
<li>Liquid is run in strict mode: undefined filters and variables are errors.</li>
<li>Missing markdown features:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#attribute-list-definitions" rel="nofollow">attribute lists</a></li>
<li><a href="https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#html-blocks" rel="nofollow"><code>markdown="span"</code>, <code>markdown="block"</code></a></li>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Also see the <a href="#feature-status">detailed status</a> below.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other Differences</h3>
<p dir="auto">These will probably not change:</p>
<p dir="auto">By design:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Plugins must be listed in the config file, not a Gemfile.</li>
<li>The wrong type in a <code>_config.yml</code> file – for example, a list where a string is
expected, or vice versa – is generally an error.</li>
<li>Server live reload is always on.</li>
<li><code>serve --watch</code> (the default) reloads the <code>_config.yml</code> and data files too.</li>
<li><code>serve</code> generates pages on the fly; it doesn't write to the file system.</li>
<li>Files are cached in <code>/tmp/gojekyll-${USER}</code>, not <code>./.sass-cache</code></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Upstream:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Markdown:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> inside markdown is interpreted as HTML. For example, <code>This is &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;</code> renders as <b>bold</b>. This behavior matches the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#html" rel="nofollow">Markdown
spec</a>, but differs
from Jekyll's default Kramdown processor.</li>
<li>The autogenerated id of a header that includes HTML is computed from the
text of the title, ignoring its attributes. For example, the id of <code>## Title (&lt;a href="https://example.com/path/to/details"&gt;ref&lt;/a&gt;))</code> is <code>#title-ref</code>,
not <code>#title-https-example-path-to-details-ref</code>.</li>
<li>Autogenerated header ids replace punctuation by the hyphens, rather than the
empty string. For example, the id of <code>## Either/or</code> is <code>#either-or</code> not
<code>#eitheror</code>; the id of <code>## I'm Lucky</code> is <code>#i-m-lucky</code> not <code>#im-lucky</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">If the error is "403 API rate limit exceeded", you are probably building a
repository that uses the <code>jekyll-github-metadata</code> gem. Try setting the
<code>JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN</code>, <code>JEKYLL_GITHUB_TOKEN</code>, or <code>OCTOKIT_ACCESS_TOKEN</code>
environment variable to the value of a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token">GitHub personal access
token</a> and trying again.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

							<p>The growing movement against single-use plastics has led many bars and restaurants to swap plastic straws for paper ones. On the surface, this seems like an easy win – we get to sip our drinks through an eco-friendly alternative while keeping tons of plastic out of landfills and oceans. But the truth about paper straws is more complicated.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/paper-straws-contain-forever-chemicals-which-mean-they-might-not-be-better-than-plastic-ones">study conducted</a> at the University of Antwerp found that a shocking 90% of so-called eco-friendly paper straws actually contain traces of “forever chemicals.” Forever chemicals, more formally known as <a href="https://chemtrust.org/pfas/">per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances</a>&nbsp;(PFAS), are compounds that don’t break down once released into the environment or our bodies. They stick around virtually forever, which is how they got their ominous nickname.</p>
<p>PFAS have been linked to concerning health effects including high cholesterol, reduced immune response, thyroid disease, and increased risk of certain cancers. So why are they turning up in paper straws? The researchers tested 39 different brands of straws made from various materials like paper, bamboo, glass, stainless steel, and plastic. PFAS were detected in the majority – 69% overall.</p>
<p>But paper straws were by far the worst offenders, with PFAS identified in a whopping 90% of brands tested. The concentrations varied quite a bit, but the frequent presence of the chemicals suggests they were likely intentionally added in some cases. PFAS are sometimes used as a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/water-resistant-products-toxic-pfas-study">water-resistant coating</a> – not something you want leaching into your daily iced tea.</p>
<p>Among the PFAS found in paper straws was <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Perfluorooctanoic-acid">perfluorooctanoic acid</a> (PFOA), which has actually been <a href="https://chemicalwatch.com/189390/global-ban-on-pfoa-enters-into-force-for-most-countries">globally banned since 2020</a> due to health risks including cancer and organ damage. Also frequently detected were other concerning PFAS chemicals <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoroacetic_acid">trifluoroacetic acid</a>&nbsp;(TFA) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triflic_acid">trifluoromethanesulfonic acid</a> (TFMS). While bamboo straws fared slightly better than paper ones, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045653521007074?via%3Dihub">PFAS was still found in 80%</a> of the bamboo brands tested. Plastic and glass straws also occasionally contained PFAS, though less commonly than plant-based options.</p>
<p>The one material that seems safest is stainless steel – the researchers did not detect any PFAS compounds in the steel straws analyzed. While the PFAS levels measured in this study were fairly low, these chemicals have the ominous ability to accumulate in the human body and the environment over time. The findings raise the question – if paper straws leach PFAS into our drinks over months and years of use, could they be harming our health?</p>
<p>Unfortunately the current research didn’t examine whether the chemicals transfer into liquids. But previous studies have shown PFAS can migrate from food packaging materials into actual food and drinks. More research is critically needed to determine if PFAS leach out of paper straws during typical use.</p>
<p>In the meantime, it’s clear we need to rethink the assumption that paper and other plant-based products are inherently better for health and sustainability compared to plastic. The revelation about paper straws casts doubt on the idea that swapping plastic for paper is a foolproof eco-friendly solution. After all, PFAS spreading from straws into waterways and landfills still contribute to environmental contamination – regardless of that paper label.</p>
<p>The study was published in the journal&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2023.2240908" rel="noopener">Food Additives and Contaminants</a></i>.</p>

<p>Computer science pioneer Edsger Dijkstra's algorithms form the backbone of many computer subroutines, thanks to their elegant efficiency. However, seemingly subtle changes in requirements can lead to these often conceptually simple formulations failing to provide an accurate answer. The replacement algorithms provide the correct answers but are frequently orders of magnitude slower.</p>
<p>A recent breakthrough in combinatorial techniques has shown how these early algorithms can be revived. </p>
<p>Shortest-path problems provide good examples of the sensitivity of an algorithm to the specifics of their requirements. The underpinning for many applications from navigation to chip layout, these problems present a simple, basic proposition: Find the path through a network of directed paths that offers the lowest cost based on the weights applied to each hop. That weighting may reflect distance or delay, properties that are always positive in the physical world.</p>
<p>Problems start when you encounter a similar network where paths can have negative weights. "When you're dealing with the situation when edge weights correspond to cost, negative weights are natural," says Aaron Bernstein, assistant professor of computer science at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ.</p>
<p>In finance, for example, there may be situations in currency or options trading where buying and selling in one sequence is more profitable than taking a different path, and these can be modeled using negative weights as long as the search algorithm is fast enough. But those negative weights can throw Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm for a loop.</p>
<p>The issue lies in the efficient greediness of the algorithm developed in the mid-1950s: It will often remove negative-weight paths from consideration. It processes each vertex in turn and does not return, so the algorithm may not consider whether a high weight combined with one that carries a negative weight might result in a lower cost than a single hop with a low weight.</p>
<p>A revised approach, often known as the Bellman-Ford algorithm, handles the negative-weight connections correctly, but because it relies on the ability to process nodes, it lacks the raw efficiency of Dijkstra's technique, which completes in a time based on the sum of the number of nodes and connections. Bellman-Ford instead needs many more steps: The total is based on the product of the number of nodes and vertices.</p>
<p>Though computer scientists have attempted to find more efficient solutions to the problem using similar combinatorial techniques to those used in these longstanding algorithms, they failed to narrow the computational gap between them by a significant amount. Over the past few decades, greater advances were made by representing the graph as coefficients in a matrix and using the tools of linear algebra. Such techniques have proven successful for a wide range of path-related problems, not just for identifying the shortest route but for applications such as maximizing flow through a network of pipes or transportation routes, as demonstrated in a paper presented at last year's Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS).</p>
<p>Georgia Institute of Technology Ph.D. student Li Chen, working with mathematicians at Switzerland's ETH Zurich, Stanford University, and the University of Toronto, developed a mechanism based on gradient descent, the same core approach as the one used to train neural networks, to progressively move to the best answer for maximizing flow through a network. This algorithm managed to bring the computation time down to almost linear performance.</p>
<p>The downside to recently developed techniques based on optimization is that they are more difficult to implement and understand than traditional combinatorial algorithms. "This type of approach often uses a lot of dynamic algorithms, which tend to be complicated. They involve many moving parts that you have to put together," says Danupon Nanongkai, director and scientific member of the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken, Germany.</p>

<hr>
<p>Bernstein, Nanongkai, and Christian Wulff-Nilsen, associate professor of computer science at the University of Copenhagen, wanted to see if they could find an efficient combinatorial solution to the single-source, shortest-path problem with negative weights.</p>
<p>The team first turned to an early-1990s paper by Andrew Goldberg and colleagues that had reduced the complexity to the square root of the number of vertices multiplied by the number of nodes by trying to scale the weight values to become positive and so allow the shortest path to be found using Dijkstra's approach. "The original goal was just to improve the Goldberg result by a little bit but, in the end, it turned out that once everything was in place we could go all the way," says Nanongkai.</p>
<p>A long-standing technique for scaling is the use of price functions, though it can be difficult to assign prices efficiently and in a way that does not distort the relationship between weights. The team found an efficient algorithm which worked on a specific type of graph: those with low diameter. That proved to be the key to a bigger breakthrough and one that may help uncover more efficient combinatorial solutions to other problems.</p>
<p>Low-diameter graphs are structures where the paths are short and can be seen as strongly connected to each other. The low-diameter property has been a key component of finding ways to cut graphs into sections so processing can be distributed across multiple computers. Ensuring that strongly connected components are kept on the same machine helps minimize network traffic.</p>
<p>The team found it was possible to divide the input graph into clusters of low-diameter subgraphs, and then to progressively rework the weights using a series of price functions to build a restructured graph that could be processed almost completely using Dijkstra's algorithm. This involved the random removal of paths with negative weights that would enable the source graph to be converted into a directed acyclic graph: one with only forward paths and no loops connecting the strongly connected clusters to each other. This form was selected because it opened the door to tools that would allow the use of the fastest algorithm. A later phase then reintroduces the missing negative-weight edges. The small number of these paths can be processed using the Bellman-Ford algorithm with comparatively little impact on runtime.</p>
<p>Though a form of low-diameter decomposition built for directed graphs proved fundamental to the solution, Bernstein says it was not immediately obvious as the traditional decomposition was developed for undirected graphs. "When we started to look at it, it was unclear what low-diameter decomposition in this context would mean and it didn't occur to us that it could be a relevant notion. It was only because we started working from a different direction and found we were dealing with graphs connected to the low-diameter property that we started to see how it could be used," he says.</p>
<p>The decomposition made it possible to break the price-function calculations into several steps, and do so in an efficient way without risking the distortion that a single-step approach would impose.</p>
<p>"In a sense, what our algorithm is doing is decomposing the graph, solving things with a few negative edge weights, fixing those, and then moving up. It's continually trying to make sure there are few negative edge weights, solving those and then figuring out the next, progressively trying to make things less and less negative," Bernstein adds.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The core algorithm has several elements with a logarithmic dependency on the number of vertices in the graph, each of which represents room for improvement.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Wulff-Nilsen notes, "This progressive improvement is done by changing the edges using price functions several times. So, it's not as if we just find one price point."</p>
<p>The result was an algorithm with near-linear performance, and with slightly better performance on its task compared to the optimization technique of maximum flow presented by Chen at the same FOCS event last year. Both shared the best-paper award at the symposium, and a number of teachers have since incorporated the combinatorial algorithm and colleagues into their classes because of its relative simplicity.</p>
<p>Though the core algorithm is near-linear, it has several elements that have a logarithmic dependency on the number of vertices in the graph, each of which presents room for improvement. Karl Bringmann and Alejandro Cassis of Saarland University teamed up with Nick Fischer of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and managed to optimize away six of the eight log factors in a paper published in April. Some they regarded as simple, such as changing the order in which elements are presented to the underlying Dijkstra algorithm, but others were "more involved."</p>
<p>In their work, Bringmann and colleagues came up with what they describe as a more direct form of decomposition for their more efficient algorithm, together with a different form of low-diameter decomposition they did not use for this particular problem.</p>
<p>Such treatments could turn out to be as useful for directed graphs as low-diameter decomposition as they have been for work with undirected graphs. "I think people were excited to see that low-diameter decomposition could be used in this way. People have been talking to all of us about using this for other directed-graph problems," Bernstein claims.</p>
<p>Taking the low-diameter decomposition full circle, Bernstein, Nanongkai, and others published a paper in March demonstrating a distributed algorithm for shortest-path calculation. However, finding efficient combinatorial solutions to problems such as flow maximization remains an uphill struggle, and despite their greater complexity and reliance on techniques that call for the manipulation of dynamic data structures, the optimization-based approaches remain key tools for computer science.</p>
<p>Bernstein observes, "The optimization techniques really are the only way we know to solve some problems. Our algorithm showed a combinatorial solution for one problem, but it's still one particular problem. For minimum-cost flow, for example, we don't yet have an idea of how to do it combinatorially."</p>

						<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><span>In recent years, </span><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/cell-based-architecture-on-aws/"><span>cellular architectures</span></a><span> have become increasingly popular for large online services as a way to increase redundancy and limit the blast radius of site failures. In pursuit of these goals, we have migrated the most critical user-facing services at Slack from a monolithic to a cell-based architecture over the last 1.5 years. In this series of blog posts, we’ll discuss our reasons for embarking on this massive migration, illustrate the design of our cellular topology along with the engineering trade-offs we made along the way, and talk about our strategies for successfully shipping deep changes across many connected services.</span></p>
<h2><b>Background: the incident</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_16211" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16211"><img decoding="async" src="https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image1.jpg?w=640" alt="Graph of TCP retransmits by AZ, with one AZ worse than the others" width="640" height="188" srcset="https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image1.jpg 1600w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image1.jpg?resize=640,188 640w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image1.jpg?resize=768,226 768w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image1.jpg?resize=1280,376 1280w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image1.jpg?resize=1536,451 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 599px) 432px, 536px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16211">TCP retransmits by AZ, 2021-06-30 outage</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>At Slack, we conduct an incident review after each notable service outage. Below is an excerpt from our internal report summarizing one such incident and our findings:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><i><span>At 11:45am PDT on 2021-06-30, our cloud provider experienced a network disruption in one of several availability zones in our U.S. East Coast region, where the majority of Slack is hosted. A network link that connects one availability zone with several other availability zones containing Slack servers experienced intermittent faults, causing slowness and degraded connections between Slack servers and degrading service for Slack customers.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>At 12:33pm PDT on 2021-06-30, the network link was automatically removed from service by our cloud provider, restoring full service to Slack customers. After a series of automated checks by our cloud provider, the network link entered service again.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>At 5:22pm PDT on 2021-06-30, the same network link experienced the same intermittent faults. At 5:31pm PDT on 2021-06-30, the cloud provider permanently removed the network link from service, restoring full service to our customers.</span></i></p>
<p><span>At first glance, this appears to be pretty unremarkable; a piece of physical hardware upon which we were reliant failed, so we served some errors until it was removed from service. However, as we went through the reflective process of incident review, we were led to wonder why, in fact, this outage was visible to our users </span><i><span>at all</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Slack operates a global, multi-regional edge network, but most of our core computational infrastructure resides in multiple Availability Zones within a single region, us-east-1. Availability Zones (AZs) are isolated datacenters within a single region; in addition to the physical isolation they offer, components of cloud services upon which we rely (virtualization, storage, networking, etc.) are blast-radius limited such that they should not fail simultaneously across multiple AZs. This enables builders of services hosted in the cloud (such as Slack) to architect services in such a way that the availability of the entire service in a region is greater than the availability of any one underlying AZ. So to restate the question above — why didn’t this strategy work out for us on June 30? Why did one failed AZ result in user-visible errors?</span></p>
<p><span>As it turns out, detecting failure in distributed systems is a hard problem. A single Slack API request from a user (for example, loading messages in a channel) may fan out into hundreds of RPCs to service backends, each of which must complete to return a correct response to the user. Our service frontends are continuously attempting to detect and exclude failed backends, but we’ve got to record some failures before we can exclude a failed server! To make things even harder, some of our key datastores (including </span><a href="https://slack.engineering/scaling-datastores-at-slack-with-vitess/"><span>our main datastore Vitess</span></a><span>) offer strongly consistent semantics. This is enormously useful to us as application developers but also requires that there be a single backend available for any given write. If a shard primary is unavailable to an application frontend, writes to that shard will fail until the primary returns or a secondary is promoted to take its place.</span></p>
<p><span>We might class the outage above as a </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/paper-1.pdf"><i><span>gray failure</span></i></a><span>. In a gray failure, different components have different views of the availability of the system. In our incident, systems within the impacted AZ saw complete availability of backends within their AZ, but backends outside the AZ were unavailable, and vice versa systems in unimpacted AZs saw the impacted AZ as unavailable. Even clients within the same AZ would have different views of backends in the impacted AZ, depending on whether their network flows happened to traverse the failed equipment. Informally, it seems that this is quite a lot of complexity to ask a distributed system to deal with along the way to doing its real job of serving messages and cat GIFs to our customers.</span></p>
<p><span>Rather than try to solve automatic remediation of gray failures, our solution to this conundrum was to make the computers’ job easier by tapping the power of human judgment. During the outage, it was quite clear to engineers responding that the impact was largely due to one AZ being unreachable — nearly every graph we had aggregated by target AZ looked similar to the retransmits graph above. If we had a button that told all our systems “This AZ is bad; avoid it.” we would absolutely have smashed it! So we set out to build a button that would drain traffic from an AZ.</span></p>
<h2><b>Our solution: AZs are cells, and cells may be drained</b></h2>
<p><span>Like a lot of satisfying infrastructure work, an AZ drain button is conceptually simple yet complicated in practice. The design goals we chose are:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Remove as much traffic as possible from an AZ within 5 minutes. Slack’s </span><a href="https://slack.com/terms/service-level-agreement"><span>99.99% availability SLA</span></a><span>&nbsp;allows us less than 1 hour per year of total unavailability, and so to support it effectively we need tools that work quickly.</span></li>
<li><span>Drains must not result in user-visible errors. An important quality of draining is that it is a </span><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/generic-mitigations/"><span>generic mitigation</span></a><span>: as long as a failure is contained within a single AZ, a drain may be effectively used to mitigate even if the root cause is not yet understood. This lends itself to an experimental approach wherein, during in an incident, an operator may try draining an AZ to see if it enables recovery, then undrain if it does not. If draining results in additional errors this approach is not useful.</span></li>
<li><span>Drains and undrains must be incremental. When undraining, an operator should be able to assign as little as 1% of traffic to an AZ to test whether it has truly recovered.</span></li>
<li><span>The draining mechanism must not rely on resources in the AZ being drained. For example, it’s not OK to activate a drain by just SSHing to every server and forcing it to healthcheck down. This ensures that drains may be put in place even if an AZ is completely offline.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>A naive implementation that fits these requirements would have us plumb a signal into each of our RPC clients that, when received, causes them to fail a specified percentage of traffic away from a particular AZ. This turns out to have a lot of complexity lurking within. Slack does not share a common codebase or even runtime; services in the user-facing request path are written in Hack, Go, Java, and C++. This would necessitate a separate implementation in each language. Beyond that concern, we support a number of internal service discovery interfaces including the Envoy xDS API, the Consul API, and even DNS. Notably, DNS does not offer an abstraction for something like an AZ or partial draining; clients expect to resolve a DNS address and receive a list of IPs and no more. Finally, we rely heavily on open-source systems like Vitess, for which code-level changes present an unpleasant choice between maintaining an internal fork and doing the additional work to get changes merged into upstream.</span></p>
<p><span>The main strategy we settled on is called </span><i><span>siloing</span></i><span>. Services may be said to be </span><i><span>siloed</span></i><span>&nbsp;if they only receive traffic from within their AZ and only send traffic upstream to servers in their AZ. The overall architectural effect of this is that each service appears to be N virtual services, one per AZ. Importantly, we may effectively remove traffic from all siloed services in an AZ simply by redirecting user requests away from that AZ. If no new requests from users are arriving in a siloed AZ, internal services in that AZ will naturally quiesce as they have no new work to do.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_16212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16212"><img decoding="async" src="https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image2.jpg?w=640" alt="A digram showing request failures across multiple AZs caused by a failure in a single AZ." width="640" height="434" srcset="https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image2.jpg 1160w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image2.jpg?resize=640,435 640w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image2.jpg?resize=768,522 768w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 599px) 432px, 536px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16212">Our original architecture. Backends are spread across AZs, so errors present in frontends in all AZs.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>And so we finally arrive at our cellular architecture. All services are present in all AZs, but each service only communicates with services within its AZ. Failure of a system within one AZ is contained within that AZ, and we may dynamically route traffic away to avoid those failures simply by redirecting at the frontend.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_16213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-16213"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image3.jpg?w=640" alt="A digram showing client requests siloed within AZs, routing around a failed AZ." width="640" height="424" srcset="https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image3.jpg 1160w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image3.jpg?resize=640,424 640w, https://slack.engineering/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2023/08/image3.jpg?resize=768,508 768w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 90vw, (max-width: 599px) 432px, 536px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-16213">Siloed architecture. Failure in one AZ is contained to that AZ; traffic may be routed away.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>Siloing allows us to concentrate our efforts on the traffic-shifting implementation in one place: the systems that route queries from users into the core services in us-east-1. Over the last several years we have invested heavily in </span><a href="https://slack.engineering/migrating-millions-of-concurrent-websockets-to-envoy/"><span>migrating from HAProxy to the Envoy / xDS ecosystem,</span></a><span>&nbsp;and so all our edge load balancers are now running Envoy and receive configuration from Rotor, our in-house xDS control plane. This enabled us to power AZ draining by simply using two out-of-the-box Envoy features: weighted clusters and dynamic weight assignment via RTDS. When we drain an AZ, we simply send a signal through Rotor to the edge Envoy load balancers instructing them to reweight their per-AZ target clusters at us-east-1. If an AZ at us-east-1 is reweighted to zero, Envoy will continue handling in-flight requests but assign all new requests to another AZ, and thus the AZ is drained. Let’s see how this satisfies our goals:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Propagation through the control plane is on the order of seconds; Envoy load balancers will apply new weights immediately.</span></li>
<li><span>Drains are graceful; no queries to a drained AZ will be abandoned by the load balancing layer.</span></li>
<li><span>Weights provide gradual drains with a granularity of 1%.</span></li>
<li><span>Edge load balancers are located in different regions entirely, and the control plane is replicated regionally and resilient against the failure of any single AZ.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Here is a graph showing bandwidth per AZ as we gradually drain traffic from one AZ into two others. Note how pronounced the “knees” in the graph are; this reflects the low propagation time and high granularity afforded us by the Envoy/xDS implementation.</span></p>

<p><span>In our next post we’ll dive deeper into the details of our technical implementation. We’ll discuss how siloing is implemented for internal services, and which services can’t be siloed and what we do about them. We’ll also discuss how we’ve changed the way we operate and build services at Slack now that we have this powerful new tool at our disposal. Stay tuned!</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>Cryptography libraries for Rust should be written entirely in Rust.

</p><p>Rust should be improved to provide the necessary building blocks that are
   needed to write cryptography code that is free from timing side channels and
   similar hazards. These facilities should not be restricted to code within
   Rust -provided or -endorsed libraries; anybody should be able to use them to
   publish a crate that correctly implements cryptography. The standard Rust
   toolchain (rustc, Cargo, etc.) should ensure that these facilities work
    as specified.

</p><p>Rust should provide safe, direct access to architecture-specific instructions
   that are required to implement cryptography with optimal performance. Rust
   should provide a safe mechanism for dispatching to microarchitecture-specific
   implementations at runtime. There is no need to trade off performance vs.
   safety.

</p><p>In some cases (e.g. WebAssembly and other virtual machine architectures) the
   target may need to be extended to provide the necessary facilities so
   that Rust compilers can produce safe code. The Rust community should work with
   the communities implementing these architectures to help them provide what is
   needed.

</p><p>The Rust Foundation is led by several organizations that have experts in
   maintaining FIPS-validated software libraries: ARM, Amazon Web Services, Google,
   and Microsoft. They should support the Rust community by letting their experts
   help the Rust community create FIPS-validated cryptography libraries written
   entirely in safe Rust that expose safe and idiomatic Rust APIs.

</p><p>We should help formal methods cryptography projects generate and/or verify
   safe Rust code.

</p><p>The word "safe" above refers to Rust's sense of safety: All of these facilities
   should be provided such that they can be used without any use of the
   <code>unsafe</code> keyword in the crypto code.

</p><p>All of the above is achievable with reasonable effort, time, and cost. It is
   often impractical for people to advocate for or work on pure Rust cryptography,
   even if they want to do so—especially when they may work for organizations that
   already have committed to doing something else. The community has to kindly
   demand pure Rust cryptography, politely but firmly refuse compromises, and
   generously support the individuals who are actively working towards making safe
   Rust cryptography a reality.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A short note about corporate free / open source software (FOSS), and corporate-employed maintainers. Or specifically "corporate-employed maintainers .. with bad incentives". I tried to come up with a pithy name, but that's the best I could do: CEMBIs.</p><p>I've worked professionally in FOSS for a long time. I've seen a lot of corporate approaches to FOSS participation over that time, and seen the FOSS community develop a fairly nuanced understanding of what sorts of corporate strategies are welcome or unwelcome, healthy or harmful to a project. We have articulated a lot of thoughts about (say) open core and dual licensing business models, or (say) which forms of corporate "embrace" represent a step on an "extend/extinguish" path, or (say) which forms of telemetry are appropriate and which put users at risk of surveillance.</p><p>What I haven't seen a lot of discussion of, and wish I did see, is the structure and content of relationships that exist between corporate-employed FOSS maintainers and their employers. And I think this matters because the people doing corporate FOSS aren't soul-less automata executing corporate strategy. They are people with their own motivations, incentives, a certain amount of autonomy, but (most relevant to my concerns) a set of performance-evaluation criteria they have to satisfy to remain employed and/or get promoted.</p><p>Companies incentivize lots of things, but I worry (and in many cases I either know first hand or have heard second hand) that companies often have an incentive structure that rewards <em>novelty</em>, especially in the form of <em>features</em> if not entire <em>products</em>. There's a good reason for this when the company is "making products to sell": this year's new-and-improved is always sellable over last year's tired old model. But it's also just a reflection of the "growth orientation" or capitalism in general: whatever activity the company accomplished last year, a common measure of health and vitality isn't consistent execution but <em>growth of the business</em>. Failure to grow is treated as stagnation which is treated as equivalent to death. This orientation can be embedded so deep in a company's DNA that it's the incentive structure given to <em>everyone</em> who works there, regardless of whether they're making products, auditing the accounts, or <em>maintaining corporate infrastructure</em>.</p><p>And to a large measure, that's what FOSS is. Not always, but usually: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure">infrastructure</a>. It's stuff that's supposed to work the same way from one day to the next. Stuff that's not supposed to be noticed because it just works. Reliably, efficiently, silently. Stuff that has a massive installed base of users relying on it, massive social and institutional inertia, and thereby massive (and sensible) built-in resistance to novelty. You don't actually want novelty in the electrical grid, the drinking water system, sewers, roads, bridges, rail lines, telecoms .. you want this stuff to be <em>absolutely rock solid</em> and not novel in the least. That's what maybe 90 or 95% of FOSS is like, certainly the stuff that <em>needs</em> reliable corporate maintainers.</p><p>For corporate-employed FOSS maintainers working at a firm with these "growth and novelty" incentives -- CEMBIs -- this leads to a real quandry. They're in a position where their job performance is very likely to be evaluated in terms of visible growth and novelty (it might be dressed up in more abstract terms like "real-world impact" or "visibility" but it still means the same thing) even though that is exactly the wrong thing for the health of the project they're maintaining. The incentives are bad. If they do the <em>best</em> thing for the project <em>as infrastructure</em> -- triage and fix bugs from the backlog, optimize performance, increase security and reliability, pay down tech debt, simplify and automate ongoing maintenance -- the bias of their organization is likely to view them as "doing nothing", or at best doing "low-value work" that only counts as "reducing fixed costs", not leading the way towards new growth. To be seen in a positive light by their employer, the CEMBI winds uphaving to do essentially <em>anti-maintenance work</em>: make the program "do something new and exciting", that it didn't do yesterday. Ignore maintenance of "what is", focus on "what's next".</p><p>Seeing this over and over in FOSS makes me a bit sad. I guess I've maybe been watching too many re-runs of The West Wing lately, but while I've been thinking about this subject, I keep thinking of the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_Bartlet_Be_Bartlet">Let Bartlet Be Bartlet</a>" episode near the end of the first season, where the characters come around to the idea that maybe it'd be best to just do what they were elected to do. I keep thinking it'd be nice if employers could incentivize their employees to do what they were hired to do. To "<b>Let Maintainers Be Maintainers</b>". Maintaining FOSS isn't low-value work. It's <em>essential</em> work, stuff that you ignore at your medium and long-term peril. As a new homeowner I will make more salient analogies: it's testing the wiring for faults, testing the walls for mould, replacing the roof before it leaks. It's work that <em>has to be done</em> in order for FOSS to keep functioning over the long term. Software actually does "break down and wear out": requirements change; upstream and downstream platforms and libraries change incompatibly; patterns of usage change; hardware changes; new subsystems become performance bottlenecks; new bugs are discovered, some of which will be high severity security vulnerabilities, others will merely grow in importance as they're encountered more often. Software maintenance is <em>real and important work</em>, and if a company hires a maintainer of a project "in order to support the project", it's what that company should be incentivizing and evaluating those maintainers in terms of.</p></div></div>]]></description>

   <p>Two people dressed in dark colors and wearing masks dart into a busy street on a hill in San Francisco. One of them hauls a big orange traffic cone. They sprint toward a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/10/1193272085/san-francisco-has-lots-of-self-driving-cars-theyre-driving-first-responders-nuts">driverless car </a>and quickly set the cone on the hood.</p>   <p>The vehicle's side lights burst on and start flashing orange. And then, it sits there immobile.</p>   <p>"All right, looks good," one of them says after making sure no one is inside. "Let's get out of here." They hop on e-bikes and pedal off.</p>   <p>All it takes to render the technology-packed self-driving car inoperable is a traffic cone. If all goes according to plan, it will stay there, frozen, until someone comes and removes it. </p>   
   <p>An anonymous activist group called Safe Street Rebel is responsible for this so-called coning incident and dozens of others over the past few months.<strong> </strong>The group's goal is to incapacitate the driverless cars roaming San Francisco's streets as a protest against the city being used as a testing ground for this<strong> </strong>emerging technology.</p>   <p>Over the past couple of years, driverless cars have become ubiquitous throughout San Francisco. It began with human safety drivers on board who were there to make sure everything ran smoothly. And then, many cars started operating with no humans at all. </p>   <p>They're mostly run by Cruise, which is owned by GM, and Waymo, which is owned by Google parent company Alphabet. Both companies have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-most-tech-forward-city-has-doubts-about-self-driving-cars-d6b098e0">poured billions of dollars</a> into developing these autonomous vehicles. Neither Cruise nor Waymo responded to questions about why the cars can be disabled by traffic cones.</p>

<!-- END ID="RES1195712538" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Waymo says it has a permit for 250 cars and it deploys about 100 at any given time. Cruise says it runs 100 in San Francisco during the day and 300 at night. The Department of Motor Vehicles made Cruise <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/technology/cruise-crash-driverless-car-san-francisco.html">cut that number in half</a> after one of its cars collided with a firetruck last week. </p>   <h3>Street theater protests are nothing new in San Francisco</h3>   <p>Earlier this month, the California Public Utilities Commission voted 3-1 to let the two companies <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/10/1193272085/san-francisco-has-lots-of-self-driving-cars-theyre-driving-first-responders-nuts">run their vehicles at all hours of the day</a> picking up passengers like taxis.</p>   
   <p>The lead-up to the commission's vote prompted the Safe Street Rebel group to start "coning," as they call it.  Members have long used street theater shenanigans to gain attention in their fight against cars and to promote public transportation. </p>   <p>Coning driverless cars fits in line with a long history of protests against the impact of the tech industry on San Francisco. Throughout the years, activists have <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/12/17/251960183/in-a-divided-san-francisco-private-tech-buses-drive-tension">blockaded Google's private commuter buses</a> from picking up employees in the city. And when scooter companies flooded the sidewalks with electric scooters, people <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/the-mad-tale-of-the-electric-scooter-craze-with-bird-lime-and-spin-in-san-francisco/">threw them into San Francisco Bay</a>.</p>   <p>"Then there was the burning of Lime scooters in front of a Google bus," says Manissa Maharawal, an assistant professor at American University who has <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/anti.12744">studied these protests</a>. </p>   <p>She points out that when tech companies test their products in the city, residents don't have much say in those decisions: "There's been various iterations of this where it's like, 'Oh, yep, let's try that out in San Francisco again,' with very little input from anyone who lives here."</p>   <p>That gets to the crux of Safe Street Rebel's protest. The group only agreed to speak to NPR if they could remain anonymous because it's unclear if what they're doing is legal.<strong> </strong></p>   <p>"We thought that putting cones on these [driverless cars] was a funny image that could captivate people," says one organizer. "One of these self-driving cars with billions of dollars of venture capital investment money and R&amp;D, just being disabled by a common traffic cone."</p>   <h3>First responders aren't happy with driverless cars</h3>   <p>Safe Street Rebel has <a href="https://www.safestreetrebel.com/conesf/">cataloged hundreds of near misses and blunders</a> with Cruise and Waymo vehicles over the past few months — even without traffic cones. </p>   <p>The cars have <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/12/watch-san-francisco-cruise-robotaxi-appears-to-almost-get-hit-by-bus/">run red lights</a>, <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/cruise_032323-pdf/">rear-ended a bus</a> and blocked crosswalks and bike paths. In one incident, dozens of confused cars <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/dead-end-sf-street-plagued-with-confused-waymo-cars-trying-to-turn-around-every-5-minutes/">congregated in a residential cul-de-sac</a>, clogging the street. In another, a Waymo <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/06/a-waymo-self-driving-car-killed-a-dog-in-unavoidable-accident/">ran over and killed a dog</a>. </p>   
   <p>"We don't really need traffic cones to show how vulnerable they are," says the Safe Street Rebel<strong> </strong>organizer.</p>   <p>Both Cruise and Waymo say their vehicles are far safer than human drivers and compared to humans they've had relatively<strong> </strong>few incidents. They say they've driven millions of driverless miles without any human fatalities or life-threatening injuries. An Uber self-driving car, operating in full autonomous mode and with a safety driver in the vehicle, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-self-driving-car-fatal-crash/">killed a pedestrian in Arizona</a> in 2018.</p>   <div id="res1195817069">

   <p>Safe Street Rebel isn't the only group that's had issues with the autonomous vehicles. San Francisco's police and fire departments have also said the cars <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/10/1193272085/san-francisco-has-lots-of-self-driving-cars-theyre-driving-first-responders-nuts">aren't yet ready for public roads</a>. They've <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2023/08/cruise-waymo-autonomous-vehicle-robot-taxi-driverless-car-reports-san-francisco/">tallied 55 incidents where self-driving cars have gotten in the way of rescue operations</a> in just the past six months. </p>   <p>Those incidents include driving through yellow emergency tape, blocking firehouse driveways, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2023/05/waymo-cruise-fire-department-police-san-francisco/">running over fire hoses</a> and refusing to move for first responders. </p>   <h3>Autonomous vehicles are programmed to be overly conservative</h3>   <p>Ziwen Wan, a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at University of California, Irvine, has <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/autonomous-vehicles-can-be-tricked-dangerous-driving-behavior">studied why driverless cars may be acting this way</a>. He used open source data for his research, so his findings aren't based specifically on Cruise and Waymo. Wan found that ordinary objects on the road can lead to dangerous driving behavior. Part of this, he says, is because the cars are programmed to be overly conservative. </p>   <p>"The software can make the autonomous vehicle behave as conservatively as possible because a safety violation would be very serious," Wan says. "But this may lead to concerns on the other side, like in some cases, even though it's safe it will fail to drive normally."</p>   <p>That abnormal driving includes abrupt halts, swerves, erratic behavior or just stopping in the middle of the road. </p>   <p>"The traffic cone protest is an example of how things in the real world can really confound machines, even ones as sophisticated and finely tuned as this,"<strong> </strong>says<strong> </strong>Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington who <a href="https://www.margaretomara.com/">studies the tech industry</a>. "It's a reminder that in this very high-tech world, the most low-tech things can literally put a wrench in the machine."</p>   
   <p>Despite the bumps in the road, both Waymo and Cruise are rapidly expanding their robo-taxi programs throughout the U.S. Waymo is already giving rides in Phoenix and is testing with human safety drivers in Los Angeles and Austin. And Cruise is offering rides in Phoenix and Austin and testing in Dallas, Houston, Miami, Nashville and Charlotte.</p>   <p>Meanwhile, in San Francisco, members of Safe Street Rebel continue to go out at night and stalk the vehicles one cone at a time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://rmkit.dev/eink-is-so-retropunk/">https://rmkit.dev/eink-is-so-retropunk/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37272652">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’ve long been struggling to describe why e-ink is so much fun for me, but I
think I’ve finally realized what it is: <strong>e-ink is just so so so retropunk</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/8760cI9.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>An e-ink device is a hacker’s dream - or at least, this hacker’s dream.  They
are a return to the magical feeling of computers of the 80s and 90s. It’s a
world where Microsoft and Apple never existed and we don’t have to suffer with
abstractions on top of abstractions.  It’s DOS for the 2020s. It’s graphing
calculators for grown-ups.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>The e-ink devices I favor are low powered ARM devices running linux without a
display server or gigabytes of RAM. Let’s break down why that’s so awesome:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low Powered: They can last for weeks on a single charge</li>
  <li>ARM is a simple architecture with a low instruction count and even lower cost</li>
  <li>Linux: as much as I like it, Android is a complicated mess</li>
  <li>Apps are simple: they talk to the kernel to read input and draw directly to the framebuffer</li>
  <li>Low RAM and slow CPUs: There’s no room to build complicated stacks of software, which means no window managers, no browsers and definitely no electron apps</li>
</ul>

<p>As similar as they are to the computers of the early 90s, they are different in
some tangible ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The resolution is much higher than an old computer - The PPI is between 200 - 300</li>
  <li>All devices supports touch events, some even support a pen stylus</li>
  <li>They are super portable, weighing between 200 - 400 grams, with displays ranging from 6” to 10”</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-software">The Software</h2>

<p>Since the devices are niche, the software ecosystem is way more
<strong>homebrew</strong> (as in the Homebrew Computing Club): people write and share their
apps and the community is tight knit. The people who use eink devices are
enthusiasts: they’ve given up the joys of color displays to work on these
under-powered devices that are devoid of app stores, tracking pixels, pay to
play features and constant distractions. There’s no email on these devices,
there’s no chat or social networks, there’s only simple applications.</p>

<p>Don’t be fooled though: the device constraints lead to interesting and quirky
software. In the <a href="https://toltec-dev.org/">reMarkable eco-system</a>, there’s dozens of
applications, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>multi-tasking application launchers like <a href="https://github.com/Eeems/oxide/">oxide</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rmkit-dev/rmkit/tree/master/src/remux">remux</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/timower/rM2-stuff">terminal emulators</a></li>
  <li>an <a href="https://github.com/bkirwi/folly">interactive fiction interpreter</a></li>
  <li>an <a href="https://github.com/bkirwi/sill">experimental shell that you can write into</a></li>
  <li>alternative ebook readers like <a href="https://github.com/koreader/koreader/">koreader</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LinusCDE/plato/">plato</a></li>
  <li>a <a href="https://rmkit.dev/apps/sas">simple app script that follows the unix philosphy</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/LinusCDE/chessmarkable">a chess board</a></li>
  <li>even a <a href="https://github.com/LinusCDE/doomarkable">port of doom</a></li>
  <li>and so <a href="https://rmkit.dev/">much more</a> - like <a href="https://toltec-dev.org/stable/">much, much, more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Since eink is currently niche, it also means green fields: there are lots of
opportunities to write applications that fills out the ecosystem. In short, a
hacker’s playground.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h2>

<p>Convinced that you should hack on eink devices? Grab a reMarkable or Kobo and
get hacking ;) Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/hAKFTcuu">reMarkable discord
server</a> or browse the <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=247">Mobile Read Kobo
Forums</a>.</p>

<p>For reMarkable, the toltec repository is a good place to get started - one of
the maintainers, Eeems, <a href="https://eeems.website/toltec/">has written a great
tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>If you want more specific advice, feel free to directly <a href="https://rmkit.dev/about">get in touch</a></p>

<h2 id="why-write-a-post-now">Why write a post now?</h2>

<p>Several years ago, I started hacking on e-ink devices and had an enormous
amount of fun writing applications and seeing what others have built.
Unfortunately, I’ve had several false starts with writing about e-ink: whether
it was about what I’ve actually done, or the lessons learned along the way or
even a set of things to consider when developing e-ink apps, the posts would
lay half finished because they just never felt compelling - my enthusiasm for
e-ink just wasn’t coming through.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to push any of those posts to completion, I’ve decided to try
to articulate what is so cool about e-ink to me.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-hacker-unfriendly-devices">Appendix: Hacker unfriendly devices</h2>

<h4 id="kindles">Kindles</h4>

<p>The Kindle requires a jailbreak to use and is running a modified version of
Kindle Fire. The Kindle Scribe is still secured, though. For this reason, I don’t
particularly recommend the Kindle devices.</p>

<h4 id="onyx">Onyx</h4>

<p>In every eink thread that comes up, the Onyx is brought up as not following the
GPL: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/p9ztru/lets_help_onyx_become_a_better_company/">they use a modified linux kernel and haven’t published the source for it</a>.</p>

<h4 id="pine">Pine</h4>

<p>The Pine Note is cool and open, but it’s software is still in development. Use
only if you are willing to take on an <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/PineNote#State_of_the_software">early product aimed at early adopters and
developers</a> - In other words,
maybe the Pine Note is too hacker friendly.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once installed, run <code>fish</code> from your current shell to try fish out!</p>
<a name="user-content-dependencies"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<p dir="auto">Running fish requires:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>curses or ncurses (preinstalled on most *nix systems)</li>
<li>some common *nix system utilities (currently <code>mktemp</code>), in
addition to the basic POSIX utilities (<code>cat</code>, <code>cut</code>, <code>dirname</code>,
<code>ls</code>, <code>mkdir</code>, <code>mkfifo</code>, <code>rm</code>, <code>sort</code>, <code>tee</code>, <code>tr</code>,
<code>uname</code> and <code>sed</code> at least, but the full coreutils plus <code>find</code> and
<code>awk</code> is preferred)</li>
<li>The gettext library, if compiled with
translation support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The following optional features also have specific requirements:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>builtin commands that have the <code>--help</code> option or print usage
messages require <code>nroff</code> or <code>mandoc</code> for
display</li>
<li>automated completion generation from manual pages requires Python 3.5+</li>
<li>the <code>fish_config</code> web configuration tool requires Python 3.5+ and a web browser</li>
<li>system clipboard integration (with the default Ctrl-V and Ctrl-X
bindings) require either the <code>xsel</code>, <code>xclip</code>,
<code>wl-copy</code>/<code>wl-paste</code> or <code>pbcopy</code>/<code>pbpaste</code> utilities</li>
<li>full completions for <code>yarn</code> and <code>npm</code> require the
<code>all-the-package-names</code> NPM module</li>
<li><code>colorls</code> is used, if installed, to add color when running <code>ls</code> on platforms
that do not have color support (such as OpenBSD)</li>
</ul>
<a name="user-content-switching-to-fish"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Switching to fish</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you wish to use fish as your default shell, use the following
command:</p>
<pre>chsh -s /usr/local/bin/fish
</pre>
<p dir="auto"><code>chsh</code> will prompt you for your password and change your default
shell. (Substitute <code>/usr/local/bin/fish</code> with whatever path fish was
installed to, if it differs.) Log out, then log in again for the changes
to take effect.</p>
<p dir="auto">Use the following command if fish isn’t already added to <code>/etc/shells</code>
to permit fish to be your login shell:</p>
<pre>echo /usr/local/bin/fish | sudo tee -a /etc/shells
</pre>
<p dir="auto">To switch your default shell back, you can run <code>chsh -s /bin/bash</code>
(substituting <code>/bin/bash</code> with <code>/bin/tcsh</code> or <code>/bin/zsh</code> as
appropriate).</p>
<a name="user-content-building"></a>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2>
<a name="user-content-id1"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies</h3>
<p dir="auto">Compiling fish from a tarball requires:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>a C++11 compiler (g++ 4.8 or later, or clang 3.3 or later)</li>
<li>CMake (version 3.5 or later)</li>
<li>a curses implementation such as ncurses (headers and libraries)</li>
<li>PCRE2 (headers and libraries) - optional, this will be downloaded if missing</li>
<li>gettext (headers and libraries) - optional, for translation support</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Sphinx is also optionally required to build the documentation from a
cloned git repository.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, running the test suite requires Python 3.5+ and the pexpect package.</p>
<a name="user-content-dependencies-git-master"></a>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Dependencies, git master</h3>
<p dir="auto">Building from git master currently requires, in addition to the dependencies for a tarball:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Rust (version 1.67 or later)</li>
<li>libclang, even if you are compiling with GCC</li>
<li>an Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">fish is in the process of being ported to Rust, replacing all C++ code, and as such these dependencies are a bit awkward and in flux.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><a href="https://www.teamshares.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Teamshares</a> is a low-flying, New York-based startup with big ambitions to capitalize on an opportunity in plain sight: that of small businesses without a succession plan.</p>
<p>It’s not a small market. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small businesses represent 99.7% of U.S. employer firms and 64% of private-sector jobs. Meanwhile, just 15% or so of small business owners pass along their company to a family member, with many others simply closing up shop at some point.</p>
<p>With an aging population in the U.S., Teamshares is betting this market will grow even bigger, which is why since 2018, it has snapped up 84 small businesses from retiring owners. These owners like its pitch. Though Teamshares says that it sometimes pays below market price for a company, it installs a new president that it trains and grants 10% of the business’s stock to its employees. <span>Moreover</span>, it promises to increase those employees’ ownership to 80% within 20 years. It sounds almost valiant, like when KKR bought out a door company in 2015 and promised every employee a payout of at least $15,000 if the company met its targets when sold. When in 2022, KKR sold the company for 10 times what it paid, its 800 employees saw a payout of <a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-kkr-got-more-by-giving-ownership-to-the-factory-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$360 million</a>.</p>
<p>But Teamshares isn’t in the private equity business. It’s a fintech company that has raised $245 million in venture capital to date, including from QED Investors, Spark Capital, Union Square Ventures, Inspired Capital, Khosla Ventures and Slow Ventures. It has also secured another $150 million in debt.</p>
<p>Those backers aren’t funding Teamshares so that it can grow and resell the businesses it acquires. In fact, according to co-founder and CEO Michael Brown, Teamshares doesn’t want to sell the companies it is buying — ever. The plan instead is to generate revenue from a growing array of fintech products that it sells to the businesses it buys. Think insurance, think credit cards. If everything goes as planned, Teamshares will eventually replace the majority of vendors these companies use — and become a brand known to many others outside of its immediate sphere. Certainly, it’s among the more unique fintech models this reporter can recall. More below, edited for length.</p>
<p><strong>TC: Other than some exceptions like KKR, which is focused in part on employee ownership because owners tend to be better employees, I don’t know of another venture-backed company doing what you’re doing. How did you settle on this broader idea?</strong></p>
<p>MB:&nbsp; I spent the first seven years of my career in investment banking. And that’s where I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexeu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex Eu</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinshiiba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin Shiiba</a>, the other two founders. Kevin decided he wanted to join the tech industry very early [and joined the] coding bootcamp General Assembly; Alex and I went and bought one, and then eventually eight, small businesses. We transitioned from being financial spreadsheet people to being operators and later entrepreneurs; learning how to operate a businesses informs [our work] today.</p>
<p><strong>How did you exit those businesses?</strong></p>
<p>We still own the ones in Canada; they’re running themselves today. There’s a president, a vice president. They’re just sort of like a dormant legacy business, but they’ve started the employee ownership journey, too, and that’s continuing on.</p>
<p><strong>You make money off those businesses through dividends? Is this how you’ll make money at Teamshares?</strong></p>
<p>How Teamshares makes money is we buy businesses, we dilute ourselves voluntarily to get employee ownership jump-started. We [carve out] 10% for all the employees and an additional 5% for [a president who we hire to run each business], and that stock is a gift — it’s earned over time through service.</p>
<p>From a financial standpoint, we’re [structured] just like Berkshire Hathaway, so if we buy a business with $5 million in revenue, then that becomes our revenue the next day. We profit from the profits of the business that was acquired, proportionate to our ownership, and we sell our stock back over time to the companies until it becomes 80% employee owned. We also have new revenue streams that we’ve just started launching. We built a neobank, we’re soon to launch credit cards, and we’re building an insurance business as well, so there’s a secondary layer of financial products that will basically replace the vendors that the companies used to use.</p>
<p><strong>These products are going to be available exclusively to Teamshares companies or you start there and expand out?</strong></p>
<p>The hope is the latter. We only build something if a product doesn’t exist for our exact use case, which is some combination of really traditional small business or employee ownership. And there’s not a lot of stuff [out there]. When we set out, we didn’t think we’d build a neobank, but there just wasn’t something that existed to our satisfaction, in part because small businesses still unfortunately receive a lot of checks. But the hope would be that in the future — let’s call it in the next five years — we could scale up and open these products up and have small businesses generally get to know Teamshares.</p>
<p><strong>What do the companies you’ve acquired so far have in common?</strong></p>
<p>Where <em>we</em> have commonality in the companies is around employee ownership, financial education, the president program and financial infrastructure. So, we’re audited by KPMG, for example, and we help these companies go from mom-and-pop accounting to having real financial infrastructure and being able to produce statement financials every month that are in accordance with GAAP. But we really believe in the companies [operating as] independently as possible. We provide support, and we work closely with the presidents. But we don’t think that it’s a good idea to try and integrate all the companies.</p>
<p><strong>So you aren’t trying to roll up similar companies, or swaths of similar companies?</strong></p>
<p>There are some exceptions where, for example, we’ve been buying pizza shops in a state back East, and those are being integrated to create one larger company that’s going to create more employee ownership wealth than could a stand-alone set of pizza shops. We’re doing this again in pool maintenance, where a lot of the businesses are really [small] and actually [buying] a first one that’s small but big enough to support the cost of a president, and then you can add smaller ones. So there’s a roll-up-esque element of certain companies we work with, but in general, we think these are really high-quality businesses that can operate fairly independently and we actually make a very devout customer promise that the companies are going to become 80% employee owned, or never for sale again.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your investing criteria?</strong></p>
<p>There are over 40 specific industries [represented in Teamshares’ current portfolio], but they really fall into about six categories, which are business services, consumer services, distribution, manufacturing, restaurants, and retail. So they’re all traditional businesses that are, on average, 30 years old, with annual revenue of between $2 million and $10 million generally.</p>
<p>We have a belief that employee ownership works in every industry, and our actual final decision — amongst the 70,000 leads we get every year — is all done on a case-by-case basis. But we start off by filtering the companies on what we call our structural criteria. So is it a true retirement sale? Are the owners of that age? Are there two or more managers? Is there low customer concentration? Do the earnings show up on the tax returns?</p>
<p><strong>You’re planning to sell these companies your products. Are there other ways the companies in the Teamshares ecosystem can work together?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. We’re now getting to the size where we’re starting to organize the companies, around industry groups. So there’s talk of the restaurant companies all kind of banding together [toward the goal of] common purchasing. The presidents [sometimes] share knowledge about what’s the best sort of ERP system and other software to use? Then there’s other things that don’t make sense for us to build but we can arrange large, corporate vendor partnerships. So, for example, you know, lots of these companies need vehicles, so having a national account with one of the major vehicle lessors is going to make sense.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned Berkshire Hathaway early on. Is that what you aspire to build? Do you want Teamshares to go public?</strong></p>
<p>The most probable outcome is we go public, but there are ways to stay private, too. We do not plan to ever sell Teamshares; we would want it to be independent.</p>
<p>In terms of the Berkshire Hathaway piece, we subscribe to a lot of their philosophy about being very long-term minded and being pretty efficient in our underwriting and keeping things simple. But we’re not a one-for-one translation of the model. Their model is to have the permanent ownership forever, whereas our model has employee ownership as a twist, so we’re actually forgoing some amount of future growth by making employee ownership happen. And we believe that’s the right thing to do. And we believe the companies will be bigger and better for it.</p>
<p>Also Berkshire Hathaway can only buy companies that already have a CEO in place, whereas that’s not a luxury you can have in small business. We realized we had to build up a new generation of people, generally in their 30s and 40s, who were ready for something more entrepreneurial and ready for something really mission aligned. And so we recruit people from some really great companies — McKinsey, USAA, Tesla and Amazon — and train them to run these small businesses.</p>
<p><strong>How many employees do you have, and how big is your tech team?</strong></p>
<p>We have about 140 people altogether, and a 70-person tech team, so we’ve closed seven companies a month with two people. We’ve created a lot of leverage through building a lot of software for ourselves and for the companies.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) has officially gone into effect. Starting on August 25th, 2023, tech giants like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more must comply with sweeping legislation that holds online platforms legally accountable for the content posted to them.</p><p>Even though this new law was passed in the EU, we’ll likely see far-reaching global effects as companies adjust their policies to comply. Here’s what exactly the DSA does and how the EU plans on enforcing it.</p><p><h3>What is the Digital Services Act?</h3></p><p>The overarching goal of the DSA is to foster safer online environments. Under the new rules, online platforms must implement ways to prevent and remove posts containing illegal goods, services, or content while simultaneously giving users the means to report this type of content.</p><p>Additionally, the DSA bans targeted advertising based on a person’s sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, or political beliefs and puts restrictions on targeting ads to children. It also requires online platforms to provide more transparency on how their algorithms work. </p><p>The DSA carves out additional rules for what it considers “very large online platforms,” forcing them to give users the right to opt out of recommendation systems and profiling, share key data with researchers and authorities, cooperate with crisis response requirements, and perform external and independent auditing. </p><p>The European Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220701IPR34364/digital-services-landmark-rules-adopted-for-a-safer-open-online-environment">passed the DSA in July 2022</a>. While the EU doesn’t require smaller companies to comply with the DSA just yet, it asked very large online platforms to comply four months after their designation as such, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2413">which occurred in April</a>.</p><p><h3>Which online platforms are affected?</h3></p><p>The EU considers very large online platforms (or very large online search engines) as those with over 45 million monthly users in the EU. So far, the EU has designed 19 platforms and search engines that fall into that category, including the following:</p><div><ul><li>Alibaba AliExpress</li><li>Amazon Store</li><li>Apple App Store</li><li>Booking.com</li><li>Facebook</li><li>Google Play</li><li>Google Maps</li><li>Google Shopping</li><li>Instagram</li><li>LinkedIn</li><li>Pinterest</li><li>Snapchat</li><li>TikTok</li><li>Twitter</li><li>Wikipedia</li><li>YouTube</li><li>Zalando</li><li>Bing</li><li>Google Search</li></ul></div><p>The EU will require each of these platforms to update their user numbers at least every six months. If a platform has less than 45 million monthly users for an entire year, they’ll be removed from the list.</p><p><h3>What are online platforms doing to comply?</h3></p><p>Many of these companies have already outlined the ways in which they’re going to comply with the DSA. Here’s a brief overview of the most notable ones.</p><p><h4>Google</h4></p><p>While Google says it already complies with some of the policies envisioned by the DSA, including the ability to give YouTube creators to appeal video removals and restrictions, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23845117/google-expanding-ads-transparency-center-comply-eu-dsa">Google announced that it’s expanding</a> its Ads Transparency Center to meet the requirements outlined by the legislation.</p><p>The company also committed to expanding data access to researchers to provide more information about “how Google Search, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Play and Shopping work in practice.” It will also improve its transparency reporting and analyze potential “risks of illegal content dissemination, or risks to fundamental rights, public health or civic discourse.”</p><p><h4>Meta</h4></p><p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is working to expand its Ad Library, which currently compiles the ads shown on its platforms. The company will soon start displaying and archiving all the ads that target users in the EU while also including the parameters used to target the ads, as well as who was served the ad.</p><div><p>In June, Meta released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/29/23778068/meta-facebook-instagram-social-media-algorithms-ai-transparency">a lengthy report about how its algorithm works</a> across Facebook and Instagram as part of its push toward transparency. It will also start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841173/instagram-facebook-meta-chronological-feed-stories-reels-european-union-digital-services-act">allowing European users to view content chronologically on Reels</a>, Stories, and Search on both Facebook and Instagram — without being subject to its personalization engine.</p></div><p><h4>TikTok</h4></p><p>Similar to the measures Meta is rolling out, TikTok has also announced that it’s making its algorithm optional for users in the EU. When the algorithm is disabled, users will see videos from “both the places where they live and around the world” in their For You and Live feeds instead of videos based on personal interests. </p><p>It will also enable users to view content chronologically on their Following and Friends feeds. TikTok is making some changes to its advertising policies as well. For European users aged 13 to 17, TikTok will stop showing personalized ads based on their activity in the app.</p><p><h4>Snap</h4></p><p>Snapchat will also give users in the EU the option to opt out of personalized feeds on its Discover and Spotlight pages and <a href="https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/17338132910484-Personalisation-on-Snapchat?_ga=2.55027560.2100881955.1692971960-1974149196.1692971960">has also published reports</a> on how it ranks the posts on these feeds. The company has committed to providing users with more information about why their posts or account has been removed and will give them the tools they need to appeal the decision.</p><p>In addition, Snapchat will no longer serve personalized ads to European Snapchat users aged 13 to 17. It will also create an archive of targeted advertisements it shows in the EU and will give European Snapchat users over the age of 18 more control over the ads they see.</p><p><h3>What happens if these platforms don't comply?</h3></p><p>Online platforms that don’t comply with the DSA’s rules could see fines of up to 6 percent of their global turnover. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2348">According to the EU Commission</a>, the Digital Services Coordinator and the Commission&nbsp;will have the power to “require immediate actions where necessary to address very serious harms.” A platform continually refusing to comply could result in a temporary suspension in the EU.</p><p>The EU is already seeing some companies push back on the DSA. In July, Amazon filed a petition that asks the EU to reevaluate its classification as a very large online platform, claiming that it’s getting “unfairly singled out.” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/zalando-sues-eu-commission-over-landmark-online-content-rules-2023-06-27/">German retailer Zalando also filed a lawsuit</a> against the EU Commission, similarly claiming that it doesn’t meet the definition of a very large online platform.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://dbohdan.com/clean-mount-lists">https://dbohdan.com/clean-mount-lists</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37271611">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Default installations of Linux distributions mount more filesystems than they used to. This is because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device">loop devices</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups">cgroups</a>, and, in Ubuntu, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_(software)">snaps</a>. As a result, the output from GNU df(1) as well as from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Util-linux">lsblk(8) and mount(8)</a> is more difficult to understand at a glance.</p>
<p>It is possible to make the output of these commands more readable by removing some of the “noise” devices. The following is a list of command arguments that remove irrelevant devices. After the list, I show how to replace the default commands in <a href="https://fishshell.com/">fish</a>. You can adapt the replacement script for other shells.</p>
<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>
<nav id="TOC" role="doc-toc">
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#df">df</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#lsblk">lsblk</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#mount">mount</a>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#include-list">Include list</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#exclude-list">Exclude list</a>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#findmnt">findmnt instead of df and mount</a>
</li>
</ul>
</nav>
<h2 id="df">df</h2>
<p>GNU df(1) allows you to exclude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs">tmpfs</a> with a simple option. In Ubuntu 22.04, this removes <code>/dev/shm</code>, <code>/run</code>, <code>/run/user/*</code>, and other mount points from its output. In an improvement from Ubuntu 20.04, df(1) is already <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/+bug/1756595">patched</a> to exclude <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SquashFS">Squashfs</a> (snaps).</p>
<p>Command:</p>
<pre><code>df -x tmpfs</code></pre>
<p>The improvement on my system is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; df | wc -l
25
&gt; df -x tmpfs | wc -l
19</code></pre>
<h2 id="lsblk">lsblk</h2>
<p>The command lsblk(8) can exclude devices by major device type. Snaps are loopback devices. According to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/devices.txt"><code>devices.txt</code></a> in the Linux kernel admin guide, the device type for loopback devices is 7.</p>
<p>Command:</p>
<pre><code>lsblk -e 7</code></pre>
<p>Improvement:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; lsblk | wc -l
56
&gt; lsblk -e 7 | wc -l
28</code></pre>
<h2 id="mount">mount</h2>
<p>We can simplify the output of GNU mount(8) by either excluding certain filesystem types or only including certain filesystem types.</p>
<h3 id="include-list">Include list</h3>
<p>Example command:</p>
<pre><code>mount -l -t btrfs,fat,exfat,ext2,ext4,iso9660,ntfs3,ufs,vfat,xfs,zfs</code></pre>
<p>Choose the type based on what filesystems you work with. For a list of supported filesystem type, look in <code>/proc/filesystems</code> and <code>/lib/modules/"$(uname -r)"/kernel/fs/</code>.</p>
<h3 id="exclude-list">Exclude list</h3>
<p>This is a little more involved, since mount(8) seems to lack a built-in “exclude” option. We can filter the output by the type column with awk.</p>
<p>Example command:</p>
<pre><code>mount | awk '$5 !~ /(autofs|binfmt_misc|bpf|cgroup2|configfs|debugfs|devpts|devtmpfs|fuse|hugetlbfs|mqueue|nfsd|nsfs|proc|pstore|ramfs|rpc_pipefs|securityfs|squashfs|sysfs|tmpfs|tracefs)/'</code></pre>
<p>The improvement with the exclude list is,</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mount | wc -l
77
&gt; mount | awk '...' | wc -l
19</code></pre>
<h3 id="fish">fish configuration</h3>
<p>This configuration script replaces commands with wrappers that use arguments from the previous sections by default. They only use the arguments if you do not give arguments of your own. To ignore the wrapper and run, for example, <code>mount</code> without any arguments, use <code>command mount</code> or <code>mount --</code>.</p>
<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>
<pre><code>cd ~/.config/fish/conf.d/

<h2 id="findmnt">findmnt instead of df and mount</h2>
<p><a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/findmnt">findmnt(8)</a> from util-linux is an alternative to df(1) and mount(8) with better options for filtering. For example,</p>
<pre><code>findmnt --df --options rw --real</code></pre>
<p>produces output like <code>df -h</code>, but only for real and read-write filesystems.</p>
<p>Thanks to the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37271611">HN discussion thread</a> for suggesting findmnt(8) and the <code>--options rw --real</code> invocation.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Fresh from blowing up a small portion of Texas with Starship, SpaceX is once again being forced to focus on more earthly matters, like discriminatory hiring practices, in a lawsuit brought by the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1311656/dl?inline">complaint</a> [PDF] filed Wednesday through the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer, part of the department's Executive Office for Immigration Review, accuses SpaceX of discriminating against asylees and refugees and "routinely" discouraging people with this citizenship status against even applying for roles at the company.</p>
<p>We're all used to CEO Elon Musk saying things of dubious veracity as the owner of <span>Twitter</span> X, but in this case the DoJ claims that statements from both SpaceX and its boss were so wrong they broke federal law, specifically the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The rules stipulate that asylees and refugees cannot be discriminated against for their citizenship status in the process of applying for job.</p>

    

<p>SpaceX fell foul of the law, the DoJ alleges, because it repeatedly and incorrectly claimed it could only hire US citizens and lawful permanent residents, thereby discouraging asylees and refugees from even bothering. Between September 2018 and May 2022, it was accused of tracking applicants by citizen status and marking asylees and refugees as ineligible for employment under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).</p>

        


        

<p>Explaining why this was way off-piste, the DoJ said in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring">statement</a> yesterday: "Under these regulations, asylees, refugees, lawful permanent residents, US citizens and US nationals working at US companies can access export-controlled items without authorization from the US government. Therefore, these laws do not require SpaceX to treat asylees and refugees differently than US citizens or green card holders."</p>
<p>The DoJ added that asylees and refugees "undergo thorough vetting by the United States government. Under the INA, employers cannot discriminate against them in hiring, unless a law, regulation, executive order or government contract requires the employer to do so. In this instance, no law, regulation, executive order or government contract required or permitted SpaceX to engage in the widespread discrimination against asylees or refugees that the department's investigation found."</p>

        

<p>The complaint alleges that SpaceX's incorrect stance went right to the top, highlighting a number of times where Musk said that the working at the company was off-limits to anyone who wasn't a US citizen or lacked a green card.</p>
<p>On June 16, 2020, Musk posted on Twitter: "US law requires at least a green card to be hired at SpaceX, as rockets are considered advanced weapons technology."</p>
<p>It also said that during an international space conference in September 2016, "SpaceX's CEO stated the SpaceX had to comply with ITAR, which meant that a normal work visa is insufficient to work at SpaceX unless the company can obtain 'special permission from the Secretary of Defense or Secretary of State.' He then added that SpaceX is 'not allowed' to hire people who don't have a 'green card' and that 'unless [you] can somehow get a green card, we are legally prevented from hiring anyone.'"</p>

</ul>
<p>In an online video dating all the way back to 2012, the complaint quoted Musk as saying: "It's quite difficult for us to employ people that don't have a green card because of US ITAR rules." He added that his "first advice" to non-US citizens hoping for a job at SpaceX would be: "Do anything you can to get a green card."</p>
<p>The complaint also claimed that SpaceX's Vice President of Human Resources said on an online chat forum in 2016: "To comply with US government space technology export regulations including ITAR, applicants must generally be US citizens or lawful permanent residents."</p>

        

<p>The DoJ points out that not everyone working at SpaceX is a rocket scientist, also employing "welders, cooks, crane operators, baristas and dishwashers... The jobs at issue in the lawsuit are not limited to those that require advanced degrees."</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said: "Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law.</p>
<p>"Our investigation also found that SpaceX recruiters and high-level officials took actions that actively discouraged asylees and refugees from seeking work opportunities at the company.</p>
<p>"Asylees and refugees have overcome many obstacles in their lives, and unlawful employment discrimination based on their citizenship status should not be one of them. Through this lawsuit we will hold SpaceX accountable for its illegal employment practices and seek relief that allows asylees and refugees to fairly compete for job opportunities and contribute their talents to SpaceX's workforce."</p>
<p>The suit seeks "fair consideration and back pay for asylees and refugees who were deterred or denied employment at SpaceX due to the alleged discrimination," civil penalties to be determined in court, and policy changes to ensure the company does not flout the INA again.</p>
<p>It could be that SpaceX has been erring on the side caution when it comes to ITAR because it has a number of lucrative contracts with NASA and the US Department of Defense. Accidental violation of export control laws and regulations could indeed put such contracts at risk.</p>
<p>However, by law, asylees and refugees should never fall under these restrictions, thus the DoJ believes SpaceX has, for lack of a better term, done goofed.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> has asked SpaceX to comment. ®</p>
