        <p>A <a href="https://assets.anthropic.com/m/ec212e6566a0d47/original/Disrupting-the-first-reported-AI-orchestrated-cyber-espionage-campaign.pdf">report</a> was recently published by an AI-research company called <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>.
They are the ones who notably created <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Claude</a>, an AI-assistant for coding. Personally, I don’t use it but that is besides the point.
Before we start, it’s important to say I don’t have anything against them, or AI in general. I do have <a href="https://djnn.sh/posts/on-llms/">some documented concerns</a> but I am not “Anti-AI”, or whatever.
Rather than the technology itself, it’s the industry’s perception of it, and the way it is inserted everywhere, even when unnecessary that bothers me. However, that too is a bit besides the point.</p>
<p>Today, I wanted to discuss the Paper (or Report, however you want to call it) that was recently published by them.
Looking at the executive summary, this paragraph jumps out immediately.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In mid-September 2025, we detected a highly sophisticated cyber espionage operation
conducted by a Chinese state-sponsored group we’ve designated GTG-1002 that
represents a fundamental shift in how advanced threat actors use AI. Our investigation
revealed a well-resourced, professionally coordinated operation involving multiple
simultaneous targeted intrusions. The operation targeted roughly 30 entities and our
investigation validated a handful of successful intrusions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extremely interesting for many reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthropic seemingly disrupted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">APT</a>’s campaign, though a number of companies and government entities were affected,</li>
<li>This highly-advanced APT doesn’t use its own infra, but rather relies on Claude to coordinate its automation (??? Why, though ?),</li>
<li>I assume they run exploits and custom tools ? If so, what are these ?</li>
<li>Anthropic was able to attribute this attack to a Chinese-affiliated state-sponsored group.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re like me, you then eagerly read the rest of the paper, hoping to find clues and technical details on the TTPs (Tactics, Techniques and Procedures), or IoCs (Indicators of Compromise) to advance the research.
However, the report very quickly falls flat, which sucks.</p>
<h2 id="where-are-the-iocs-mrclaude-">where are the IoCs, Mr.Claude ?</h2>
<p>The primary goal of a Threat-Intelligence report such as this one would be to inform other parties of a new type of attack, and artefacts they might use to discover the attack on their network.
This is typically done by sharing domain-names linked with the campaign, MD5 or SHA512 hashes you could look for on Virus Exchange websites such as <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/">VirusTotal</a>, or other markers that would help you verify that your
networks are safe. As an example, <a href="https://cert.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/CERTFR-2023-CTI-009.pdf">here</a> is the French CERT sharing (in French, but an English version is available too) about APT28’s TTPs.</p>
<p>We can see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&amp;CK</a> used to determine what are the techniques used (eg: Account Manipulation, Antivirus evasion, etc.),</li>
<li>Emails used for phishing, originating IPs and even date when these emails are sent,</li>
<li>Tooling (VPN software, but also what kind of tools) used by the APT,</li>
<li>a set of recommandations</li>
</ul>
<p>This report is just one I picked randomly by skimming through their publications. Any serious CERT or Threat-Intel company would publish things in the same fashion, because this is the industry standard.
These publications are made public to inform Security Operation Centers around the world about how to detect and prevent those attacks.</p>
<h2 id="poc--gtfo">PoC || GTFO</h2>
<p>In this case, none of the these markers are present in the report. In fact, not a whole lot of the information is verifiable, which is another problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The human operator tasked instances of Claude Code to operate in groups as autonomous penetration testing orchestrators and agents, with the threat actor able to leverage AI to execute 80-90% of tactical operations independently at physically impossible request rates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This figure (80-90%) is not verifiable either. How do we know this is actually the case ?
I have no doubt so-called Autonomous agents are being used in these campaigns, in some capacity. However this report clearly states that Autonomous Agents perform active exploitation, and even data exfiltration.</p>
<p>What kind of tooling is used ? What kind of information has been extracted ? Who is at risk ? How does a CERT identifies an AI agent in their networks ?
None of these questions are answered. It’s not like Anthropic doesn’t have access to this data, since they claim they were able to stop it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upon receiving authorization from the human operators, Claude executed systematic
credential collection across targeted networks. This involved querying internal services,
extracting authentication certificates from configurations, and testing harvested
credentials across discovered systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How ? Did it run Mimikatz ? Did it access Cloud environments ? We don’t even know what kind of systems were affected.
There is no details, or fact-based evidence to support these claims or even help other people protect their networks.</p>
<p>The report goes on to claim that upon detection, the accounts were closed and implemented “enhancements”, and then drops this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We notified relevant authorities and industry partners, and shared information with impacted entities where appropriate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is that even supposed to mean ? You claim your agents were able to find exploitable vulnerabilities in multiple services.
Were these patched ? What about the extracted data ? What about the affected people ? Do you care about this at all ?</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">final thoughts</h2>
<p>Look, is it very likely that Threat Actors are using these Agents with bad intentions, no one is disputing that. But this report does not meet the standard of publishing for serious companies.
The same goes with research in other fields. You <strong>cannot</strong> just claim things and not back it up in any way, and we <strong>cannot</strong> as an industry accept that it’s OK for companies to release this.</p>
<p>There seem to be a pattern for Tech Companies (especially in AI, but they’re not the only culprits) out there to just announce things, generate hype and then under-deliever.
Just because it works with VCs doesn’t mean it should work with us. We should, as an industry, expect better.</p>
<p>For instance, it attributes the attacks to a Chinese State-affiliated (!!!) group, but does not go on to give any details.
Which APT is it ? What helped you determine this ?</p>
<p>Attribution is a <strong>very</strong> serious matter, with sometimes diplomatical implications. You can’t just go on and point the finger at anyone and expect people to believe you for no reason.
In a time of increasing tensions between the West and China, it does not seem like the smart thing to do at all. Frankly, I don’t understand who was stupid enough to approve this to be released.
For all we know, the “advanced threat actors” they’re talking about here could just be script kiddies trying to automate <code>ffuf</code> and <code>sqlmap</code> commands.</p>
<p>If they’re going to release IoCs and proof of everything, I’d be happy to share them here. But until them, I will say this: this paper would not pass any review board.
It’s irresponsible at best to accuse other countries of serious things without backing it up. Yes, I am aware that Chinese-linked APTs are out there and very aggressive, and Yes, I am aware that
Threat Actors misuse LLMs all the time, but that is besides the point. We need fact-based evidence. We need to be able to verify all this. Otherwise, anyone can say anything, on the premise that it’s
probably happening. But that’s not good enough.</p>
<p>So if the report does not give any details on TTPs and detections, what was the purpose of this report exactly ?</p>
<p>There is a paragraph at the end that seem to give us a clue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cybersecurity community needs to assume a fundamental change has occurred: Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense in areas like SOC automation, threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response and build experience with what works in their specific environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Security teams should experiment with applying AI for defense”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Hmm. But who sells this kind of AI they’re talking about here ?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this shit is a pathetic excuse of a report and should not be taken as anything else than a shameless attempt at selling more of their product.
This is shameful and extremely unprofessional, at best. This disregard for basics ethics in order to sell just a little bit more make me want to never use their product, ever.</p>
<p>Do better.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p>Two things happened for me over the holidays five years ago: I went to rehab, and I acquired a cyberstalker. These were not entirely independent events. The stalker was someone in India who’d started following me when I was playing poker, who came to believe we had a close personal relationship and that my tweets were coded messages to him. When I stopped tweeting for two months, he became convinced something had happened to me, so he tracked down my email and phone number and started spamming me with messages demanding to know where I was.</p><p>By the time I realized this was happening, he’d already escalated to the point that I was clearly never going to respond. I started blocking him on different platforms, but he’d just create another account or phone number, or find some other way in. He messaged me dozens of times a day, alternating between threats and pleas. When he reached out to my company six months later to apply for a job, I learned his real name and used it to track down an old friend of his to ask for help — but the friend told me he was afraid to intervene because he didn’t want to become a target himself. I decided that there was nothing I could do from the other side of the world, and resigned myself to waiting him out.</p><p>Only he never tired. Years went by and I never responded, and still he messaged me multiple times a day. The messages became more disturbing, more pornographic, more violent. He told me he would come find me in Berkeley and hurt me. Finally, last November, in the span of a few days, he sent me an image of his brand new passport and a visa application, which he said he planned to use to travel here, and successfully extorted money from my brother by spoofing my phone number and pretending to have kidnapped me.</p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Useful Fictions! This post is public so feel free to share it.</p><p data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/maybe-youre-not-actually-trying?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p></div><p><em>Enough! </em><span>I thought, and snapped into action. Except that I didn’t. Instead, I curled up in a ball and cried, and told friends who suggested contacting the police that there was no point, that no one would be able to help as long as I was here and he was in India.</span></p><p>But my husband was insistent that there had to be a better answer, and asked me to let him intervene on my behalf. In short order, he was in contact with the FBI, the US consulate in India, and, with the help of his friend Govind, who has family there, the local police where the stalker lived. Within months, the situation had resolved, and he will never set foot on American soil.</p><p>One of the interesting things about all of this is that there was nothing particularly inventive about the strategies my husband deployed. They were more or less exactly the strategies I would have come up with if I’d been put in charge of a similar situation in someone else’s life. Why did it take another person getting involved for me to realize I wasn’t Actually Trying?</p><p>I think what happened is this: When the stalker entered my life, I was at a low point in personal capacity — broke, alone, addled, etc. My approach towards him at that point (ignore, hoping he’d stop) was the only one that seemed available given my spiritual and psychological resources at the time. But my orientation to the problem became fixed in time at that point of low agency, and it never occurred to me to revisit it as my capacity for action increased.</p><p><span>I think we are all like this. </span><strong>People are not just high-agency or low-agency in a global sense, across their entire lives. Instead, people are selectively agentic.</strong></p><p>Let’s say that life is divided up into three theaters: work, relationships with others (all kinds) and relationship to self (physical health, introspection, emotional development, all of it). I think it’s the rule, rather than the exception, that people are stuck at an earlier stage of development in at least one area. There is one theater of life where they’re not Actually Trying — where they’re approaching serious problems with the resourcefulness of a teenager, though they are now capable adults.</p><p>In my particular corner of the world, there are tons of high-achievers in work. These are ingenious people shaping the world through innovations in science, technology, and policy. But many of them haven’t applied the same ingenuity to their interior experience or relationships. These are people who could successfully launch a product in a foreign country with little instruction, but who complain that there aren’t any fun people to meet on the dating apps.</p><p><strong>It seems like, by default, you are stuck with whatever level of resourcefulness you brought to a problem the first time you encountered it and failed to fix it.</strong></p><p>Let’s say you tried therapy when you were 20, and it didn’t help with your high levels of anxiety. When you think about your anxiety, as the years go by, you think, “hard problem, tried the main solution, didn’t work out.” Perhaps you just accept anxiety as a fixed trait, and your friends playfully rib you about it, which is nice but makes it seem even more like a static part of your identity. But you’re not 20 anymore. You’re, say, a 32-year-old CTO, and when a vital project at your startup doesn’t respond to your first approach, you vigorously try another, and another, trying to learn from every failure. That same persistence and curiosity don’t get applied to the anxiety that makes you suffer at work, though.</p><p><span>You don’t think, </span><em>oh, I could probably</em><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Check on my nutrition and sleep, in a serious way</p></li><li><p>Look into supplements and medication</p></li><li><p>Throw some resources at improving my rest and recovery</p></li><li><p>Ask all of my friends about the best anxiety treatments they’ve ever heard of, or the best coaches/therapists they’ve ever worked with</p></li><li><p>Research any emerging therapies designed for people like me</p></li></ul><p><span>Instead of doing those things, you just put up with it. Or, worse, you fight through your anxiety using an earlier solution that required willpower, and the exertion of willpower makes you feel like you’re trying. </span><strong>But the feeling of effort doesn’t mean that you’re Actually Trying.</strong></p><p><span>There is a relevant concept from Alexander Technique that I love, “faulty sensory appreciation,” which I learned about from </span><a href="https://expandingawareness.org/" rel="">Michael Ashcroft</a><span>. The concept is that habitual tension distorts your sensory impressions—rigid stillness via bodily tension starts to feel like “good posture,” whereas relaxed uprightness feels strange, to the extent you might feel like your back is at a weird angle when you’re actually standing up tall. The right way feels like the wrong way. Apparently, this is demonstrated by having Alexander students lie in a position where your legs tell you that you shouldn’t be able to stand up — and then the instructor says, “by the way, you can stand up from here,” and you do.</span></p><p><span>Similarly, people who are being selectively agentic often have a kind of faulty sensory appreciation. Perhaps relationships </span><em>feel hard </em><span>for you, they take willpower, so it’s tempting to believe that you’re Actually Trying, that you’ve brought the full weight of your genius to bear on the problem. You might even take some pride in the struggle. Like rigid posture, the strain feels like correctness. But struggling is not evidence that you’ve tried everything. To the contrary, the continuous need for willpower may be the sign of a badly-engineered life.</span></p><p><span>I’d recommend assuming there’s some area of your life where you are, without realizing it, frozen in time, and that locating it matters quite a bit. Look across the three theaters of your life: work, relationships, and self-relationship, and take note of the biggest issues you face. Know that you might be looking for something that doesn’t feel like an </span><em>issue </em><span>— it might just feel like sadness or anger</span><em>, </em><span>like the sadness of not being seen, or the frustration of not feeling like your work is meaningful. Once you’ve surfaced something, ask yourself: Have I done my best to come up with a set of potential solutions, using all the resources I have? Am I doing as well by myself as I would by any friend who came to me with the same problem? How do I know I’m Actually Trying?</span></p><p><em><strong><a href="https://mailchi.mp/44578760e686/book-preorder-signup" rel="">Sign up to be notified</a><span> when my book, You Can Just Do Things, is available for purchase.</span></strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/2025-hyundai-ioniq-5-n-review-a-racing-sim-you-can-drive-on-the-road" target="_blank">2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N</a> owner was venting on Reddit recently about not being able to change his brake pads without specialized computer equipment. It sounds insane, but this is what new-car ownership is like in 2025. We did some digging and made contact with <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/category/hyundai-news" target="_blank">Hyundai</a> to understand the situation and break it down for you—it’s a frustrating one.</p>



<p>Having to talk to computers to fix a car isn’t necessarily unique to the Korean automaker, but I fell into a rabbit hole of Hyundai maintenance research here, so that’ll be our focus for the moment.</p>



<p>Context for casual readers: Brake pad and rotor replacements are super basic car maintenance. You won’t need to do the job nearly as often on an electric car (thanks to regenerative braking), but even EV pads don’t last forever. On most cars, part of the job involves disconnecting or retracting the parking brake, which usually grabs the rear wheels. Many modern cars, and all EVs, have an electronic parking brake controlled by a computer signal, rather than a manually adjustable nut-and-cable situation. This is what sparked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5N/comments/1ojjp6m/hyundai_declares_war_on_right_to_repair/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Redditor u/SoultronicPear’s justifiable frustration</a>.</p>



<p>One more piece of stage-setting: Since electronic parking brakes are indeed common, many readily available diagnostic tools (pretty basic OBD scanners) can issue a retract-brake command to a car’s ECU. Still, you do need one with bi-directional test functionality. Remember that point—it will become significant again in a few paragraphs.</p>

<figcaption>Wondering if your car has an electronic parking brake or a cable one? It’s very easy to tell—if you’ve got a button or switch (left), it’s electronic. Parking brakes with big, satisfying handles (like on the right) are mechanical. <em>stock.adobe.com</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Apparently, no cheap scanner option worked on the original Reddit poster’s Ioniq 5 N. That led them on a journey of attempting to access commercial-grade car-repair gear, which was ultimately fruitless.</p>



<p>You can access a Hyundai EV’s diagnostic brain using the brand’s proprietary dealership hardware and software (it’s called GDS, and it is publicly buyable but <a href="https://oemdiagnostictools.com/hyundai-gds-kds-dealer-diagnostic-tool/?setCurrencyId=1&amp;sku=GDSM-CPKITK&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=17303113625&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACJ-HcmF-xGsDbkCjbcZhnreKKPE9" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">costs about six grand</a>) or a third-party aftermarket system running a J2534 program. J2534 is an interface standard <a href="https://www.sae.org/standards/j2534-1_5_00-recommended-practice-pass-thru-vehicle-programming" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">designed by the SAE</a> and <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2003/06/27/03-14461/control-of-air-pollution-from-motor-vehicles-and-new-motor-vehicle-engines-revisions-to-regulations" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">mandated by the EPA</a> that basically ensures ECUs from different car brands can speak the same language for the sake of independent repair shops.</p>

<p>Hyundai supports J2534 and <a href="https://hyundaitechinfo.com/external/files/j2534_diagnostics_and_reprogramming/J2534_Diagnostics.pdf?v=20251022" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">recommends</a> one of three machines for talking to its cars: <a href="https://opusivs.com/product/cardaq-plus-3-kit/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">CarDAQ Plus 3</a> (about $2,000), <a href="https://www.bosch-mobility.com/en/solutions/diagnostics/vehicle-communication-interface/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">MTS 6531</a> (also about $2,000), and <a href="https://www.dgtech.com/d-bridge-pro/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">d-briDGe PRO</a> (about $800). “…under no circumstances do we recommend the use of a non-approved J2534 device,” the company states. You would then also need a subscription to Hyundai’s J2534 Diagnostic Tool Software, which costs $60 a week (or less over longer time blocks). All this info is in .PDFs linked from <a href="https://hyundaitechinfo.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai’s tech portal</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, after spending about $2,000 on tools, you should be able to service your own Hyundai Ioniq brakes, but if you’re a DIYer, you still can’t. Written in red at the top of one of Hyundai’s many tech documents is this: “Access to Bi-Directional Tests and Special Functions require Diagnostic Professional or Vehicle Security Professional credential from NASTF.”</p>



<p><a href="https://wp.nastf.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">NASTF</a> is the National Automotive Service Task Force. It exists “to identify and resolve gaps in service information, tool information, and training” between OEMs and independent shops (cool idea). It’s also the arbiter of things like lock coding and car credential management. To get scan-tool validation as a member, you need to be a professional mechanic.</p>



<p>And with that final roadblock, we can confirm that, no, a DIYer can not do their own brakes on a Hyundai Ioniq 5 N.</p>



<p>I’m guessing most of you reading this will now have the same thought I did—it does seem smart to have some regulation on sensitive data like the codes to your car locks, but what the heck, you should be able to do brake pads on a car you own. Or as Randy Marsh would have put it:<em> “I’m sorry, I thought this was America!”</em></p>

<p>Naturally, I also dropped Hyundai a note about this directly. Here’s what the automaker told us:</p>



<p>“Hyundai is committed to supporting both our dealer network and independent repair facilities with safe, secure, and accessible service solutions. For vehicles equipped with electronic parking brakes, including the Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 5 N, the official repair procedure requires placing the rear calipers in service mode using either our Global Diagnostic System (GDS) or the J2534 application. This ensures proper functionality and customer safety. Hyundai recently expanded access through an update to our J2534 application, enabling aftermarket users to perform functions previously restricted by the GDS secure gateway. While authentication through NASTF is required for sensitive operations, this step helps maintain security and accountability. Our official dealer tool (GDS) is also available for purchase by anyone.</p>



<p>Hyundai is actively exploring ways to make routine maintenance easier for all customers while upholding safety standards.</p>



<p>“We appreciate the interest in DIY repairs and will continue working toward solutions that balance convenience with security.”</p>

See that little hook I put an orange arrow pointed at? That’s the parking brake engager.

Modern cars have the same functionality, but you can’t mess with it without computer control. <em>stock.adobe.com</em> </figcaption></figure>



<p>So after all that, we can address the Reddit thread title “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ioniq5N/comments/1ojjp6m/hyundai_declares_war_on_right_to_repair/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Hyundai declares WAR on Right to Repair</a>” as technically incorrect. Right-to-repair <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/technology-and-communication/right-to-repair-2023-legislation" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">legislation</a> prevents product manufacturers from hiding technology behind proprietary diagnostic tools, and this stuff is not restricted to the brand’s own equipment. So, technically, I think the company’s in the clear on the rules as-written. We can also add a layer of clarification to the <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/11/ioniq-5-n-owner-says-hyundai-wont-even-let-you-change-your-brake-pads/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Carscoops</em></a> post on this that was headlined as “Apparently You Need Hyundai’s Permission To Change Your Own Brakes.” It’s not Hyundai’s permission you need, it’s the NASTF’s.</p>



<p>However, obviously, both <em>Carscoops </em>and the guy on Reddit were totally right in principle. A car repair task that has historically been totally DIY’able in a driveway is now relegated to shop-only because of technology. And that’s not good.</p>



<p>We focused on Hyundai here because this particular Reddit thread caught my eye and sent me on a research quest about this particular brand, but the Korean automaker is hardly the only company making it hard to mess with modern cars.</p>



<p>I understand, and even appreciate, automakers wanting to be careful with things like lock and engine-starting encryption. You definitely don’t want anybody to be able to download your car keys and make off with your vehicle, or do worse. But there’s got to be a better middle-ground than this. People should have unfettered access to the cars (and tractors, and tools) they own, plain and simple.</p>



<p>One last note: For anyone who found this article because you, too, are trying to get a modern car’s electronic brake to release for service but aren’t having luck … I did find <a href="https://epbrt.242925.xyz/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">this one tool</a> that might be able to override the existing software. But I’m making no endorsement of it whatsoever—I’ve never used it and have no idea if it works or if using it might trigger any unintended consequences. Use at your own risk (but report back in the comments if you’ve tried it).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="user-content-outline-text-description">
<p>IDEmacs aims to be a set of Emacs configurations which provide an out-of-the-box experience similar (if not identical) to popular GUI IDEs and editors.</p>
<p>
It is aimed at…</p>
<ol>
<li>Programmers coming to Emacs from other IDEs, or even first-time programmers familiar with only office applications.</li>
<li>
<p>Beginner Common Lisp and Scheme programmers, who need the functionality of Emacs (Sly/Geiser + structural editing) without having to perform unnecessary setup and without dealing with an alien style of keybindings. In other words, similar to <a href="https://portacle.github.io/" rel="nofollow">Portacle</a> or <a href="https://elephly.net/guile-studio/" rel="nofollow">Guile Studio</a>.<sup><a id="user-content-footnote-reference-1" href="#user-content-footnote-1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>Some may say that we should improve support for Common Lisp and Scheme in other editors and IDEs instead. Still others may say that we should work on a better Lisp IDE than Emacs instead (such as Second Climacs or Lem). All great points. IDEmacs is just a band-aid for the present situation, where Emacs + Sly/Geiser is the best Lisp/Scheme IDE.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Non-programmers who want a fully-featured Org, Markdown, or LaTeX editor with idiomatic shortcuts and mouse-friendly GUI.</li>
</ol>
<p>It provides…</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>GUI and mouse support</strong>, in addition to a keyboard-driven interface.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike most starter kits, we do not hide GUI elements by default.</li>
<li>
<p>We support configuration via the <code>custom</code> GUI, not just Elisp</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting GUI and <code>custom</code> means we cannot use <code>straight</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If resources allow, we may implement new GUIs in Emacs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keybindings that follow popular GUI and IDE conventions.</strong> <sup><a id="user-content-footnote-reference-2" href="#user-content-footnote-2" rel="nofollow">2</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>CUA mode is just the start - much more keybinding configuration is needed to provide an unsurprising experince. And that's before we even get to the IDE-specific keybindings.</li>
<li>This excludes starter kits that use Evil by default, such as Spacemacs or Doom.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A fully-featured, fast, and configuration-free Emacs experience</strong>, like any starter kit/distro.</p>
<ul>
<li>The configuration uses idiomatic Elisp and contains a generous amount of comments, valuable to anyone interested in learning to configure Emacs using Elisp.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Perfectly imitating the GUIs and subtle behaviour differences of IDEs is desirable, but not top priority. Given our limited resources, we aim for "good enough".</p>
<p>
We hope this gives new users a comfortable starting point, and make them more likely to stick around to discover the possibilities of Emacs' malleability, rather than being driven off by the default experience.</p>

<p>
Currently, it brings together -</p>
<ol>
<li>VSCode Dark Plus theme</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs" rel="nofollow">Treemacs</a> for the sidebar file browser ("Explorer")</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ema2159/centaur-tabs/" rel="nofollow">Centaur Tabs</a> for the tab bar</li>
<li><code>breadcrumb</code> to show file paths as breadcrumbs</li>
<li><code>idle-highlight-mode</code> to automatically highlight occurrences of the symbol at point</li>
<li>Emulation of most keybindings listed in the "General", "Basic Editing", "Rich Languages Editing", and "Multi-cursor and selection" sections of the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf" rel="nofollow">VSCode keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet</a>.</li>
<li>All editing packages required for emulation, including <code>whole-line-or-region</code>, <code>expand-region</code>, <code>multiple-cursors</code>, and <code>smartparens</code></li>
<li><code>vc</code> and <code>magit</code> for version control</li>
<li><code>diff-hl</code> and <code>blamer</code> to show in-buffer version control information</li>
<li>A comprehensive collection of completion packages - <a href="https://github.com/minad/vertico" rel="nofollow">Vertico</a>, <code>orderless</code>, <a href="https://github.com/minad/consult/" rel="nofollow">Consult</a>, <code>marginalia</code>, and <code>company</code>.</li>
<li>Lisp editing packages - <code>sly</code>, <code>geiser</code>, and <code>adjust-parens</code> (similar to Parinfer)</li>
<li><code>eat</code> for terminals</li>
<li>Sensible Emacs defaults, and other goodies - <code>org-superstar</code>, <code>pdf-tools</code>, <code>undo-tree</code>, <code>helpful</code>, <code>rainbow-mode</code>, …</li>

From the author -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I created this abomination so I could learn Lisp without having to worry too much about learning Emacs. It was originally envisaged for me to use and then switch off as I learned Emacs. But I actually liked it better and now it is my main editor.</p>
<p>
Mousemacs works pretty much like Sublime Text or Visual Studio Code out of the box. But it has the full power of Emacs underneath. All I did was take all the most useful Emacs packages and wrap them in a mouse friendly distribution. It is not perfect and certainly not for everyone, but it might be useful for some. It comes with a simple plain theme but it is still Emacs.</p>

<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Caution</p><p dir="auto"><strong>You must have a rooted device with Xposed to use LibrePods on Android.</strong> This is due to a <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/371713238" rel="nofollow">bug in the Android Bluetooth stack</a>. Please upvote the issue by clicking the '+1' icon on the IssueTracker page.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are <strong>no exceptions</strong> to the root requirement until Google merges the fix.</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">Until then, you must xposed. I used to provide a non-xposed method too, where the module used overlayfs to replace the bluetooth library with a locally patched one, but that was broken due to how various devices handled overlayfs and a patched library. With xposed, you can also enable the DID hook enabling a few extra features.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bluetooth DID (Device Identification) Hook</h2><a id="user-content-bluetooth-did-device-identification-hook" aria-label="Permalink: Bluetooth DID (Device Identification) Hook" href="#bluetooth-did-device-identification-hook"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Turns out, if you change the manufacturerid to that of Apple, you get access to several special features!</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Multi-device Connectivity</h3><a id="user-content-multi-device-connectivity" aria-label="Permalink: Multi-device Connectivity" href="#multi-device-connectivity"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Upto two devices can be simultaneously connected to AirPods, for audio and control both. Seamless connection switching. The same notification shows up on Apple device when Android takes over the AirPods as if it were an Apple device ("Move to iPhone"). Android also shows a popup when the other device takes over.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Accessibility Settings and Hearing Aid</h3><a id="user-content-accessibility-settings-and-hearing-aid" aria-label="Permalink: Accessibility Settings and Hearing Aid" href="#accessibility-settings-and-hearing-aid"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Accessibility settings like customizing transparency mode (amplification, balance, tone, conversation boost, and ambient noise reduction), and loud sound reduction can be configured.</p>
<p dir="auto">All hearing aid customizations can be done from Android, including setting the audiogram result. The app doesn't provide a way to take a hearing test because it requires much more precision. It is much better to use an already available audiogram result.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enable these features, enable App Settings -&gt; <code>act as Apple Device</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A few notes</h4><a id="user-content-a-few-notes" aria-label="Permalink: A few notes" href="#a-few-notes"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">Due to recent AirPods' firmware upgrades, you must enable <code>Off listening mode</code> to switch to <code>Off</code>. This is because in this mode, louds sounds are not reduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you have take both AirPods out, the app will automatically switch to the phone speaker. But, Android might keep on trying to connect to the AirPods because the phone is still connected to them, just the A2DP profile is not connected. The app tries to disconnect the A2DP profile as soon as it detects that Android has connected again if they're not in the ear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">When renaming your AirPods through the app, you'll need to re-pair them with your phone for the name change to take effect. This is a limitation of how Bluetooth device naming works on Android.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you want the AirPods icon and battery status to show in Android Settings app, install the app as a system app by using the root module.</p>

I try not to write anything even vaguely political on this blog because we have a variety of views on a variety of subjects and no one is here for that. We can all enjoy our geriatric little silicon artifacts together regardless of your electoral persuasion. But I was hopping mad this week, and the reason is actually on-topic, because I got hit with US Customs tariffs close to double the cost of the vintage items I was ordering and more than the items were worth. This eventually got straightened out, but it wouldn't have happened without my complaint and some time on the phone.
</p><p>
Although we make regular trips down under, your humble author is based in California and so is the Floodgap computer lab. For newly manufactured items and parts it has generally been my policy to buy parts from United States sellers even prior to the tariffs, mostly because that gets around various irregularities and it arrives more quickly. If they're going to drop-ship then it's their problem, not mine, because they advertised it was already here. Since such items are typically newly produced, the current tariffs would logically apply and this policy thus has the additional benefit of me not having to deal with that directly: any tariff should already have been paid to get them States-side.
</p><p>
But for NOS and used parts, especially if you are a collector like I am for certain systems, you buy where you can find them. Coincidentally I wanted to buy a second Apple Network Server logic board since my ANS 700 is acting a little weird (don't say caps) and I still want a good spare for the ANS 500. These don't exactly grow on trees but, as it turns out, the seller I bought my current spare logic board from (pre-tariffs) had another in stock. The logic board doesn't come with the regular ANS AIX ROM SIMM nor cache, so we'll want one each of those just in case, and he also had an Apple BTO Twin Turbo video card (I believe originally for the Power Macintosh 9500) which might also be nice for one of the other beige PCI Macs. These are all new old stock items in their Apple Service packaging because obviously Apple hasn't made nor sold any of these parts in decades. Per the seller, they came from the teardown of new machines which Apple was unable to sell and got turned into official surplus new stock. The seller is in an European Union country, so we're not talking some shady Shenzhen shop operating off an alley liftgate. (I'm not naming the seller because none of this is his fault and I'm sure he'd not like to be contacted about this.)
</p><p>
The items came to €296.00, about US$355 at the spot exchange rate, plus €48.10 for UPS shipping. This would have been well-under the prior <i>de minimis</i> exemption even with the shipping rolled in. We had to do UPS because his particular country's postal service limits shipment value to the United States to US$100 due to the tariffs, causing him to spend a substantial amount of time at the UPS drop-off depot and on the paperwork, which was way more than he was required to do and I very much appreciate. For any import you need to come up with a Harmonized System code for what you're shipping, which then maps to a Harmonized Tariff Schedule code specific to the United States. These parts are all populated PCBs and most populated boards are, by prior rulings, classified with <a href="https://rulings.cbp.gov/search?term=8473.30">an HTS code of 8473.30</a>, which is what the seller tagged all four items with. This code is for "Parts and accessories of the machines of heading 8471 [Automatic data processing machines and units thereof]." If you look under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule search engine for this code, you <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=847330">find a duty rate</a> for certain subheadings that at <em>most</em> would be 35 percent, or even if these were products of the People's Republic of China (they're old enough that I don't know their exact provenance, but I have no evidence to believe these were originally), then maybe, maybe, <em>maybe</em> <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=99038803">an additional 25 percent</a>. The declared value was the purchase price in euros and he even picked up the insurance. The package left the depot uneventfully and worked its way across the continent.
</p><p>
The first sign of trouble was over the weekend when I got an unexpected message.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRO6uX353u4XAiNm_52JHxvDYCsY9pjQuaDpUZLmoEEOD_y5WuSK4DiZlsnwZsktqT8Uh51jWcycpNaTbVTsK0651qPy26Lyal3BEx0Se0cVXkcq8c24iOTAev5yUCP0DgCIUVhyG_DY2f5Yv5b_BgxJhmLfNO9rOzkbS568n6LDX6TmC2Y6TZLaiL5z8/s1702/upyourups-2.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1702" data-original-width="1668" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiRO6uX353u4XAiNm_52JHxvDYCsY9pjQuaDpUZLmoEEOD_y5WuSK4DiZlsnwZsktqT8Uh51jWcycpNaTbVTsK0651qPy26Lyal3BEx0Se0cVXkcq8c24iOTAev5yUCP0DgCIUVhyG_DY2f5Yv5b_BgxJhmLfNO9rOzkbS568n6LDX6TmC2Y6TZLaiL5z8/s320/upyourups-2.png"></a></p><p>

The UPS shipping agent had indicated the parcel was subject to <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary/232-tariffs-aluminum-and-steel-faqs">Section 232 tariffs</a> on steel and aluminum, which required me to fill out a UPS-specific form attesting to the steel and aluminum content of the package. (This is an important distinction because Section 232 is not currently part of <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2025/24-1287_097c.pdf">the present matter before the U.S. Supreme Court</a> (PDF), only <a href="https://www.swlaw.com/publication/what-if-the-supreme-court-overrules-the-reciprocal-tariffs-plan-now-for-refunds-protests-and-contract-reconciliation/">reciprocal tariffs under the IEEPA</a>.) There should be little or no aluminum in these because the board and traces would be copper. However, a PCI card is probably going to have a steel bracket, so I looked at the typical mass for those and picked a sufficiently high number of 149g, almost certainly an overestimate but that's always safest with this stuff, then looked at the spot price of stainless steel and based on that weight computed a steel content value of $0.48. I marked "not applicable" for everything else and sent it back. They accepted that.
</p><p>
In the background, all this goes into a U.S. Customs and Border Protection Form 7501, also known as an Entry Summary. It is important to realize that in this circumstance, with UPS as the broker, you are <em>not</em> actually the importer of record — they are. You are the "ultimate consignee." Based on the information provided and the judgement of the broker's agent, then a tariff is assigned and added to the paperwork, which is "assessed" by CBP but in practice is being assessed by the broker based on what they expect CBP would charge under current regulation. Ordinarily you don't see this form. CBP does spot-check these but the majority just go through. Since UPS is the importer in this situation, they also pay the tariff they computed "in advance" to clear customs, and then they charge you for that plus their broker fee.
</p><p>
It took several more days for the actual tariff bill to arrive, which was early Monday morning. Now, the initial E-mail said this:

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz3mJRRRVpyOUdo0bPPC4ZPIgHYDTaBL9yvPapat_CUPHIHJL1DjG1nbiLWRsu3tnHK6Ar3gLDc5u0AIHjyaPcDk5epS-Ojwmlnft8i2A5SXZDuZ5cIA0VRt-kQy4-YsGqMJDFxpYdXDUVXTW-OIxp2Mx0UTt10ynbVgt0cwPXPuauiIWx2Cez8mQLt4c/s1804/upyourups-3.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1804" data-original-width="1668" height="320" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhz3mJRRRVpyOUdo0bPPC4ZPIgHYDTaBL9yvPapat_CUPHIHJL1DjG1nbiLWRsu3tnHK6Ar3gLDc5u0AIHjyaPcDk5epS-Ojwmlnft8i2A5SXZDuZ5cIA0VRt-kQy4-YsGqMJDFxpYdXDUVXTW-OIxp2Mx0UTt10ynbVgt0cwPXPuauiIWx2Cez8mQLt4c/s320/upyourups-3.png"></a></p><p>

Yes, the initial bill was for US$711. When I logged in, however, it gave me a total of $698 because it hadn't yet been delivered, which included a $14 brokerage fee.

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4IQTh6fo1ImSoo2TL8H7pDwB4OtcnDAwlo4mlZwBVkjlYai32RuU-nF6cDioi_kuIsbFLZSeM9cyvJKPHZREcvfp3WsXhIbVMx5xqS80DvjPCibAViqcq635sv_Eh-CkzLulfQXRCnfMCCZnuxkAuM87tumEaJMoREgPPokLnzoZIB8GqTOKM98yCTU0/s2906/upyourups-4.png"><img alt="" data-original-height="1201" data-original-width="2906" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4IQTh6fo1ImSoo2TL8H7pDwB4OtcnDAwlo4mlZwBVkjlYai32RuU-nF6cDioi_kuIsbFLZSeM9cyvJKPHZREcvfp3WsXhIbVMx5xqS80DvjPCibAViqcq635sv_Eh-CkzLulfQXRCnfMCCZnuxkAuM87tumEaJMoREgPPokLnzoZIB8GqTOKM98yCTU0/s320/upyourups-4.png" width="320"></a></p><p>

Time was of the essence, however, because it was arriving <em>that day</em>. I was absolutely incandescent to have to do it, but I paid the entire charge in full on the spot, and this is <em>the correct thing to do.</em> The last thing you want is for your package to get redirected to a warehouse pending your payment, because any shipper will start tacking on storage fees and they have no incentive to get it out of storage quickly. For UPS, a direct quote from their own agents, "Warehouse charges will be added on shipments that are held in our warehouse over two business days at a rate of $20.00 per day and $0.04 per pound. ... On the 15th day, all shipments will be eligible for General Order warehousing by U.S. Customs. Any shipment moved to a G.O. warehouse will be assigned additional warehouse fees over and above any UPS warehouse fees. If imposed, these fees must be paid in full before the shipment can be removed." Obviously I wanted no part of that.
</p><p>
After I had been advised by the system the package would be delivered as scheduled, I then relentlessly abused the AI chatbot on UPS' home page until it asked for my phone number and I got a callback into their phone support line. The first person on the line advised me they didn't handle tariffs and transferred me to another department, after which I spent (not an exaggeration) 45 minutes on hold until it was answered. This new agent said that this was dealt with through a specific subgroup on the UPS post entry team that didn't do anything by phone. (These brokerage teams generally operate out of the Kentucky UPS Worldport hub at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, formerly Standiford Field, hence its IATA code of SDF that also turns up in UPS documentation.) He gave me an E-mail address that looked like line noise but I confirmed it twice with him and also that I had to put the tracking number into the subject line with the magic words "Disputing Duties and Custom Charges." I indicated in the message the fees were paid but that I believed they were unreasonable and incorrect, and also pointed out I submitted the Section 232 paperwork when requested.
</p><p>
It took a day to get a reply, then came the United States Veterans' Day holiday, and finally I heard back yesterday from a second agent that they had "corrected this shipment." What they had done was file an amended Form 7501 and this 7501 they actually sent me so I could see the results. The declared value was changed to US$342 (I presume a difference in the spot exchange rate at the time of filing) and now it had two HTSUS numbers. The entire $342 was attributed to <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=8473.30.2000">8473.30.2000</a>, a slightly different code for "Parts and accessories, including face plates and lock latches, of printed circuit assemblies" which might be referring to the bracket I declared in the Section 232 form. There was no tariff on this ("FREE"). However, a second code <a href="https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=99030220">9903.02.20</a> was added, a long-winded way of saying a tariff (in this case 15%) on "articles the product of the European Union." This was $51.30 and the final tariff.
</p><p>
Everything arrived safely, by the way, and in excellent condition (though I cracked open the antistatic bag on the ANS board to take off the Maxell battery which Apple always shipped logic boards with back then). However, I would like to point out for the sake of accuracy that the ANS logic board, ROM SIMM and cache DIMM have no country of origin printed on them. Only the Twin Turbo card does, and it says ...

</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7B2-6rjm9Xk610XOOuYNQb9w-E7i8E4IEyDwbzjj5hEdHvioIl9jot8cL6rwI-f8H8h4XsBrBUOoT5LGbSTuNMpZ8WdX2H7MIsrRxAID_aZD-Rf2ohHp3R5o7vbP0rxGVV28zWsAJHZqs23TkukVgNY7GwM18cdqAnEFIjp_8K86vCQ2KxcdHhFiX-TY/s4080/PXL_20251115_231859295~2.jpg"><img alt="" data-original-height="3072" data-original-width="4080" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7B2-6rjm9Xk610XOOuYNQb9w-E7i8E4IEyDwbzjj5hEdHvioIl9jot8cL6rwI-f8H8h4XsBrBUOoT5LGbSTuNMpZ8WdX2H7MIsrRxAID_aZD-Rf2ohHp3R5o7vbP0rxGVV28zWsAJHZqs23TkukVgNY7GwM18cdqAnEFIjp_8K86vCQ2KxcdHhFiX-TY/s320/PXL_20251115_231859295~2.jpg" width="320"></a></p><p>

.. but since it wasn't the major part of the order it seemed like I'd be wasting even more time over ten or fifteen bucks to appeal this too. Your mileage and motivation may vary.
</p><p>
Now that UPS was into me for $632.70, the revising agent said, "Any difference between the amount paid and the amount now reflected will be auto-refunded to you. Most of the time, this is done by check sent to the billing address, you can expect this between 2-6 weeks." They didn't say when they don't use a check (I paid with a credit card), but they did give me a phone number for accounting, which I'll call if UPS fails to pay back this particular interest-free loan.
</p><p>
So that's the sordid tale. Even though UPS (mostly) made this right, I'm still unhappy with them for screwing up so badly in the first place because I'm out the money until they get around to reimbursing me. You'd think someone would have noticed that a thumping big duty like that seemed a little weird for a transaction of this size and maybe called a supervisor or something. The fact it could be so promptly appealed — and reversed in a few days, something that hardly ever happens with the federal government — pretty much demonstrates it was their call to ding it for that much in duty in the first place. I'm also unhappy with them for only alerting me to the final cost of the tariff when the shipment was inbound and due for delivery instead of earlier when it was assessed, because they have you over a barrel at that point unless you want to take your chances with their brokerage warehouse. This obviously nets them more money with the people who won't pay up immediately, but it's undeniably pretty bad customer service. Unfortunately, my unscientific survey of reports in the UPS Reddit indicate I am far from the only person to get a disproportionate assessment of this type.
</p><p>
Regardless, if this happens to you — whether it's FedEx or DHL or UPS or whatever — <em>pay it</em> and <em>then</em> appeal it. Don't let your shipment go to a warehouse and don't bounce it back to the sender; since odds are the shipper (because they are likely the importer of record) has already paid the duty, they're going to want their money back and you'll be out the money <em>and</em> the items. But, by golly, appeal it: just because you might agree with it politically doesn't mean they did it right.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://libwifi.so/">https://libwifi.so/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45941025">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/libwifi/libwifi" target="_blank">libwifi</a> is a fast, simple C shared library with a
        <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">permissive license</a> for generating and parsing a wide variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11#Layer_2_%E2%80%93_Datagrams" target="_blank">802.11 wireless frames</a> on Linux and macOS with a few lines of straight forward code.
        </p><p>
        It is written with a simple-to-use approach while also exposing features that allow more advanced use, with clean and readable code being a priority.
        </p><p>
        Other goals of the library include cross-architecture support, clean compilation without warnings and strict error checking.
    </p></div><div><p>
    libwifi exposes functions and structs to make parsing and generating WiFi frames very easy, and examples can be found in the source <a href="https://github.com/libwifi/libwifi/tree/main/examples" target="_blank">examples</a> directory.
    </p><p>
    When using libwifi, be sure to pass <code>-lwifi</code> to the linker, and make sure that the libwifi shared library is installed on the system.
    </p><h2>Parsing</h2><p>
    The generic flow of a program using libwifi to parse frames is a loop that reads captured packets as raw data, such as with <a href="https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap" target="_blank">libpcap</a> from a file or monitor interface, then parse the frame into a common datatype, then parse again to retrieve frame     specific data.
    </p><p><code><pre>static int got_radiotap = 0;

int main(int argc, const char *argv[]) {
    pcap_t handle = {0};
    char errbuf[PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE] = {0};

    if ((handle = pcap_create(argv[2], errbuf)) == NULL) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    if (pcap_activate(handle) != 0) {
        pcap_close(handle);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    int linktype = pcap_datalink(handle);
    if (linktype == DLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO) {
        got_radiotap = 1;
    } else if (linktype == DLT_IEEE802_11) {
        got_radiotap = 0;
    } else {
        pcap_close(handle);
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    pd = pcap_dump_open(handle, PCAP_SAVEFILE);
    pcap_loop(handle, -1 /*INFINITY*/, &amp;parse_packet, (unsigned char *) pd);
}
    </pre></code></p><p>
    The data from the libpcap loop is then given to <code>libwifi_get_frame()</code> which checks for frame validity and type/subtype, and stores the data in a <code>struct libwifi_frame</code>.
    </p><p><code><pre>void parse_packet(unsigned char *args,
                  const struct pcap_pkthdr *header,
                  const unsigned char *packet) {
    unsigned long data_len = header-&gt;caplen;
    unsigned char *data = (unsigned char *) packet;

    struct libwifi_frame frame = {0};
    int ret = libwifi_get_wifi_frame(&amp;frame, data, data_len, got_radiotap);
    if (ret != 0) {
        printf("[!] Error getting libwifi_frame: %d\n", ret);
        return;
    }
    </pre></code></p><p>
    The <code>libwifi_frame</code> struct can then be given to one of the frame parser functions, such as <code>libwifi_parse_beacon()</code>. Since the header comment for
    <code>libwifi_parse_beacon()</code> indicates that the parsed data is stored in a <code>struct libwifi_bss</code>, we need to initalise one and pass it as a parameter.
    </p><p>
    We'll use the BSS struct to easily show the SSID and Channel from the sniffed beacon frame.
    </p><p><code><pre>    if (frame.frame_control.type == TYPE_MANAGEMENT &amp;&amp;
        frame.frame_control.subtype == SUBTYPE_BEACON) {
        struct libwifi_bss bss = {0};

        int ret = libwifi_parse_beacon(&amp;bss, &amp;frame);
        if (ret != 0) {
            printf("Failed to parse beacon: %d\n", ret);
            return;
        }

        printf("SSID: %s, Channel: %d\n", bss.ssid, bss.channel);
    }
}
    </pre></code></p>
    <h2>Generation</h2><p>
    For frame generation, you only need to provide the required data to one of the frame generation functions. In this example, <code>libwifi_create_beacon()</code>.
    </p><p><code><pre>int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    struct libwifi_beacon beacon = {0};
    static unsigned char bcast[] = "\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF\xFF";
    static unsigned char tx[] = "\x00\x20\x91\xAA\xBB\CC";

    int ret = libwifi_create_beacon(&amp;beacon, bcast, tx, tx, "wifi-beacon", 11);
    if (ret != 0) {
        return ret;
    }
    </pre></code></p><p>
    From here, we can use the dumper function for this frame subtype to write the beacon in raw byte format to a buffer. This can be useful for writing the
    generated frame out to a pcap file using <code>pcap_dump()</code> or transmitting from a monitor mode interface.
    </p><p><code><pre>    unsigned char *buf = NULL;
    size_t buf_sz = libwifi_get_beacon_length(&amp;beacon);

    buf = malloc(buf_sz);
    if (buf == NULL) {
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    ret = libwifi_dump_beacon(&amp;beacon, buf, buf_sz);
    if (ret &lt; 0) {
        return ret;
    }

    // Inject frame bytes or write bytes to file

    libwifi_free_beacon(&amp;beacon);
    free(buf);
}
    </pre></code></p>

	<h2>About</h2>

	<p>AsciiMath is an easy-to-write markup language for mathematics.<br>
		Try it out in the interactive renderer:</p>

	<p><label for="demoSource">Input:</label>
		<br>

		
	</p>

	<div>
		<p><label for="demoRendering">Rendering:</label></p><p>
			`sum_(i=1)^n i^3=((n(n+1))/2)^2`
		</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section id="gettingStarted">
	<h2>Getting Started</h2>

	<p>In order to get started you have two options:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>Use <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> to render your formulas.
				MathJax is a full fledged open source JavaScript display engine for
				mathematics and <strong>works in all browsers.</strong><br>
				This is the recommended approach!</p>

			<p>Get started by loading the default AsciiMath configuration:</p>

			<p>
				<code>&lt;script
					src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.4/latest.js?config=AM_CHTML"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
			</p>
	
			<p>Visit the MathJax <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html">Getting Started</a> 
				page to find other CDN options , or to learn how to install MathJax locally on your server.</p> 
				
			<p>Text in your HTML enclosed in <code>`</code> (backticks) will now get
				rendered as a math formula. The math delimiters can also be customized.
				Check out the <a href="https://mathjax.org/">MathJax</a> website for more
				information!</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Load the AsciiMath javascript file
				(<a href="http://git.io/X84VQQ">get it on GitHub</a>)
				in either the <code>head</code> or the <code>body</code>
				tag of your website like this:</p>

			<p>
				<code>&lt;script
					src="ASCIIMathML.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>
			</p>

			<p>This file contains JavaScript to convert AsciiMath
				notation and (some) LaTeX to Presentation MathML. The conversion
				is done while the HTML page loads.</p>

			<p>
				<mark><strong>Attention:</strong> Currently this only works in
					Firefox and Safari.  
				</mark>
			</p>

			<p>While HTML5 now includes MathML as an official
				recommendation, the remaining browsers do not appear to be
				implementing it.  For widest browser compatibility, the use
				of MathJax is recommended.</p>

		</li>
	</ol>
</section>

<section id="syntax">
<h2>Syntax</h2>

	<p>Most AsciiMath symbols attempt to mimic in text what they look like 
	   rendered, like <code>oo</code> for `oo`.  Many symbols can also be
	   displayed using a TeX alternative, but a preceeding backslash is not 
	   required.</p>

<h3>Standard Functions</h3>

<p>sin, cos, tan, sec, csc, cot, 
arcsin, arccos, arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, sech, csch, coth, exp, log, ln,
det, dim, mod, gcd, lcm, lub, glb, min, max, f, g.</p>

<br>

<h3>Special Cases</h3>

<p>Matrices: <code>[[a,b],[c,d]]</code> yields to `[[a,b],[c,d]]`</p>

<p>Column vectors: <code>((a),(b))</code> yields to `((a),(b))`</p>

<p>Augmented matrices: <code>[[a,b,|,c],[d,e,|,f]]</code> yields to `[[a,b,|,c],[d,e,|,f]]`</p>

<p>Matrices can be used for layout:
 <code>{(2x,+,17y,=,23),(x,-,y,=,5):}</code> yields
 `{(2x,+,17y,=,23),(x,-,y,=,5):}`</p>
 
<p>Complex subscripts: <code>lim_(N-&gt;oo) sum_(i=0)^N</code> yields to `lim_(N-&gt;oo) sum_(i=0)^N`</p>

<p>Subscripts must come before superscripts:
	<code>int_0^1 f(x)dx</code> yields to `int_0^1 f(x)dx`</p>
	
<p>Derivatives: <code> f'(x) = dy/dx</code> yields `f'(x) = dy/dx`<br>
	For variables other than x,y,z, or t you will need grouping symbols: 
	<code> (dq)/(dp)</code> for `(dq)/(dp)`</p>

<p>Overbraces and underbraces:
	<code>ubrace(1+2+3+4)_("4 terms")</code> yields `ubrace(1+2+3+4)_("4 terms")`.<br>
	<code>obrace(1+2+3+4)^("4 terms")</code> yields `obrace(1+2+3+4)^("4 terms")`.
</p>

<p>Attention: Always try to surround the <code>&gt;</code> and
	<code>&lt;</code> characters with spaces so that the html parser does not
	confuse it with an opening or closing tag!</p>
<br>


<h3>The Grammar</h3>

<p>Here is a definition of the grammar used to parse AsciiMath expressions.
	In the Backus-Naur form given below, the letter on the left of the
	<code>::=</code> represents a category of symbols that could be one
	of the possible sequences of symbols listed on the right.
	The vertical bar <code>|</code> separates the alternatives.</p>

<pre id="grammar">v ::= [A-Za-z] | greek letters | numbers | other constant symbols
u ::= sqrt | text | bb | other unary symbols for font commands
b ::= frac | root | stackrel | other binary symbols
l ::= ( | [ | { | (: | {: | other left brackets
r ::= ) | ] | } | :) | :} | other right brackets
S ::= v | lEr | uS | bSS             Simple expression
I ::= S_S | S^S | S_S^S | S          Intermediate expression
E ::= IE | I/I                       Expression
</pre>

<p>The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0d424625-f4f8-4646-9f6e-927c8cbe0e3e"><em>Financial Times</em> reports</a> that Apple has stepped up its preparations for the handover of the CEO role from Tim Cook. Here are the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-apple-steps-up-tim-cook-s-succession-efforts">Apple steps up Tim Cook’s succession efforts</h2>



<p>According to the FT’s sources, Apple’s board and senior executives have “recently intensified” the company’s succession planning for its top role.</p>



<p>The <em>FT</em> adds that although Apple’s Senior VP of Hardware Engineering, John Ternus, is the most likely to take the reins of the company, “no final decisions have been made”.</p>



<p>While the report doesn’t mention why Apple is accelerating its succession efforts, it notes that the move is not tied to the company’s performance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“People close to Apple say the long-planned transition is not related to the company’s current performance, ahead of what is expected to be a blockbuster end-of-year sales period for the iPhone.</p>



<p>(…)</p>



<p>The company is unlikely to name a new CEO before its next earnings report in late January, which covers the critical holiday period.”</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>Their sources also cautioned that “although preparations have intensified, the timing of any announcement could change”.</p>



<p>This report lands just hours after former Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/11/14/apple-ex-coo-jeff-williams-now-officially-retired/">spent his last day at Apple</a>, following the retirement announcement <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/08/apple-coo-jeff-williams-stepping-down-later-this-month/">he made in July</a>.</p>



<p>Williams had already handed operational leadership to Sabih Khan earlier this year, and his remaining responsibilities were <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/10/09/apple-folds-health-and-fitness-into-services-splits-apple-watch-oversight/">recently redistributed</a> among other top executives, Ternus among them.</p>



<p>Apple has also recently gone through a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/03/apple-cfo-luca-maestri/">CFO transition</a>, with longtime finance chief Luca Maestri stepping down and handing the role to Kevan Parekh, who previously served as the company’s vice president of Financial Planning and Analysis.</p>

<p id="15905113-780b-45b9-973e-ebd4fcdffa94">AMD increased its share across all markets served by x86 processors at Intel's expense in the third quarter of 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.mercuryresearch.com/" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.mercuryresearch.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link">Mercury Research</a>. Intel is holding strong, and as its latest offerings for client and server systems got significantly more competitive than they were several quarters ago, the pace of AMD's gains has slowed down considerably. However, during the quarter, AMD achieved two important milestones: it now commands shipments of over 25% of all x86 CPUs, and it now ships over 33% (one-third) of desktop x86 CPUs.</p><h2 id="abnormal-market-performance-shipments-of-x86-cpus-flat-quarter-over-quarter-3">Abnormal market performance: Shipments of x86 CPUs flat quarter-over-quarter</h2><p id="812aa114-6fad-46f2-b319-8dc06ce20264">Normally, we start our coverage of the x86 market based on data from Mercury Research with client CPUs, but the third quarter was very unusual as unit shipments of x86 CPUs were flat quarter-over-quarter (QoQ), which significantly contradicts the normal seasonal bump when PC makers start to prep for the back-to-school (BTS) season in June – July as well as Christmas season in September.</p><p id="812aa114-6fad-46f2-b319-8dc06ce20264-1">Indeed, PC and server makers increased their CPU procurements in Q3, but the weakness came almost entirely from Intel, which saw sharp drops in IoT/SoC and entry-level mobile processors as it shifted manufacturing capacity toward server processors, and strong shipments of such parts in Q2. By contrast, AMD's unit shipments were flat to slightly up, so the company gained share sequentially and year-over-year (YoY), hitting two psychologically important milestones.</p><p>For the first time in years, AMD's unit share of all x86 client and server CPUs shipped exceeded 25% and now stands at 25.6%, up from 24.2% in the prior quarter and up from 24% in the same quarter a year ago. Intel still commands 74.4%, but it lost some share in certain segments, allowing AMD to hit an important milestone amid a market shrink.</p><p>If we add embedded, IoT, and game consoles SoCs to the equation, then AMD's share looks even more impressive: a 30.9% share of all x86-based chips, up from 25% in the third quarter of 2024. While Intel maintains its dominant position with 69.1%, its 5.9% YoY share loss does not look very good. Yet, it should be noted that AMD shipped significantly more game console SoCs in the third quarter this year compared to the third quarter of 2024, which inflated its results a bit.</p><p id="afae9d47-3d08-47f8-9016-c3c7ddf03fb0">Strong desktop and mobile CPU lineups as well as Intel struggles with supply of small-core mobile CPUs and prior-generation desktop offerings allowed AMD to slightly outgrow Intel in the third quarter both sequentially and year-over-year, according to data from Mercury Research.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="8d129087-6efe-4aae-8f17-d928cb02454a"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

By contrast, Intel's share fell to 74.6%, down 1.5% sequentially and 1.4% compared to the same quarter a year ago, as its entry-level mobile shipments were constrained by reduced small-core CPU supply.

If we compare AMD's current share to its share in the second quarter of 2024, the gain would be a whopping 10.6%</p><p>Intel still held the majority of desktop shipments, but its share fell from 67.8% to 66.4% QoQ, and from 71.7% YoY, reflecting AMD’s continued gains in both the mainstream and high-end segments and shortages of Intel's 13th and 14th Core 'Raptor Lake' processors that are still popular three years after their original release in 2022.</p><p>On the revenue front, AMD reached another record quarter for desktop CPU revenue, driven by higher shipments and a strong mix of premium SKUs, as the company noted in its conference call a week ago. Intel's revenue position weakened as its unit share declined and AMD absorbed more of the market's high-margin demand. Mercury Research notes that AMD's revenue growth in desktops significantly outpaced its unit growth, which confirms that the red company continued to strengthen its position in the most profitable parts of the desktop market.</p><p id="d336c17d-753e-47ea-ba4e-1de0853c505c">AMD lost market share to Intel in the mobile CPU space in Q1 and Q2 2025, but the company outperformed Intel in Q3 2025 on a sequential basis, gaining unit share as Intel struggled with reduced shipments of its entry-level small-core processors.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="2cd72f79-802d-48f8-81ac-0ffdcb13ada8"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Both companies saw YoY shipment growth, but AMD's increase was stronger, helping it push unit share higher compared to the same quarter a year earlier, so overall things look good for AMD.</p><p>Most of the real action in Q3 came from product mix rather than volume, according to Mercury. AMD's EPYC 'Turin' ramp accelerated, driving stronger demand for high-core-count EPYC processors, while Intel saw increasing adoption of Xeon 6 'Granite Rapids,' which helped lift its average selling prices despite slightly lower unit volumes.</p><p>On the revenue side, AMD hit another all-time high, as the mix shifted heavily toward its latest and more expensive EPYC 9005-series platform. The combination of flat unit shipments and rising prices meant that AMD's server revenue continues to grow significantly faster than its unit share, while Intel's revenue gains were more limited due to modest declines in its overall shipment mix.</p><h2 id="summary-3">Summary</h2><p id="61822df5-6cbc-4098-a9a6-7dd35b4db4b0">In terms of unit share, AMD continued to gain ground in Q3 2025 across nearly all major x86 segments, helped by strong desktop growth driven by the halo effect of range-topping Ryzen 9000-series CPUs and Intel's struggles to ship enough previous-generation desktop CPUs, as well as the relatively low popularity of its latest offerings for desktops. As a result, AMD expanded its presence in client CPUs, reached a new high in desktops, and inched upward in servers, while Intel's share declined modestly as supply constraints and product transitions limited its ability to address all orders. Although Intel still led the market in total shipments, the balance continued shifting gradually toward AMD.</p><p>In terms of revenue, AMD delivered even stronger results, setting new highs in both desktop and server segments thanks to rising sales of premium processors and the ramp of its newest platforms. Intel's revenue performance was more mixed: constrained low-end supply pushed its average prices higher, but it ceded more of the high-margin market to AMD, especially in desktops and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/enterprise">enterprise</a> servers.

<p><strong><em>A Python toolkit for hardware engineering</em></strong></p>
<p>By Jared Callaham • 6 Oct 2025</p>
<hr>
<p>A great engineer (controls being no exception) has to be part hacker, part master craftsman.</p>
<p>You have to be a hacker because things rarely “just work” in the real world without a little… creativity.
But you can’t <em>only</em> be a hacker; developing complex systems in aerospace, automotive, robotics, and similar industries demands a disciplined, systematic approach.
You need tools that let you iterate fast and maintain a methodical workflow where changes are version-controlled, algorithms are tested systematically, and deployment is repeatable.</p>
<p>Modern deep learning frameworks solved this years ago — you can develop in PyTorch or JAX and deploy anywhere.
But those tools were built for neural net models, GPUs, and cloud deployments, not dynamics models, MCUs, and HIL testing.</p>
<p>That’s where Archimedes comes in; what PyTorch did for ML deployment, Archimedes aims to do for control systems.
The goal is to build an open-source “PyTorch for hardware” that gives you the productivity of Python with the deployability of C.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>Archimedes is a Python framework that lets you develop and analyze algorithms in NumPy and automatically generate optimized C code for embedded systems</strong>.
For instance, you can write a physics model in Python, calibrate it with data, use the model to design and simulate control logic, validate with simple hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing, and deploy with confidence:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/dev_workflow.png" src="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/_images/dev_workflow.png">
<img alt="../../_images/dev_workflow_dark.png" src="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/_images/dev_workflow_dark.png">
<p>This is <em>one</em> workflow you might use with Archimedes (specifically, the one from the <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/tutorials/deployment/deployment00.html"><span>hardware deployment tutorial</span></a>), but it’s designed to be flexible, so you’re free to build up whatever workflow suits your style and application best.</p>
<section id="the-linchpin-python-c-code-generation">
<h2>The Linchpin: Python → C Code Generation<a href="#the-linchpin-python-c-code-generation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Archimedes started with the question, <strong>“What would you need to actually do practical control systems development in Python?”</strong></p>
<p>As a high-level language, it’s hard to beat Python on design principles like progressive disclosure, flexibility, and scalability.
The numerical ecosystem (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, PyTorch, etc.) is also excellent.
The problem is that <strong>none of it can deploy to typical embedded systems.</strong></p>
<p>If you need to deploy to hardware today, you have a few basic options:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Work in a high-level language like Python or Julia and manually translate algorithms to C code</p></li>
<li><p>Work entirely in a low-level language like C/C++ or Rust</p></li>
<li><p>Adopt an expensive vendor-locked ecosystem that supports automatic code generation</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(<strong>Side note</strong>: While running Python itself on a microcontroller is growing in popularity for educational and hobby applications, there’s no real future for pure Python in real-time mission-critical deployments.)</p>
<p>However, if you could do seamless C code generation from standard NumPy code, you could layer on simulation and optimization tools, building blocks for physics modeling, testing frameworks, and other features of comprehensive controls engineering toolchains.
But without the code generation, there will always be a gulf between the software and the hardware deployment.</p>
<p>Just to drive the point home, here’s a side-by-side of manual vs automatic coding for a common piece of sensor fusion algorithms:</p>
<details>
<div>
<p>Below are two implementations of a Kalman filter, an algorithm that combines noisy sensor measurements with a prediction model to estimate system state.
This is what’s behind GPS navigation, spacecraft guidance, and sensor fusion in millions of devices.</p>
<p>On the left is hand-written C code, and on the right is a NumPy version that can be used to generate an equivalent function.</p>
<p>Here we’ll show an implementation for the common case of a single sensor, which avoids having to use a library for matrix inversion in C (though Archimedes does support operations like Cholesky factorization).</p>

<p>Neither of these implementations is optimized, but it gives a sense of what it looks like to work in either environment.
Of course, for production hand-written code, you’d likely also use optimized linear algebra libraries like CMSIS-DSP and numerical strategies like Cholesky factorization or a square-root form for stability.
But the extra numerical features are only a few extra lines in NumPy, while the hand-written C version becomes more and more complex.</p>
</div>
</details><p>This capability, and most of the other core functionality in Archimedes, is made possible by building on <a href="https://web.casadi.org/">CasADi</a>, a sophisticated open-source library for nonlinear optimization and algorithmic differentiation.
This lets Archimedes translate your NumPy code into C++ <em>computational graphs</em> that support code generation, derivative calculation, and more.</p>

<section id="beyond-codegen">
<h2>Beyond Codegen<a href="#beyond-codegen" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you’re already working in C/C++/Rust, or if you don’t actually need to deploy to hardware for your application, the codegen may not speak to you.
But while Python → C code generation is what makes Archimedes practical for deployment, there’s much more you can do.</p>
<!--
Archimedes has a primarily _functional_ style, meaning that much of the core functionality is exposed through function _decorators_ that transform the function you wrote into a modified function according to the purpose of the decorator.

This design was heavily influenced by JAX and PyTorch, but don't worry if you haven't used these frameworks before.
-->
<section id="compilation">
<h3>Compilation<a href="#compilation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Archimedes can “compile” a Python function into a C++ <em>computational graph</em>, meaning that when you call the compiled function, the entire numerical code gets executed in C++ rather than interpreted Python.
For complicated functions this can achieve dramatic speedups over pure Python (5-10x even on simple benchmarks).</p>

<p>You can embed complex functionality like <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/generated/api/archimedes.odeint.html#archimedes.odeint" title="archimedes.odeint"><span>ODE solves</span></a>, <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/generated/api/archimedes.minimize.html#archimedes.minimize" title="archimedes.minimize"><span>constrained nonlinear optimization</span></a>, and more directly in these computational graphs.</p>
<p>When you first call your function, Archimedes feeds it <em>symbolic arrays</em> (using <a href="https://web.casadi.org/">CasADi’s</a> symbolic types under the hood) that match the shape and type of your numerical inputs.
As your code executes, it builds up a C++ representation of the calculation.
Then, instead of operating on the numerical arrays, your code operates on these symbolic replacements, using NumPy’s <em>array dispatch</em> mechanism to redirect to CasADi whenever you call NumPy functions.
By the end of this “tracing” step, CasADi has a full view of what the function does and can reproduce it in efficient C++.
Then, any time you call that function again, the C++ equivalent is what actually gets executed.</p>
<p>This approach is not “Just-In-Time” (JIT) compilation in the sense used by Julia/JAX/Numba, where the Python code is literally compiled down to highly optimized platform-specific machine code.
We’ll show some benchmarking in a separate post, but generally what you can expect is that these JIT-compiled frameworks will be somewhat faster than pre-compiled CasADi (and hence, Archimedes).
However, by avoiding the overhead and “unrolling” of true JIT compilation, we get a massive reduction in compilation time for the kind of complex functions typical of advanced controls applications.</p>
<p>For more on how this works (and when it doesn’t), see the <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/under-the-hood.html"><span>Under the Hood</span></a> documentation page.</p>

<p>Besides linearizing models for stability analysis and controller design, this is a feature you may not directly use very often.
But gradients and Jacobians are used pervasively in numerical methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Optimization</strong> solvers use gradients of the objective, Jacobians of the constraints, and sometimes even Hessian information</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulation</strong> algorithms use Jacobians of the dynamics model for implicit solvers, especially for “stiff” ODE/DAE problems</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Root-finding</strong> solvers like Newton’s method use Jacobians at every iteration to find an improved guess at the solution point</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So when you do parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, trim point identification, or even just call <code><span>odeint</span></code>, you don’t <em>think</em> about “autodiff”, but it’s happening behind the scenes to solve your problem.</p>
<p>Traditional scientific computing packages like SciPy and MATLAB usually fall back to slow and inaccurate finite differencing unless you provide manually implemented gradients, Jacobians, etc. - but for anything but the simplest problems this is prohibitively complicated to calculate and implement.</p>
<p>Newer frameworks like Julia, JAX, and PyTorch rely much more heavily on autodiff, but none of these are tailored towards hardware and controls engineering applications.
My personal experience has been that CasADi (the autodiff framework used under the hood by Archimedes) has far and away the best autodiff system for the kinds of large, sparse problems that commonly arise in engineering (like parameter estimation, trajectory optimization, model-predictive control, etc.).</p>
<p>All that is to say, the derivatives are there if you need them.</p>

<h3>Structured Data Types<a href="#structured-data-types" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most numerical codes are naturally written to operate on flat vectors.
This makes sense for the implementation of an optimization algorithm or ODE solver, but physical systems are usually more naturally conceived of as hierarchical.
For instance, a satellite has position, velocity, attitude, angular velocity, battery state, thermal state, etc.
To work with typical numerical codes, you have to either keep track of what entries in your array are which physical state or manually flatten/unflatten every time you call a routine that expects a flat vector.</p>
<p>That might be fine the <em>first</em> time, but what if you want to try a higher-fidelity battery model that has twice as many dynamic states?
It quickly becomes a nightmare to maintain these kinds of codes, and the result is that you waste cycles on keeping all of this straight, and you lose the practical capability to explore multi-fidelity modeling.</p>
<p>This also comes up frequently in deep learning: models are naturally organized as hierarchical modules with trainable parameters.
This is the root of the <code><span>nn.Module</span></code> in PyTorch and the “PyTree” concept in JAX.
Modern ML frameworks (specifically JAX and PyTorch) have developed a nice set of solutions around working with this kind of hierarchically structured data.</p>
<p>But this hierarchical data and logic might even be <em>more</em> common in engineering.
Physical systems are naturally organized into subsystems and components that have well-defined interfaces, and each of these might have its own dynamic state and configurable parameters.
Hierarchical data structures can mirror this physical system decomposition.</p>
<p>Archimedes takes inspiration from these frameworks and supports “tree operations” (functions applied to hierarchical data) and a <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/generated/api/archimedes.struct.html#archimedes.struct" title="archimedes.struct"><span><code><span>@struct</span></code></span></a> decorator to create tree-compatible data classes:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>@arc</span><span>.</span><span>struct</span>
<span>class</span><span> </span><span>PointMass</span><span>:</span>
    <span>pos</span><span>:</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ndarray</span>
    <span>vel</span><span>:</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ndarray</span>

<span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>PointMass</span><span>(</span><span>np</span><span>.</span><span>zeros</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>),</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>ones</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>))</span>  <span># state.pos, state.vel</span>
<span>flat_state</span><span>,</span> <span>unravel</span> <span>=</span> <span>arc</span><span>.</span><span>tree</span><span>.</span><span>ravel</span><span>(</span><span>state</span><span>)</span>  <span># flat_state is a vector</span>
<span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>unravel</span><span>(</span><span>flat_state</span><span>)</span>  <span># Back to a PointMass instance</span>
</pre></div>
<p>These <code><span>@struct</span></code>-decorated classes can be nested inside one another, flattened to/from a 1D vector, and used to auto-generate nested <code><span>struct</span></code> types in deployable C code.
If a <code><span>PointMass</span></code> is used as an argument to a codegen function, it will become:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>typedef</span><span> </span><span>struct</span><span> </span><span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>pos</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>    </span><span>float</span><span> </span><span>vel</span><span>[</span><span>3</span><span>];</span>
<span>}</span><span> </span><span>point_mass_t</span><span>;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This gives you a predictable and intuitive way to switch back and forth between Python and auto-generated C.</p>

<h2>Why Another Framework?<a href="#why-another-framework" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are lots of modeling and simulation tools out there, from rock-solid commercial tools building on 30-year legacies to innovative modern frameworks experimenting with new languages, JIT-compilation, and physics-informed ML.</p>
<p>I created Archimedes because none of these really solved the problems I was having in my own work.
Codebases that started out being logical and well-organized invariably ended up growing into a gnarled, difficult-to-maintain mass in order to support increasingly complex models and analyses.
Then when it’s time to move towards testing and production, you’re back to square one to translate to C code.</p>
<p>Granted, these complaints might just indicate that I’m not a great software developer - but I’m <em>not</em> a software developer.
That’s the point.
I wanted a framework that would let me write code that looked as clean as a deep learning repository in PyTorch, but would also be high-performance for simulation and optimization, <em>and</em> had a path to hardware deployment.
After seeing it perform in my own work, I’m convinced this approach - NumPy-based development with automatic C deployment - could help how control systems engineers develop and deploy algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>One last comment</strong>: from personal experience, it takes a little time (but maybe less than you think) to grok the functional programming and hierarchical data types that are core to Archimedes.
(I’ve spent a lot of time in JAX, which heavily influenced the design of this library.)
It’s different than what you might be used to, and there are also some <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/gotchas.html"><span>quirks and gotchas</span></a> related to compilation and control flow.</p>
<p>But these concepts do actually map quite neatly to our mental/mathematical models for dynamical systems and control algorithms.
Once it clicks, you’ll be able to write clean, modular, maintainable workflows that cut down your iteration time and make it faster to design, debug, deploy, and debug, and debug, and redesign, and debug, and…</p>

<section id="public-beta-status">
<h3>“Public Beta” Status<a href="#public-beta-status" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This post marks the release of Archimedes in “public beta” (v0.X.X).
This means that the core functionality is there and has already been tested in practical applications.
The API is also well-tested and stable; while it is likely to evolve in time, it will change with semantic versioning conventions, meaning smooth upgrade paths and deprecation notices.
The library will remain in beta for 6-12 months to allow for community feedback and API maturation across ongoing real-world applications.</p>
<p>For symbolic/numeric reliability in particular, Archimedes gets a big leg up by using CasADi as its backend, which has an excellent track record and is widely and actively used and tested in a variety of applications.</p>
<p>All that is to say, between now and the “v1.0” release you can expect things to be largely stable, but this additional time builds in a cushion to work out any kinks.</p>
<p>Ongoing development priorities are outlined in detail in the <a href="https://pinetreelabs.github.io/archimedes/roadmap.html"><span>roadmap</span></a>, but key focus areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Hybrid Simulations</strong>: Support for DAEs, zero-crossing events, multirate control logic</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hardware Deployment</strong>: Improved support for HIL testing, static analysis, and profiling/telemetry</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Physics Modeling</strong>: Built-in functionality like reference frames, kinematic trees, polynomial/spline primitives, and templates for domain-specific components.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Algorithm Development</strong>: State machines, trajectory optimization, MPC, sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, etc.</p></li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>On May 28, hours after Nevada’s workplace safety agency served notice of more than $400,000 in fines to Elon Musk’s $5.6 billion tunneling startup the Boring Company, the phone rang at Nevada governor Joe Lombardo’s office.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>Boring Co. president Steve Davis was on the line. Boring Company was challenging citations from Nevada’s workplace safety regulator blaming it for chemical burns two firefighters had suffered in its tunnels during a training exercise.&nbsp;



</p><p>By the next afternoon, a group of high-ranking state officials, including the governor’s state infrastructure coordinator who took the call, were convened in a room with Davis, who was himself wrapping up a stint in Washington D.C. helping Musk run the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). At the beginning of that meeting, the citations and fines—among the agency’s largest in a decade and a potential threat to Boring’s plans to build tunnels in other U.S. cities—were summarily rescinded.&nbsp;



</p><p>Soon, something else disappeared: The record of the Governor’s office meeting with Musk’s company was removed from a public document without explanation. More irregularities in the case file occurred: Documents weren’t saved to the file, and a document intended to provide reasoning for revoking the citations was left out.&nbsp;



</p><p>The sequence of events, which <em>Fortune</em> is the first to report, raised alarm and has had a chilling effect within Nevada’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, according to an OSHA staffer as well as someone who worked on the case, and it raises questions about the degree to which a powerful business is able to bend regulatory guardrails to its will and skirt proper oversight, especially as Musk’s consortium of companies become increasingly intertwined with Nevada’s economy.</p><p>“There is a defined process, and we didn’t follow it,” says one of the people that worked on the case file. “It wasn’t the agency that decided to do that—it was above the agency,” the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from speaking about internal OSHA matters.



</p><p>In statements to <em>Fortune</em>, Teri Williams, a spokeswoman for Nevada OSHA and the state departments that sit above it, described most of the irregularities in public record documentation of the case as innocuous mistakes, and said the agency had amended its case file after <em>Fortune</em>’s outreach “to ensure that the file is accurate.” She said the citations and fines did not meet legal requirements and should never have been issued in the first place, and that, as a result of this incident, the agency has since updated its policies and procedures to provide more oversight of OSHA investigations into “high-profile” employers.&nbsp;



</p><p>Regarding the meeting, Williams said that the Governor’s office “frequently receives complaints and inquiries” from employers and that “it is standard practice” for the Governor’s office to reach out to leadership to assist with complaints and inquiries. She said that the Governor’s office has never directed Nevada agencies to resolve complaints and that, in this instance, it would have supported an agency decision to keep citations if they were “found to have merit and could be validated.”&nbsp;&nbsp;



</p><p>“This specific outreach from Boring Company is not an anomaly and only stands out due to the high-profile nature of the business because of its affiliation with Elon Musk,” she said. (To read Nevada’s OSHA entire response to this story, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/12/fortune-investigation-boring-co-las-vegas-workplace-injuries-citations-rescinded-nevada-osha-responses" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/11/12/fortune-investigation-boring-co-las-vegas-workplace-injuries-citations-rescinded-nevada-osha-responses">click here.</a>)



</p><p>Four lawyers and former Nevada regulators, however, say this level of political involvement in an OSHA investigation is not only highly unusual, but goes against procedure. “It’s absolutely not appropriate,” said Jess Lankford, who oversaw Nevada OSHA until 2021. The agency is supposed to have the political independence to call “balls and strikes” as it sees fit, says Terry Johnson, an adjunct professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas who previously served as the director of the department that sits above OSHA.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>“It’s absolutely not appropriate.”<cite>Jess Lankford, Chief Administrative Officer of Nevada OSHA until 2021 </cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The Boring Company’s project, which aims to build an 104-station network of underground tunnels connecting the Convention Center to the airport, the Las Vegas Strip, and Allegiant Stadium, is one of several major investments that Elon Musk has made in Nevada, including the $7 billion <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> Gigafactory, which employs more than 17,000 construction and factory workers and has drawn other partner companies to set up shop nearby.&nbsp;



</p><p>As the fallout from the closed investigation has been quietly playing out behind the scenes, more safety incidents have occurred on Boring project sites in Las Vegas, under what one recently departed employee described as a “cowboy” culture regarding safety protocols. A worker’s pelvis was <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/09/11/boring-company-job-site-injury-reported-safety/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/09/11/boring-company-job-site-injury-reported-safety/">crushed</a> in September; a different employee was shocked by an electrical panel this summer; and the harsh chemicals that burned the firefighters, part of a toxic muck fluid that pools in the tunnels, remain an ever-present danger for Boring workers, according to five current and former employees at the Boring Company, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.&nbsp;



</p><p>One former employee described how workers would often kneel in the muck, not even realizing they were being burned until it was happening. “They go to peel off their sock,” they said, “And a big old chunk of skin comes off.”&nbsp;



</p><p>Meanwhile, a current Nevada OSHA employee says that the OSHA staffers working on the agency’s ongoing investigations into Boring (one of which involves the crushed worker) are frightened they will “get disciplined for doing their job.”</p><p>“It’s very political right now,” they added.&nbsp;



</p><p>This account of the firefighter injuries in Boring Co. tunnels, the Governor’s office involvement, and the aborted penalties is based on interviews with and statements from Nevada regulators and current or former Nevada OSHA employees, interviews with current and former Boring Co. employees, analysis from attorneys practicing in Nevada, and hundreds of pages of documents, including calendars, emails, photographs, and notes, related to OSHA’s inspection that were either obtained via several Freedom of Information Act Requests or shared privately with <em>Fortune</em>.&nbsp;



</p><p>Boring Company and Davis did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.&nbsp;



</p><h2><strong>A fire drill gone awry&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Musk’s Boring Co. bills itself as a new kind of transportation system, with ambitions to dig a vast “underground highway” for Teslas to zip through under the streets of Las Vegas, Nashville, and eventually other cities.



</p><p>It’s raised more than $900 million in funding over the years, according to PitchBook, including from some of Silicon Valley’s top investment firms such as Sequoia Capital. Boring’s short 4-mile stretch underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center and to two casinos, is, thus far, the lone working example of this vision. But Boring Co. President Davis, a long-time lieutenant to Musk’s various businesses, is racing to expand the Las Vegas “Loop” tunnel into the city and other areas of the broader county.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2147820483.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p><figcaption>A four-mile tunnel under the Las Vegas Convention Center is the first piece of Boring Co’s vision to build an “underground highway” under the city.</figcaption><p>AaronP/Bauer-Griffin/GC Image</p></div>



<p>Building the underground Tesla system is grueling work in the best of cases—involving giant drilling machines, toxic chemicals, and long shifts. At Boring Co. safety precautions and environmental permits have seemingly been thrown to the side in favor of speed. A <em>Fortune</em> <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/">investigation</a> published in early 2024 <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/flirted-death-elon-musk-boring-company-employees-injuries-osha-citations/">found</a> that numerous employees had suffered from burns caused by an accelerant used to harden the concrete mixture that keeps the tunnel structure in place. That chemical, called MasterRoc AGA 41S, mixes with groundwater and dirt as the tunneling proceeds, and pools at the base of the tunnels, sometimes to knee-high levels.&nbsp;



</p><p>So when the Clark County fire department began to familiarize itself with the tunnel network to conduct emergency rescue drills at the end of 2024, the question of how to deal with the muck was part of the planning process, according to planning documents reviewed by <em>Fortune</em>. Boring was slated to brief firefighters on the muck fluid before each day of the December safety drills.&nbsp;



</p><p>Preparation for the two-day fire drill began more than a month beforehand. Scripts about the hypothetical accident and evacuation were put together, five prep meetings were held, and the Fire Department stowed an approximately 200-pound mannequin dummy in a hard-to-reach location within the tunnel, so the technical rescue team could simulate an arduous evacuation, according to planning materials, documents Boring Company shared with OSHA, and the Fire Department’s subsequent review of the drills that were shared with <em>Fortune</em>.&nbsp;



</p><p>Approximately thirteen fire units arrived for the drill on December 9, parking around the training site and at the Centerfolds strip club down the street.



</p><p>The first day went as planned, but it was right after the drill on the second day, December 10, 2024, that complications ensued. After two hours in the tunnels, two firefighters reported irritation on their legs. They were taken to the hospital, where it was determined that their legs had been burned by the chemicals in Boring’s tunnel. The firefighters’ skin was permanently scarred, according to findings from the subsequent OSHA investigation, though they left the hospital later that same day and were back at work the next work shift, which was two days later, a spokeswoman for the County Fire Department says.&nbsp;</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Boring-Company-Las-Vegas-Firemeninjuries.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p><figcaption>After two hours in the tunnels, two firefighters reported irritation on their legs and were taken to the hospital.

<p>OSHA’s investigator interviewed four firefighters who were at the drill, according to notes from the interviews obtained by <em>Fortune</em> in a records request (the names of the firefighters were redacted). Three of the firefighters said that the muck fluid reached the top of their boots or above, and one of the firefighters who was burned said they had to crawl through it at one point to rescue the dummy, according to the notes. “My boots were full of muck,” they said.



</p><p>Some of the firefighters appeared not to have been aware of the risk, the notes show. “We weren’t aware of the chemicals being hazardous,” one firefighter said, according to the notes, pointing out that Boring Company had supposedly told them “we could just wash it off after” and that it was “just mud.” Another firefighter reported that the Boring Company “had someone put their full arm in the muck” and tell them “they’d be fine.”&nbsp;



</p><p>According to one former Boring employee who worked at the company at the time of the drills, workers had made an effort to clear the tunnels of the muck fluid before the fire department arrived for the exercise. “There’s no way to fully clean it,” the employee said, “Because there’s constant flow coming out of the machine, even when it’s standing still.”&nbsp;



</p><p>“We’re so used to dealing with it on a daily basis,” they added.&nbsp;

<p>Shortly after Nevada’s OSHA opened an investigation, Boring Company’s lawyers put together a response in which Boring denied any responsibility and placed full blame for the incident on the Clark County Fire Department. “The key breakdowns in the Training Plan were committed by CCFD employees, not TBC employees,” the company’s lawyer wrote in the letter. (The Fire Department maintains that “CCFD followed all recommendations from TBC” and says that OSHA found no fault with the Fire Department for the incident) In the response, Boring Company provided nearly 1,000 pages of documents that OSHA had requested, including receipts of equipment and protective gear it had purchased as well as documentation showing it had debriefed the Fire Department on the chemicals, performed safety meetings prior to the drills, and offered the use of a liner truck to transport the firefighters through the tunnel.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevada OSHA came to a different conclusion. On May 28, OSHA issued three “willful” citations against Boring. These are the most aggressive violations the agency can levy, reserved for an employer that committed an “intentional and knowing” violation or knew that a hazardous condition existed and made no “reasonable effort” to eliminate it. All three citations were categorized as “serious,” meaning there was a “substantial probability that death or serious physical harm” could have occurred.&nbsp;



</p><figure><blockquote><p>“We’re so used to dealing with it on a daily basis.”<cite>former Boring Company employee</cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>OSHA proposed penalties of $425,595 for the three citations, according to the citation notice sent to Boring Company. That may not sound like much for a company <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/elon-r-musk/">owned by the world’s richest man</a>, but it would have been the third-largest initial penalty Nevada OSHA had issued to an employer since 2015, according to a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/toppenalties" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.osha.gov/enforcement/toppenalties">public database</a> of enforcement actions that the Department of Labor keeps on its website. The median initial penalty Nevada OSHA issued in the first six months of this year was $5,142, according to OSHA.&nbsp;



</p><p>A fine of that size could also have been a public black eye for the company at a time when it was pushing to expand in Las Vegas and <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2025/07/18/tennessee-boring-co-nashville-airport-tunnel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.bizjournals.com/nashville/news/2025/07/18/tennessee-boring-co-nashville-airport-tunnel.html">win business in other cities</a>.&nbsp;



</p><h2><strong>‘Not the way it’s supposed to work’</strong></h2>



<p>When Boring Co.’s Davis called the Governor’s office the day the company received the citations, he spoke to Chris Reilly, the governor’s point person for state infrastructure, who was hired in 2024 after working at Tesla for more than seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>The next day, May 29, at 4 p.m. a coterie of high-level Nevada officials gathered to meet with a handful of Boring executives, including Davis and Tyler Fairbanks, head of project development at Boring Co., according to a copy of the meeting invite, calendar records, and independent verification by <em>Fortune</em>. The Nevada government attendees included Reilly; Dr. Kristopher Sanchez, the Governor Lombardo-appointed director of the Department of Business and Industry (DBI); as well as supervisory staff from the Division of Industry Relations (DIR), which oversees Nevada OSHA; Nevada OSHA itself, and a representative from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. (Governor Lombardo himself was not present, and was reviewing legislation at the time, according to a copy of his calendar that <em>Fortune</em> received in a records request.)



</p><p>Boring Co. had prepared a 25-page slide deck for the meeting that echoed its previous arguments and called the citations “patently absurd” and “demonstrably false.” Before the company laid out its case in the meeting, however, Nevada OSHA had already withdrawn the citations, and state officials kicked off the meeting by telling Boring Co. they had been rescinded, Nevada’s OSHA confirmed in a statement to <em>Fortune.</em> “No information provided during the meeting was the basis for the citations being withdrawn,” OSHA’s Williams said in an email.



</p><p>In an interview, Victoria Carreón, the Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations, which oversees Nevada OSHA, who was also in the meeting, said that the concerns Boring raised to the Governor’s office had led Nevada OSHA’s legal counsel to go back and review the citations ahead of the meeting.



</p><p>The state’s lawyers determined the key elements for a citation were not met and so “we decided that the best course of action was to withdraw the citation pending further review,” she said, noting that the subsequent review found that the “particular citations that were originally composed were not warranted to be reissued.”



</p><p>Reilly, the state infrastructure coordinator in Lombardo’s office, added in a statement that, in the May 29 meeting, representatives from OSHA and the Division of Industrial Relations had shared that the violations were issued without proper internal documentation, failed to consider materials previously submitted by the company refuting the violations, and “should not have been sent.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>“We decided that the best course of action was to withdraw the citation pending further review.”<cite>Victoria Carreón, Administrator of the Division of Industrial Relations</cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Nevada OSHA’s <a href="https://dir.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dirnvgov/content/Governance/NOM%20%28April%202023%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://dir.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/dirnvgov/content/Governance/NOM%20%28April%202023%29.pdf">official procedures</a> allow for an appeals process where companies can object to the citations, in writing, and set up an informal meeting with OSHA to ask for the penalties to be modified or even withdrawn. Once the governor’s office was looped in however, none of this ever happened.&nbsp;



</p><p>Multiple sources, including current and former Nevada OSHA employees, regulators, and employment lawyers, told <em>Fortune</em> that it’s inappropriate for the Governor’s office and political appointees to get involved in a specific OSHA inspection—even one involving a high-profile company. Jess Lankford, the former Nevada OSHA chief administrative officer, said the Governor’s office getting involved is “not the way it’s supposed to work.”&nbsp;



</p><h2>Irregularities in the public record and special treatment for ‘large employers’</h2>



<p>Several of the things that happened next were, even by OSHA’s admission, inconsistent with the agency’s standard process and norms. After the May 29 meeting, the three now-rescinded citations against Boring Co.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>were never mentioned again in the&nbsp;OSHA case file,&nbsp;even though documentation of their removal should have&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;in the public record, according to&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>’s review of the case file. No document was added to the file explaining or justifying their removal. “There are various missing documents, processes that weren’t followed. So we know that the policies, the procedures, were not being followed,” Nevada OSHA’s Williams acknowledged on a call with&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>.



</p><p>Moreover, a key document in OSHA’s Boring Company inspection file was altered, according to two people with knowledge of the matter and documents seen by <em>Fortune</em>. A line in the OSHA case diary—the only reference in the case file to a meeting with the Governor’s office—was deleted, the people said. <em>Fortune</em> compared the public record it received from OSHA to an earlier version obtained from sources that had been available to all agency staff on its server, and confirmed that the line item documenting the meeting had been deleted from the case diary.</p><div><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Boring-documents.jpg?w=1440&amp;q=85"></p><figcaption>Nevada OSHA includes a “case diary” in the case file, which documents step-by-step the progress of the case. An entry was included in the case diary, outlining that a meeting with Boring Company had taken place with OSHA, the Director’s Office, and the Governor’s Office on May 29, according to an early version of the case diary that was reviewed by Fortune. The below document, which was the document shared with Fortune as part of its records request, shows that the line item about the meeting was removed.</figcaption></div>



<p>“You have substantial evidence that shows there was, I’m not going to use the word illegal, but there was some questionable practices right there, having that removed,” said Lankford, the former OSHA chief administrative officer.&nbsp;



</p><p>“From an attorney’s standpoint, it looks really bad,” said Ron Zambrano, the employment litigation chair at West Coast Trial Lawyers, which represents plaintiff-side clients in California and Nevada. “You did something very unusual with this embarrassing thing, which is try to hide it,” he added.



</p><p>The case file included other discrepancies, including an incorrect date on a key document, missing worksheets detailing the rationale behind the citations that Nevada OSHA said were “apparently not saved into the file”, and another document that was “inadvertently omitted.”



</p><p>Regarding the deleted entry for the Governor’s office meeting, officials did not contest that the line item had been deleted, but emphasized that no supervisors had directed its deletion.&nbsp;



</p><p>Reilly, from Governor Lombardo’s office, said that “no record was edited at the direction of me, the Governor’s Office, DIR, B&amp;I, or any other entity I am aware of,” adding that the “insinuation” that these officers had directed such a deletion was “incorrect.” Nevada OSHA spokeswoman Williams also disputed that Nevada agencies had tried to conceal the meeting and said they were forthcoming about the meeting to <em>Fortune</em>.</p><p>Nevada OSHA updated the case file after <em>Fortune</em>’s inquiries, and shared a new copy of the case diary, in which there is now an update at the bottom, describing a May 29 “collaborative meeting w/ employer” in which Boring Company was told “OSHA was withdrawing the citation.” The case diary still no longer mentions that representatives from the Governor’s office were present.

</p><p>Meanwhile, the state has revised its OSHA policies in ways that could ultimately make it more difficult or take longer for the agency to impose such fines on larger employers like the Boring Co. Carreón, the DIR Administrator, said her agency conducted a “quality review process” after the Boring case, and implemented new policies and new procedures. Among them is a mandatory 30-day lawyer review period and notification to the Public Information Officer in “high-profile” or “large-scale employer” cases. The goal, Carreón said, is to improve the quality of Nevada OSHA case files and make sure that what was included in them would be “legally sufficient.”



</p><p>Williams stressed that OSHA employees have been assured that they have “full support” from DBI and DIR “to do their job in [a] way that ensures Nevada employees have access to a safe, healthful workplace, and businesses have confidence that the agency will regulate them in a fair and impartial manner.”&nbsp;



</p><p>Boring ended up making a few concessions with OSHA, which included monthly “update” meetings with the chief administrative officer (CAO) of Nevada OSHA. But the CAO, William Gardner, who held that role when the original citations were issued against Boring, left in July, and Carreón acknowledged that the meetings have not been taking place monthly.&nbsp;

<h2><strong>‘They won’t make sh*t safe for us’</strong></h2>



<p>In the tunnels below Las Vegas, the mission to construct the subterranean highway system continues. Three current and former Boring Co. employees, who have all worked at the company this year, say that pressure to speed up the project has heightened since June—when Steve Davis returned to his day-to-day role at the company after his brief stint helping Musk run DOGE. That month—just after the citations had been issued, then retracted—employees started seeing Davis around again. Three employees who worked at Boring in June said they would see Davis being whisked to and from various project sites, escorted by an armed bodyguard in a Cadillac Escalade.&nbsp;</p><p>Five current and former Boring employees who spoke with <em>Fortune</em> say the same safety issues persist, with two reporting that chemical burns seem to happen “daily.” When asked to describe safety protocols and training, one employee who left in recent weeks put it simply: “There is none.”&nbsp;



</p><p>“PPE has been provided to the Boring Company workers as well as the firefighters. Accelerant is an integral part of the process and will continue to be used. The Boring Company is working to limit workers’ exposure and is making progress, but properly used PPE remains the correct way for employees to protect themselves,” says a spokeswoman from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, the government marketing agency that pays Boring Company to operate the tunnel system below the Convention Center and has overseen the initial project construction.



</p><p>Within Nevada’s workplace safety watchdog agency, meanwhile, the unusual reversal of the citations is having ripple effects. Two staffers say they were alarmed by the handling of the incident and the speed at which the citations were withdrawn, and that these actions have made agency employees fear inspecting or regulating Boring Co. in the future, particularly because two employees that worked on the Boring Co. investigation were demoted or written up (Williams said Nevada OSHA wouldn’t comment on “specific personnel actions taken in this case or any other.”) One of the people who worked on the case said that they and many colleagues worried that the agency’s ability to independently enforce safe working conditions and accountability had been compromised in order to appease one of Nevada’s (and the world’s) most high-profile business magnates.



</p><figure><blockquote><p>“It’s very political right now.”<cite>Current OSHA employee</cite></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>The events may even have <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/boring-company-drilling-fluid-fine-wastewater-elon-musk/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/boring-company-drilling-fluid-fine-wastewater-elon-musk/">emboldened</a> Boring Company in its interactions with regulators. In mid-August, Clark County’s environmental regulators allege, Boring workers refused to stop dumping wastewater down manholes around Las Vegas and later “feigned compliance” and made false statements to inspectors about when the dumping had started, according to documents sent to Boring Company from the Clark County Water Reclamation District. The episode ended up causing “substantial damage” to the broader county infrastructure, and the regulator fined Boring Company nearly $500,000, the documents show. (Boring has not responded to <em>Fortune</em>’s multiple requests for comment on the matter)</p><p>To date, Boring has never paid a penalty to Nevada OSHA for any safety incidents on its job sites. The company is still contesting eight citations issued in 2023 by Nevada OSHA. As Boring Co. has plowed ahead, Nevada OSHA has been one of the few checks on its practices. But the events of this spring have led some to call into question OSHA’s willingness or ability to wield its own authority.



</p><p>For those underground, digging the tunnels, a perceived lack of consequence has sent a clear message:&nbsp; “It seems like people are going to have to die, because they won’t make sh*t safe for us,” one current Boring employee says.

      <p>The ability to recognize and avoid pathogens is essential for survival. In some cases, animals recognize molecules produced by pathogens, allowing them to mount an immediate response. In other cases, animals learn to avoid the pathogen after they have been exposed to it – a phenomenon that is called “learned avoidance”.</p>
<p>The worm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> can learn to avoid <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, a pathogenic bacterium that causes disease in a range of species (<a href="#bib7">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). In 2019, Coleen Murphy and colleagues at Princeton University observed that learned avoidance of the PA14 strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> could be transmitted for up to four generations of <i>C. elegans</i> without new exposure to PA14 (<a href="#bib6">Moore et al., 2019</a>; <a href="#bib3">Kaletsky et al., 2020</a>). This transgenerational epigenetic inheritance allows animals that have never encountered PA14 to benefit from the experiences of previous generations.</p>
<p>Recently, Craig Hunter and colleagues at Harvard University questioned the inheritance of learned avoidance to the F2 generation (<a href="#bib2">Gainey et al., 2025</a>). While they observed learned avoidance to PA14 in parents (P0) and their progeny (F1), they did not observe avoidance in the F2 generation. The Murphy group responded, contending that the inability to observe transgenerational epigenetic inheritance was due to changes the Hunter group made to the original experimental protocols (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). Now, in eLife, Andres Vidal-Gadea and colleagues at Illinois State University – Aalimah Akinosho, Joseph Alexander and Kyle Floyd – report that they have confirmed findings from the Murphy group by showing that learned avoidance of PA14 is passed on to the F2 generation (<a href="#bib1">Akinosho et al., 2025</a>).</p>
<p>In a standard avoidance assay, test spots of bacteria are placed at opposite ends of an agar plate, and sodium azide – a chemical that immobilizes worms – is added to each test spot (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). The worms are placed at the center of the plate and allowed to roam, and the number of worms in proximity to each test spot is scored after one hour (<a href="#bib6">Moore et al., 2019</a>).</p>

                <p>An avoidance assay (top row) measures the ability of <i>C. elegans</i> worms to avoid specific bacteria. The worms are first grown on OP50 (orange; top left), a non-pathogenic strain of the bacterium <i>E. coli</i> that is the standard laboratory diet of <i>C. elegans,</i> before transfering them to a test plate. Spots of each bacterium are placed at opposite ends of a petri dish (top right), the worms are allowed to roam, and their position after a set period of time is recorded. When worms grown on OP50 encounter the pathogenic PA14 strain of <i>P. aeruginosa</i> (green) for the first time, they are initially attracted to it (top right). However, when worms are exposed to PA14 before the avoidance assay, they avoid PA14 during the assay (second row). This learned avoidance can be passed on to the next generation (F1; third row) and the generation after that (F2; fourth row), without these worms needing to encounter PA14.</p>

<p>For the learned avoidance assay, the worms are exposed to PA14 for 24 hours, a process sometimes called “training”, after which time they are collected and washed. A subset of these worms is transferred to a test plate and allowed to choose between PA14 and the OP50 strain of <i>E. coli</i> (which is the standard laboratory diet of <i>C. elegans</i>). This is the parental generation, and the worms in it will avoid PA14.</p>
<p>Eggs (F1) are collected from the remaining worms and transferred to standard OP50 plates. Once they reach the adult stage, the same process is carried out; a subset of animals is tested, and eggs are collected from the remaining worms for the next generation (F2). Importantly, after the parental generation, worms do not encounter PA14 before testing, but they retain the learned avoidance of the parental generation. To measure learned avoidance, all groups are compared to animals whose predecessors have never encountered PA14.</p>
<p>Both the Murphy and Vidal-Gadea groups used sodium azide in their assays to immobilize the worms, while the Hunter group immobilized them by lowering the temperature to 4 °C at the end of the assay. With azide, worms that reach the test spots before the end of the assay are immobilized. By contrast, when the temperature shift method is used, worms can come into contact with the test spots and then move away before the end of the assay. The Murphy group proposed that the use of azide ensured that animals were captured in their initial response, which prevented them from learning to avoid PA14 after encountering it during the assay. However, they argued, when the temperature-shift method is used, worms can encounter PA14, learn from this encounter, and avoid the PA14 spot (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). Put simply, an encounter with PA14 could unintentionally introduce another source of learned avoidance to the assay. The most significant impact of this would be on the negative control, where it is assumed that the worms’ response reflects that of animals that have never encountered PA14.</p>
<p>Worms that have not previously encountered PA14 are initially attracted to it (<a href="#bib7">Zhang et al., 2005</a>). While the Murphy group consistently observed this attraction in their assays, the Hunter group generally did not (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). The Vidal-Gadea group also observed that worms that had not been exposed to PA14 were initially attracted to it, suggesting that this is an important piece of the puzzle (<a href="#bib1">Akinosho et al., 2025</a>). Indeed, when tested directly, the Murphy group did not observe attraction using the temperature-shift method (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>). However, whether the omission of azide alone explains the discrepancy between the studies is not clear. In a handful of assays, the Hunter group used azide but failed to see the initial attraction to PA14, or to observe learned avoidance in the F2 generation.</p>
<p>P11, a small RNA produced by PA14, is necessary and sufficient to induce transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (<a href="#bib3">Kaletsky et al., 2020</a>). In addition, loss of P11 reduces chemoattraction to PA14 by reducing ammonia production (<a href="#bib5">Marogi et al., 2024</a>). The Murphy lab proposed that suboptimal P11 expression could explain difficulties in reproducing transgenerational epigenetic inheritance and in observing the initial attraction to PA14. Although they did not measure P11 levels, the Hunter group argued that their ability to observe learned avoidance in the F1 generation excluded the possibility that P11 expression was insufficient. PA14 growth conditions can alter P11 expression (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>), but whether low levels of P11 could permit F1 inheritance but not F2, is unknown.</p>
<p>Behavioral assays are notoriously finicky, not because they measure effects that are not robust, but because <i>C. elegans</i> are highly attuned to their environments; they integrate a myriad of environmental signals into an appropriate response. Hunter and colleagues tested potential sources of variability in the laboratory environment, including the sources of bacterial and worm strains, but none of these explained the discrepancy in their findings. The sources of variability identified by the Murphy lab (<a href="#bib4">Kaletsky et al., 2025</a>) provide a logical explanation for the differences between the two studies, but other unidentified environmental or procedural differences may also have contributed. The results of the Vidal-Gadea group, therefore, represent an important validation of the work of the Murphy group, and support the idea that procedural modifications made by the Hunter group contributed to their inability to observe transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.</p>

<p>FBI Director Kash Patel granted waivers to Deputy Director Dan Bongino and two other newly hired senior FBI staff members, exempting them from passing polygraph exams normally required to gain access to America’s most sensitive classified information, according to a former senior FBI official and several other government officials.</p>



<p>Bongino’s role as the FBI’s second-highest-ranking official means he is responsible for day-to-day operations of the agency, including green-lighting surveillance missions, coordinating with intelligence agency partners and managing the bureau’s 56 field offices across the country. The deputy director receives some of the country’s most closely held secrets, including the President’s Daily Brief, which also contains intelligence from the CIA and the National Security Agency.</p>



<p>People familiar with the matter say his ascent to that position without passing a standard FBI background check was unprecedented. ProPublica spoke with four people familiar with the polygraph issues, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation and because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the details of FBI background checks.</p>



<p>Bongino was selected for the role at the FBI although he, like Patel, had no prior experience at the bureau. Bongino had previously served in the Secret Service and worked as a New York City police officer. But he later gained millions of fans and followers in conservative circles for television and podcast appearances, having taken over Rush Limbaugh’s spot on numerous radio stations. Over the years, Bongino used those platforms to push <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/01/03/dan-bongino-and-the-big-business-of-returning-trump-to-power">conspiracy theories</a> about the 2020 election and professed his allegiance to President Donald Trump while railing against the agency he now helps lead.</p>



<p>He’s had a rocky tenure so far, marked by public fights with senior Cabinet officials and accusations that he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/11/us/politics/jeffrey-epstein-pam-bondi-dan-bongino-clash.html">leaked information</a> to the press, which Bongino denied. In August, Trump appointed Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey as co-deputy director at the FBI, setting off speculation that the White House had lost faith in Bongino. But he remains in the job.</p>



<p>ProPublica could not determine whether Bongino sat for a polygraph exam or what its results were. Though the existence of a polygraph waiver is an indication he may not have passed the test, it is possible Bongino received a preemptive exemption, a former senior FBI official with knowledge of the vetting program told ProPublica.</p>




<p>When ProPublica sought comment from the FBI, the agency denied that Bongino or the other senior staff members failed polygraph tests. “It is <strong>false</strong> that the individuals you referenced failed polygraphs,” wrote spokesperson Ben Williamson.</p>



<p>He added: “The FBI follows all laws and procedures on personnel security measures, and any implication otherwise is false. Furthermore, while the FBI does not comment on confidential security information, particularly in matters of personnel, this article is riddled with falsehoods — it misrepresents polygraph protocol, inaccurately portrays FBI security measures, and makes multiple false claims about FBI employees who have done nothing wrong.”</p>



<p>ProPublica asked the FBI to specify what it considered to be false. The agency did not reply.</p>



<p>A polygraph exam is not technically pass or fail, but a person is not cleared for approval if the examiner finds deception or is unable to reach a conclusion about the veracity of the answers given. Officials said that a person may not have technically failed the exams; the results could be deemed inconclusive, which would not meet the FBI’s standards for hiring or security clearances.</p>



<p>The FBI spokesperson initially said the three officials are so-called Schedule C — a category reserved for political appointees. He said the status would mean they were “not required” to undergo polygraphs. But Daniel Meyer, a former executive director for the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community External Review Panel, told ProPublica that an FBI employee wouldn’t be excluded from taking a polygraph exam simply because they’re a Schedule C employee. Three other lawyers, who specialize in national security matters, said the same.</p>



<p>In fact, the FBI’s <a href="https://fbijobs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/guide_eligibility.pdf">employment eligibility guidelines say</a> all employees must obtain a “Top Secret” clearance in order to work at the agency following a background check. “The preliminary employment requirements include a polygraph examination,” the guidelines say.</p>

Santiago/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-did-they-survive">“How Did They Survive?”</h3>



<p>Former FBI officials said they could not recall a single instance in which a senior official like Bongino received a waiver and was then given a top secret clearance. One said they were only aware of one waiver being issued in a seven-year period under Director Christopher Wray, for an outside subject matter expert whose polygraph results were inconclusive.</p>



<p>Two other officials, Marshall Yates, the agency’s liaison with Congress, and Nicole Rucker, Patel’s personal assistant, did not clear their polygraph exam and were granted waivers by Patel that allowed them to get a high-level security clearance, said officials with knowledge of the issue. Neither of their roles is as high-profile as Bongino’s, nor does either one have prior FBI experience.</p>



<p>Polygraph examiners ask a standard list of questions about drug use, criminal history, foreign contacts and mishandling of classified information. After the exam, an analyst scrutinizes the results and decides whether or not they indicate deception or are inconclusive. Those whose answers are determined to be inconclusive are given another chance to take the test the following day.</p>



<p>“I don’t know of anybody in my time that were in those senior roles that failed polygraphs, and most of us had taken multiple polygraphs,” said Bob Anderson, a former FBI executive who ran the counterintelligence division and retired in 2016. “If somebody would fail those polygraphs in my time, most likely they would be removed out of the classified environment until that could get cleared.”</p>



<p>This year, an employee within the FBI’s Security Division filed a formal complaint alleging the waivers violated agency policy. The Security Division conducts employee polygraph exams and evaluates their results. Its mission is to protect the FBI from leaks of classified information and infiltration by foreign spies. The employee filed the complaint with the division director, Robert Turner, a 22-year veteran of the bureau who previously held roles in counterterrorism and counterespionage.</p>



<p>A complaint about the waivers was also shared with the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General, sources said.</p>




<p>According to her resume, Rucker, 40, has served as an assistant to Stephen Miller, the powerful architect of the administration’s immigration crackdown, since January 2020.</p>



<p>Rucker would have detailed insight into day-to-day FBI operations and those meeting within the director’s office. She also assists in planning Patel’s travel, a former FBI official familiar with her job responsibilities said.</p>



<p>The White House said Rucker is not sharing information on the FBI’s operations with Miller and referred further questions to the bureau and the Department of Justice.</p>



<p>Meanwhile Yates, 37, was <a href="https://dc.hillsdale.edu/Profiles/Marshall-Yates/">previously</a> the executive director of the Election Integrity Network, a group that worked to overturn the results of the 2020 election. <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/marshall-yates-named-assistant-director-of-the-office-of-congressional-affairs">Yates</a>, as the top liaison between the bureau and Congress, has wide visibility into the workforce, including some access to internal files about past investigations.</p>



<p>Historically, the job was staffed by a nonpartisan career FBI or Department of Justice official with deep knowledge of the bureau. Among other tasks, the official organizes closed-door briefings with lawmakers to discuss active, undisclosed threats to the country.</p>



<p>While an FBI spokesperson discussed the polygraph issues with ProPublica, Patel, Bongino, Yates, Rucker and Turner did not respond to direct requests for comment.</p>



<p>Sen. Dick Durbin, the Democratic ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, raised the issue of senior FBI leadership not passing polygraphs — without identifying any individuals — when Patel testified before the committee in September.</p>



<p>“As I understand it from highly credible sources, key members of Director Patel’s senior executive team and others on the seventh floor had disqualifying alerts on their initial polygraph exams,” Durbin said. “How did they survive? They survived because of a personal waiver by either the director or the attorney general to remain employed by the bureau.”</p>



<p>When Durbin asked Patel if anyone on his senior executive team received “disqualifying alerts on their polygraphs,” Patel refused to answer. And when the senator followed up by asking if he or Attorney General Pam Bondi granted a waiver, Patel replied, “I have to get back to you.”</p>



<p>The FBI did not respond to the committee on questions concerning polygraphs, according to a person familiar with the matter.</p>



<p>Durbin, in a statement to ProPublica, said, “Reports of disqualifying alerts on polygraphs by senior FBI officials — which require personal waivers from the highest levels of leadership to remain employed — are deeply alarming.”</p>



<h3 id="h-heart-rate-check">Heart Rate Check</h3>



<p>The polygraph exam uses a device strapped to a subject’s body to measure physiological responses like heart rate, blood pressure and perspiration as the person answers yes-or-no questions. Though the device’s efficacy is debated, it is routinely used in America’s law enforcement and intelligence agencies to screen potential employees and conduct leak investigations. The FBI first began requiring the polygraph exam for all applicants in 1994, according to a <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/GOVPUB-J37-PURL-gpo133846">2006 report by the Department of Justice’s Office of the Inspector General</a>.</p>




<p>They are used as part of a broader background check conducted on all potential FBI employees to determine if the applicant triggers any national security or suitability concerns. Suitability refers to a candidate’s criminal history, drug use or other issues that would prevent them from becoming employees of a federal law enforcement agency.</p>



<p>FBI security measures are designed to protect sensitive intelligence sources and information, and the screening is intended to ensure that officials given access to this information have cleared a thorough vetting process.</p>



<p>Staff who work in the director’s office on the seventh floor of the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington must also obtain an additional clearance called SCI, or sensitive compartmented information.</p>



<p>SCI contains some of America’s most sensitive intelligence secrets, and employees with that clearance are “read-in” to various compartments or programs. Bongino, Yates and Rucker all obtained SCI clearances after being granted the waivers, people familiar with their clearance level said.</p>



<p>In addition to bringing on loyalists, the administration has launched a purge of career FBI staff since January. More than 50 bureau officials have been fired or pushed out, a ProPublica analysis found. They include executives with decades of counterterrorism and intelligence experience, as well as line agents assigned to work on politically sensitive criminal probes, including investigations into Jan. 6 rioters and Trump.</p>



<p>Patel has justified these firings under Article II of the Constitution, which outlines the president’s powers over government — a novel use of the statute that is being challenged in the courts. Publicly, the administration has suggested some fired agents were involved in misconduct while investigating Trump or his allies.</p>



<p>Former acting FBI Director Brian Driscoll <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.284697/gov.uscourts.dcd.284697.1.0_3.pdf">sued Patel, Bondi and the bureau</a> in September, saying he was subjected to political loyalty tests and illegally fired. The FBI declined to comment when the suit was filed and federal agencies have yet to respond in court.</p>



<p>The FBI has recently used the polygraph to ask senior employees if they have said anything negative about Patel or had spoken to the media, multiple former FBI employees said. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/10/us/politics/fbi-polygraph-kash-patel.html">earlier reported</a> the use of polygraphs to investigate negative comments about Patel.</p>



<h3 id="h-destined-for-something-greater">Destined for Something Greater</h3>



<p>A lawyer by training, Yates has been the point person in <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/07/yates.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">responding to inquiries</a> from Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a Republican who for months has been publishing internal FBI documents, which he contends show improper past investigations into Trump. According to a former senior FBI official, Yates called regional bureau field offices early this year to get lists of employees involved in cases against Trump; several of those agents were later fired by Patel.</p>



<p>Originally from Alabama, Yates previously worked as chief of staff for former Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and was counsel to Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. A Democratic representative <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/judge-dismisses-claims-rep-mo-brooks-incited-capitol-riot-rcna19465">accused Brooks of inciting rioters</a> on Jan. 6, which Brooks denied; the civil case was later dismissed. Brooks has described the FBI as “partisan hacks.” Massie wrote on social media this month, “Capitol Police turned CIA orchestrated the pipe bombs on January 6th, and the FBI has covered it up.”</p>



<p>Little is known about Nicole Rucker, who spells her name online as Nikole. Multiple sources have described Rucker as Patel’s personal assistant. She joined Patel on a recent foreign trip to London, where she sat in on a sensitive meeting with a Western intelligence ally, according to a knowledgeable source.</p>



<p>Rucker arrived at the FBI on Jan. 20 and began working in the director’s suite without a security clearance, according to a former FBI employee familiar with her work.</p>




<p>Due to her initial lack of clearance, Rucker was escorted from the FBI lobby to the secure director’s suite by Turner, who was then the deputy of the FBI’s Security Division. Rucker eventually obtained a security clearance and was no longer escorted, the person said.</p>



<p>Williamson, the FBI spokesperson, said “people are escorted in similar circumstances all the time.”</p>



<p>In May, Rucker’s husband posted a photo on LinkedIn with himself and Rucker alongside Patel, standing in front of the FBI logo.</p>



<p>On her resume, she also lists a job working as the executive assistant to the chief of public affairs at the National Museum of African American History and Culture from 2018 to 2019. After that, she was a congressional relations liaison at Ultra Electronics, a British defense contractor.</p>



<p>Rucker founded Cobblestone Concierge, which offers personal assistant services such as “home management, organization, errand service and so much more!” according to her LinkedIn profile. The company’s website says its services include “household management (including meeting the cable guy).”</p>



<p>ProPublica interviewed her ex-husband, Joseph Churchville, who said Rucker worked at a title insurance company while they were married but had always thought she was destined for something greater. “She’s tenacious. When she acquires something that she wants, she has the ability to make things happen,” Churchville said.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="body">

<p>In the human world, wealth inequality arguably has more of an impact on lives and relationships than physical differences like distance and energy. We need to have meaningful discussions about structural class differences, and segmenting the population based on wealth is an obvious starting point.</p>

<p>Wealth, like most quantities, doesn’t need precision beyond the exponent to expose some sharp differences between wealth classes, and sharp similarities within a wealth class.</p>
<p>It’s not useful to compare relative wealth within a wealth level, except perhaps to say “lower” (at risk of falling to a lower level) or “upper” (the next level higher is within reach). For wealth specifically, using any further precision easily leads to direct wealth comparisons between members of the same level, which then leads to jealousy and discontent, rather than insight into the core issue.</p>
<h3 id="general-scale">General scale</h3>
<p>For the quantitative treatment, we need to anchor the scale, but using exact values is not possible due to inflation. On a mag scale, inflation happens pretty slowly (↑1.5 from 1900-2025 in the US–about 30x), but this consistent drift can’t be ignored, even in Mag World.</p>
<p>This scale is calibrated on US dollars in the early 1980s; this aligns with some basic cultural expectations around wealth. For instance, that a dollar can still buy something useful, and that a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/net-worth-needed-to-be-considered-wealthy-in-major-us-cities.html">“millionaire” is considered wealthy</a>. To translate 2024 US dollars into mag wealth, divide by 3 (or ↑0.5).</p>
<p>All dollar values are given in 2024 US dollars for convenience.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-levels">Wealth Levels</h3>
<p>These wealth levels have existed throughout human history, even though the unit of currency changes.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-destitute-less-than-3">↑-1 Wealth: Destitute (less than $3)</h3>
<p>At the bottom-most level, a person can’t even scrape together a few bucks for some food. Societal services aren’t accessible unless they are completely free. Finding a toilet and shower may be difficult. They have no possessions; their shoes and coat are probably decrepit and dirty.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-broke-3-30">↑0 Wealth: Broke ($3-$30)</h3>
<p>At ↑0 wealth, a person can’t pull together $30.</p>
<p>Daily shelter and sustenance are at the mercy of other people. If they are not sleeping on the streets, then they are in public shelters, or squatting, or staying with relatives. (Few people will provide long-term housing for a friend with no money.) They need to hustle every single day for their needs, whether through mooching or begging or stealing.</p>
<p>Employment is not possible without support; even day-laborers need breakfast and transportation to the pickup site. Without a permanent address you <a href="https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor">can’t even donate blood plasma</a>.</p>
<p>People at this level can’t borrow money, even from friends and relatives, because any lender would be foolish to expect repayment.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-poor-30-300">↑1 Wealth: Poor ($30-$300)</h3>
<p>At ↑1 wealth, a person can reliably scrape together $10, maybe $50 or $100, but they might have to sell their body or blood to do it.</p>
<p>Housing at ↑1 is almost as tenuous as ↑0. If not living out of their car, they are couch-surfing; if they have a permanent address, they are living with someone else and paying a low or flexible amount of rent.</p>
<p>They may not have a bank account, or if they do, it is in danger of being overdrawn.</p>
<p>If they have a car, it’s a junker, and it has less than a quarter tank of gas.</p>
<p>They work odd jobs. They might get a windfall of $300 from a generous client or a lottery scratch-off ticket, but they would likely spend it immediately on essentials they have been putting off.</p>
<p>Hard drugs are plentiful at this level.</p>
<p>At ↑1, no institution will lend them any amount of money, though friends or relatives might. Church and religious community can be very helpful with food banks and meal services, even if the recipient isn’t religious.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-lower-class-300-3k">↑2 Wealth: Lower class ($300-$3k)</h3>
<p>At ↑2 wealth, a person could probably pull together a few thousand dollars, but it would likely involve a substantial amount of hustle and/or usury.</p>
<p>People at ↑2 wealth have some kind of steady employment, maybe minimum wage, and they make enough money to have a permanent address. They get benefits at their employer’s discretion (so probably not).</p>
<p>At ↑2 a bank account becomes necessary, to deposit paychecks and pay bills. It can be a challenge to avoid bank overdrafts. They are likely to have bad credit or no credit, and use a debit card. If they need money and are upper ↑2, they may have a credit card with a small limit. At lower ↑2 they might get a payday loan. They probably can’t or shouldn’t pay it off straight from their bank account, because they need to make sure rent and groceries are paid first. Basic money management skills like budgeting and cashflow are required to move from lower ↑2 to upper ↑2.</p>
<p>A hallmark of ↑2 is unstable housing and/or rotating roommates. Good and cheap situations are hard to come by, and when they do, they don’t generally last, so people at ↑2 wealth are often have to move frequently. Sometimes they find a stable situation that’s cheap enough, but it’s sketchy or unpleasant or both, and they put up with it because it’s the best of bad options. Often this involves a roommate; more than 2 (non-family) roommates is almost inherently an unstable configuration, which increases roommate turnover too.</p>
<p>Living with immediate family is common. If they live alone, it is in subsidized housing, or a very small studio.</p>
<p>At ↑2, they can’t maintain their life for more than a month without working or outside support (possibly unemployment). Vacations are exclusively long weekends or during holidays. A week off work is a luxury and a 2 week vacation abroad would be a once-in-a-lifetime event.</p>
<p>They can buy a nice little thing for themselves here and there. They probably feel guilty about it. They appreciate gifts of nice things they can technically afford but wouldn’t buy themselves. But not expensive things. It’s hard enough to get money to repair or replace items that break down, so durable goods are often in a state of disrepair. They can’t reasonably sell an expensive item to replace things they might need more; and if the expensive item itself breaks, repairs will be more expensive. So a ↑3 gift (some thousands of dollars) would be kind of overwhelming to someone at ↑2, unless it’s a car. A gift that cost more than ↑3 would be weird or confusing.</p>
<p>In the US, people at ↑2 are generally eligible for some kind of government assistance, and have more ability to collect it reliably: food stamps, Section 8 housing. But many programs restrict assets to ↑2 (Medicaid is restricted to having less than $2000 in the bank).</p>
<h3 id="wealth-working-class-3k-30k">↑3 Wealth: Working class ($3k-$30k)</h3>
<p>↑3 wealth is lower-middle class. They can pull together a few thousand bucks if their car breaks down, but it hurts. They can buy a used car if they have to replace it, or a new car on a payment plan.</p>
<p>Credit cards and car loans are the hallmarks of this level: people are likely to have more creditors than bank accounts. If they are lower ↑3 they carry credit card debt and may have to juggle some things around to fund an emergency expense. If they are upper ↑3 they can manage to carry an extra balance for a few months.</p>
<p>One big unexpected expense could put them deep into debt, which is one way they could become stuck here.</p>
<p>They rent and their housing situation has been stable for years. They can make a deliberate choice about where to live and could even move cities, but that’s uncommon at this level.</p>
<p>If they lose their job, it’s financially stressful, but they can make it a few months without income. Upper ↑3 could even make it a year if they maxed out their credit cards. They generally can choose where to work, and to leave terrible work environments. Their hours are dictated.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-middle-class-30k-300k">↑4 Wealth: Middle class ($30k-$300k)</h3>
<p>↑4 wealth is middle class. This includes young professionals, middle-aged small business owners, and older tradesmen.</p>
<p>At ↑4, they have a foothold in society; shrewd operators can climb from here.</p>
<p>Unburdened by debt (or only having “smart” debt, like low-interest fixed-rate loans), they have probably 6 months savings, the start of a retirement account, they’re doing the financial things you’re supposed to do. They probably dabble in investing, if only with that retirement account.</p>
<p>They are a relatively recent (under 10 years) home-owner, or they rent a decent place. They have an extra bedroom as an office or for guests.</p>
<p>They have the first taste of relative freedoms. They can take longer and/or more frequent vacations; a month for a significant overseas trip is not out of the question.</p>
<p>They may have bought a new car, but it’s probably not fancy unless they’re showing off. They either own property or are looking for property or saving up to buy property.</p>
<p>If they lose their job or their business is not doing well, they can last a year, maybe a few more if they are at upper ↑4 or can reduce their expenses to ↑3 levels.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-comfortable-300k-3m">↑5 Wealth: Comfortable ($300k-$3m)</h3>
<p>At ↑5 wealth, a person is upper-middle class; they can pull together hundreds of thousands of dollars. Enough to buy a house and live comfortably. Money is no longer the primary obstacle in their life.</p>
<p>They’ve figured out the things they want, and they can have them. Not the best of everything, but the best of <em>some</em> things, the things that matter to them.</p>
<p>They have a money market account and know how to trade equities.</p>
<p>If they need a substantial amount of money, they can borrow from their retirement accounts, mortgage their house, or sell some investments.</p>
<p>If they are older, they are retired, and they may be able to leave some ↑4 or even ↑5 wealth to their children. If younger, they may not be able to retire, but they also don’t have to work this year, or the next, or the next.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-rich-3m-30m">↑6 Wealth: Rich ($3m-$30m)</h3>
<p>A person with lower ↑6 wealth is a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-net-worth_individual">high-net-worth individual</a>” (HNWI, $1m), and a person with upper ↑6 wealth is a “very-high-net-worth individual” (VHNWI, $5m).</p>
<p>Colloquially, they’re “rich”. Employment is generally optional.</p>
<p>How do they bank? Where do they live? What kind of debt and other monetary instruments do they use?</p>
<p>About 16 million people (↑7) are designated as HNWI.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-ultra-rich-30m-300m">↑7 Wealth: Ultra-rich ($30m-$300m)</h3>
<p>A person with ↑7 wealth is an “ultra-high-net-worth individual” (UHNWI, $30m+). About 250,000 people (↑5.5) are designated as UHNWI, with over 10% of the world’s wealth combined.</p>
<p>This is a huge amount of money: 10x more wealthy than merely “rich”. This is absolutely generational wealth–buying any kind of normal thing, even a house, won’t even make a dent in their wealth. In fact, ↑6 and ↑7 things usually retain or appreciate their value over time (like real estate or fine art).</p>
<p>UHNW individuals “have, on average, eight cars and three or four homes. Three-quarters own a jet aircraft and most have a yacht.” (2006)</p>
<p>They have staff, to manage their money and their properties (multiple). If they have children, they have a full-time nanny or au pair.</p>
<p>Tax management is key at this level. They use offshore tax havens.</p>
<p>If they need money, they go to their investment bank and borrow against their investments, which might be illiquid, or they don’t want to sell for tax purposes.</p>
<p>Proposed “wealth taxes” would only apply to people with at least ↑7 wealth.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-ultra-ultra-rich-300m-3b">↑8 Wealth: Ultra-ultra rich ($300m-$3b)</h3>
<p>At ↑8 wealth, a person has hundreds of millions of dollars. At ↑8.5 wealth they become a “billionaire”. In 2024, about 50,000 people (↑4.5) have ↑8 wealth, including ↑4 billionaires.</p>
<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/BuyBorrowDieExplained/comments/1f26rsf/buy_borrow_die_explained/">Buy, Borrow, Die</a> is a tax minimization strategy that only works at ↑8 and above.</p>
<h3 id="wealth-multi-billionaire-3b-30b">↑9 Wealth: Multi-Billionaire ($3b-$30b)</h3>
<p>The world has always been fascinated by people with ludicrous amounts of wealth and power. Usually there are just a few sovereigns and family dynasties in this category.</p>
<p>In 1990, about 250 people (↑2.5) had ↑9 wealth. In 2024, about 2500 people (↑3.5) have ↑9 wealth.</p>
<h3 id="ultra-billionaire-30b-300b">↑10: Ultra-Billionaire ($30b-$300b)</h3>
<p>In 1990, the <a href="https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/09/10/73983/">richest people</a> were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassanal_Bolkiah">Sultan of Brunei</a> (2024US$60b), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia">King Fahd of Saudi Arabia</a> (2024US$43b), and <a href="">Queen Elizabeth II of England</a> (2024US$28b). Also the Mars family, the Newhouse family, and the Reichmann family with about $30b each. This is ↑10 wealth.</p>
<p>In 2024, there are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/">over 200 people</a> with ↑10 wealth. 15 of those people have ↑10.5 wealth (over $100b).</p>
<p>The ultra rich as a class have gotten 10x wealthier in the last 30 years, and that’s after adjusting for inflation.</p>
<p>Note that Forbes only started publishing a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seankilachand/2012/03/21/forbes-history-the-original-1987-list-of-international-billionaires/">list of billionaires in 1987</a>. Prior to that, they just did an article on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/28/business/forbes-s-list-of-the-richest.html">“worlds richest people” (1983)</a> separated into three strata (lower ↑8, upper ↑8, ↑9) without maintaining a complete and ordered list.</p>
<h3 id="megacorps-300b-3t">↑11: Megacorps ($300b-$3t)</h3>
<p>Some lists of the <a href="https://historycollection.com/20-of-the-wealthiest-individuals-throughout-history/">wealthiest people in history</a> speculate that Ford, Vanderbilt, Carnegie, and Rockefeller had the equivalent of ↑11 wealth, but that’s when calculated as a percentage of GDP and scaled up. Adjusting for literal inflation, none of them even come close.</p>
<p>A handful of corporations in history, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company">Dutch East India Company</a> and Standard Oil, had valuations of ↑11. In modern times, it’s Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Tesla at upper ↑11, and another 20 or so companies at lower ↑11 valuations.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<h3 id="national-wealth-compared-with-personal-wealth">National Wealth compared with personal wealth</h3>
<p>A country’s “national wealth” is the total value of net wealth owned by its residents. For context, the entire world has ↑14.7 wealth (about $500 trillion).</p>
<ul>
<li>↑10: tiny and/or poor countries: Sudan, Albania, Laos.</li>
<li>↑11: small and/or modest countries: Ethiopia, Hungary, Ukraine, Pakistan, Malaysia.</li>
<li>↑12: Africa; large and/or rich countries: Spain, Mexico, Brazil, Russia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, 30 others.</li>
<li>↑13: major countries: Japan, Germany, UK, France, India, Canada, Italy.</li>
<li>↑14: US, China.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taiwan (23m or ↑7 people) has as much wealth as the entire continent of Africa (with ↑9 people).</li>
<li>Elon Musk (1 person) has as much wealth as Ethiopia (which has ↑8 people).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="us-budget">US Budget</h3>
<p>For instance, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/historical-tables/">US budget</a> was:</p>
<ul>
<li>↑8.8 in 1910</li>
<li>↑9 in 1917</li>
<li>↑10 in 1918</li>
<li>↑11 in 1960</li>
<li>↑12 in 1990</li>
<li>↑12.8 in 2020</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of World War I, the US budget grew 10x in one year (actually it was almost 20x from 1916-1919)! (If you look at the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/hist01z1_fy2025.xlsx">linked spreadsheet</a>, it recedes to ↑9.5 during the Great Depression, before climbing again to ↑10 in 1940.)</p>
<p>So you can see that from 1910 to 2020, the US budget grew ↑4 (10,000x). This seems like a lot!</p>
<p>But GDP growth was ↑3.5 (from $↑11 in 1930 to $↑14.5 in 2025) over roughly the same time period, and US population growth was ↑0.5 (from ↑8 to ↑8.5 people). This makes sense, that the cost of government scales with its nation’s economy and population.</p>
<p>Factoring in inflation of ↑1.5, we might hypothesize that the US federal budget increased in the past 100 years due to population growth (3x), inflation (30x), and GDP growth (100x). A lot more would have to be done to support this theory, but it’s a very reasonable starting place.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>This post describes my experience using Linux on the <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/my/products/computing/pc/ap/notebooks/lifebook-u729/">Fujitsu Lifebook
U729</a>. The tl;dr is that it’s a delightful laptop, and Linux runs
flawlessly, and all the hardware things I’ve needed run OOTB. The only
difficulty I had was in disabling Secure Boot, but I figured out how to do it,
which I explain below.</p>

</ol>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>From early 2024 my daily driver was an M2 MacBook Air, until earlier this year I
broke the screen, and the repair was quoted at almost 1000 AUD. Since I used it
as a desktop most of the time, this didn’t affect me much. After some
flip-flopping I decided to get an M4 Mac mini. Partly for the faster CPU and
more RAM, but partly because I liked the idea of LARPing like it’s the 2000s,
when computers, and by extension the Internet, where fixed in physical space,
rather than following everyone around.</p>

<p>Of course this was a terrible idea. I had three working computers—a
Linux+Windows desktop, a Mac Mini, and a MacBook Air that I could use as a
desktop—and none of them were portable. When I went to <a href="https://rustforgeconf.com/">RustForge 2025</a> I
just brought my phone. If I wanted to travel, even within Sydney, to a demo
night or math club or some such, I didn’t have a laptop to bring with me.</p>

<p>So I needed a new laptop. And the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Tahoe">Tahoe release</a> of macOS was so ugly
(see e.g. <a href="https://x.com/zetalyrae/status/1968813221025865868">1</a>, <a href="https://x.com/zetalyrae/status/1979654314244403272">2</a>, <a href="https://x.com/zetalyrae/status/1971719256980312211">3</a>) it made me boot up the old Linux
desktop, and start playing around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NixOS">NixOS</a> again. And I fell in love
with Linux again: with the tinkering and the experimentation and the freedom it
affords you.</p>

<p>So, I wanted a Linux laptop. I had a <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/p/laptops/thinkpad/thinkpadx1/x1-extreme-g4/22tp2x1x1e4">ThinkPad X1</a> some years ago and it was
terribly: flimsy plastic build and hardware that vastly underperformed its
price. I looked around for old, refursbished workstation laptops, and, randomly,
I ran into an eBay seller offering a refurbished Fujitsu laptop.</p>

<p>The specs/price ratio was pretty good: 16 GiB of RAM and 512GiB of SSD, all for
250 AUD. And it was 12in and 1.1kg, which I like: laptops should be small and
lightweight. But the thing that got me, in all honesty, was the brand. “Fujitsu
laptop” sounds like colour in a William Gibson novel: “crawling into the
avionics bay, Case took out a battered Fujitsu refurb, and stuck a JTAG port in
the flight computer—”. I already use NixOS and a <a href="https://elecomusa.com/products/deft-trackball-wireless-copy">trackball</a> and a
<a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B07B8J6C3C">mechanical keyboard</a>, so a laptop that’s even more obscure than a
ThinkPad is perfect for me. And it was only 250 AUD. So I got it.</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/laptop.webp" alt="A photograph of the laptop."></p>

<p>The only problem I had was disabling Secure Boot in order to install
Linux. Otherwise: I love it. It’s small and lightweight, feels solid, the
keyboard is good, all the hardware works out of the box with NixOS, and the
battery life is pretty good.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>This section describes the problems I encountered.</p>

<h2 id="secure-boot">Secure Boot</h2>

<p>I tried to install Linux the usual way, when I was greeted by this:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/secureboot.webp" alt="A photograph of the laptop screen showing an error message, red text on white: 'secure boot is failed **access denied**'."></p>

<p>Going into the BIOS, the option to disable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI#Secure_Boot">Secure Boot</a> was greyed out. I
tried a bunch of random bullshit: wiping the TPM, disabling the TPM. That didn’t
work.</p>

<p>What did work was this:</p>

<p>First, install Windows 11. This came with the laptop. And the installation makes
installing Linux feel easy: I had to do so many weird tricks to avoid having to
create an account with Microsoft during the installation.</p>

<p>Once Windows is installed, go into Windows Update. Under “Advanced Options &gt;
Optional Updates”, there should be an option to install Fujitsu-specific
drivers. Install those. And for good measure, do a general Windows update.</p>

<p>There should be a program called DeskUpdate on the Desktop. This is the Fujitsu
BIOS update tool. Run this and go through the instructions: this should update
the BIOS (the ordering seems to be important: first update the Fujitsu firmware
through Windows Update, then the BIOS through DeskUpdate).</p>

<p>Reboot and go into the BIOS (F2). You should have a new BIOS version. In my
case, I went from BIOS 2.17 to 2.31 which was released on 2025-03-28:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/bios.webp" alt="A photograph of the BIOS screen showing BIOS version information."></p>

<p>You now have the option to disable Secure Boot:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/secureboot-disable.webp" alt="A photograph of the BIOS screen showing the option to disable Secure Boot."></p>

<p>After this, I was able to install NixOS from a live USB:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/nixos.webp" alt="A photograph of the laptop, showing the NixOS installer."></p>

<h2 id="spyware">Spyware</h2>

<p>The laptop comes with this corporate spyware thing called <a href="https://www.absolute.com/platform/persistence">Absolute
Persistence</a>. It’s some anti-theft tracking device. Since the Lifebook is
typically an enterprise laptop, it makes sense that it comes with this type of
thing.</p>

<p>I only noticed this because I was searching the BIOS thoroughly for a way to
disable Secure Boot. The good news is disabling it is pretty straightforward:
you just disable it in the BIOS.</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content/linux-on-the-fujitsu-lifebook-u729/ap.webp" alt="A photograph of the BIOS screen showing the Absolute Persistence options."></p>

<p>As I understand it, Absolute Persistence requires an agent running in the OS, so
the BIOS support, by itself, doesn’t do anything once disabled.</p>

<h2 id="non-problems">Non-Problems</h2>

<p>The following work flawlessly OOTB:</p>

<ul>
  <li>WiFi</li>
  <li>Bluetooth</li>
  <li>Sound (using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PipeWire">PipeWire</a>)</li>
  <li>Display brightness control (using <a href="https://github.com/Hummer12007/brightnessctl">brightnessctl</a>)</li>
  <li>Touchscreen (I didn’t realize the screen was actually a touchscreen until I
touched it by accident and saw the mouse move)</li>
  <li>Webcam (not winning any awards on quality, but it works)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things I have not tested:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Microphone</li>
  <li>Fingerprint sensor</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="bios-notes">BIOS Notes</h2>

<p>To enter the BIOS: smash <code>F2</code> until you hear the beep. No need to hold down the
<code>Fn</code> key.</p>

<p>To enter the boot menu: as above but with <code>F12</code>.</p>
