<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="visual-studio-code-tunnel">Visual studio code tunnel</h2>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Since July 2023, Microsoft is offering  the perfect reverse shell, embedded inside Visual Studio Code, a widely used development tool. With just a few clicks, any user with a github account can share their visual studio desktop on the web. VS code tunnel is almost considered a <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/HonorableMentions/Code/">lolbin (Living Of the Land Binary)</a>.</p>
<p>I am so glad that my users now have the ability to expose their computer with highly sensitive data right on the web, through an authentication I nor control, nor supervise. My internal network is now accessible from anywhere !</p>
<p>The worse part is that this tunnel can be triggered <a href="https://badoption.eu/blog/2023/01/31/code_c2.html">from the cmdline</a> with the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&amp;os=cli-win32-x64">portable version of code.exe</a>. An attacker just has to upload the binary, which won't be detected by any anti-virus since it is legitimate and singed windows binary.</p>
<p>It is therefore something to watch out for.</p>
<p>Execute it, open the link mentioned, log in to your github account and there is your reverse shell.</p>

<p><a href="https://badoption.eu/blog/2023/01/31/code_c2.html">pfiatde blog post</a> already did a great job at describing what an attacker can do so I won't say much more. Go check his awesome blog post.</p>
<h2 id="mitigation">Mitigation</h2>
<p>But now, as a defender, how do we block or detect its usage ?</p>
<h3 id="domains-blacklist">Domains blacklist</h3>
<p>Microsoft documentation states :</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="fallback"><span><span>1</span><span>If you're part of an organization who wants to control access to Remote Tunnels, you can do so by allowing or denying access to the domain global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com.
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yeah it's not that simple. It will indeed block most users but, from my testing, it won't block an attacker that has already established a tunnel once. Meaning the tunnel can be kept active or restarted at will despite this domain being blacklisted.</p>
<p>From my understanding, VScode contacts <em>global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com</em> to get its "clusters" : <a href="https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters">https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters</a></p>
<p>Here is a sample of the resulting json :</p>

<p>Applocker is Microsoft application whitelisting technology. When enabled and configured, with default rules for example, everything is blocked by default except for the executables and scripts defined in the preceding rules.
Let's pretend we use Microsoft default rules for demo purpose.</p>
<p>To generate them, in <em>Group Policy Management Editor</em>, go to <em>Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; Application Control Policies -&gt; AppLocker</em>.
Right Click on <em>Create Default Rules</em>.</p>
<p>Then right click on <em>AppLocker</em> and <em>Export Policy</em>.</p>

Content filtering tools that prevent users from searching for certain keywords on school devices were ubiquitous, <!-- -->with nearly 100% of teachers surveyed saying their schools<!-- --> use<!-- --> them in some capacity. Students and teachers say those tools are making their lives more difficult.</p><p>“Whether old or new, technologies deployed across schools have negative impacts on students, and schools are out of step in addressing rising concerns,” the report reads.</p><p>Almost three-quarters of the students surveyed by CDT said these filtering tools made it more difficult for them to complete coursework by blocking access to useful content and information<!-- -->. Teachers agree. Nearly half of those surveyed in the reports said they thought filtering technology left students siloed away from content that “will help them learn as a student” or “grow as a person.”</p><p>Both teachers and students say filtering originally intended to target adult content is instead being used by some school administrators to block LGBTQ+ and race-related content they deem “inappropriate.” Disciplinary action and punishment for violations aren’t experienced at the same rates for all students. The report found students who identify as LGBTQ+ and those with disabilities in individualized education programs were more likely to get in trouble due to the tools. 19% of students at schools that use filtering technology say they were even aware of students who were “outed” for LGBTQ+ as a result of the filtering. That’s up six percentage points from the 2021-2022 school year.</p><p>“Students at Title I schools, students with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ students continue to bear the brunt of irresponsible data and technology use and policies in the classroom and at home,” CDT Director of the Equity in Civic Technology Project Elizabeth Laird said in a statement. “This is alarming given that schools say they use technologies to keep all students safe and enhance their learning experience.”</p><p>AI-enabled activity monitoring software that tracks students’ online activity is similarly altering students’ day-to-day lives. Around two-thirds of teachers surveyed said they’d seen students disciplined at school as a result of AI-powered monitoring software. Shockingly, 38% of teachers said they were even aware of a student who was contacted by law enforcement as a result of the monitoring.</p><p>Teachers, students, and parents alike similarly expressed concerns over school administrators’ handling of potentially sensitive student data. More than two-<!-- -->thirds (73%) of parents said they were concerned, a figure up by 12 percentage points from those surveyed a year prior. Despite those concerns, just 31% of the parents say their schools solicited their input for how to responsibly use student data.

To make $45K/month as an employee is not an easy task, I would have to be extremely good at coding (and also office politics!).</p><p>The learnings are also one of the benefits.</p><p>Running a company requires a wide range of skills that I learned along the way: marketing, legal, finance, partnership, sales, etc.</p><p>Even thought I’m at a very small scale, I feel much more confident talking about business now compared to when I was just an employee doing what being told.</p><p><strong>The cold start</strong></p><p>Nothing comes for free. It could be very challenging and stressful to find a product and make it work, especially in the beginning.</p><p>I always tell people not to quit their job without a stable revenue each month, a lot of savings, and backup plans.</p><p>Working on side projects while having a full-time job can be stressful too. I was lucky because I haven’t yet have a family and only need to take care of myself. For people who have a full-time job, wife, and kids, there isn’t much time and energy left to work on side projects.

It gets very lonely.</p><p>When I quit my job, I didn’t think this would be a big problem, so I didn’t really paying attention to keeping my connections with people around me.</p><p>Now I’m starting to build the back connections, but it’s difficult to keep in touch with people when you no longer work in the same office and have the same topics to talk about.</p><p>My friends all have a full-time jobs, not a lot of indie hacker friends around me and they all have different favorite country/city to live. My best option if I want to fix this is to move to some popular indie hubs around the world like Bali or Lisbon, but I still think this isn’t going to work long-term.</p><p>It’s just the trade off I have to make going on this path.

I don’t really know.</p><p>Right now, I don’t have a long-term plan. I only have a general guideline that I live to: stay healthy, make more money by doing things that I’m interested in, all of that while not sacrificing my freedom.</p><p>Work and enjoy life at the same time.</p><p>As for short-term plan, I’ll keep working on my products: Typing Mind (current focus), DevUtils, Xnapper. Maybe even a new product in the near future!</p><p>I hope this post will be helpful for anyone want to pursue the same path.</p><p>If you are looking to do the same thing as I did, here are some of my key takeaways:</p><ul><li><p>First and foremost, keep in mind that all of this is my story, “my way”. It’s definitely not the “only way”, and probably not “the best way”. All you can do is to cherry pick what I shared here and see if it works for you. There is no formula to guarantee success.</p></li><li><p>If you plan to work alone like me, try to become a generalist: know a bit of everything. For example, if you are a developer, don’t restrict yourself to only work as a frontend dev, try to develop in backend too, and mobile apps, and design, then also learn marketing, etc. Make use of the 80/20 rule: use 20% of your effort to capture 80% of the value.</p></li><li><p>Build unfair advantages for yourself. I considered my coding skills as an unfair advantage. I can build apps very fast because I’ve been doing it for years. If you don’t have any unfair advantages, find it or build it today.</p></li><li><p>Build an audience. This is not for everyone, but if you can, give it a try. Build an audience or a community of your own on Twitter/Reddit/internet forums. Anything you do later will be much more easier. The benefit is compounded. I built an audience of 97K followers on Twitter over the past 2 years and now that’s one of my unfair advantages too.</p></li><li><p>Ship early, ship small, ship frequently. Don’t stuck on one idea for too long if it doesn’t work. Practice shipping products more frequently to build “muscle memory”.</p></li><li><p>When building product: focus on the core value it brings to the customer. Practice viewing the product from customer point-of-view to avoid over-engineering. Talk to your customers and involve them to your building process.</p></li><li><p>Be patient and be prepared for luck. It’s a long term game.</p></li></ul><p><span>That’s all I have to share for now.

        <p>
            We expose a surprising failure of generalization in auto-regressive large language models (LLMs). If a model is trained on a sentence of the form "A is B", it will not automatically generalize to the reverse direction "B is A". This is the Reversal Curse. For instance, if a model is trained on "Olaf Scholz was the ninth Chancellor of Germany", it will not automatically be able to answer the question, "Who was the ninth Chancellor of Germany?". Moreover, the likelihood of the correct answer ("Olaf Scholz") will not be higher than for a random name. Thus, models exhibit a basic failure of logical deduction and do not generalize a prevalent pattern in their training set (i.e. if "A is B'' occurs, "B is A" is more likely to occur). We provide evidence for the Reversal Curse by finetuning GPT-3 and Llama-1 on fictitious statements such as "Uriah Hawthorne is the composer of 'Abyssal Melodies'" and showing that they fail to correctly answer "Who composed 'Abyssal Melodies?'". The Reversal Curse is robust across model sizes and model families and is not alleviated by data augmentation. We also evaluate ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) on questions about real-world celebrities, such as "Who is Tom Cruise's mother? [A: Mary Lee Pfeiffer]" and the reverse "Who is Mary Lee Pfeiffer's son?". GPT-4 correctly answers questions like the former 79% of the time, compared to 33% for the latter. This shows a failure of logical deduction that we hypothesize is caused by the Reversal Curse. Code is available at https://github.com/lukasberglund/reversal_curse.

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> the brand new State of HTML survey is finally open!</p>
<p><a href="https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023/?source=leaverou" target="_blank">Take State of HTML 2023 Survey</a></p>
<p>Benefits to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Survey results are <strong>used by browsers to prioritize roadmaps</strong> — the reason Google is funding this.
Time spent thoughtfully filling them out is an investment that can come back to you tenfold
in the form of seeing features you care about implemented, browser incompatibilities being prioritized, and gaps in the platform being addressed.</li>
<li>Learn about new and upcoming features you may have missed</li>
<li>Get a personalized score and see how you compare to other respondents</li>
<li>Learn about the latest trends in the ecosystem and what other developers are focusing on</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="background" tabindex="-1"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>This is likely the most ambitious <a href="https://www.devographics.com/">Devographics</a> survey to date.
For <a href="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/design-state-of-html/">the past couple of months</a>, I’ve been hard at work leading a small product team spread across three continents (2am to 8am became my second work shift 😅).
We embarked on this mission with some uncertainty about whether there were <em>enough</em> features for a State of HTML survey,
but quickly found ourselves with the opposite problem:
there were too many, all with good reasons for inclusion!
To help weigh the tradeoffs and decide what makes the cut we consulted both <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/categories/state-of-html-2023-features?discussions_q=is%3Aopen+category%3A%22State+of+HTML+2023+Features%22+sort%3Atop">the developer community</a>,
as well as stakeholders across browsers, standards groups, community groups, and more.</p>
<p>We even designed new UI controls to facilitate collecting the types of complex data that were needed without making the questions too taxing,
and did original UX research to validate them.
Once the dust settles, I plan to write separate blog posts about some of these.</p>
<h2 id="faq" tabindex="-1"><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<h3 id="can-i-edit-my-responses%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#can-i-edit-my-responses%3F">Can I edit my responses?</a></h3>
<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong> Do not worry about filling it out perfectly in one go.
If you create an account, you can edit your responses for the whole period the survey is open, and even split filling it out across multiple devices (e.g. start on your phone, then fill out some on your desktop, etc.)
Even if you’re filling it out anonymously, you can still edit responses on your device for a while.
You could even start anonymously and create an account later, and your responses will be preserved (the only issue is filling it out anonymously, then logging in with an existing account).</p>
<p>So, perhaps the call to action above should be…</p>
<p><a href="https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-html/2023/?source=leaverou" target="_blank"><em>Start</em> State of HTML 2023 Survey</a></p>
<h3 id="why-are-there-js-questions-in-an-html-survey%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-are-there-js-questions-in-an-html-survey%3F">Why are there JS questions in an HTML survey?</a></h3>
<p>For the same reason there are JS APIs in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/">HTML standard</a>:
many JS APIs are intrinsically related to HTML.
We mainly included JS APIs in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>APIs used to manipulate HTML dynamically (DOM, form validation, etc.)</li>
<li>Web Components APIs, used to create custom HTML elements</li>
<li>APIs used to create web apps that feel like native apps (e.g. Service Workers, Web App Manifest, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don’t write any JS, we absolutely still want to hear from you!
In fact, I would encourage you to fill out the survey <strong>even more</strong>: we need to hear from folks who don’t write JS, as they are often underrepresented.
Please feel free to skip any JS-related questions (all questions are optional anyway) or select that you have never heard these features.
There is a question at the end, where you can select that you only write HTML/CSS:</p>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/html-js-balance.png" alt="Question about HTML/CSS and JS balance"></p>
<h3 id="is-the-survey-only-available-in-english%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#is-the-survey-only-available-in-english%3F">Is the survey only available in English?</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely not! Localization has been an integral part of these surveys since the beginning.
Fun fact: Nobody in the core <a href="#acknowledgements">State of HTML team</a> is a native English speaker.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/languages.png" alt="Screenshot showing dozens of languages"></p>
<figcaption>
<p>Each survey gets (at least partially) translated to over 30 languages.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>However, since translations are a community effort, they are not necessarily complete, especially in the beginning.
If you are a native speaker of a language that is not yet complete, please consider <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/locale-en-US">helping out</a>!</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-score-lower-than-i-expected%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#why-is-my-score-lower-than-i-expected%3F">Why is my score lower than I expected?</a></h3>
<figure>
<p><img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/my-score.png" alt="80% score, 105/131 heard or used"></p>
<figcaption>
<p>If it makes you feel better, this was my own score, and I <em>created</em> the darn survey 😅
Our engineer, <a href="https://sachagreif.com/">Sacha</a> who is also the founder of <a href="https://www.devographics.com/">Devographics</a> got 19%!</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It asks about <em>a lot</em> of cutting edge features, more than the other surveys.
As I mentioned above, we had a lot of difficult tradeoffs to make,
and had to cut a ton of features that were otherwise a great fit.
We err’ed on the side of more cutting edge features, as those are the areas the survey can help make the most difference in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>To save on space, and be able to ask about more features, we used a new compact format for some of the more stable features, which only asks about usage, not awareness.
Here is an example from the first section of the survey (Forms):
<img src="https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/state-of-html-2023/images/form-validation.png" alt="Form validation question screenshot">
This has the downside that features you do know about but haven’t used do not count towards the final score.</li>
</ol>
<p>We are <a href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/217">exploring ways to improve this experience</a>, such as displaying a rank among other respondents,
and/or displaying separate usage and awareness scores that combine to form the overall score.</p>
<h3 id="i-found-a-bug%2C-what-should-i-do%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#i-found-a-bug%2C-what-should-i-do%3F">I found a bug, what should I do?</a></h3>
<p>Please file an issue so we can fix it!</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="acknowledgements" tabindex="-1"><a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
<p>This survey would not have been possible without the hard work of many people.
Besides myself (Lea Verou), this includes the rest of the team:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering team: Sacha Greif, Eric Burel</li>
<li>UX research &amp; data science team: Shaine Rosewel Matala, Michael Quiapos, Gio Vernell Quiogue</li>
<li>Our logo designer, <a href="https://chriskirknielsen.com/">Chris Kirk-Nielsen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And several volunteers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tink.uk/">Léonie Watson</a> for accessibility feedback</li>
<li>Our usability testing participants</li>
<li>…and all folks who provided early feedback throuhgout the process</li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>Kadir Topal</strong> made the survey possible in the first place, by proposing it and securing funding from Google.</p>
<p>Thank you all! 🙏🏼</p>

    <p>Large generative models (e.g., large language models, diffusion models) have shown remarkable performance, but they require a massive amount of computational resources. To make them more accessible, it is crucial to improve their efficiency.</p>

<p>This course will introduce efficient AI computing techniques that enable powerful deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics include model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, data/model parallelism, gradient compression, and on-device fine-tuning. It also introduces application-specific acceleration techniques for large language models, diffusion models, video recognition, and point cloud. This course will also cover topics about quantum machine learning. Students will get hands-on experience deploying large language models (e.g., LLaMA 2) on a laptop.</p>

<p>The slides and lab assignments from the last semester are available for access <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0ftluqbd1afzqpy/AADqxwkYrt1FbGnSQ4KP3Kpva?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>croc</code> is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, <em>croc</em> is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does <strong>all</strong> of the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>allows <strong>any two computers</strong> to transfer data (using a relay)</li>
<li>provides <strong>end-to-end encryption</strong> (using PAKE)</li>
<li>enables easy <strong>cross-platform</strong> transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)</li>
<li>allows <strong>multiple file</strong> transfers</li>
<li>allows <strong>resuming transfers</strong> that are interrupted</li>
<li>local server or port-forwarding <strong>not needed</strong></li>
<li><strong>ipv6-first</strong> with ipv4 fallback</li>
<li>can <strong>use proxy</strong>, like tor</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">Or, you can <a href="https://golang.org/dl/" rel="nofollow">install Go</a> and build from source (requires Go 1.17+):</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go install github.com/schollz/croc/v9@latest"><pre><code>go install github.com/schollz/croc/v9@latest

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-usage" dir="auto"><a href="#usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">To send a file, simply do:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase"><pre><code>$ croc send [file(s)-or-folder]
Sending 'file-or-folder' (X MB)
Code is: code-phrase
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then to receive the file (or folder) on another computer, you can just do</p>

<p dir="auto">The code phrase is used to establish password-authenticated key agreement (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement" rel="nofollow">PAKE</a>) which generates a secret key for the sender and recipient to use for end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a number of configurable options (see <code>--help</code>). A set of options (like custom relay, ports, and code phrase) can be set using <code>--remember</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-custom-code-phrase" dir="auto"><a href="#custom-code-phrase">Custom code phrase</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can send with your own code phrase (must be more than 6 characters).</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]"><pre><code>croc send --code [code-phrase] [file(s)-or-folder]
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-allow-overwriting-without-prompt" dir="auto"><a href="#allow-overwriting-without-prompt">Allow overwriting without prompt</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">By default, croc will prompt whether to overwrite a file. You can automatically overwrite files by using the <code>--overwrite</code> flag (recipient only). For example, receive a file to automatically overwrite:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --yes --overwrite <code>"><pre><code>croc --yes --overwrite &lt;code&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-pipes---stdin-and-stdout" dir="auto"><a href="#use-pipes---stdin-and-stdout">Use pipes - stdin and stdout</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can pipe to <code>croc</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cat [filename] | croc send"><pre><code>cat [filename] | croc send
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">In this case <code>croc</code> will automatically use the stdin data and send and assign a filename like "croc-stdin-123456789". To receive to <code>stdout</code> at you can always just use the <code>--yes</code>  will automatically approve the transfer and pipe it out to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --yes [code-phrase] > out"><pre><code>croc --yes [code-phrase] &gt; out
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">All of the other text printed to the console is going to <code>stderr</code> so it will not interfere with the message going to <code>stdout</code>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-send-text" dir="auto"><a href="#send-text">Send text</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes you want to send URLs or short text. In addition to piping, you can easily send text with <code>croc</code>:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --text &quot;hello world&quot;"><pre><code>croc send --text "hello world"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This will automatically tell the receiver to use <code>stdout</code> when they receive the text so it will be displayed.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-use-a-proxy" dir="auto"><a href="#use-a-proxy">Use a proxy</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can use a proxy as your connection to the relay by adding a proxy address with <code>--socks5</code>. For example, you can send via a tor relay:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --socks5 &quot;127.0.0.1:9050&quot; send SOMEFILE"><pre><code>croc --socks5 "127.0.0.1:9050" send SOMEFILE
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-change-encryption-curve" dir="auto"><a href="#change-encryption-curve">Change encryption curve</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can choose from several different elliptic curves to use for encryption by using the <code>--curve</code> flag. Only the recipient can choose the curve. For example, receive a file using the P-521 curve:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --curve p521 <codephrase>"><pre><code>croc --curve p521 &lt;codephrase&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Available curves are P-256, P-348, P-521 and SIEC. P-256 is the default curve.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-change-hash-algorithm" dir="auto"><a href="#change-hash-algorithm">Change hash algorithm</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">You can choose from several different hash algorithms. The default is the <code>xxhash</code> algorithm which is fast and thorough. If you want to optimize for speed you can use the <code>imohash</code> algorithm which is even faster, but since it samples files (versus reading the whole file) it can mistakenly determine that a file is the same on the two computers transferring - though this is only a problem if you are syncing files versus sending a new file to a computer.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE"><pre><code>croc send --hash imohash SOMEFILE
</code></pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-self-host-relay" dir="auto"><a href="#self-host-relay">Self-host relay</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections. By default, <code>croc</code> uses a public relay but you can also run your own relay:</p>

<p dir="auto">By default it uses TCP ports 9009-9013. Make sure to open those up. You can customized the ports (e.g. <code>croc relay --ports 1111,1112</code>), but you must have a minimum of <strong>2</strong> ports for the relay. The first port is for communication and the subsequent ports are used for the multiplexed data transfer.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can send files using your relay by entering <code>--relay</code> to change the relay that you are using if you want to custom host your own.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --relay &quot;myrelay.example.com:9009&quot; send [filename]"><pre><code>croc --relay "myrelay.example.com:9009" send [filename]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note, when sending, you only need to include the first port (the communication port). The subsequent ports for data transfer will be transmitted back to the user from the relay.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-self-host-relay-docker" dir="auto"><a href="#self-host-relay-docker">Self-host relay (docker)</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">If it's easier you can also run a relay with Docker:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc"><pre><code>docker run -d -p 9009-9013:9009-9013 -e CROC_PASS='YOURPASSWORD' schollz/croc
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Be sure to include the password for the relay otherwise any requests will be rejected.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay &quot;myreal.example.com:9009&quot; send [filename]"><pre><code>croc --pass YOURPASSWORD --relay "myreal.example.com:9009" send [filename]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note: when including <code>--pass YOURPASSWORD</code> you can instead pass a file with the password, e.g. <code>--pass FILEWITHPASSWORD</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">TG is a geometry library for C that is small, fast, and easy to use.
I designed it for programs that need real-time geospatial, such as geofencing, monitoring, and streaming analysis.</p>

</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-goals" dir="auto"><a href="#goals">Goals</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">The main goal of TG is to provide the fastest, most memory efficent geometry library for the purpose of monitoring spatial relationships, specifically operations like point-in-polygon and geometry intersect.</p>
<p dir="auto">It's a non-goal for TG to be a full GIS library. Consider <a href="https://libgeos.org/" rel="nofollow">GEOS</a> if you need GIS algorithms like generating a convex hull or voronoi diagram.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-performance" dir="auto"><a href="#performance">Performance</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">TG uses <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/POLYGON_INDEXING.md">entirely new</a> indexing structures that speed up <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-predicates">geometry predicates</a>. It can index more than 10GB per second of point data on modern hardware, while using less than 7% of additional memory, and can perform over 10 million point-in-polygon operations, even when using large polygons with over 10K points.</p>
<p dir="auto">The following benchmark provides an example of the point-in-polygon performance
of TG when using a large polygon. In this case of Brazil, which has 39K points.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-using" dir="auto"><a href="#using">Using</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">Just drop the "tg.c" and "tg.h" files into your project.
Uses standard C11 so most modern C compilers should work.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-programmer-notes" dir="auto"><a href="#programmer-notes">Programmer notes</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><em>Check out the complete <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md">API</a> for detailed information.</em></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-pure-functions" dir="auto"><a href="#pure-functions">Pure functions</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">TG library functions are thread-safe, reentrant, and (mostly) without side
effects.
The exception being with the use of malloc by some functions like
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-constructors">geometry constructors</a>.
In those cases, it's the programmer's responsibiilty to check the return value
before continuing.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom = tg_geom_new_point(-112, 33);
if (!geom) {
    // System is out of memory.
}"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_geom</span> <span>*</span><span>geom</span> <span>=</span> <span>tg_geom_new_point</span>(<span>-112</span>, <span>33</span>);
<span>if</span> (!<span>geom</span>) {
    <span>// System is out of memory.</span>
}</pre></div>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-fast-cloning" dir="auto"><a href="#fast-cloning">Fast cloning</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The cloning of geometries, as with <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_clone">tg_geom_clone()</a>, are
O(1) operations that use implicit sharing through an atomic reference counter.
Geometry constructors like <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_new_polygon">tg_geom_new_polygon()</a> will
use this method under the hood to maintain references of its inputs.</p>
<p dir="auto">While this may only be an implementation detail, it's important for the
programmer to understand how TG uses memory and object references.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom = tg_geom_new_polygon(exterior, holes, nholes);"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_geom</span> <span>*</span><span>geom</span> <span>=</span> <span>tg_geom_new_polygon</span>(<span>exterior</span>, <span>holes</span>, <span>nholes</span>);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Above, a new geometry "geom" was created and includes a cloned reference to the
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a> "exterior" and all of the holes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Providing <code>TG_NOATOMICS</code> to the compiler will disable the use of atomics and
instead use non-atomic reference counters.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="cc -DTG_NOATOMICS tg.c ..."><pre><code>cc -DTG_NOATOMICS tg.c ...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, the <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_copy">tg_geom_copy()</a> method is available to perform a deep copy of the
geometry.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-avoid-memory-leaks" dir="auto"><a href="#avoid-memory-leaks">Avoid memory leaks</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">To avoid memory leaks, call <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_free">tg_geom_free()</a> on geometries
created from <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-constructors">geometry constructors</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#geometry-parsing">geometry parsers</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_clone">tg_geom_clone()</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom_copy">tg_geom_copy()</a></p>
<p dir="auto">In other words, for every <code>tg_geom_new_*()</code>, <code>tg_geom_parse_*()</code>,
<code>tg_geom_clone()</code>, and <code>tg_geom_copy()</code> there should be (eventually and exactly)
one <code>tg_geom_free()</code>.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-upcasting" dir="auto"><a href="#upcasting">Upcasting</a></h4>
<p dir="auto">The TG object types <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_line">tg_line</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_poly">tg_poly</a> can be safely upcasted to a <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom">tg_geom</a> with no
cost at runtime.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_geom *geom1 = (struct tg_geom*)line; // Cast tg_line to tg_geom

<p dir="auto">This allows for exposing all <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom">tg_geom</a> functions to the other
object types.</p>
<p dir="auto">In addition, the <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_ring">tg_ring</a> type can also cast to a
<a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_poly">tg_poly</a>.</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="struct tg_poly *poly = (struct tg_poly*)ring; // Cast tg_ring to tg_poly"><pre><span>struct</span> <span>tg_poly</span> <span>*</span><span>poly</span> <span>=</span> (<span>struct</span> <span>tg_poly</span><span>*</span>)<span>ring</span>; <span>// Cast tg_ring to tg_poly</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><em>Do not downcast. It's not generally safe to cast from a <a href="https://github.com/tidwall/tg/blob/main/docs/API.md#tg_geom">tg_geom</a> to other

<p dir="auto">The JPL Open Source Rover is an open source, build it yourself, scaled down version of the 6 wheel rover design that JPL uses to explore the surface of Mars. The Open Source Rover is designed entirely out of consumer off the shelf (COTS) parts. This project is intended to be a teaching and learning experience for those who want to get involved in mechanical engineering, software, electronics, robotics but is also an excellent research platform for rugged terrain. No prior skills or knowledge is required.</p>

<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-features" dir="auto"><a href="#features">Features</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This rover is designed to function similarly to the 6 wheel rover designs on Mars and employs a few of the major driving mechanics that the mars rovers use to traverse rocky surfaces:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Rocker-Bogie:</strong> The Rocker-Bogie suspension system allows all 6 wheels to continually be in contact with the ground while climbing over obstacles</li>
<li><strong>Differential Pivot:</strong> Allows weight to be mechanically offloaded from one side of the rover to the other while climbing</li>
<li><strong>6-Wheel Ackerman Steering:</strong> Driving and steering/turning mechanism that governs where the wheels point and how fast each of them will move.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">A Raspberry Pi acts as the "brain" of this rover for its versatility, accessibility, simplicity, and ability to add and upgrade your own modifications. Any method with which you can communicate with a Raspberry Pi (bluetooth, WiFi, USB devices, etc) can be interfaced into the control system of the robot.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project has elements in mechanical assembly/fabrication, uses a host of electrical components, and has software that will run it all. In order to complete this project, you will need to have some experience in the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Fabrication/Machining:</strong> All parts are Consumer Off-The-Shelf (COTS) parts and <strong>no metal machining should be required</strong> to complete the 'base' version of the rover. However for any optional expansions, it may be useful to have access to the following skills/tools:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Metal cutting using band saw/dremel</li>
<li>Drilling using drill press/hand drill</li>
<li>Filing and sanding for part cleanup</li>
<li>General Fabrication/Machining Safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Electronics:</strong> This project uses components like motors, motor controllers, and batteries. While prior experience with the following skills is not required, having access to someone who can help will save a lot of time:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Soldering</li>
<li>Electrical debugging</li>
<li>Wiring</li>
<li>Electrical Safety</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Software:</strong> The rover's brain is a Raspberry Pi. All code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code">osr-rover-code</a> repository along with step-by-step instructions to set it up. Basic familiarity with Linux, ROS, Git, and Python will be helpful though.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Most of the above are skills that you can learn and pick up fairly quickly from watching videos and doing research on the internet, and throughout the project we try to give supplemental information on some of these as well. See the build documents for more information.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-tools-necessary" dir="auto"><a href="#tools-necessary">Tools Necessary</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">This project assumes you have some standard tools to help assemble the project. If you do not have any of the optional tools, we provide examples of online services that you can use to have the parts fabricated and sent to you.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 1:</strong> <a href="#ordering-parts">Order parts</a>. You'll want to get started on this ASAP!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/electrical/wiring/README.md">Create the wiring</a>. The cables connect the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) in the body to each motor and integrate into the rocker-bogie and corner assemblies so they need to be built first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 3:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/electrical/pcb/README.md">Make the electronics</a>: Soldering the PCB and installing into the rover along with peripheral connections. We'll also use the wiring to test your PCBs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 4:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/mechanical/README.md">Make the mechanical assemblies</a>: the body, the two rocker-bogies, the drive and corner motor assemblies. The instructions will guide you through how to do these step by step while integrating the cabling from Stage 2. You'll then attach them into something that will start to look like a rover!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Stage 5:</strong> Setting up and configuring the operating system rover code. The <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/osr-rover-code">Rover Code repo</a>'s README files will walk you through all necessary steps for getting the rover software up and running on the Raspberry Pi. These steps can be completed at any point during the project, all the way up to when all the electronics and mechanical parts are completed and you are ready to start driving and controlling the robot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What's next?</strong> Add your own upgrades! We chose Raspberry Pi as the brain of the project so that it should be easy to add, change, and upgrade to build exciting things on top of this already cool robot.  Some upgrade ideas to get you brainstorming: sonar for collision detection, IMU for orientation / closed-loop driving / obstacle mapping, camera for object identification and tracking, sensor packages (temperature, pressure, humidity), solar panels, or even a robotic arm!</p>

<p dir="auto">You can select higher RPM motors (to drive your rover faster) at the sacrifice of max stall torque. A selection of motors that would integrate easily with the rest of the suggested rover design can be found at <a href="https://www.gobilda.com/yellow-jacket-planetary-gear-motors/" rel="nofollow">GoBilda - 5203 series</a>.
The rover design and the software can accommodate different wheel sizes if you find wheels you like better.</p>
<p dir="auto">The body plates that attach to all sides of the body are designed to be made from laser cut acrylic, MDF, hardwood, or similar. The 2D cutout files  are the .DXF files in the <a href="https://github.com/nasa-jpl/open-source-rover/blob/master/mechanical/body/dxf">laser cut parts folder</a>. They were designed to be around 3mm thick (1/8").

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p data-block-key="ie0t5"><b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> – The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today announced it is beginning a rulemaking process to remove medical bills from Americans’ credit reports. The CFPB outlined proposals under consideration that would help families financially recover from medical crises, stop debt collectors from coercing people into paying bills they may not even owe, and ensure that creditors are not relying on data that is often plagued with inaccuracies and mistakes.</p><p data-block-key="8cm31">“Research shows that medical bills have little predictive value in credit decisions, yet tens of millions of American households are dealing with medical debt on their credit reports,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. “When someone gets sick, they should be able to focus on getting better, rather than fighting debt collectors trying to extort them into paying bills they may not even owe.”</p><p data-block-key="7iks1">A <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-estimates-88-billion-in-medical-bills-on-credit-reports/">2022 report</a> found that roughly 20% of Americans report having medical debt, but <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-study-finds-medical-debt-overly-penalizes-consumer-credit-scores/">previous research</a> by the CFPB has shown that medical billing data on a credit report is less predictive of future repayment than reporting on traditional credit obligations. Mistakes and inaccuracies in medical billing are common and can be compounded by problems such as disputes over insurance payments or complex billing practices.</p><p data-block-key="83c6a">The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts creditors’ ability to use medical information in making credit decisions and places limits on the inclusion of medical information on credit reports. The FCRA also granted five financial regulators authority to create regulatory exemptions to the restriction on creditors’ use of medical information, and in 2005, those regulators created an exception to allow creditors to rely on medical data if it could be characterized as “financial information.”</p><p data-block-key="btipa">The document released today is an outline of proposals and alternatives under consideration for the CFPB’s medical debt rulemaking. If finalized, they would:</p><ul><li data-block-key="b8ha"><b>Remove medical bills from consumers’ credit reports:</b> Consumer reporting companies would be prohibited from including medical debts and collection information on consumer reports that creditors use in making underwriting decisions.</li><li data-block-key="7rv83"><b>Stop creditors from relying on medical bills for underwriting decisions:</b> The proposal would narrow the 2005 exception and prohibit creditors from using medical collections information when evaluating borrowers’ credit applications.</li><li data-block-key="51gc"><b>Stop coercive collection practices:</b> As unpaid medical bills would no longer appear on consumers’ credit reports used by creditors in making underwriting decisions, debt collectors would no longer be able to use the credit reporting system as leverage to pressure consumers into paying questionable debts.</li></ul><p data-block-key="9ht47">The proposal would not stop creditors from obtaining medical bill information for other purposes, such as verifying the need for medical forbearances, or evaluating loan applications to pay for medical services.</p><p data-block-key="539ph">In advance of beginning the rulemaking process, the CFPB has engaged with the public on this issue.

    <h2>Autopilot</h2>
    <p>It automates the steps that a human operator would do to deploy and to manage a
Postgres database inside Kubernetes, including automated failover.</p>

</div>
        
        <div>
    <h2>Data persistence</h2>
    <p>It doesn’t rely on statefulsets and uses its own way to manage persistent volume claims where the <code>PGDATA</code> is stored.</p>

</div>
        
        <div>
    <h2>Designed for Kubernetes</h2>
    <p>It’s entirely declarative, and directly integrates with the Kubernetes API server to update the state of the cluster — for this reason, it does not require an external failover management tool.</p>

      <p>You can extend the primary/standby architecture by adding a PgBouncer
connection pooler between your application and your PostgreSQL database.

<p>In this episode of "Just Ship It," Evan You, the creator of Vue.js and Vite, discusses his journey to becoming an independent open-source developer. His dedication to Vue.js and (and now Vite) since 2016 has made him a prominent figure in the open-source community. This conversation highlights  Evan's transition to full-time open-source work, the growth of Vue.js, and his aspirations for the future.</p>
<p>Evan shares his journey toward becoming a full-time open-source developer and the challenges and factors that facilitated this shift. Evan attributes his success to a combination of luck and persistence. He elaborates on his experiences while developing Vue.js, emphasizing his passion for solving intriguing problems. He outlines his approach to API-driven development, where he designs how things should work before implementing them.</p>
<p>Evan explains that Vue.js initially attracted users through platforms like Hacker News and Chinese social networks, thanks to its bottom-up approach and user-friendly documentation. This is in stark contrast to larger frameworks like React and Angular, which often gain enterprise-level adoption due to corporate backing.</p>
<p>Evan reflects on Vue.js's evolution, highlighting the turning point when it gained prominence in the Laravel community, solidifying its reputation as a dependable framework for production projects. He discusses how Vue.js particularly appeals to back-end developers, as it seamlessly integrates with traditional back-end frameworks.</p>
<p>The conversation touches on Vue.js's adoption in different regions, particularly in Asia, attributing its success to Evan's active participation in Chinese social networks. Additionally, Evan underscores the importance of high-quality Chinese documentation.</p>
<p>The episode concludes with Evan sharing the pace and satisfaction he found in working on Vue.js during its early stages, contrasting it with the more complex decision-making processes required as the project grew.
Evan's work on Vue.js and Vite has had a significant impact on the web development landscape, and his commitment to fostering a thriving open-source community continues to shape the future of front-end development.</p></div><div><p><em>This Dot Labs is a development consultancy that is trusted by top industry companies, including Stripe, Xero, Wikimedia, Docusign, and Twilio.

<p>ARE American lives cheaper than those of the Chinese? It's a question raised by Ron Unz, publisher of <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/chinese-melamine-and-american-vioxx-a-comparison/%20" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/blog/chinese-melamine-and-american-vioxx-a-comparison/%20">The American Conservative</a>, who has produced a compelling comparison between the way the Chinese dealt with one of their drug scandals – melamine in baby formula - and how the US handled the Vioxx aspirin-substitute disaster. The Chinese scandal surfaced in 2008, shortly before the Beijing Olympics. Crooked dairymen diluted their milk products, then added a plastic chemical compound called melamine to raise the apparent protein content back to normal levels. Nearly 300,000 babies across China suffered urinary problems, with many hundreds requiring lengthy hospitalisation for kidney stones. Six died.</p><p>Long prison sentences were handed down and a couple of the guiltiest culprits were tried and executed for their role. Throughout these events, American media coverage was extensive, with appropriate sneering about the Chinese leadership's indifference to human life. Four years earlier, in September 2004, Merck, one of America's largest pharmaceutical companies, issued a sudden recall of Vioxx, its anti-pain medication widely used to treat arthritis-related ailments.</p><p>The recall came just days after Merck discovered that a top medical journal was about to publish a study by an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) investigator indicating that the drug in question greatly increased the risk of fatal heart attacks and strokes and had probably been responsible for at least 55,000 American deaths during the five years it had been on the market. It soon turned out Merck had known of potential lethal side effects even before launching Vioxx in 1999, but had brushed all such disturbing tests under the rug.</p><div id="blueconic-article-theweek">

</div><p>With a TV ad budget averaging a hundred million dollars per year, Vioxx swiftly became one of Merck's bestsellers, generating over $2 billion in yearly revenue. Twenty-five million Americans were eventually prescribed Vioxx as an aspirin-substitute thought to produce fewer complications. There was a fair amount of news coverage after the recall, but pretty slim considering the alleged 55,000 death toll. A class-action lawsuit dragged its way through the courts for years, eventually being settled for $4.85 billion in 2007.</p><p>When the scandal first broke, Merck's stock price collapsed, and many believed that the company could not possibly survive, especially after evidence of a deliberate corporate conspiracy surfaced. Instead, Merck's stock price eventually reached new heights in 2008 and today it is just 15 per cent below where it stood before the disaster. The year after the scandal unfolded, Merck's long-time CEO resigned and was replaced by one of his top lieutenants. But he retained the $50 million in financial compensation he had received over the previous five years. Neither he nor any other Merck executives was charged with corporate malfeasance.</p><p>Senior FDA officials apologised for their lack of effective oversight and promised to do better in the future. The Vioxx scandal began to sink into the vast marsh of semi-forgotten international pharmaceutical scandals.</p><p>Then in 2005, as he now remembers it, Ron Unz "was reading my morning newspapers, as I always do, and noticed tiny items about an unprecedented drop in the American death rate. Hmm I said, I wonder if that might have anything to do with all those other stories about that deadly drug recently taken off the market and all the resulting lawsuits." The year after Vioxx was pulled from the market, the New York Times and other media outlets were running minor news items, usually down-column, noting that American death rates had undergone a striking and completely unexpected decline. These were what Unz, a dedicated news browser, was reading. Typical was the headline on a short article that ran in the 19 April 2005 edition of USA Today: 'USA Records Largest Drop in Annual Deaths in at Least 60 Years.' During that one year, American deaths fell by 50,000 despite the growth in both the size and the age of the nation's population. Government health experts were quoted as being greatly "surprised" and "scratching [their] heads" over this strange anomaly, which was led by a sharp drop in fatal heart attacks.</p><p>For his Chinese melamine/Vioxx comparison, Unz went back to those 2005 stories. Quick scrutiny of the most recent 15 years worth of national mortality data provided on the US Government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website offered Unz some useful clues.</p><p>"We find the largest rise in American mortality rates occurred in 1999, the year Vioxx was introduced, while the largest drop occurred in 2004, the year it was withdrawn," says Unz. "Vioxx was almost entirely marketed to the elderly, and these substantial changes in the national death-rate were completely concentrated within the 65-plus population.</p><p>"The FDA studies had proven that use of Vioxx led to deaths from cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes, and these were exactly the factors driving the changes in national mortality rates." The impact of these shifts, Unz points out, was not small. After a decade of remaining roughly constant, the overall American death rate began a substantial decline in 2004, soon falling by approximately five per cent, despite the continued ageing of the population. This drop corresponds to roughly 100,000 fewer deaths per year. The age-adjusted decline in death rates was considerably greater. "Patterns of cause and effect cannot easily be proven," Unz continues. "But if we hypothesise a direct connection between the recall of a class of very popular drugs proven to cause fatal heart attacks and other deadly illnesses with an immediate drop in the national rate of fatal heart attacks and other deadly illnesses, then the statistical implications are quite serious."</p><p>Unz makes the point that the users of Vioxx were almost all elderly, and it was not possible to determine whether a particular victim's heart attack had been caused by Vioxx or other factors. But he concludes: "<em>Perhaps 500,000 or more premature American deaths may have resulted from Vioxx</em> [my italics], a figure substantially larger than the 3,468 deaths of named individuals acknowledged by Merck during the settlement of its lawsuit. And almost no one among our political or media elites seems to know or care about this possibility." I remarked to Unz that it seemed truly incredible that a greater than expected death rate of this dimension should scarcely have caused a ripple. "I'm just as astonished," he said. "From 2004 onwards, huge numbers of America's toughest trial lawyers were suing Merck for billions based on Vioxx casualties - didn't they notice the dramatic drop in the national death rate?</p><p>"The inescapable conclusion is that in today's world and in the opinion of our own media, American lives are quite cheap, unlike those in China. "Besides," says Unz laughing, "it shows the stupidity of our political leaders that they didn't seize upon this great opportunity. They should have just renamed Vioxx the 'Save Social Security Drug,' and distributed it free in very large doses to everyone, starting on their 65th birthday. Maybe they should have even made it mandatory, three times per day. At sufficiently large levels of national consumption, Vioxx could have almost singlehandedly eliminated all our serious budget deficit problems. 'Vioxx - The Miracle Anti-Deficit Drug'."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="uni-article-paragraph" data-analytics-module="{
           &quot;module_name&quot;: &quot;Paragraph&quot;,
           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;0\u002Ddays exploited by commercial surveillance vendor in Egypt&quot;
         }"><p data-block-key="z0lph">Last week Google’s Threat Analysis Group (TAG), in partnership with <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2023/09/predator-in-the-wires-ahmed-eltantawy-targeted-with-predator-spyware-after-announcing-presidential-ambitions">The Citizen Lab</a>, discovered an in-the-wild 0-day exploit chain for iPhones. Developed by the commercial surveillance vendor, Intellexa, this exploit chain is used to install its Predator spyware surreptitiously onto a device.</p><p data-block-key="db5qn">In response, yesterday, Apple patched the bugs in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213927">iOS 16.7</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213926">iOS 17.0.1</a> as CVE-2023-41991, CVE-2023-41992, CVE-2023-41993. This quick patching from Apple helps to better protect users and we encourage all iOS users to install them as soon as possible.</p><h3 data-block-key="9mihu">Exploit delivery via man-in-the-middle (MITM)</h3><p data-block-key="3tkrk">The Intellexa exploit chain was delivered via a “man-in-the-middle” (MITM) attack, where an attacker is in between the target and the website they’re trying to reach. If the target is going to a website using ‘http’, then the attacker can intercept the traffic and send fake data back to the target to force them to a different website. Visiting a website using ‘https’ means that the traffic is encrypted, and it is easily verifiable that the received data came from the intended website using their certificate. That is not the case when using ‘http’.</p><p data-block-key="43ulj">In the case of this campaign, if the target went to any ‘http’ site, the attackers injected traffic to silently redirect them to an Intellexa site, c.betly[.]me. If the user was the expected targeted user, the site would then redirect the target to the exploit server, sec-flare[.]com. While there’s a spotlight on “0-click” vulnerabilities (bugs that don’t require user interaction) this MITM delivery also didn’t require the user to open any documents, click a specific link, or answer any phone calls.</p><h3 data-block-key="7bvmk">iOS Exploit Chain</h3><p data-block-key="3mmcg">As soon as the attacker redirected the target to their exploit server, the exploit chain began to execute. For iOS, this chain included three vulnerabilities:</p><ul><li data-block-key="9h3i5">CVE-2023-41993: Initial remote code execution (RCE) in Safari</li><li data-block-key="b9i2o">CVE-2023-41991: PAC bypass</li><li data-block-key="bchsp">CVE-2023-41992: Local privilege escalation (LPE) in the XNU Kernel</li></ul><p data-block-key="d9tj1">The chain then ran a small binary to decide whether or not to install the full Predator implant. However, TAG was unable to capture the full Predator implant.</p><p data-block-key="9beab">We plan to publish a technical deep dive on these exploits in line with the <a href="https://about.google/appsecurity/">Google vulnerability disclosure policy</a>.</p><h3 data-block-key="7qhpg">Android Exploit Chain</h3><p data-block-key="8ub7c">The attacker also had an exploit chain to install Predator on Android devices in Egypt. TAG observed these exploits delivered in two different ways: the MITM injection and via one-time links sent directly to the target. We were only able to obtain the initial renderer remote code execution vulnerability for Chrome, which was exploiting <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2023/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html">CVE-2023-4762</a>.</p><p data-block-key="1me89">This bug had already been separately reported to the Chrome Vulnerability Rewards Program by a security researcher and was patched on September 5th. We assess that Intellexa was also previously using this vulnerability as a 0-day.</p><h3 data-block-key="fp05">Chrome's work to protect against MITM</h3><p data-block-key="6d3d2">For years, Chrome has worked toward universal HTTPS adoption across the web. Additionally <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html">Chrome has an “HTTPS-First Mode”</a> that can reduce the likelihood of exploits being delivered via MITM network injection. "HTTPS-First Mode" will attempt to load all pages over HTTPS, and show a large warning before falling back to sending an HTTP request. This setting is currently on by default for users enrolled in the <a href="https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/">Advanced Protection Program</a> who are also signed into Chrome. We encourage all users <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10468685?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">to enable “HTTPS-First Mode”</a> to better protect themselves from MITM attacks.</p><h3 data-block-key="1gn1m">Conclusion</h3><p data-block-key="5b2rm">This campaign is yet another example of the abuses caused by the proliferation of commercial surveillance vendors and their serious risk to the safety of online users. TAG will continue to take action against, and publish research about, the commercial spyware industry, as well as work across the public and private sectors to push this work forward.</p><p data-block-key="1q972">We would like to acknowledge and thank The Citizen Lab for their collaboration and partnership in the capturing and analysis of these exploits, and Apple for deploying a timely patch for the safety of online users.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee">https://blog.unity.com/news/open-letter-on-runtime-fee</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37614793">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To our community:</p>
<p>I’m Marc Whitten, and I lead Unity Create which includes the Unity engine and editor teams.</p>
<p>I want to start with this: I am sorry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should have spoken with more of you and we should have incorporated more of your feedback before announcing our new Runtime Fee policy. Our goal with this policy is to ensure we can continue to support you today and tomorrow, and keep deeply investing in our game engine.</p>
<p>You are what makes Unity great, and we know we need to listen, and work hard to earn your trust. We have heard your concerns, and we are making changes in the policy we announced to address them.</p>
<p>Our Unity Personal plan will remain free and there will be no Runtime Fee for games built on <strong>Unity Personal</strong>. We will be increasing the cap from $100,000 to $200,000 and we will remove the requirement to use the <em>Made with Unity</em> splash screen.</p>
<p>No game with less than $1 million in trailing 12-month revenue will be subject to the fee.</p>
<p>For those creators on <strong>Unity Pro and Unity Enterprise</strong>, we are also making changes based on your feedback.</p>
<p>The Runtime Fee policy will only apply <strong>beginning with the next LTS version of Unity</strong> shipping in 2024 and beyond. Your games that are currently shipped and the projects you are currently working on will not be included – unless you choose to upgrade them to this new version of Unity.</p>
<p><strong>We will make sure that you can stay on the terms applicable for the version of Unity editor you are using </strong>– as long as you keep using that version.</p>
<p>For games that are subject to the runtime fee, we are giving you a choice of either a <strong>2.5% revenue share</strong> or the calculated amount based on the number of new people engaging with your game each month. Both of these numbers are <strong>self-reported</strong> from data you already have available. You will always be billed the lesser amount.</p>
<p>We want to continue to build the best engine for creators. We truly love this industry and you are the reason why.</p>
<p>I’d like to invite you to join me for a <a href="https://youtube.com/live/qyLcI5O9iUY" target="_blank">live fireside chat</a> hosted by Jason Weimann today at 4:00 pm ET/1:00 pm PT, where I will do my best to answer your questions. In the meantime, <a href="https://unity.com/pricing-updates" target="_blank">here</a> are some more details.<sup>*</sup></p>
<p>Thank you for caring as deeply as you do, and thank you for giving us hard feedback.</p>
<p>Marc Whitten</p>
<p><sup><em>*We are working to localize translations of this web page.</em></sup></p>
