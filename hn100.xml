<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>For years, cops</span> and other government authorities all over the world have been using phone hacking technology provided by Cellebrite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/27/cellebrite-may-have-found-a-way-to-unlock-iphones-running-ios-11/">to unlock phones</a> and obtain the data within. And the company has been keen on keeping the use of its technology “hush hush.”</p>
<p>As part of the deal with government agencies, Cellebrite asks users to keep its tech — and the fact that they used it — secret, TechCrunch has learned. This request concerns legal experts who argue that powerful technology like the one Cellebrite builds and sells, and how it gets used by law enforcement agencies, ought to be public and scrutinized.</p>
<p>In a leaked training video for law enforcement customers that was obtained by TechCrunch, a senior Cellebrite employee tells customers that “ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime, how you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.”</p>
<p>“We don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone,” the employee, who we are not naming, says in the video.</p>
<p>For legal experts, this kind of request is troubling because authorities need to be transparent in order for a judge to authorize searches, or to authorize the use of certain data and evidence in court. Secrecy, the experts argue, hurts the rights of defendants, and ultimately the rights of the public.</p>
<p>“The results these super-secretive products spit out are used in court to try to prove whether someone is guilty of a crime,” Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford University’s Internet Observatory, told TechCrunch. “The accused (whether through their lawyers or through an expert) must have the ability to fully understand how Cellebrite devices work, examine them, and determine whether they functioned properly or contained flaws that might have affected the results.”</p>
<p>“And anyone testifying about those products under oath must not hide important information that could help exonerate a criminal defendant solely to protect the business interests of some company,” said Pfefferkorn.</p>
<p>Hanni Fakhoury, a criminal defense attorney who has studied surveillance technology for years, told TechCrunch that “the reason why that stuff needs to be disclosed, is the defense needs to be able to figure out ‘was there a legal problem in how this evidence was obtained? Do I have the ability to challenge that?’”</p>
<p>The Cellebrite employee claims in the video that disclosing the use of its technology could help criminals and make the lives of law enforcement agencies harder.</p>
<p>“It’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally,” the Cellebrite employee says in the video. “We want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome, we definitely don’t want that.”</p>
<p>Cellebrite spokesperson Victor Cooper said in an email to TechCrunch that the company “is committed to support ethical law enforcement. Our tools are designed for lawful use, with the utmost respect for the chain of custody and judicial process.”</p>
<p>“We do not advise our customers to act in contravention with any law, legal requirements or other forensics standards,” the spokesperson said. “While we continue protecting and expect users of our tools to respect our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information, we also permanently continue developing our training and other published materials for the purpose of identifying statements which could be improperly interpreted by listeners, and in this respect, we thank you for bringing this to our attention.”</p>
<p>When asked whether Cellebrite would change the content of its training, the spokesperson did not respond.</p>
<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s senior staff attorney Saira Hussain and senior staff technologist Cooper Quintin told TechCrunch in an email that “Cellebrite is helping create a world where authoritarian countries, criminal groups, and cyber-mercenaries also are able to exploit these vulnerable devices and commit crimes, silence opposition, and invade people’s privacy.”</p>
<p>Cellebrite is not the first company that asks its customers to keep its technology secret.</p>
<p>For years, government contractor Harris Corporation made law enforcement agencies who wanted to use its cellphone surveillance tool, known as stingrays, sign <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/harris-stingray-nda/">a non-disclosure agreement</a> that in some cases suggested dropping cases rather than disclosing what tools the authorities used. These requests <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/19/cellebrite-asks-cops-to-keep-its-phone-hacking-tech-hush-hush/nytimes.com/2015/03/16/business/a-police-gadget-tracks-phones-shhh-its-secret.html">go as far back as the mid 2010s</a>, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-cell-site-simulator-stingray-secrecy/">are still in force today</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s the full transcript of the training video:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m happy you can join us. And I’m happy to kick off this initial module covering the system overview and orientation for Cellebrite Premium. Thank you and enjoy.</p>
<p>Did you know that Cellebrite Advanced Services has 10 labs in nine different countries around the world? Well, in order to leverage all of that capacity, we are working together to deliver this training to you, so you will be hearing from colleagues from around the world. The following list are those that comprise this current module set, I hope you enjoy meeting them each.</p>
<p>Before we begin, it’s quite important to go over the confidentiality and operational security concerns that we must abide by by using Cellebrite Premium, not only ourselves in our own Cellebrite Advanced Services labs, but most particularly you in your own labs around the world.</p>
<p>Well, we must recognize that this capability is actually saving lives. And in situations when it’s too late, we’re helping to deliver closure for the victims’ families, and ultimately solve crimes and put people behind bars. So, it’s super important to keep all these capabilities as protected as possible, because ultimately leakage can be harmful to the entire law enforcement community globally.</p>
<p>In a bit more detail, these capabilities that are put into Cellebrite Premium, they are actually trade secrets of Cellebrite, and we want to continue to ensure the viability of them so that we can continue to invest heavily into research and development, so we can give these abilities to law enforcement globally. Your part is to ensure that these techniques are protected as best as you can, and to either consider them as “law enforcement sensitive” or classify them to a higher level of protection in your individual country or agency.</p>
<p>And the reason why is because we want to ensure that widespread knowledge of these capabilities does not spread. And, if the bad guys find out how we’re getting into a device, or that we’re able to decrypt a particular encrypted messaging app, while they might move on to something much, much more difficult or impossible to overcome.We definitely don’t want that.</p>
<p>We’re also aware that the phone manufacturers are continuously looking to strengthen the security of their products. And the challenge is already so difficult as it is, but we still continue to have really good breakthroughs. Please don’t make this any more difficult for us than it already is.</p>
<p>And ultimately, we don’t really want any techniques to leak in court through disclosure practices, or you know, ultimately in testimony, when you are sitting in the stand, producing all this evidence and discussing how you got into the phone. Ultimately, you’ve extracted the data, it’s the data that solves the crime. How you got in, let’s try to keep that as hush hush as possible.</p>
<p>And now moving on to operational security or “opsec.” It starts with the physical protection of the premium system and all of its components that you’ve received in the kit.</p>
<p>These little bits and pieces that make all this capability… magic. They’re highly sensitive assets, and we want to ensure that no tampering or any other curiosities are employed on these devices. And in some cases, there is the chance of tampering and disabling the component, and that’s something that you really don’t want to do, because it could knock out your agency from having the capability whilst you await a replacement.</p>
<p>Additionally, exposure of any of these premium capabilities could be quite harmful to the global law enforcement environment. So, be careful with information sharing, whether it’s in face to face conversations, over the phone, on online discussion groups, via email — other things like that — just try to keep it sensitive and don’t go into any details.</p>
<p>When it comes to written documentation, obviously, you don’t want to disclose too much in your court reports. But definitely put the bare minimum to ensure that a layperson can understand the basic concepts of what was done.</p>
<p>Certainly mention that you used Premium, you can mention the version, but do not go into detail of what you’ve done with the phone: either manipulating it or whatever shows up on the graphical user interface of premium itself.</p>
<p>And when it comes to technical operations and quality management within your organization, please be wary that any document that you put together as a standard operating procedure could be visible by an outside auditor for ISO 17025 or other people that could do a Freedom of Information Act request in your agency in whichever laws of your country.</p>
<p>So just be careful with all that. You need to protect this as best as possible. And the other additional factor that you may not be aware of is that failed exploitations on devices — if they’re able to connect to the network — they could phone home and inform the manufacturer that the device is under attack. And with enough knowledge and intelligence, it is possible that the phone manufacturers might find out what we’re doing to achieve this magic. So please do your best to follow all the instructions and make this the best possible procedures [sic] going forward.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The historic structure on Front Street is the last house standing in a neighborhood reduced to rubble. </p>



<p>Before fires ripped through Lahaina, the craftsman-inspired home at 271 Front St. didn’t stand out much in the neighborhood.&nbsp;The nearly 100-year-old structure had been lovingly restored in recent years, but it was one of many charming homes lining the waterfront of one of Hawaii’s most historically important towns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, the house is unmissable: A red-roofed structure in seemingly pristine condition, surrounded by piles of ash and rubble for blocks in every direction. </p>



<p>“It looks like it was photoshopped in,” homeowner Trip Millikin said of the house, which stands in such contrast to the surrounding ruins that images of the home have gone viral in recent days. </p>

(Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2023)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millikin has spent much of the last week — in between anxious calls to check up on friends and neighbors — puzzling over why his house was somehow spared. </p>



<p>Maybe it was just luck. Maybe the wind shifted at just the right moment. Or maybe it was a series of serendipitous choices made during a recent home renovation that helped prevent flying pieces of burning wood and debris from doing little more than scorching small patches of his yard and bubbling the paint on one wall.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Experts say it was likely a little bit of all the above, but that one element of the home’s recent renovation is actually the most affordable and important thing people can do to try and protect their homes. </p>



<h2>A Painstaking Renovation </h2>



<p>Millikin and his wife, Dora Millikin, fell in love with the Front Street house several years ago, although it was vacant and had fallen into a state of disrepair. </p>



<p>The home, known as the Pioneer Mill Co./Lahaina Ice Co. Bookkeeper’s House, is believed to have been moved to Front Street in 1925 from a nearby plantation. For decades, it was used to house management-level employees. </p>



<p>The Millikins, who started living in Lahaina more than a decade ago, used to bicycle by the house and talk about what it would take to fix the sagging roof, the rotting lanai, the peeling paint. </p>



<p>“The house was an absolute nightmare, but you could see the bones of it,” Millikin said. </p>

(Courtesy: Trip Millikin/2023)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millikin and his wife bought the property in 2021, working with the county on a historic preservation plan before embarking on a nearly two-year renovation project. They did much of the work themselves, along with a local carpenter and the help of neighbors. </p>



<p>The effort was a source of neighborhood pride, Millikin said, with people walking by and frequently talking to the couple as they hand glazed the 500 window panes in the structure, painstakingly repaired the termite damage, dug out the mushrooms growing in the downstairs ohana unit. </p>



<p>The house is what’s known as a craftsman-inspired “plantation vernacular” dwelling, a style of homes constructed mostly by sugar and pineapple plantation companies in the early 20th century. </p>



<p>This home, overseen by a Native Hawaiian carpenter who headed most construction projects for the Pioneer Mill Co., was built from California redwood, Millikin said, which has some natural fire-resistant properties. But so was the historic house next door, which burned completely in the Aug. 8 fire. </p>

<p>During renovations, Millikin installed a commercial-grade steel roof, something that definitely would have provided better protection from flying embers than shingles. At first, Millikin thought this might have made the biggest difference in why his home was spared. </p>



<p>But Michael Wara, the director of the Climate and Energy Policy Program at the Stanford Wood Institute for the Environment, said it was likely the Millikins’ decision to dig out the existing landscaping directly surrounding the house and replace it with river stones that made the biggest difference. </p>



<p>“What folks in the wildfire business call the zone zero or the ember ignition zone, is kind of a key factor in whether homes do or do not burn down,” Wara said. </p>



<p>Having nothing combustible in the 5 feet directly around a house is enormously important.</p>



<p>Millikin said the decision to install river stones for about a meter around the house was not actually aimed at fire prevention. He wanted to prevent runoff from landscaping from creating water and termite damage. But it may have saved his home. </p>



<p>Regulations in California have typically focused on a 30-foot perimeter around homes known as “Zone A” in firefighting. But Wara said that research on the thousands of homes that have burned in California in recent years has shown that it’s really what’s installed in the immediate few feet of a home that makes the biggest difference. </p>



<p>In fires like the one in Lahaina, there are enormous amounts of flaming embers that are flying through the air. And if there’s something next to the house that is combustible — a wood fence, a bush, dry grass — that’s often what will ignite the structure, Wara said. </p>



<p>In the instance of the Front Street house, there was also a considerable amount of luck involved, he said. Because even the most well-prepared house can catch fire when the homes next to it are burning. </p>



<p>“Basically, the houses start catching each other on fire,” Wara said, which is why encouraging homeowners to remove landscaping and install rocks or granite walkways around homes is so important. “If enough of the homes have that kind of preparation then that chain reaction doesn’t get started.”</p>



<h2>A Struggle To Make Use Of Luck </h2>



<p>Millikin, who was on a trip to Massachusetts during the Lahaina fire, said the last he heard from his immediate neighbor on Aug. 8 was that the whole neighborhood was burning and his home was unlikely to make it. </p>



<p>He went to bed feeling physically ill out of fear for the fate of his friends, his neighborhood, and his home. </p>



<p>In the morning, a friend called and sent them a picture from a helicopter flyover of Lahaina. Every structure had been destroyed in the area. But there, in the midst of the destruction, was the seemingly untouched red roof of Millikin’s home. </p>



<p>Millikin said he and his wife were overcome with emotion. </p>

(Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2023)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Millikin said he has friends who have lost homes in California in recent years, and when he’s seen stories about other “miracle houses” left standing in the aftermath of destructive fires, he’s always thought: “Boy, I’m glad I don’t own that one. I wouldn’t want that. I would feel guilty.” </p>



<p>Now, Millikin said, “that’s our house.” </p>



<p>Millikin is hoping to channel his luck — and his feelings of guilt — into community action. He’s been told by neighbors that it’s best to stay put outside of Lahaina while he can so as not to take up much-needed resources for other survivors. </p>



<p>But when he and his wife are able to go back, he’s hoping to set up his home as some sort of a community hub for people trying to rebuild theirs. </p>



<p>“Let’s rebuild this together,” he said. “This house will become a base for all of us. Let’s use it.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-body="true" data-testid="post-body"><p>sitting in my car in a Seattle parking lot. there's a knock on my window. it's an old lady, who asks me "how do we pay for parking?"<!-- --></p><hr>
<!-- --><p>she's taking her husband to the hospital to see his doctor, but there's a massive road project that has cut off access for months, no end in sight, so she's parked a few blocks away. almost every parking lot in town removed their pay stations years ago. she has a smartphone but no idea how to handle this situation.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>she never would have figured it out. her words, and I don't doubt her.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>the lot has three signs hung up with instructions on how to pay, because every single lot in town supports one to five different competing parking lot apps. there's one sign that says you can use Park Mobile, and gives a lot ID, and then on another wall there's a sign that says you can use PayByPhone, with a different lot ID, and then there's a huge sign with a QR code that encourages you to Scan Here To Park, as if it's the official primary method for doing so. It is not, it's just another app.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I've scanned these before and gotten an "Instant App." I figure this is minimal friction for this person, so I suggest she do so. she pulls up a QR Scanner app - either because she's been bamboozled into believing that's the only way to get QR support, or because her particular Android phone actually does not have it built into the camera for God knows what reason; I didn't have time to figure out which.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>at first she struggles to figure out how to change cameras, but this turns out to be only because she's used to every camera app opening with the front facing selected by default; it has actually selected the rear camera, so I help her get it aimed right, and it goes bleep, and then... pops up an ad. i have to stop her before she hits open on whatever sludge is trying to put itself on her device<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>then we get a screen with 30 different elements on it describing different qualities of the QR code. the most prominent is a "Search The Web" button, which would have dumped the scanned URL into Google for some reason and produced irrelevant results; i have to direct her to tap the tiny blue link.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>that link opens Instant App. Google play prints a huge permissions message; I direct her to accept it. it installs a 16mb app; so what was the point of Instant here, exactly?<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>well, that's moot anyway, because as soon as it opens, it asks for permission, and then simply installs the normal version of the app, 24mb.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>we get into that. it asks for the street address of the lot. I have never seen this information printed on any parking lot in my life. it suggests several "nearby" options; they are actually half a mile away.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>unable to figure this conundrum out even for myself, i sigh and walk her through installing Park Mobile, which I know works. i help her find the lot ID. it asks for duration. she picks two hours. it asks for payment. she gets out her CC and types in the info.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>proceeding to checkout, it then... selects google pay. even though she just put in a CC. she hits proceed, and i go "is that the right card?" and she double takes and goes "...no." i maybe just saved this woman from losing $30 in overdrafts.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I direct her to tap the payment options field. nothing. i sigh. "I'm sorry, it looks like you have to tap that tiny pencil icon in the CORNER of the field." yep. finally she's able to select her credit card. she hits proceed.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>it now pops up the duration selector again. what???? why????? it's back at the default of 1 hour, and she tries to pick two again, but it just won't do it. I happen to know this UI pretty well, so I know that if parking time was actually limited to 1 hour, it wouldn't show the option at all. This is just completely glitched out.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>with no other options, she just picks one hour, and successfully pays. we both breathe a sigh of relief, and I advise her that if she needs more time, she should be able to just tap a button in the app to extend her parking. I really hope it actually works like I described.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>throughout all this we had to grant Location permissions at least three times, and each time you have to decide between three options, none of which are "Yes." the one you want is "while the app is open" but there is no way to know this, and nobody alive has ever picked either of the other options. nobody would.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>i have struggled to write an ending to this post three times. words genuinely fail me.<!-- --></p></div></div>]]></description>

In 2022, rightsholders obtained permission in Austria to block several pirate site domains and a list of IP addresses that actually belonged to Cloudflare. ISPs had no choice but to comply with the court's instructions which took out countless Cloudflare customers in Austria. According to reviews conducted by local telecoms regulator TKK, the IP address blocking violated net neutrality regulations and will no longer be allowed.
</p>

<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg" alt="Page Blocked" width="275" height="207" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg 275w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked-200x150.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 275px) 100vw, 275px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20275%20207'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg 275w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked-200x150.jpg 200w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/pageblocked.jpg"></a>With momentum building in favor of pirate site blocking measures elsewhere in Europe, Austrian ISPs took their <a href="https://futurezone.at/netzpolitik/ogh-netzsperren-sind-zulaessig-user-sollen-dafuer-zahlen/139.308.830">opposition</a> all the way to the country’s Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/austrian-telecoms-regulator-rejects-informal-pirate-site-blocks-190118/">concerns</a> over the implications for net neutrality, rightsholders’ interests prevailed. Like many of their foreign counterparts, Austrian ISPs soon found themselves compelled by court order to block torrent and streaming sites, those offering unlicensed musical works, plus scientific article and textbook repositories.</p>
<h2>Domain/DNS Blocking Received Surprise ‘Upgrade’</h2>
<p>For years Austrian ISPs had deployed DNS blocking in response to court orders but in the summer of 2022, everything changed. New pirate site blocking orders not only contained domain names to be blocked, but also a list of IP addresses. </p>
<p>When the ISPs discovered that the IP addresses belonged to Cloudflare, arms were thrown up in despair. With no opportunity to contest the court-ordered blockades, ISPs had no other choice than to block the IP addresses, rendering countless innocent sites using Cloudflare inaccessible.</p>
<p>While this disruption was controversial and avoidable, the long term effect should be more positive.</p>
<h2>IP Address Blocking Violated Net Neutrality</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/weitere-regulierungsthemen/netzneutralitaet/nn_procedures.de.html">series of reports</a> published this week, local telecoms regulator Telekom Control Commission (TKK) states that the IP address blocks implemented last August amounted to net neutrality violations under EU law.</p>
<p>“In a decision dated August 7, 2023, the Telekom Control Commission decided on the admissibility of blocking networks by [various local ISPs] based on a warning from the rights holder SATEL Film GmbH in accordance with <a href="https://wilmap.stanford.edu/country/austria">Section 81 (1a) UrhG</a>,” one of the reports begins.</p>
<p>“The provider mentioned had set up DNS access blocks on the one hand and an IP access block on the other in its network at the end of August 2022. With regard to the DNS access blocks, no current violation of Art 3 Para 3 VO (EU) 2015/2120 was found and the procedure was discontinued in this respect.</p>
<p>“With regard to the blocking of access to the IP address 190.115.18.20, the Telekom Control Commission found a violation of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015R2120">Article 3 Paragraph 3 of Regulation (EU) 2015/2120</a>, because the IP access block poses the risk of ‘overblocking’ any website content.”</p>
<center><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png" alt="net-neutrality-art3" width="610" height="285" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png 686w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20610%20285'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png 686w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3-300x140.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/net-neutrality-art3.png"></a></center>
<p>In a follow-up announcement, TKK said that, since DNS-based blocking is generally sufficient to protect rightsholders, that will be the only method available to them moving forward.</p>
<h2>Protecting Net Neutrality</h2>
<p>After declaring IP address-based blocking prohibited in Austria, TKK explained its reasoning to a background of net neutrality and freedom of expression on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Since countless websites can be accessed from a single IP address, the risk of blocking websites or Internet services of uninvolved third parties is particularly high in the event of a block,” a TKK spokesman said.</p>
<p>“In Austria, network blocks have so far mainly been implemented with so-called ‘DNS blocks’. With this type of block, only individual domains are blocked and blocking notices are displayed instead. It is important that this practice is maintained in order to maintain the legally required proportionality in the future.” </p>
<p><em>TKK’s commitment to transparency includes <a href="https://www.rtr.at/TKP/was_wir_tun/telekommunikation/weitere-regulierungsthemen/netzneutralitaet/nn_blockings.de.html">publishing all blocking decisions</a> and the domains they affect.</em></p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Evidently, when the Iraqi government began blocking Telegram, it started by <a href="https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1688660150087823360" rel="noopener" target="_blank">using BGP to hijack traffic</a> destined for IP addresses associated with the messaging service, redirecting them to the proverbial bitbucket. And, as has happened before on numerous occasions, these hijack BGP routes leaked out of the country.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">However, despite this technical error, no Telegram disruption was reported outside of Iraq, in part, due to the fact that Telegram had created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure#Route_Origin_Authorizations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Route Origin Authorizations</a> (ROAs) for its routes allowing ASes outside of Iraq to automatically reject the hijacks. A ROA is a record in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Public_Key_Infrastructure" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RPKI</a> that specifies the AS origin that is authorized to originate the IP address range.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Perhaps the most famous BGP hijack ever was Pakistan’s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/02/pakistans-accid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hijack of YouTube in 2008</a> (also see <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/a-brief-history-of-the-internets-biggest-bgp-incidents/">The Internet’s Biggest BGP Incidents</a>). In that case, the Pakistani government ordered a block of Youtube in the country. The Pakistani state telecom, PTCL created BGP routes to hijack traffic destined for Youtube and blackhole it. However, the hijacks leaked out of Pakistan, leading to a global disruption of Youtube. Over the years, there have been many such leaks of BGP hijacks meant to censor content, such as those in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210512142832mp_/https://blogs.oracle.com/internetintelligence/ukraine-bans-russian-social-media" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ukraine</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170327193134/http://dyn.com/blog/iran-leaks-censorship-via-bgp-hijacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Iran</a>.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">More recently, during the initial weeks of the <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/myanmar-goes-offline-during-military-coup/">Myanmar military coup in 2021</a>, the military junta in charge ordered social media to be blocked. To comply with the order, one Myanma ISP elected to use BGP in order to hijack local Twitter traffic and drop it. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.manrs.org/2021/02/did-someone-try-to-hijack-twitter-yes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">their hijack route was inadvertently leaked out</a> of Myanmar, causing disruptions to Twitter around South Asia.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">And finally, last year, during Russia’s crackdown on social media and independent journalism following their invasion of Ukraine, a <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/russian-network-hijacked-twitter-traffic-578000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Russian ISP elected to use BGP to blackhole traffic</a> to Twitter by hijacking the <em>exact same prefix</em> (104.244.42.0/24) that was hijacked a year earlier in Myanmar.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">However, there was a difference between the two hijacks of Twitter’s 104.244.42.0/24 by Myanmar in 2021 and then again by Russia in 2022. In the intervening year, Twitter deployed RPKI, creating ROAs in RPKI for nearly all of its routes. By doing so, it enabled ASes which reject RPKI-invalid routes to automatically reject the hijack routes, limiting the disruption to Twitter.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">As Twitter’s CISO <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaKissner/status/1508503164374315011" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wrote at the time</a>, “a bunch of the point of having security is to keep your systems from breaking all of the time” and in this case, it kept a BGP hijack from breaking access to Twitter for users outside of Russia. The Russian hijack propagated <a href="https://twitter.com/DougMadory/status/1508466367112093709" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>slightly less</em></a> than the hijack from Myanmar, but it is hard to directly compare since the hijacks were announced from different places on the internet, and there are numerous factors which can influence BGP route propagation.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Anecdotally, I would say that after my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKwjq94Quhc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">NANOG 86 presentation</a> on the internet impacts due to the war in Ukraine, one of Twitter’s network engineers shared that, from a traffic standpoint, they observed significantly less disruption due to the Russian hijack. They believed the difference was due to RPKI.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">The recent episode in Iraq is similar to the aforementioned cases because it was a BGP incident that was intentional, but also accidental. The network accidentally leaked out a BGP hijack that they intentionally created.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Except for the networks in the semi-autonomous region of Kurdistan, all Iraqi internet service must go through <a href="https://bgp.tools/as/208293" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AS208293</a>, a government network which serves as the country’s international gateway. AS208293 normally doesn’t originate any routes; it only connects the country’s telecoms to international transit providers.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">However, at 13:52 UTC on 5 August 2023, AS208293 started originating the following prefixes:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">151.106.160.0/19</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">95.161.64.0/20</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">95.161.0.0/17</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.8.0/22</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.0.0/18</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.4.0/22</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">149.154.160.0/20</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">149.154.164.0/22</td></tr><tr><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">91.108.56.0/22</td><td color="body" font-size="16,18" font-weight="light">149.154.160.0/22</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">All but the first are address ranges used by Telegram. 151.106.160.0/19 was last utilized by the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/subspace-com_we-regret-to-announce-that-effective-may-activity-6930952295824207873-2z25/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now-defunct Subspace network</a>, so the reason for its inclusion is unclear.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Illustrated in Kentik’s BGP Route Viewer below, 149.154.160.0/20 was originated by AS208293 and attained global circulation for two reasons. The first was that there was no competing route in circulation — 149.154.160.0/20 is “less-specific” to existing Telegram routes. Secondly, there was no matching ROA in RPKI to give ASes who have deployed RPKI a reason to reject it.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Conversely, when we look at the propagation of the corresponding “more-specific” 149.154.160.0/22, we see that nearly the entire internet believed (correctly!) that AS62041 (Telegram) was the origin. While AS208293 shows up in red in the ball-and-stick diagram along the bottom, it can hardly be seen in the upper stacked plot, which depicts route propagation by origin.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">The lack of propagation of a BGP route with AS208293 as the origin of 149.154.160.0/22 is due to the fact that there was already an existing route to compete with (originated by AS62041), but also because the route from Iraq was <a href="https://rpki-validator.ripe.net/ui/149.154.160.0%2F22/AS208293?include=related_alloc,related_less_specific" rel="noopener" target="_blank">RPKI-invalid</a>, dramatically <a href="https://www.kentik.com/blog/how-much-does-rpki-rov-reduce-the-propagation-of-invalid-routes/">limiting its reach</a>.</p>

<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">The challenge of measuring the positive impact of any security mechanism is that it often requires knowledge of the incidents that didn’t occur as a result of its use. RPKI is no different. While it likely didn’t have the potential to be another Pakistan/YouTube incident, BGP non-events like this are what RPKI success looks like.</p>
<p font-size="18,20" font-weight="300" color="body">Of course, this is little solace to the Iraqi users who must now employ a VPN to circumvent this IP-level blockage. Censoring Telegram will do little to protect the personal data of any Iraqis, but it does cut them off from a popular communication tool and source of news and information.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cswpt1#:%7E:text=In%201953%20Iran's%20democratically%20elected,British%20and%20American%20intelligence%20services.">1953 coup d'etat</a> in Iran ushered in a period of exploitation and oppression that has continued – despite a subsequent revolution that led to huge changes – for 70 years. Each year on August 19, the anniversary of the coup, millions of Iranians ask themselves what would have happened if the US and UK had not conspired all those years ago to overthrow Iran’s democratically elected leader. </p>

<p>Iran, the Middle East and, arguably, the whole world may well have been profoundly different. Apart from rewriting the destiny of Iran and its neighbours, the coup paved the way for a series of imperialist interventions and the toppling of democratically elected governments across the global south. Perhaps Washington might have thought twice before plotting coups in <a href="https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/jacobo-arbenz-guzman-deposed/">Guatemala in 1954</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/jan/17/patrice-lumumba-50th-anniversary-assassination">Congo in 1961</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/18/1973-coup-chile-democratic-socialism-still-matters-britain">Chile in 1973</a>, if they’d been unable to overthrow Iran’s prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, so easily and profitably.</p>

<p>As the democratically elected leader of Iran from 1951 to 1953, Mosaddegh championed nationalisation of Iran’s oil industry. This had previously been in the hands of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company">Anglo-Persian Oil Company</a> –  a British company, founded in 1909 after the discovery of a large oil field in Iran, which would later become BP. </p>

<p>In March 1951, Iran’s parliament <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/world/mideast/032551iran-oil-vote.html">voted to proceed with nationalisation</a>. This caused consternation in the west – most notably in Britain, where the prospect of nationalisation was seen as potentially hugely damaging to the economy. Furthermore, it would have undermined Britain’s influence in the Middle East. Plotting to depose Mosaddegh began in earnest.</p>

<p>In the event, the coup – named <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/06/20/64-years-later-cia-finally-releases-details-of-iranian-coup-iran-tehran-oil/">Operation Ajax</a> –  was a joint venture between the CIA and MI6. The shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had recently fled the country after an earlier plot to remove Mossadegh had failed, returned to Iran.</p>

<p>Within a short period, he had tightened his grip on the country’s security services and imposed a dictatorial regime which ruled through brutality and fear. Pahlavi banned all opposition political parties, and many of the activists who participated in the movement for nationalisation of oil were arrested or fled the country. </p>

<h2>Government by fear</h2>

<p>In 1957, the shah established an internal security service, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK">Sazman-e Ettel'at va Amniyat-e Keshvar</a></em> (Savak), which essentially ran Iran at the shah’s bidding. From then until 1975, only two major political parties were allowed to operate, the People’s Party (<em>Ḥezb-e Mardom</em>) and the New Iran Party (<em>Ḥezb-e Iran-e Novin</em>), and all parliamentary candidates had to be approved by Savak.</p>

<p>Both parties in reality were wholly under the shah’s control. The parliament only existed to rubber-stamp his decisions, as did the prime minister – who the shah appointed. </p>

<p>In 1975, the shah took his domination of Iranian politics further, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/03/archives/shah-decrees-iran-a-oneparty-nation.html">establishing a single party</a>, the Party of Resurrection of the Iranian Nation (<em>Hezb-e Rastakhiz</em>), which all Iranians were obliged to join. By 1979, when Iran <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-iranian-revolution-a-timeline-of-events/">rose up in a popular revolution</a>, it was a virtual absolute monarchy, with the shah’s will enforced by the dreaded Savak secret police.</p>

<p>Within months of the revolution, though, Iran’s religious authorities took control under the leadership of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Islamic Republic quickly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/06/07/khomeini-is-reported-to-have-a-savak-of-his-own/dfc8e0a4-85b5-4a35-9723-c8a57caabae6/">established its own secret police, Savama</a> – <em>[Sazman-e Ettelaat Va Amniat Meli Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Intelligence</em>(Iran))_ – which used many of the same brutal methods as Savak.</p>

<h2>‘Woman, Life, Freedom’</h2>

<p>This week, Iranians will recall the 1953 coup as they prepare protests ahead of the anniversary of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” uprising. This movement began in September 2022 after the <a href="https://theconversation.com/iran-on-fire-once-again-women-are-on-the-vanguard-of-transformative-change-191297">death of Mahsa Amini</a> at the hands of the morality police – who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-66218318">patrol the streets</a> tasked with enforcing the laws on Islamic dress code in public – for the “crime” of not wearing her hijab (headscarf) in the approved manner. </p>

<p>The resulting explosion of unrest has posed the most serious challenge to the Islamic Republic in its history. Although the state tried to <a href="https://theconversation.com/iran-is-using-every-effort-to-crush-protesters-intent-on-a-revolution-except-hearing-them-out-193684">crush the demonstrations</a> from the beginning, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/jul/24/theres-no-other-option-but-to-fight-iranian-women-defiant-as-morality-police-return">protesters have defied</a> police brutality and the prospect of severe punishment, which included public executions and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/12/13/iran-death-sentences-against-protesters">hundreds of deaths of protesters</a> at the hands of the security forces.</p>

<p>At the same time as battling the oppression of their own state apparatus, ordinary Iranians are also suffering under the brutal US-imposed regime of sanctions. In the past five years, these sanctions – reimposed by Donald Trump after he unilaterally pulled the US out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which had been signed by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 – have devastated the Iranian economy. Soaring inflation and devaluation of the national currency have caused <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/c86fccb4-f56e-43b7-a596-29c036cb4ec1?accessToken=zwAGAzIWvP-IkdPIb8y09W5Dt9OllinANstOwQ.MEUCIB-C6PA2kZTxATwPKPY1n-zam6BzvbSibbybEmV1FFyZAiEAhZTNZOtTm3l-gtkRtQYHI-C5I9UpYRKxm-s5hZRRBjc&amp;sharetype=gift&amp;token=b91228d2-5530-4fe4-bbf3-071a531111a6">serious hardship</a> for ordinary Iranians.</p>

<p>As they <a href="https://theconversation.com/iran-unions-and-civil-rights-groups-demand-democracy-and-social-justice-201422">fight for a better future</a>, Iranians clearly grasp how, 70 years after the coup snuffed out their fledgling democracy, their internal struggles are still being influenced by foreign powers. </p>

<p>And they ask themselves if Mahsa Amini, and also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/08/mother-says-police-beat-daughter-to-death-in-iranian-protests">Nika Shahkarami</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/oct/07/another-teenage-girl-dead-at-hands-of-irans-security-forces-reports-claim">Sarina Esmailzadeh</a> – two other women beaten to death by members of the state apparatus for protesting – as well as hundreds of other young Iranians, would still be paying with their lives in Iran’s struggle for basic rights today if the 1953 coup had not happened.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>
          Howdy! I’m Carlos and I like tech and planes (among other things like
          having massive servings of pasta). I’m currently studying for my
          commercial license in Europe. So far most of my flight training has
          happened on a Piper PA28 (the -180 variant)
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image2.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>my school's plane doesn't look this pretty</figcaption>
        <p>
          It’s from the late 60s, often there are at least 1 or 2 things that
          don’t work properly and it shows - the thing is old! I imagine at some
          point I’ll jump into modern jets, and so I am happy to spend the first
          few hundred hours being as much of an ‘aviator’ as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a bit of background, these planes are single pilot operation, so
          the idea is that whoever is flying is doing the navigating, the
          radios, the checklist, the flying, the communicating and the looking
          out and in. It can get busy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one thing on this plane that is just hard to adapt to is how
          cramped it is and hot it can get - I’m talking about 38C/100F in a
          vibrating machine for 3h. And I say that with the knowledge of all the
          other issues this plane has (magnetos may drop excessively, gyro
          basically useless, fuel pump is old…).
        </p>
        <p>
          We get these things called kneeboards, that provide a ‘comfy’ space
          for us to write down things like the weather reports, the tower
          instructions and how accurate our routing plan is as we follow it
          along.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image7.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          how comfortable is that! does it come with a cupholder?
        </figcaption>
        <p>
          Whilst this picture looks pretty spacious, my plane is more cramped
          than that, and I’m sitting at a weirder angle. In my kneeboard /
          floating around the plane I have: 
          </p><ul>
            <li><a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/3070/5823042998_7de069bf04_b.jpg">Checklist</a> (before taking off checklist, taxiing checklist, …)</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectional_aeronautical_chart">Map</a> (big unfolding 1:400 map) (like the ones in the cartoons that open and open and open)</li>
            <li>Piece of paper to jot on (weather, tower instructions, tic tac toe..)</li>
            <li>Nav log (more on this soon)</li>
          </ul>    
        
        <p>
            All of those documents have to be hot swapped for one another at different phases of the flight, and so there is actually a pretty big market for kneeboards and all the shapes and sizes they can come in. 
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image1.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          the kneeboard, the cargo pants of the air
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            The Nav log is the term we give for a paper with point-to-point instructions from one waypoint to another. It typically has a lot of information to help us navigate (and even more info that we really use but had to write down to work out other things). Here’s a sample, but don’t worry too much about reading it.

        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image3.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          an example of a Navigation Log
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            Realistically, out of all those numbers, I’m only really looking at a few because things like the wind correction angle only really matter so that I can work out other information (except in some edge cases).
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I’ve grown happy with how I work out the items in the Nav log (an important skill when you are in training), now I occasionally use this tool (screenshot below) which automatically fills most of those fields for me. For the most part it is repetitive work, like “how do my heading and wind interact with each other, hmm let me see.. <basic math="" here="">”. 
        </basic></p>
        <p>
            I simply look at my 1:400 map and then pick out the waypoints in this browser tool. This allows me to prep other parts of my fight that I might be doing that lesson whilst still having a fleshed out Nav log!
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image5.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          one of the tools available for flight planning
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            I then get a PDF which I can then copy by hand into my Kneeboard nav log. Sweet!
        </p>
        <p>
            Like I said I also like computers and toyin’ around with them, and so the other day I bought a receipt printer. Why? Well… 
            </p><ul>
                <li>they seemed super cool for small projects</li>
                <li>don’t use ink</li>
                <li>can get them second hand easily</li>
                <li>plug and play into Linux (/dev/usb/lp0)</li>
                <li>look cute (mostly through the use of googly eyes</li>
              </ul>   
        
        <p>
            So then I thought… hey… what about the windshield pillar or a-pillar (if you speak cars) in the plane?
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image4.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
          it's strange to find unsued space in a cockpit
        </figcaption>
        <p>
            I mean, that thing is in the middle of the cockpit, serves no function (other than the obvious one of preventing a total structural collapse) and is strangely receipt sized.. surely.. I could use that to alleviate some of my issues with the cramped kneeboard. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Why don’t I make a <a href="https://github.com/kiloamp/fliprep">git project</a> that will let me have nicely formatted receipt prints of my nav log.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought the Navlog would be the easiest thing to do so that’s where I started. Oh how wrong I was.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowing that I’ll be using SkyVector for the foreseeable future I wrote a quick (ish) script to grab their Nav log. Ideally I could export a Navlog in some format like the Garmin one, but not really - only a weirdly formatted PDF. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways, fair enough -- I’ll just grab the whole PDF text with Ctrl+A and then ask the user to paste it into my script.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks to: 
            </p><ul>
                <li>Regex (special weird code that searches for patterns in code)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            think “take this ‘he3ll4o, $$th3er8e’ and remove everything that isn’t a letter
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>String splitting (less weird looking code that lets you play around with a chunk of text)
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            think “from the above example, split hello there into [“hello”], [“there”]
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Some math to fill in here and there 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            think “once we have [speed] and [distance] from the PDF work out the time taken”

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>  
            
            <p>
                I actually got a somewhat pretty looking Python dictionary / JSON of every leg of the journey. 
            </p>
            <pre>{
    "from": null,
    "to": null,
    "wind_direction": null,
    "wind_speed": null,
    "temp": null,
    "temp_deviation": null,
    "TAS": null,
    "Track": null,
    "WCA": null,
    "TH": null,
    "Var": null,
    "Magnetic Heading": null,
    "Ground Speed": null,
    "Distance": null,
    "ETA": null,
    "CumulativeETA": null
}</pre>
            <p>
                Then that JSON was exported into a PHP file (thanks <a href="https://github.com/mike42/escpos-php/">Mike42’s escpos-php/ library</a>!) which is what I’m using for formatting text in the receipt printer (mostly just font size and text-wrapping) and boom!
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image9.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
                version 1 -- still with a few things to add!
            </figcaption>
            <p>
                I have to say it works surprisingly well. I use that to quickly understand where I am whilst I play with the map and communicate on our area’s busy air to air frequency. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I don’t consider this to be dangerous since I also carry with me the full Nav log, so at any doubt I have all the other details, but hey, it never hurts to have extra easily-accessible information in unused space! 
            </p>
            <p>
                The script also works for simpler things, like printing the lesson plan if you want to. Hopefully in version 2 I can make this feature a bit more extensive, and maybe have some nicer formatting, maybe a QR reference to the lesson plan, etc..etc… 
            </p>
            <p><img src="https://carloslagoa.com/blog/flipreps/flipreps_files/image6.png" alt="alt text"></p><figcaption>
                the lesson plan is normally on an internal web app, I’d rather sellotape it to the plane!

<p dir="auto">This feature allows disks to be added one at a time to a RAID-Z group, expanding its capacity incrementally. This feature is especially useful for small pools (typically with only one RAID-Z group), where there isn't sufficient hardware to add capacity by adding a whole new RAID-Z group (typically doubling the number of disks).</p>

<h4 dir="auto">Initiating expansion</h4>
<p dir="auto">A new device (disk) can be attached to an existing RAIDZ vdev, by running <code>zpool attach POOL raidzP-N NEW_DEVICE</code>, e.g. <code>zpool attach tank raidz2-0 sda</code>. The new device will become part of the RAIDZ group. A <em>raidz expansion</em> will<br>
be initiated, and the new device will contribute additional space to the RAIDZ group once the expansion completes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>feature@raidz_expansion</code> on-disk feature flag must be <code>enabled</code> to initiate an expansion, and it remains <code>active</code> for the life of the pool. In other words, pools with expanded RAIDZ vdevs can not be imported by older releases of the ZFS software.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">During expansion</h4>
<p dir="auto">The expansion entails reading all allocated space from existing disks in the RAIDZ group, and rewriting it to the new disks in the RAIDZ group (including the newly added device).</p>
<p dir="auto">The expansion progress can be monitored with <code>zpool status</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Data redundancy is maintained during (and after) the expansion. If a disk fails while the expansion is in progress, the expansion pauses until the health of the RAIDZ vdev is restored (e.g. by replacing the failed disk and waiting<br>
for reconstruction to complete).</p>
<p dir="auto">The pool remains accessible during expansion. Following a reboot or export/import, the expansion resumes where it left off.</p>
<h4 dir="auto">After expansion</h4>
<p dir="auto">When the expansion completes, the additional space is available for use, and is reflected in the <code>available</code> zfs property (as seen in <code>zfs list</code>, <code>df</code>, etc).</p>
<p dir="auto">Expansion does not change the number of failures that can be tolerated without data loss (e.g. a RAIDZ2 is still a RAIDZ2 even after expansion).</p>
<p dir="auto">A RAIDZ vdev can be expanded multiple times.</p>
<p dir="auto">After the expansion completes, old blocks remain with their old data-to-parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distributed among the larger set of disks. New blocks will be written with the new data-to-parity<br>
ratio (e.g. a 5-wide RAIDZ2 which has been expanded once to 6-wide, has 4 data to 2 parity). However, the RAIDZ vdev's "assumed parity ratio" does not change, so slightly less space than is expected may be reported for newly-written blocks, according to <code>zfs list</code>, <code>df</code>, <code>ls -s</code>, and similar tools.</p>

     zpool-attach — attach new device to existing ZFS vdev

SYNOPSIS
     zpool attach [-fsw] [-o property=value] pool device new_device

DESCRIPTION
     Attaches new_device to the existing device.  The behavior differs depend‐
     ing on if the existing device is a RAIDZ device, or a mirror/plain
     device.

     If the existing device is a mirror or plain device ...

     If the existing device is a RAIDZ device (e.g. specified as &quot;raidz2-0&quot;),
     the new device will become part of that RAIDZ group.  A &quot;raidz expansion&quot;
     will be initiated, and the new device will contribute additional space to
     the RAIDZ group once the expansion completes.  The expansion entails
     reading all allocated space from existing disks in the RAIDZ group, and
     rewriting it to the new disks in the RAIDZ group (including the newly
     added device).  Its progress can be monitored with zpool status.

     Data redundancy is maintained during and after the expansion.  If a disk
     fails while the expansion is in progress, the expansion pauses until the
     health of the RAIDZ vdev is restored (e.g. by replacing the failed disk
     and waiting for reconstruction to complete).  Expansion does not change
     the number of failures that can be tolerated without data loss (e.g. a
     RAIDZ2 is still a RAIDZ2 even after expansion).  A RAIDZ vdev can be
     expanded multiple times.

     After the expansion completes, old blocks remain with their old data-to-
     parity ratio (e.g. 5-wide RAIDZ2, has 3 data to 2 parity), but distrib‐
     uted among the larger set of disks.  New blocks will be written with the
     new data-to-parity ratio (e.g. a 5-wide RAIDZ2 which has been expanded
     once to 6-wide, has 4 data to 2 parity).  However, the RAIDZ vdev's
     &quot;assumed parity ratio&quot; does not change, so slightly less space than is

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once joined a company as a consultant - in the previous 12 months, they'd spent their entire $1,500,000 marketing budget on Google/Facebook  ads. Using Hubspot we could track leads through the funnel and look at exactly how many customers this money had generated. The answer was 0. In total, the ads brought in two leads to the website who never even booked a demo for the product. For <strong><em>$1,500,000.</em></strong></p><p>We ultimately managed to turn the ship around (more on that later in the series) but the lesson stands: marketing can be expensive and drain your runway. This is why accelerators like YC prefer cold outreach / emailing prospects during the early days of your company - it's free.</p><p>But how do you know if your business is ready to invest in marketing? To answer this question, you'll need to understand if your company have some form of product market fit - PMF. There are many ways you can define PMF:</p><pre>In 2009, Sean Ellis, also known as the founder of Growth Hacking, wrote that he identify Product-Market fit with the help of a survey. He asks the users of a product however they would be disappointed if the product would no longer be available. If at least 40% of users say they would be very disappointed, it probably means that you have Product-Market Fit.<p>Further, he adds that “Admittedly this threshold is a bit arbitrary, but I defined it after comparing results across nearly 100 startups. Those that struggle for traction are always under 40%, while most that gain strong traction exceed 40%.”</p></pre><p>There are more abstract definitions which say that PMF has been achieved when your company is drowning in demand - without time or resources to scale. I don't like this definition as much because it's only the ultimate form of PMF from a VC perspective - I've seen plenty of companies with PMF who are not in the aforementioned situation. If a kid sells lemonade on a sunny day, they can still make bank even if the line to the stand isn't running around the block.</p><p>If you don't have any PMF, don't invest money in marketing - you might end up like the examples mentioned in the introduction. The goal of marketing is to find a predictable method where if you spend e.g. $1,000 marketing dollars and expect a statistical 3x return of $3,000 in profit which should scale with your marketing budget. Marketing research can help you find customers who would be a good fit for your product, but if so it needs to be conducted in a cheap fashion (more on this later). Instead, invest your budget in product development to reach PMF.<br></p><h3>If you have product market fit</h3><p>Congratulations! You've got over the hardest part of starting a startup and can start investing in marketing.</p><p>The basis of a good marketing strategy is aligning it with your business objective(s) - no more lofty "number of likes" metrics. Start at the top - here are some examples of marketing objectives to choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Boost Customer Acquisition:</strong> Attract new customers to expand your customer base and drive revenue growth.</li><li><strong>Increase Market Share:</strong> Expand the percentage of the market your business serves, often achieved by outperforming competitors or acquiring new customers.</li><li><strong>Market penetration:</strong> If your startup is expanding to new markets, the marketing objective could be to increase market penetration in those regions.</li><li><strong>Improve Brand Awareness:</strong> Enhance the recognition and visibility of your brand among the target audience, leading to increased trust and customer loyalty.</li><li><strong>Enhance Customer Retention:</strong> Focus on strategies to retain existing customers, thereby reducing churn and fostering long-term relationships (marketing team can help with this too).</li><li><strong>Improve Employee Engagement (internal communication):</strong> Foster a positive work culture and invest in employee development to increase productivity and reduce turnover.<br></li></ul><p>This is usually agreed on a leadership level based on what can be accomplished with the soon to be approved marketing budget. For this exercise, let's imagine a SaaS business named ApiHub, targeting B2B customers looking for an API to power their e-commerce business:</p><p><strong>Company wide business objective for end of year (EOY):</strong></p><ul><li>Increase revenue by $8,000,000</li></ul><p><strong>Selected marketing objective:</strong></p><ul><li>Boost Customer Acquisition: Get 666,250 additional visitors to our website before EOY.</li></ul><p>How did we arrive at this number? As a rule of thumb, the pipeline in startup SaaS businesses usually comes from:</p><ul><li>Marketing: 40%</li><li>Cold-outreach/sales: 40%</li><li>Partnerships: 20%</li></ul><p>Hence,  $8,000,000 x 0.4 / $3,000 Annual Contract Value (ACV) = 1,066 customers before EOY.</p><p>This is where your website analytics comes in handy - e.g. last year, we know that we had 1,200,000 visitors on our SaaS website. Of them, 2,000 became paying customers - hence the conversion rate from visitor to customer is 2,000 / 1,200,000 =  0.16%. If we want to understand how many additional website visitors we need to generate 1,066 more customers, we calculate (1,066 / 16) x  10,000 = 666,250 additional visitors.</p><h3>How the heck do we get 666,250 new visitors?</h3><p>Now what? We need to dig deeper to get to specific marketing strategies and tasks to be able to execute on. Many companies use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKRs</a> to drill down sequential marketing objectives and specify key results that ladder back up to our overarching target. But I prefer a "effectiveness framework" used in many agencies instead.</p><pre>In 2005, the UK grocery chain Sainsbury's set up a big sales goal to recover profit over a period of declining sales. With a simple equation, agency BBDO calculated that the marketing portion of this sales goal would be achieved if they got each shopper to spend an extra £1.14 every time they shopped.<p>This led to the campaign 'Try Something New Today', encouraging each shopper to spend an extra £1.14 every time they shopped. Analysis had shown that customers were 'sleep-shopping' and in a rut with the things they buy and cook. By using TV, press, radio and in-store advertising, Sainsbury's gave its customers simple meal ideas, which encouraged them to try new things and spend more on their shopping. The success of this campaign has generated £550 million in sales over two years.</p></pre><p>This is a really great effectiveness case study where Sainsbury's managed to impact the bottom line using a clear marketing objective derived from their business objective. I recommend watching their short case study <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MopXVY7KswA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The idea of an effectiveness framework is to clearly map out what objectives you need to hit, what consumer behaviour change needs to happen and the role and tasks of comms you need to achieve.</p><p>For our API business, the beginning of an effectiveness map might look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://images.prismic.io/briefmix/1df3946c-4153-4c97-b2c4-71263cde026e_Screen+Shot+2023-08-18+at+10.23.35.png?auto=compress,format" alt="Briefmix Effectiveness Map"></p><p>You can view and download this template <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uFPNbZF8--Z4wH7Y3tyWaiir66umCMPaRvgv3uVJgwk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. We have also started to add KPIs next to the map which will be important to measure during the year to make sure our efforts are on track.</p><p>This is only the beginning to the map as we have yet to decide about the brand, marketing mix, tactics and channels. As we progress through the course, we will loop back to this map and fill it out further.</p><p>And there we have it! Before we can start filling out the rest of the framework with tactics, we need to have a good understanding of our brand and what we stand for. Let’s start by understanding why a third of Coca Cola's market value comes from its brand:</p><p><a href="https://briefmix.com/startup/create-new-brand">How do you define a brand? -&gt;</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Serde, a popular Rust (de)serialization&nbsp;project,&nbsp;has decided to ship its <em>serde_derive </em>macro as a&nbsp;precompiled binary.</p>
<p>The move has generated a fair amount of push back among developers who worry about&nbsp;its future&nbsp;legal and&nbsp;technical implications, along with a potential for supply chain attacks, should the maintainer&nbsp;account&nbsp;publishing these&nbsp;binaries be compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Rust package&nbsp;registry, crates.io,&nbsp;<em>serde</em> has been downloaded <a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">over 196 million times</a> over its lifetime, whereas the <em><a href="https://crates.io/crates/serde_derive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">serde_derive</a></em>&nbsp;macro has scored&nbsp;more than 171 million downloads, attesting to the project's&nbsp;widespread circulation.</p>
<h2>Serde&nbsp;macro goes precompiled: there's no way to opt-out</h2>
<p>About three weeks ago, a Rust programmer using the Serde project in their application noticed something odd.</p>
<p>"I'm working on packaging serde for Fedora Linux, and I noticed that recent versions of <em>serde_derive</em> ship a precompiled binary now," <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issue-1825383332" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wrote</a>&nbsp;Fabio Valentini, a Fedora Packaging Committee member.</p>
<p>"This is problematic for us, since we cannot, under no circumstances (with only very few exceptions, for firmware or the like), redistribute precompiled binaries."</p>
<p>Serde&nbsp;is a commonly used&nbsp;<em>ser</em>ialization&nbsp;and <em>de</em>serialization&nbsp;framework for Rust data structures that, <a href="https://serde.rs/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">according to its website</a>,&nbsp;is designed to conduct these operations "efficiently and generically."</p>
<p>"The Serde ecosystem consists of data structures that know how to serialize and deserialize themselves along with data formats that know how to serialize and deserialize other things," states the project's website. Whereas, "<a href="https://serde.rs/derive.html#using-derive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">derive</a>" is one of its macros.</p>
<p>Valentini&nbsp;further&nbsp;inquired&nbsp;to the project maintainers, how were these new&nbsp;binaries "actually produced," and if it would be possible for him&nbsp;to recreate the binaries, as opposed to&nbsp;consuming precompiled versions.</p>
<p>David Tolnay, who is the primary Serde maintainer, <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1654783988" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">responded</a> with potential workarounds at the time. But, that's not to say that everyone is pleased.</p>
<p>Following an influx of comments from developers as to why the decision wasn't best suited for the project, Tolnay <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1682519944" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">acknowledged the feedback</a>, prior to closing&nbsp;the GitHub issue.</p>
<p>His justification for shipping precompiled binaries is reproduced in whole below.</p>
<div><p>"The precompiled implementation is the only supported way to use the macros that are published in <em>serde_derive</em>.</p><p>
If there is implementation work needed in some build tools to accommodate it, someone should feel free to do that work (as I have done for Buck and Bazel, which are tools I use and contribute significantly to) or publish your own fork of the source code under a different name.</p><p>
Separately, regarding the commentary above about security, the best path forward would be for one of the people who cares about this to invest in a Cargo or crates.io RFC around first-class precompiled macros so that there is an approach that would suit your preferences; <em>serde_derive</em> would adopt that when available."</p></div>
<p>BleepingComputer has approached Tolnay with additional questions prior to publishing.</p>
<h2>"First .NET's Moq and now this."</h2>
<p>Some Rust developers request that&nbsp;precompiled binaries be kept&nbsp;<em>optional&nbsp;</em>and separate from the original "serde_derive" crate, while others have likened the move&nbsp;to the <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-open-source-project-moq-criticized-for-quietly-collecting-data/" target="_blank">controversial code change</a> to the Moq .NET project&nbsp;that sparked backlash.</p>
<p>"Please consider moving the precompiled serde_derive version to a different crate and default serde_derive to building from source so that users that want the benefit of precompiled binary can opt-in to use it," <a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1661893000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">requested</a> one user.</p>
<p>"Or vice-versa.&nbsp;Or any other solution that allows building from source without having to patch serde_derive."</p>
<p>"Having a binary shipped as part of the crate, while I understand the build time speed benefits, is for security reasons not a viable solution for some library users."</p>
<p>Users&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1684708897" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">pointed out</a> how the change could impact entities that are&nbsp;"legally not allowed to redistribute pre-compiled binaries, by their own licenses," specifically mentioning government-regulated environments.</p>
<p>"...First .NET's Moq and now this," said Jordan Singh, an Australia-based developer, in a <a href="https://archive.is/Aqxco#issuecomment-1684657021-permalink" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">comment</a> that was later removed.</p>
<p>"If this is to force cargo devs to support a feature then this is terrible way around doing it. At-least give us reproducible binaries. I'm sick of devs of popular crates/libraries taking everyone hostage with absurd decisions."</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based Donald Stufft <a href="https://twitter.com/dstufft/status/1692705666593357909" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">cautioned against</a> the risks of getting into the business of "shipping binaries" on social media:</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Developer cautions against the move" height="221" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1164866/2023/Aug/rust-serde/tweet1.jpg" width="500"><figcaption><strong>Developer cautions against the "shipping binaries" business</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Rust programmer Nathan West, who goes by <em>Lucretiel</em>, specifically <a href="https://twitter.com/Lucretiel/status/1692760873243160740" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highlighted</a> the supply-chain risks posed by precompiled binaries, should the&nbsp;maintainer&nbsp;account get compromised:&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="supply chain risk" height="245" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1164866/2023/Aug/rust-serde/tweet2.jpg" width="500"><figcaption><strong>Supply chain risks associated with shipping precompiled&nbsp;binaries</strong></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>"Is not this the exact way they'd go about it? Ship it silently as a semi-plausible change to how <em>serde</em> works, intransigently ignore all criticism of the decision," wrote West.</p>
<p>"This is *exactly* the reason that everyone has such a reflexive opposition to moves like this."</p>
<p>"Trust on the internet isn't perfect; we *don't* know that that's really [the maintainer]&nbsp;posting in GitHub. That's why we have layers and proxies of defense; sketchy sh*t is rejected because it's not worth the risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technologist&nbsp;Sanket Kanjalkar&nbsp;called the transition to ship&nbsp;binaries without a way of opting-out "<a href="https://twitter.com/sanket1729/status/1692698203572109355" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a step backward</a>."</p>
<p>But, a security professional who goes by Lander, has <a href="https://twitter.com/landaire/status/1692688116925305176" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">a slightly different take</a>:</p>
<p>"This Rust drama about <em>serde_derive</em> shipping a precompiled binary is kind of funny," writes Lander.</p>
<p>"On one hand, I understand people's concern. On the other hand, who cares? nobody's reading proc macro <em>code/build.rs</em> code for every project they pull in anyways. An opt-out would be a good idea tho."</p>
<p>Whether you agree with the project's decision to serve its macros precompiled or not, it is a good practice&nbsp;to routinely inspect&nbsp;any source code and&nbsp;software binaries prior&nbsp;to incorporating these into your projects.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I have posted this to four other Tesla related subreddits only to have them removed so hopefully this one sticks..</p>

<p>I have had a horrible experience with Tesla and their team in the past couple of days. My family purchased our new car a couple months ago and was enjoying it up until a few days ago when I tried to get the car into gear and it demanded that I input the password. Having not set up a password previously, I contacted Tesla about the issue. </p>

<p>While I was waiting to speak with a representative, I noticed that my car was no longer linked to my account on the app, nor could I log into my Tesla account. After waiting on hold for two hours, I was finally able to get through to a representative who informed me that I needed to contact Tesla Financial about this issue. I called the number provided immediately but they did not pick up as they were outside of working hours.</p>

<p>“Not a problem.” I thought. I’d call back again tomorrow and sort this out. I left my car in the parking lot at work overnight and had a family member pick me up and drop me off the next morning. While I’m working the next day, my boss informs me that there is a tow truck outside to tow my car. Confused, I went out to the parking lot and was told by the towing company that Tesla is repossessing my vehicle. </p>

<p>This is where my confusion grew. We had paid for the vehicle IN FULL at the time we picked it up from the dealership, but the towing company is just doing what tesla told them to do. so they took my car.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, my father received a phone call from Tesla Financial and he asked them what was going on. They told him that Tesla had been trying to reach out to us multiple times through phone and email about a debt they have been attempting to collect on the car. </p>

<p>My father had been out of the country for the past couple months so any phone calls would not have reached him. He did not receive a single voicemail about this issue either. He looked through his emails and noticed that he did in fact receive only two emails on July 27 and July 28, stating that we had not yet paid for the car and that the full cost of the vehicle is still at large. These emails went ignored as he believed them to be a phishing attempt because we had already PAID IN FULL at the dealership. He also believed that Tesla could not have made such a huge mistake like this.</p>

<p>My father explained this over the phone but the representative did not budge. This Tesla representative was rude and unprofessional for the entire phone call—going so far as to yell at my father over the phone.</p>

<p>A different Tesla representative sent us an email that seemed to be a copy paste of what they had sent my father back in July and that this car is now being considered for repossession. I shot an email back explaining AGAIN that this car had been paid for in full already and that we have been very dissatisfied by how Tesla had been handling this situation.</p>

<p>Up until this point, we were under the impression that Tesla was repossessing our vehicle without any warning because the two emails they sent to us regarding this seemed to be a phishing scam. Again they left no voicemails about this either. </p>

<p>The Tesla representative then emailed back this statement:</p>

<p>“I am having the team fully post the funds of the cashier's check. I am redrafting the documents and title/lien to your name instead of [BANK]. I have attached documents. Once funds post I can then restore access to the vehicle and release title/lien to your name.”</p>

<p>Basically saying that they had the check this whole time but due to some internal oversight had not cashed it. And they came after us, accused us of not paying, and repossessed our vehicle. Not only that, they incorrectly had the title of our car under the bank’s name rather than our own.</p>

<p>The next day, we received another email stating that the car is now back under our name and it can be picked up from the tow yard. </p>

<p>No apology. No restitution. </p>

<p>My father emailed them back saying he was glad the issue was resolved but was disappointed that there was no restitution offered, not even an apology. </p>

<p>They then emailed back the equivalent of saying “well we did try to contact you about this.” </p>

<p>I shot back an email stating that we are frustrated because it seems like this was an internal accounting issue that we should not have been contacted about or been involved in, in the first place. </p>

<p>Now we find ourselves carless for four days and will have to go out of our way to pick up a car that was wrongly repossessed. </p>

<p>And still Tesla offers no apology, restitution, and no guarantee that they are taking steps to prevent anything like this from happening in the future.</p>

<p>EDIT: the car was paid for with a combination of card and CASHIER’S check. Cashiers check means the amount of money is withdrawn from the bank when it’s ISSUED not cashed. so no, we did not notice extra money sitting in our account because it had already been withdrawn.</p>

<p>UPDATE: we got the car back today and there is no damage to it. we have been talking about getting an attorney or at least taking this to small claims court but in the end the decision comes down to what my dad wants to do as he owns the car. </p>

<p>will probably not be updating again because i’m tired of thinking about this but we’ll see. i’m really upset with tesla and would return the car if i could.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Artwork created by artificial intelligence isn’t eligible for copyright protection because it lacks human authorship, a Washington, D.C., federal judge decided Friday.</p><p>Judge <bw-person data-terminal-id="15169224" data-id="00000161-7711-d8ae-adf9-ffb515750000" data-name="Beryl Alaine Howell">Beryl A. Howell</bw-person> of the US District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the US Copyright Office’s decision to deny a copyright registration to computer scientist Stephen Thaler, who argued a two-dimensional artwork created by his AI program “Creativity Machine” should be eligible for protection. </p><p>The ruling is the first in the country to establish a boundary on the legal protections for AI-generated artwork, which has exploded in popularity with the rise of products like OpenAI Inc.'s ChatGPT and DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.</p><p>Howell found that “courts have uniformly declined to recognize copyright in works created absent any human involvement,” citing cases where copyright protection was denied for celestial beings, a cultivated garden, and a monkey who took a selfie.</p><p>“Undoubtedly, we are approaching new frontiers in copyright as artists put AI in their toolbox to be used in the generation of new visual and other artistic works,” the judge wrote. </p><p>The rise of generative AI will “prompt challenging questions” about how much human input into an AI program is necessary to qualify for copyright protection, Howell said, as well as how to assess the originality of AI-generated art that comes from systems trained on existing copyrighted works. </p><p>But this case “is not nearly so complex” because Thaler admitted in his application that he played no role in creating the work, Howell said.</p><p>Thaler, the president and CEO of Imagination Engines, sued the office in June 2022 following its denial of his application to register the AI-generated art piece titled “A Recent Entrance to Paradise.”</p><p>His attorney, Ryan Abbott of Brown Neri Smith &amp; Khan LLP, said he plans to appeal the judgment. “We respectfully disagree with the court’s interpretation of the Copyright Act,” Abbott said.</p><p>The Copyright Office said in a statement that it believes the court reached the correct result and the office is reviewing the decision.</p><p>The office recently issued guidance on the copyrightability of works created with the assistance of AI, which attorneys said introduced <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-copyright-guide-has-lawyers-asking-where-to-draw-the-line">additional murkiness</a> in the AI authorship debate.</p><p>The Copyright Office in February <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-comic-art-dispute-leaves-copyright-protections-open-ended">granted</a> a limited copyright registration for an AI-assisted graphic novel, which attorneys said could crack the door open further to protect such works. </p><p>Thaler’s motion for summary judgment, which Howell denied in the Friday order, argued that permitting AI to be listed as an author on copyrighted works would incentivize more creation, which is in line with copyright law’s purpose of promoting useful art for the public.</p><p>“Denying copyright to AI-created works would thus go against the well-worn principle that '[c]opyright protection extends to all ‘original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium’ of expression,” Thaler argued in his <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/THALERvPERLMUTTERetalDocketNo122cv01564DDCJun022022CourtDocket/4?doc_id=X334L5RDNRF9EUPPB886AI13DKJ">motion</a>.</p><p>Register of Copyrights Shira Perlmutter, who leads the office, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ai-created-work-isnt-protectable-copyright-office-tells-judge">defended</a> the office’s decision to reject Thaler’s application on the grounds that it wasn’t created by a human. </p><p>“The Office’s conclusion that copyright law does not protect non-human creators was a sound and reasoned interpretation of the applicable law,” the agency wrote in its <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/THALERvPERLMUTTERetalDocketNo122cv01564DDCJun022022CourtDocket/4?doc_id=X334L5RDNRF9EUPPB886AI13DKJ">cross-motion</a> for summary judgment, which Howell granted Friday.</p><p>The Department of Justice represents the Copyright Office.</p><p>The case is <a href="https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/THALERvPERLMUTTERetalDocketNo122cv01564DDCJun022022CourtDocket/5?doc_id=X7E62VT5QQT84BRJVKSNVMDPLJV">Thaler v.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleven days ago, we sent these questions to Western Digital’s head of PR and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">published them publicly</a> on <em>The Verge</em>: </p><div><ul><li>Why are these drives still on sale?</li><li>Will you offer free data recovery services to affected customers? When?</li><li>Are you proactively warning customers and retailers who have already purchased these drives that significant data loss is possible?</li><li>If not, why not?</li><li>What, exactly, is going wrong with these drives?&nbsp;</li><li>How did this happen?&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div><p>What’s the fuss? For months, the company has been laughably silent about how its pricey portable SanDisk Extreme SSDs <em>might lose all your data</em>. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">It happened to my colleague Vjeran Pavic <em>twice</em></a>. It happened <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/sandisk-extreme-ssds-are-still-wiping-data-after-firmware-fix-users-say/">to <em>Ars Technica</em></a>. It happened <a href="https://petapixel.com/2023/08/08/sandisk-portable-ssds-are-failing-so-frequently-we-can-no-longer-recommend-them/">to <em>PetaPixel</em></a>. </p></div><div><p>Months after our inquiries, Western Digital continues to sell these drives <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued#:~:text=broken%20state%20of%20the%20internet%20means%20Western%20Digital%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20work%20very%20hard%20to%20keep%20selling%20these%20drives">due to deep discounts, fake Amazon reviews, and issues with Google Search</a> that rank favorable results far higher than warnings about potential failures.  </p></div><p>We have now received a response from Western Digital head of PR Robin Schultz, but nothing about the company’s stance has changed. Schultz repeatedly refused to answer any of our questions. Her statement doesn’t even contain an acknowledgment of the issue and has no specific timeline for any real answers. </p><p>The only reason we’re printing Western Digital’s statement is so you can see it for yourself:</p><div><blockquote><p>In response to recent reports of concerns about specific Western Digital portable SSD products, we want to assure our valued customers that we are taking all measures necessary to address any product-related issues. We understand the significance of our products to our customers and we take these matters very seriously. We are conducting a comprehensive review to gain a thorough understanding of the issues.</p></blockquote></div><p>After getting the statement, we asked Schultz three times whether Western Digital would answer our questions. Each time, she deflected. She also wouldn’t provide any idea of when the company might share its conclusions — if ever.</p><p>There <em>is</em> one possible reason Western Digital is finally speaking up and yet saying nothing: the company just got sued. <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/17/western_digital_sandisk_ssd_lawsuit/">As <em>The Register</em> reports</a>, California resident Nathan Krum has filed a prospective class action lawsuit, citing breach of contract, fraudulent and unfair business practices, and many other claims. Krum is suing over both the SanDisk Extreme drive itself and damages for any data lost. You can read the full complaint at the bottom of this story.</p><p>And that’s just lawsuit number one: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/sandisk-extreme-ssds-are-worthless-multiple-lawsuits-against-wd-say/">Ars Technica reports</a> there are two more. Three SanDisk SSD lawsuits in total, each seeking class-action status for the same failures. </p><div><p>Western Digital was already forced into <a href="https://www.wdrednasharddrivesettlement.com/">a class action settlement</a> over a previous questionable practice: in 2020, the company brazenly tried to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/western-digital-gets-sued-for-sneaking-smr-disks-into-its-nas-channel/">sneak SMR drives into its “WD Red” lineup</a> marketed for network-attached storage devices. The company <a href="https://www.bursor.com/result/western-digital-class-action-settlement/">paid $5.7 million</a> to settle those claims.</p></div><div><p>The company’s tricks didn’t end there: Western Digital’s NAS disks have started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759368/western-digital-three-years-warning-synology-nas">triggering warnings even if there’s nothing wrong with a drive</a>, seemingly to scare people into buying new ones simply after three years have gone by.</p></div><p>I won’t be buying a Western Digital or SanDisk product anytime soon.</p><p><em><strong>Update, 12:25AM ET: Added that there are actually three lawsuits, not just one, against WD.</strong></em></p></div></div>]]></description>

							<p>Have you ever wandered into an old library or dusty bookshop and paused to breathe in that familiar vanilla-coffee-grassy scent wafting off the aged tomes? That nostalgic olfactory experience is thanks to a bouquet of chemical compounds.</p>
<p>Modern books smell different because of changes in manufacturing, while old books release distinctive <a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/what-are-volatile-organic-compounds-vocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">volatile organic compounds</a> (VOCs) as they slowly decay. Scientists are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/13/scientists-preserving-books-smell" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sniffing out these VOCs</a> to reveal secrets about a book’s age, condition, and history.</p>

<h3>The Chemistry of Paper</h3>
<p>Paper is made of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/cellulose-fiber" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cellulose fibers bound by lignin</a>, while inks and bindings add other organic compounds. Cellulose is a polymer made of long glucose chains, while lignin is a complex polymer found in plant cells.</p>
<p>Over time, light, heat, and moisture cause the paper and compounds to break down, releasing VOCs that vaporize into the air. The manufacturing process also affects the VOCs released as the book ages.</p>
<h3>Telltale Scents</h3>
<p>An almond scent comes from <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benzaldehyde</a> in the paper. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Vanillin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vanillin</a>, the main compound in vanilla, is responsible for a sweet vanilla fragrance. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Ethylbenzene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethylbenzene</a>, used in inks and paints, has a sweet plastic smell. <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/2-Ethylhexan-1-ol" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2-Ethyl hexanol</a>, found in solvents and scents, smells lightly floral.</p>
<p>New books use modern chemicals like hydrogen peroxide and alkyl ketene dimers, so they give off different VOCs. The VOCs can also indicate exposure to smoke, water damage, or other aging factors.</p>
<h3>Reading the Chemical Clues</h3>
<p>Scientists can analyze the VOCs from an old book to determine its age and condition. The mix of compounds can reveal if a book came from an early print shop versus a late 19th century press. They can also identify degradation and preservation needs.</p>
<p>Librarians and historians use VOC analysis to study collections and even match orphaned books with the libraries they came from based on chemical fingerprints. It provides clues to an old tome’s origins and secrets as it aged over decades or centuries.</p>
<h3>The Life Story in a Whiff</h3>
<p>So next time you get a whiff of an old book, take a moment to enjoy that aromatic time capsule. Its scent has a story to tell, echoing the people, places, and processes that brought an ancient text to you. With each sniff, we get a little closer to understanding our bibliophilic past.</p>

<p><strong>FAQs</strong></p>
<h2>Why do old books smell the way they do?</h2>
<p>Old books release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they slowly decay over time. The specific VOCs depend on the paper, inks, and binding materials used, which give old books their distinctive scents.</p>
<h2>Do new and old books smell different?</h2>
<p>Yes, new books tend to smell more crisp and fresh, while old books have mustier, sweeter scents. This is because new book manufacturing uses different chemicals that produce different VOCs as they break down.</p>
<h2>What chemicals cause that nostalgic old book smell?</h2>
<p>Compounds like benzaldehyde, vanillin, ethylbenzene, and 2-ethyl hexanol are often responsible for old book scents. Benzaldehyde has an almond-like scent, vanillin smells like vanilla, ethylbenzene is sweet and plastic-y, and 2-ethyl hexanol is lightly floral.</p>
<h2>Can scientists learn about a book’s history from its smell?</h2>
<p>Yes, analyzing the volatile organic compounds released by a book can reveal details about its age, manufacturing origins, condition, and past exposure to elements like smoke or water. This helps determine preservation needs.</p>
<h2>How does paper decomposition create VOCs?</h2>
<p>Paper is made of cellulose and lignin. Over time, heat, light, and moisture cause these polymers to break down and release VOCs, which enter the air. The specific VOCs depend on the paper production process.</p>
<h2>Do libraries and museums use VOC analysis?</h2>
<p>Libraries and museums are beginning to use VOC analysis to identify preservation needs in collections. It can also help match orphaned books by chemical fingerprint to determine their original source library.</p>

                Friday, 11 August 2023 - 16:10

  </div>

  
  
      
    
      
  
   
      
      <div><p>Amsterdam has started the fight against noisy motorcycles and cars. On Friday, the city placed electric road signs in two places to warn road users if their vehicles are too loud. The warnings will eventually be replaced by “noise cameras,” which, like speed cameras, automatically send a fine to the offending driver, Parool reports.</p>

<p>The test with the noise signs will start at the Stadhouderskade in the city center and Molenaarsweg in Amsterdam-Noord. The installation consists of a noise meter and a screen a little further on. If the meter registers too much noise, the driver will see the message “Te luid” - “Too loud” in Dutch. Later this month, more sound meters and signs will be installed on Europaboulevard in Zuid and on Tussen Meer in Nieuw-West. </p>

<p>The municipality hopes that the signs alone will already alert road users to the noise their vehicles make and prompt them to do something about it, a spokesperson told Parool.</p>

<p>Rotterdam is conducting a similar experiment in collaboration with Amsterdam. It is part of a broader approach, the municipality of Amsterdam spokesperson said. “Other measures we are taking include a simpler way of enforcement and a feasibility study by TNO into the application of the noise camera. We try to reduce noise nuisance in various ways.”</p>

<p>The noise camera consists of a box containing four microphones that can detect precisely where a sound is coming from. The box is connected to a regular speed camera, which takes a photo of the license plate to issue a fine. If the data from the current experiment proves reliable, Amsterdam and other large cities will ask the Cabinet to have the technology certified. </p>

(Sometimes the link fails right off the bat, giving you zero opportunity to read through the terms!)</p><p>So I would take advantage of that and save it, by any means necessary: screen scrape, copy-paste, print-as-PDF, take photo of screen with second device, whatever it took, because they could make it difficult!</p><p>But then I would usually end up with a copy of the contract that I could later call up and check on. So, your suggestion that analytics can determine my dwell time on the document when it's presented to me, that's not going to be indicative of how much time I really spent reading it after copying and saving it.</p><p>I've found that this is a good practice, and not for the reason you're thinking of. I've found that I'm extraordinarily bad at reading legal documents like this (including my lease, employment contract, benefits and insurance docs, you name it) because even if I think I understand, I didn't get it, and it's pointless anyway because negotiating the wording is not on the table.</p><p>But it's a good practice to save these, because of this: there are often instructions included about how to resolve disputes and claims against the company. These instructions usually follow a strict procedure and they have rules about what you can do. They also have contact info, and again, you will never ever find this contact info anywhere else ever again if you don't save the EULA at first opportunity. They will tell you what kind of arbitration or court proceedings are acceptable, they will tell you the complaints procedure from start to end, time frames, and what to expect at each point. This info is gold, and it's not going to be available when you come to have a dispute, and you're not even going to be aware of the procedure at that point, and so you will automatically be disqualified and lose any dispute because you didn't follow procedure. Have fun!

Moreover, you should have the option to deny consent per use of personal data.<p>I wonder if they are serving different ToS in the EU (haven't received anything from Microsoft yet).

Highly unlikely this is a coordinated change with Meta and MSFT.
