<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
            <p>This week, Ruby on Rails creator David Heinemeier Hansson and WordPress founding developer Matt Mullenweg started fighting about what "open source" means. I've spent twenty years working on open source sustainability, and I have some thoughts.</p>
<p>David Heinemeier Hansson (also known as DHH) released a new kanban tool, Fizzy, this week and <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/fizzy-is-our-fun-modern-take-on-kanban-and-we-made-it-open-source-54ac41b6">called it open source</a>.</p>
<p>People quickly pointed out that the <a href="https://www.fizzy.do/license">O'Saasy license</a> that Fizzy is released under blocks others from offering a competing SaaS version, which violates the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">Open Source Initiative's definition</a>. When challenged, he brushed it off on X and said, "You know this is just some shit people made up, right?". He followed with "Open source is when the source is open. Simple as that".</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://ma.tt/2025/12/dhh-open-source/">Matt Mullenweg rightly pushed back</a>. He argued that you can't ignore the Open Source Initiative definition. He compared it to North Korea calling itself a democracy. A clumsy analogy, but the point stands.</p>
<p>Look, the term "open source" has a specific, shared meaning. It is not a loose idea and not something you can repurpose for marketing. Thousands of people shaped that definition over decades. Ignoring that work means benefiting from the community while setting aside its rules.</p>
<p>This whole debate becomes spicier knowing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vagyIcmIGOQ">DHH was on Lex Fridman's podcast</a> only a few months ago, appealing to the spirit and ethics of open source to <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=vagyIcmIGOQ&amp;t=20506">criticize Matt's handling of the WP Engine dispute</a>. If the definition is just "shit people made up", what spirit was Matt violating?</p>
<p>The definition debate matters, but the bigger issue here is sustainability. DHH's choice of license reacts to a real pressure in open source: many companies make real money from open source software while leaving the hard work of building and maintaining it to others.</p>
<p>This tension also played a role in <a href="https://dri.es/solving-the-maker-taker-problem">Matt's fight with WP Engine</a>, so he and DHH share some common ground, even if they handle it differently. We see the same thing in Drupal, where contributions from the biggest companies in our ecosystem is extremely uneven.</p>
<p>DHH can experiment because Fizzy is new. He can choose a different license and see how it works. Matt can't as WordPress has been licensed under the GPL for more than twenty years. Changing that now is virtually impossible.</p>
<p>Both conversations are important, but watching two of the most influential people in open source argue about definitions while we all wrestle with <a href="https://dri.es/scaling-open-source-communities">free riders</a> feels a bit like firefighters arguing about hose lengths during a fire.</p>
<p>The definition debate matters because open source only works when we agree on what the term means. But sustainability decides whether projects like Drupal, WordPress, and Ruby on Rails keep thriving for decades to come. That is the conversation we need to have.</p>
<p>In Drupal, we are experimenting with contribution credits and with guiding work toward companies that support the project. These ideas have helped, but also have not solved the imbalance.</p>
<p>Six years ago I wrote in <a href="https://dri.es/balancing-makers-and-takers-to-scale-and-sustain-open-source">my Makers and Takers blog post</a> that I would love to see new licenses that "encourage software free riding", but "discourage customer free riding". O'Saasy is exactly that kind of experiment.</p>
<p>A more accurate framing would be that Fizzy is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software">source available</a>. You can read it, run it, and modify it. But DHH's company is keeping the SaaS rights because they want to be able to build a sustainable business. That is defensible and generous, but it is <em>not</em> open source.</p>
<p>I still do not have the full answer to the open source sustainability problem. I have been wrestling with it for more than twenty years. But I do know the solution is not renaming the problem.</p>
<p>Some questions are worth asking, and answering:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do we distinguish between companies that can't contribute and those that won't?</li>
<li>What actually changes corporate behavior: shame, self-interest, punitive action, exclusive benefits, or regulation?</li>
</ul>
<p>If this latest fight nudges us away from word games and toward these questions, some good may come from it.</p>

The topic of the Rust experiment was just discussed at the annual
Maintainers Summit.  The consensus among the assembled developers is that
Rust in the kernel is no longer experimental — it is now a core part of the
kernel and is here to stay.  So the "experimental" tag will be coming off.
Congratulations are in order for all of the Rust for Linux team.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																				
														<p><strong>In its first six months, New York City’s controversial congestion pricing scheme has reduced air pollution by 22% in Manhattan’s toll zone, while improving air quality across the entire metropolitan region, according to new research.</strong></p>
<p>The Cornell University study analysed data from 42 air quality monitors throughout the New York area between January 2024 and June 2025, tracking PM2.5 concentrations before and after the January 2025 launch of the Congestion Relief Zone (CRZ).</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg" alt="yellow cab on road during daytime" width="800" height="508" srcset="https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4.jpg 1600w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-300x191.jpg 300w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-1024x650.jpg 1024w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-768x488.jpg 768w, https://airqualitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/ahygosiiqo4-1536x975.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></a><br>
The findings provide the first rigorous evidence that charging drivers to enter Manhattan’s core delivers substantial public health benefits.</p>
<p>Within the CRZ, which covers Manhattan streets at or below 60th Street, average daily peak concentrations of PM2.5 dropped by 3.05 µg/m³. For context, background pollution levels in the region typically hover around 8-9 µg/m³, making this reduction particularly significant for public health.</p>
<p>Notably, the benefits were found to extend far beyond the toll zone itself. Across New York City’s five boroughs, pollution levels fell by an average of 1.07 µg/m³, while the broader metropolitan area saw reductions of 0.70 µg/m³. This refutes claims that congestion pricing merely pushes traffic and its associated pollution to neighboring communities.</p>
<p>The improvements grew stronger over time, suggesting drivers are increasingly adapting their behavior. In the CRZ’s first week, pollution reductions within the toll zone averaged just 0.8 µg/m³. By the 20th week, that figure had grown to 4.9 µg/m³, suggesting commuters were switching to public transit, rescheduling trips or finding alternative routes.</p>
<p>Indeed, traffic data supports this. Between January and June 2025, vehicle entries into the toll zone dropped approximately 11% overall, with heavy-duty truck traffic falling by 18% and passenger cars declining by 9%. The disproportionate reduction in truck traffic appears particularly important, as these vehicles contribute heavily to urban air pollution despite representing a smaller share of total traffic.</p>
<p>The results exceed outcomes from similar programs in European cities. Stockholm’s congestion pricing reduced air pollution by 5-15% over several years, while London’s Ultra Low Emission Zone achieved roughly a 7% citywide decline. The researchers suggest that New York’s comparatively larger impact reflects the city’s exceptional transit infrastructure and the high volume of discretionary trips that drivers can easily shift to subways and buses.</p>
<p>The findings arrive as other American cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, consider implementing their own congestion pricing systems. New York’s experience suggests such programs can deliver rapid environmental benefits while generating revenue for transit improvements – a dual outcome that urban planners have long sought but rarely achieved.</p>
<p>Senior author Oliver Gao said: ‘Our overall conclusion is that congestion pricing in New York City, like many other cities in the world that have implemented it, helped not only improve traffic, but also helped reduce air pollutant concentration, improve air quality and should be good for public health.’</p>
<p>The study’s co-lead author Timothy Fraser added: ‘It’s really exciting to me that air quality improved throughout the entire metro area. This tells us that congestion pricing didn’t simply relocate air pollution to the suburbs by rerouting traffic. Instead, folks are likely choosing cleaner transportation options altogether, like riding public transportation or scheduling deliveries at night. This thins traffic and limits how smog compounds when many cars are on the road.’</p>

It comes with a <em>mosaic</em> of new features, contributed to by many, some of which I am happy to have helped with. Below is my pick of highlights from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/releases/6.0/">the release notes</a>.</p><div id="upgrade-with-help-from-django-upgrade"><h2>Upgrade with help from django-upgrade<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#upgrade-with-help-from-django-upgrade"></a></h2><p>If you’re upgrading a project from Django 5.2 or earlier, please try my tool <a href="https://django-upgrade.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-upgrade</a>. It will automatically update old Django code to use new features, fixing some deprecation warnings for you, including five fixers for Django 6.0. (One day, I’ll propose django-upgrade to become an official Django project, when energy and time permit…)</p></div><div id="template-partials"><h2>Template partials<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#template-partials"></a></h2><p>There are four headline features in Django 6.0, which we’ll cover before other notable changes, starting with this one:</p><blockquote>The Django Template Language now supports <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/language/#template-partials">template partials</a>, making it easier to encapsulate and reuse small named fragments within a template file.</blockquote><p>Partials are sections of a template marked by the new <code>{% partialdef %}</code> and <code>{% endpartialdef %}</code> tags. They can be reused within the same template or rendered in isolation. Let’s look at examples for each use case in turn.</p><div id="reuse-partials-within-the-same-template"><h3>Reuse partials within the same template<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#reuse-partials-within-the-same-template"></a></h3><p>The below template reuses a partial called <code>filter_controls</code> within the same template. It’s defined once at the top of the template, then used twice later on. Using a partial allows the template avoid repetition without pushing the content into a separate include file.</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>section</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>videos</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>{%</span> <span>partialdef</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>

<span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Actually, we can simplify this pattern further, by using the <code>inline</code> option on the <code>partialdef</code> tag, which causes the definition to also render in place:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>section</span> <span>id</span><span>=</span><span>videos</span><span>&gt;</span>

  <span>{%</span> <span>partial</span> <span>filter_controls</span> <span>%}</span>
<span>&lt;/</span><span>section</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>Reach for this pattern any time you find yourself repeating template code within the same template.

</pre></div><p>The initial <code>video</code> view renders the full template <code>video.html</code>. The <code>video_view_count</code> view renders just the <code>view_count</code> partial, by appending <code>#view_count</code> to the template name. This syntax is similar to how you’d reference an HTML fragment by its ID in a URL.</p></div><div id="history"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history"></a></h3><p>htmx was the main motivation for this feature, as promoted by htmx creator Carson Gross in <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/template-fragments/">a cross-framework review post</a>. Using partials definitely helps maintain “Locality of behaviour” within your templates, easing authoring, debugging, and maintenance by avoiding template file sprawl.</p><p>Django’s support for template partials was initially developed by Carlton Gibson in the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-template-partials/">django-template-partials package</a>, which remains available for older Django versions. The integration into Django itself was done in a Google Summer of Code project this year, worked on by student Farhan Ali and mentored by Carlton, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36410">Ticket #36410</a>. You can read more about the development process in <a href="https://www.farhana.li/blog/my-gsoc25-journey-django">Farhan’s retrospective blog post</a>. Many thanks to Farhan for authoring, Carlton for mentoring, and Natalia Bidart, Nick Pope, and Sarah Boyce for reviewing!</p></div></div><div id="tasks-framework"><h2>Tasks framework<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#tasks-framework"></a></h2><p>The next headline feature we’re covering:</p><blockquote>Django now includes a built-in Tasks framework for running code outside the HTTP request–response cycle. This enables offloading work, such as sending emails or processing data, to background workers.</blockquote><p>Basically, there’s a new API for defining and enqueuing background tasks—very cool!</p><p>Background tasks are a way of running code outside of the request-response cycle. They’re a common requirement in web applications, used for sending emails, processing images, generating reports, and more.</p><p>Historically, Django has not provided any system for background tasks, and kind of ignored the problem space altogether. Developers have instead relied on third-party packages like <a href="https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/">Celery</a> or <a href="https://django-q2.readthedocs.io/en/master/">Django Q2</a>. While these systems are fine, they can be complex to set up and maintain, and often don’t “go with the grain” of Django.</p><p>The new Tasks framework fills this gap by providing an interface to define background tasks, which task runner packages can then integrate with. This common ground allows third-party Django packages to define tasks in a standard way, assuming you’ll be using a compatible task runner to execute them.</p><p>Define tasks with the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/tasks/#django.tasks.task"><code>@task</code></a> decorator:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.tasks</span> <span>import</span> <span>task</span>


<span>@task</span>

Jake Howard started on the idea for Wagtail, a Django-powered CMS, back in 2021, as they have a need for common task definitions across their package ecosystem. He upgraded the idea to target Django itself in 2024, when he proposed <a href="https://github.com/django/deps/blob/main/accepted/0014-background-workers.rst">DEP 0014</a>. As a member of the Steering Council at the time, I had the pleasure of helping review and accept the DEP.</p><p>Since then, Jake has been leading the implementation effort, building pieces first in the separate <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-tasks/">django-tasks package</a> before preparing them for inclusion in Django itself. This step was done under <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/35859">Ticket #35859</a>, with <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/18627">a pull request</a> that took nearly a year to review and land. Thanks to Jake for his perseverance here, and to all reviewers: Andreas Nüßlein, Dave Gaeddert, Eric Holscher, Jacob Walls, Jake Howard, Kamal Mustafa, @rtr1, @tcely, Oliver Haas, Ran Benita, Raphael Gaschignard, and Sarah Boyce.</p><p>Read more about this feature and story in <a href="https://theorangeone.net/posts/django-dot-tasks-exists/">Jake’s post celebrating when it was merged</a>.</p></div></div><div id="content-security-policy-support"><h2>Content Security Policy support<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#content-security-policy-support"></a></h2><p>Our third headline feature:</p><blockquote>Built-in support for the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/security/#security-csp">Content Security Policy (CSP)</a> standard is now available, making it easier to protect web applications against content injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). CSP allows declaring trusted sources of content by giving browsers strict rules about which scripts, styles, images, or other resources can be loaded.</blockquote><p>I’m really excited about this, because I’m a bit of a security nerd who’s been deploying CSP for client projects for years.</p><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP">CSP</a> is a security standard that can protect your site from cross-site scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks. You set a <code><span>content-security-policy</span></code> header to declare which content sources are trusted for your site, and then browsers will block content from other sources. For example, you might declare that only scripts your domain are allowed, so an attacker who manages to inject a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag pointing to evil.com would be thwarted, as the browser would refuse to load it.</p><p>Previously, Django had no built-in support for CSP, and developers had to rely on building their own, or using a third-party package like the very popular <a href="https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-csp</a>. But this was a little bit inconvenient, as it meant that other third-party packages couldn’t reliably integrate with CSP, as there was no common API to do so.</p><p>The new CSP support provides all the core features that django-csp did, with a slightly tidier and more Djangoey API. To get started, <strong>first</strong> add <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware"><code>ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware</code></a> to your <code>MIDDLEWARE</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>MIDDLEWARE</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span># ...</span>
    <span>"django.middleware.csp.ContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware"</span><span>,</span>
    <span># ...</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p>Place it next to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/middleware/#django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware"><code>SecurityMiddleware</code></a>, as it similarly adds security-related headers to all responses. (You <em>do</em> have <code>SecurityMiddleware</code> enabled, right?)</p><p><strong>Second,</strong> configure your CSP policy using the new settings:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secure-csp"><code>SECURE_CSP</code></a> to configure the <code><span>content-security-policy</span></code> header, which is your actively enforced policy.</li><li><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/settings/#secure-csp-report-only"><code>SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY</code></a> to configure the <code><span>content-security-policy-report-only</span></code> header, which sets a non-enforced policy for which browsers report violations to a specified endpoint. This option is useful for testing and monitoring a policy before enforcing it.</li></ul><p>For example, to adopt the nonce-based strict CSP <a href="https://web.dev/articles/strict-csp">recommended by web.dev</a>, you could start with the following setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.utils.csp</span> <span>import</span> <span>CSP</span>

<span>SECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"script-src"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONCE</span><span>,</span> <span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>STRICT_DYNAMIC</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"object-src"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONE</span><span>],</span>
    <span>"base-uri"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>CSP</span><span>.</span><span>NONE</span><span>],</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div><p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/csp/#django.utils.csp.CSP"><code>CSP</code></a> enum used above provides constants for CSP directives, to help avoid typos.</p><p>This policy is quite restrictive and will break most existing sites if deployed as-is, because it requires nonces, as covered next. That’s why the example shows starting with the report-only mode header, to help track down places that need fixing before enforcing the policy. You’d later change to setting the <code>SECURE_CSP</code> setting to enforce the policy.</p><p>Anyway, those are the two basic steps to set up the new CSP support!</p><div id="nonce-generation"><h3>Nonce generation<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#nonce-generation"></a></h3><p>A key part of the new feature is that <strong>nonce generation</strong> is now built-in to Django, when using the CSP middleware. Nonces are a security feature in CSP that allow you to mark specific <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags as trusted with a <code>nonce</code> attribute:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>&lt;</span><span>script</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>/static/app.js</span> <span>type</span><span>=</span><span>module</span> <span>nonce</span><span>=</span><span>55vsH4w7ATHB85C3MbPr_g</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>script</span><span>&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>The nonce value is randomly generated per-request, and included in the CSP header. An attacker performing content injection couldn’t guess the nonce, so browsers can trust only those tags that include the correct nonce. Because nonce generation is now part of Django, third-party packages can depend on it for their <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags and they’ll continue to work if you adopt CSP with nonces.</p><p>Nonces are the recommended way to use CSP today, avoiding problems with previous allow-list based approaches. That’s why the above recommended policy enables them. To adopt a nonce-based policy, you’ll need to annotate your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags with the nonce value through the following steps.</p><p><strong>First,</strong> add the new <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/templates/api/#django.template.context_processors.csp"><code>csp</code></a> template context processor to your <code>TEMPLATES</code> setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>TEMPLATES</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span>"BACKEND"</span><span>:</span> <span>"django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates"</span><span>,</span>
        <span>"OPTIONS"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>"context_processors"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
                <span># ...</span>
                <span>"django.template.context_processors.csp"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>],</span>
        <span>},</span>
    <span>},</span>
<span>]</span>
</pre></div><p><strong>Second,</strong> annotate your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tags with <code><span>nonce="{{</span> csp_nonce }}"</code>:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>-   &lt;script src="{% static 'app.js' %}" type="module"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
<span>+   &lt;script src="{% static 'app.js' %}" type="module" nonce="{{ csp_nonce }}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
</pre></div><p>This can be tedious and error-prone, hence using the report-only mode first to monitor violations might be useful, especially on larger projects.</p><p>Anyway, deploying CSP right would be another post in itself, or even a book chapter, so we’ll stop here for now. For more info, check out <a href="https://web.dev/articles/strict-csp">that web.dev article</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">the MDN CSP guide</a>.</p></div><div id="history-2"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-2"></a></h3><p>CSP itself was proposed for browsers way back in 2004, and was first implemented in Mozilla Firefox version 4, released 2011. That same year, <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/15727">Django Ticket #15727</a> was opened, proposing adding CSP support to Django. Mozilla created <a href="https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">django-csp</a> from 2010, before the first public availability of CSP, using it on their own Django-powered sites. The first comment on Ticket #15727 pointed to django-csp, and the community basically rolled with it as the de facto solution.</p><p>Over the years, CSP itself evolved, as did django-csp, with <a href="https://rob.cogit8.org/">Rob Hudson</a> ending up as its maintainer. Focusing on the package motivated to finally get CSP into Django itself. He made a draft PR and posted on Ticket #15727 in 2024, which I enjoyed helping review. He iterated on the PR over the next 13 months until it was finally merged for Django 6.0.

This was hard to remember and it costs an extra database query.</p><p>Now Django takes advantage of the <code>RETURNING</code> SQL clause to save the model instance and fetch updated dynamic field values in a single query, on backends that support it (SQLite, PostgreSQL, and Oracle). A <code>save()</code> call may now issue a query like:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>UPDATE</span><span> </span><span>"example_video"</span>

<span>RETURNING</span><span> </span><span>"example_video"</span><span>.</span><span>"last_updated"</span>

</pre></div><p>On backends that don’t support <code>RETURNING</code> (MySQL and MariaDB), Django now marks the dynamic fields as deferred after saving.

Django uses this setting to add a primary key field called <code>id</code> to models that don’t explicitly define a primary key field. For example, if you define a model like this:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.db</span> <span>import</span> <span>models</span>


<span>class</span> <span>Video</span><span>(</span><span>models</span><span>.</span><span>Model</span><span>):</span>
    <span>title</span> <span>=</span> <span>models</span><span>.</span><span>TextField</span><span>()</span>
</pre></div><p>…then it will have two fields: <code>id</code> and <code>title</code>, where <code>id</code> uses the type defined by <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code>.</p><p>The setting can also be overridden on a per-app basis by defining <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/applications/#django.apps.AppConfig.default_auto_field"><code>AppConfig.default_auto_field</code></a> in the app’s <code>apps.py</code> file:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>django.apps</span> <span>import</span> <span>AppConfig</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ChannelConfig</span><span>(</span><span>AppConfig</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"channel"</span>
    <span>default_auto_field</span> <span>=</span> <span>"django.db.models.BigAutoField"</span>
</pre></div><p>A key motivation for adding the setting was to allow projects to switch from <code>AutoField</code> (a 32-bit integer) to <code>BigAutoField</code> (a 64-bit integer) for primary keys, without needing changes to every model. <code>AutoField</code> can store values up to about 2.1 billion, which sounds large but it becomes easy to hit at scale. <code>BigAutoField</code> can store values up to about 9.2 quintillion, which is “more than enough” for every practical purpose.</p><p>If a model using <code>AutoField</code> hits its maximum value, it can no longer accept new rows, a problem known as <strong>primary key exhaustion</strong>. The table is effectively blocked, requiring an urgent fix to switch the model from <code>AutoField</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code> via a locking database migration on a large table. For a great watch on how Kraken is fixing this problem, see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ4q0k_FNhw">Tim Bell’s DjangoCon Europe 2025 talk</a>, detailing some clever techniques to proactively migrate large tables with minimal downtime.</p><p>To stop this problem arising for new projects, Django 3.2 made new projects created with <code>startproject</code> set <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code>, and new apps created with <code>startapp</code> set their <code>AppConfig.default_auto_field</code> to <code>BigAutoField</code>. It also added a system check to ensure that projects set <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> explicitly, to ensure users were aware of the feature and could make an informed choice.</p><p>Now Django 6.0 changes the actual default values of the setting and app config attribute to <code>BigAutoField</code>. Projects using <code>BigAutoField</code> can remove the setting:</p><div><pre><span></span><span>-DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"</span>
</pre></div><p>…and app config attribute:</p><div><pre><span></span>from django.apps import AppConfig

<span> </span>class ChannelConfig(AppConfig):
<span> </span>    name = "channel"
<span>-    default_auto_field = "django.db.models.BigAutoField"</span>
</pre></div><p>The default <code>startproject</code> and <code>startapp</code> templates also no longer set these values. This change reduces the amount of boilerplate in new projects, and the problem of primary key exhaustion can fade into history, becoming something that most Django users no longer need to think about.</p><div id="history-6"><h3>History<a title="Permalink to this headline" href="#history-6"></a></h3><p>The addition of <code>DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD</code> in Django 3.2 was proposed by Caio Ariede and implemented by Tom Forbes, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31007">Ticket #31007</a>. This new change in Django 6.0 was proposed and implemented by ex-Fellow Tim Graham, in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/36564">Ticket #36564</a>.

We have an unprecedented opportunity to shape how this technology develops. Will we build open, interoperable infrastructure that serves everyone? Or will we see fragmentation that limits this powerful technology's potential? Without collaborative open development, we risk missing the full potential of agentic AI where everyone benefits thanks to open standards, open protocols, and open systems on which other tools are built. We also risk concentrating the power in the hands of a few, which dampers competition and restricts accessibility. In a proprietary, siloed ecosystem, breakthrough ideas can't easily build on each other, integration challenges slow enterprise adoption and limit use cases, accessibility barriers prevent smaller organizations from benefiting, and research limitations slow academic and independent innovation.<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!----><!----><!----></span><!----></p><!----><!--]--><!--[3--><!----><p><span><!--[--><!--[4--><!--[!-->History proves there’s a better path.

We hope that the AAIF can become what the W3C is for the Web: a set of standards and protocols that guarantee interoperability, open access, and freedom of choice with open source reference implementations.<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!----><!----><!----></span><!----></p><!----><!--]--><!--[3--><!----><!----><!--]--><!--[3--><!----><p><!----><h5><!--[--><!--[4--><!--[!-->What AAIF Will Do<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!----><!----><!----></h5><!----><!----></p><!----><!--]--><!--[3--><!----><p><span><!--[--><!--[4--><!--[!-->The Agentic AI Foundation provides a neutral home where companies, researchers, and independent developers can collaborate on open source agentic AI.<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!----><!----><!----></span><!----></p><!----><!--]--><!--[3--><!----><p><span><!--[--><!--[4--><!--[!-->Following the Linux Foundation's trusted governance model, AAIF will operate on several core principles:<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!----><!----><!----></span><!----></p><!----><!--]--><!--[3--><!----><p><span><!--[--><!--[2--><!----><strong><!--[--><!--[4--><!--[!-->Open Governance<!--]--><!--]--><!--]--><!----><!----></strong><!----><!--]--><!--[4--><!--[!-->: AAIF operates under a transparent and inclusive governance model where contributors from all backgrounds are empowered to shape the direction of the foundation and its projects.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/09/10-years">https://letsencrypt.org/2025/12/09/10-years</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46208962">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>On September 14, 2015, <a href="https://crt.sh/?id=9314793">our first publicly-trusted certificate</a> went live. We were proud that we had issued a certificate that a significant majority of clients could accept, and had done it using <a href="https://github.com/letsencrypt/boulder">automated software</a>. Of course, in retrospect this was just the first of billions of certificates. Today, Let’s Encrypt is the largest certificate authority in the world in terms of certificates issued, the ACME protocol we helped create and standardize is integrated throughout the server ecosystem, and we’ve become a household name among system administrators. We’re closing in on protecting one billion web sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/"><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/blog/blog-2025-12-09-chart1.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>In 2023, we marked the <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/tenth-anniversary/">tenth anniversary of the creation of our nonprofit</a>, Internet Security Research Group, which continues to host Let’s Encrypt and other public benefit infrastructure projects. Now, in honor of the tenth anniversary of Let’s Encrypt’s public certificate issuance and the start of the general availability of our services, we’re looking back at a few milestones and factors that contributed to our success.</p>
<h2 id="growth">Growth</h2>
<p>A conspicuous part of Let’s Encrypt’s history is how thoroughly our vision of scalability through automation has succeeded.</p>
<p>In March 2016, we issued our one millionth certificate. Just two years later, in September 2018, we were issuing a million certificates every day. In 2020 we reached a billion total certificates issued and as of late 2025 we’re frequently issuing ten million certificates per day. We’re now on track to reach a billion active sites, probably sometime in the coming year. (The “certificates issued” and “certificates active” metrics are quite different because our certificates regularly expire and get replaced.)</p>
<p>The steady growth of our issuance volume shows the strength of our architecture, the validity of our vision, and the great efforts of our engineering team to scale up our own infrastructure. It also reminds us of the confidence that the Internet community is placing in us, making the use of a Let’s Encrypt certificate a normal and, dare we say, boring choice. But I often point out that our ever-growing issuance volumes are only an indirect measure of value. What ultimately matters is improving the security of people’s use of the web, which, as far as Let’s Encrypt’s contribution goes, is not measured by issuance volumes so much as by the prevalence of HTTPS encryption. For that reason, we’ve always emphasized the graph of the percentage of encrypted connections that web users make (here represented by statistics from Firefox).</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/"><img src="https://letsencrypt.org/images/blog/blog-2025-12-09-chart2.jpg" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(These graphs are snapshots as of the date of this post; a dynamically updated version is found <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/#percent-pageloads">on our stats page</a>.) Our biggest goal was to make a concrete, measurable security impact on the web by getting HTTPS connection prevalence to increase—and it’s worked. It took five years or so to get the global percentage from below 30% to around 80%, where it’s remained ever since. In the U.S. it has been close to 95% for a while now.</p>
<p>A good amount of the remaining unencrypted traffic probably comes from internal or private organizational sites (intranets), but other than that we don’t know much about it; this would be a great topic for Internet security researchers to look into.</p>
<p>We believe our present growth in certificate issuance volume is essentially coming from growth in the web as a whole. In other words, if we protect 20% more sites over some time period, it’s because the web itself grew by 20%.</p>
<h2 id="a-few-milestones">A few milestones</h2>
<p>We’ve <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/blog/">blogged about most of Let’s Encrypt’s most significant milestones</a> as they’ve happened, and I invite everyone in our community to look over those blog posts to see how far we’ve come. We’ve also <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/annual-reports/">published annual reports for the past seven years</a>, which offer elegant and concise summaries of our work.</p>
<p>As I personally think back on the past decade, just a few of the many events that come to mind include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2014/11/18/announcing-lets-encrypt">Telling the world about the project</a> in November 2014</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/09/14/our-first-cert">Our first certificate issuance</a> in September 2015</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/03/08/our-millionth-cert">Our one millionth certificate</a> in March 2016, then <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/06/28/hundred-million-certs">our 100 millionth certificate</a> in June 2017, and then <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/02/27/one-billion-certs">our billionth certificate</a> in 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Along the way, first issuing one million certificates in a single day (in September 2018), significantly contributed to by the SquareSpace and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2021/09/14/speed-at-scale-shopify">Shopify</a> Let’s Encrypt integrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Just at the end of September 2025, we issued more than ten million certificates in a day for the first time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also periodically rolled out new features such as <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2016/10/21/introducing-idn-support">internationalized domain name support</a> (2016), <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2017/07/06/wildcard-certificates-coming-jan-2018">wildcard support</a> (2018), and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/02/20/first-short-lived-cert-issued">short-lived</a> and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/07/01/issuing-our-first-ip-address-certificate">IP address</a> (2025) certificates. We’re always working on <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/upcoming-features/">more new features</a> for the future.</p>
<p>There are many technical milestones like <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2021/01/21/next-gen-database-servers">our database server upgrades</a> in 2021, where we found we needed a serious server infrastructure boost because of the tremendous volumes of data we were dealing with. Similarly, our original infrastructure was using Gigabit Ethernet internally, and, with the growth of our issuance volume and logging, we found that our Gigabit Ethernet network eventually became too slow to synchronize database instances! (Today we’re using 25-gig Ethernet.) More recently, we’ve <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/06/11/reflections-on-a-year-of-sunlight">experimented with architectural upgrades</a> to our ever-growing Certificate Transparency logs, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2025/08/14/rfc-6962-logs-eol">decided to go ahead with deploying those upgrades</a>—to help us not just keep up with, but get ahead of, our continuing growth.</p>
<p>These kinds of growing pains and successful responses to them are nice to remember because they point to the inexorable increase in demands on our infrastructure as we’ve become a more and more essential part of the Internet. I’m proud of our technical teams which have handled those increased demands capably and professionally.</p>
<p>I also recall the ongoing work involved in <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2018/08/06/trusted-by-all-major-root-programs">making sure our certificates would be as widely accepted as possible</a>, which has meant managing the original cross-signature from IdenTrust, and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/11/06/own-two-feet">subsequently creating and propagating our own root CA certificates</a>. This process has required PKI engineering, key ceremonies, root program interactions, documentation, and community support associated with certificate migrations. Most users never have reason to look behind the scenes at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">our chains of trust</a>, but our engineers update it as root and intermediate certificates have been replaced. We’ve engaged at the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/B Forum</a>, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a>, and in other venues with the browser root programs to help shape the web PKI as a technical leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2020/12/28/executive-director-letter">As I wrote in 2020</a>, our ideal of complete automation of the web PKI aims at a world where most site owners wouldn’t even need to think about certificates at all. We continue to get closer and closer to that world, which creates a risk that people will take us and our services for granted, as the details of certificate renewal occupy less of site operators’ mental energy. As I said at the time,</p>
<p>When your strategy as a nonprofit is to get out of the way, to offer services that people don’t need to think about, you’re running a real risk that you’ll eventually be taken for granted. There is a tension between wanting your work to be invisible and the need for recognition of its value. If people aren’t aware of how valuable our services are then we may not get the support we need to continue providing them.</p>
<p>I’m also grateful to our communications and fundraising staff who help make clear what we’re doing every day and how we’re making the Internet safer.</p>
<h2 id="recognition-of-let-s-encrypt">Recognition of Let’s Encrypt</h2>
<p>Our community continually recognizes our work in tangible ways by using our certificates—now by the tens of millions per day—and by <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsoring us</a>.</p>
<p>We were honored to be recognized with awards including the <a href="https://rwc.iacr.org/LevchinPrize/winners.html#certs">2022 Levchin Prize for Real-World Cryptography</a> and the <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/documents/2019-ISRG-Annual-Report-Desktop.pdf">2019 O’Reilly Open Source Award</a>. In October of this year some of the individuals who got Let’s Encrypt started were honored to receive the <a href="https://secdev.ieee.org/2025/awardees/">IEEE Cybersecurity Award for Practice</a>.</p>
<p>We documented the history, design, and goals of the project in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319535.3363192">an academic paper at the ACM CCS ‘19 conference</a>, which has subsequently been cited hundreds of times in academic research.</p>

<p>Ten years later, I’m still deeply grateful to the five initial sponsors that got Let’s Encrypt off the ground - Mozilla, EFF, Cisco, Akamai, and IdenTrust. When they committed significant resources to the project, it was just an ambitious idea. They saw the potential and believed in our team, and because of that we were able to build the service we operate today.</p>
<h2 id="identrust-a-critical-technical-partner">IdenTrust: A critical technical partner</h2>
<p>I’d like to particularly recognize <a href="https://www.identrust.com/">IdenTrust</a>, a PKI company that worked as a partner from the outset and enabled us to issue publicly-trusted certificates via a cross-signature from one of their roots. We would simply not have been able to launch our publicly-trusted certificate service without them. Back when I first told them that we were starting a new nonprofit certificate authority that would give away millions of certificates for free, there wasn’t any precedent for this arrangement, and there wasn’t necessarily much reason for IdenTrust to pay attention to our proposal. But the company really understood what we were trying to do and was willing to engage from the beginning. Ultimately, IdenTrust’s support made our original issuance model a reality.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m proud of what we have achieved with our staff, partners, and donors over the past ten years. I hope to be even more proud of the next ten years, as we use our strong footing to continue to pursue our mission to protect Internet users by lowering monetary, technological, and informational barriers to a more secure and privacy-respecting Internet.</p>
<p>Let’s Encrypt is a project of the nonprofit Internet Security Research Group, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. You can help us make the next ten years great as well by <a href="http://letsencrypt.org/donate">donating</a> or becoming a <a href="https://www.abetterinternet.org/sponsor/">sponsor</a>.</p>

						<p>I run a <a href="https://ldnug.org/">.NET user group here in London</a>, and we host a lot of talks from people who are relatively inexperienced presenters. Sometimes they’ve done presentations internally but never spoken before a public audience. Sometimes they’re developers who have been in theatre or played in bands; people with plenty of stage experience but who haven’t presented on technical topics before - and sometimes they’ve never done any kind of public presentations or performance at all. We aim to be a friendly, supportive crowd; public speaking can be daunting, and the first public outing of somebody’s first talk can be… let’s just say that the presenter sometimes learns a lot more than the audience, and leave it at that.</p>

<p>But it can also be a hugely rewarding experience, and as a seasoned tech presenter who’s been doing this for a while, aspiring speakers often ask me for advice on how to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>Before we get into the specifics, there are two things to bear in mind.</p>

<p>One: ask yourself why you want to do this. What does “the next level” mean for you? Are you looking to promote your consultancy, or your training courses, or your software products? Do you want to become a professional speaker and actually get paid to give talks? Are you doing it ‘cos you want to go places and meet people? Figure out what “success” looks like for you.</p>

<p>Two: be realistic about how much work is involved. It took me <em>seven years</em> to go from my first user group lightning talk, back 2008, to my first international conference. If you think you can hack together some code, write a talk about it, stick it on Sessionize and three months later you’re on your way to a major international event like NDC or Yow! or Devoxx… well, no. That’s not how this works. Strap in; it’s a long ride.</p>

<h3 id="year-1-get-good">Year 1: Get Good</h3>

<p>Write the talk. Write a talk nobody else could do; tell a story nobody else can tell. Figure out what your audience is going to learn, and why you’re the best person to teach them that. Then give it at local user group. It might go great. It might be a train wreck. Don’t worry. That’s one of the reasons user groups exist. Learn from the experience. Fix the demos. Fix the slides. If it was too short? Write some more. If it was too long? Cut something. Give it at another user group. Do it again. Do it again. Maybe write a second talk, shop that one around a couple of user groups too.</p>

<p>If you can’t find user groups, look on Meetup.com. Yes, it’s a horrible platform, but it works; search by topic, search by region, find groups that look like a good match for your content, and ask if they’re looking for speakers. They probably are.</p>

<h3 id="year-2-get-seen">Year 2: Get Seen</h3>

<p>After user groups and meetups come the community conferences. Typically small, one-day events, with a few tracks, and usually free (or very cheap) to attend. For me, these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer!/_Developer!/_Developer!#External\_links">the DDD events</a> _(that’s DDD as in Developers! Developers! Developers!, not to be confused with DDD as in Domain Driven Design), _a series of one-day free developer events around the UK, organised by volunteers, usually on a Saturday so people don’t have to take time off work. They bring in a good crowd, they’re a great way to get to know other presenters and people who are involved in tech events, and you’ll almost certainly meet a few people who are on the programme committees for the bigger conferences.</p>

<p>Events like this are your chance to get noticed. Turn up the day before, join the pre-conference dinner and drinks, introduce yourself. Yeah, it’s awkward when you don’t know anybody. There will be other people there who don’t know anybody and will appreciate you making the effort. Enjoy yourself, but don’t end up doing tequila shots in a karaoke bar at 3am. Not now. You’re there to give a talk, remember?</p>

<p>Go to the event. Spend the whole day there, do your talk, watch the other sessions. Communicate with the organisers. You don’t want their memorable impression of you to be a half-hour of panic and missed calls because one of their speakers has gone AWOL and nobody knows where they are.</p>

<p>Figure out how to keep in touch with the people you met. Join the Signal or WhatsApp group chat; if there isn’t one, create one. Follow them on LinkedIn, or Bluesky - be prepared to go where people are; don’t expect folks to join Mastodon just because that’s where you want to talk to them. That’s not how this works. If you really don’t want to play the social media game - and I can’t blame you - there’s always good old-fashioned email. A short email a week later saying “hey, thanks for having me” or “hey, I loved your session at DDD, let’s keep in touch” can pay off in a big way.</p>

<p>Finally, watch out for events that put video of their sessions online. Having a couple of YouTube links of you doing your thing in front of a live, appreciate audience can make all the difference when a programme committee is looking at a handful of talks and can only accept one of them.</p>

<h3 id="year-3-get-accepted">Year 3: Get Accepted</h3>

<p>You’ve got a couple of talks. You’ve delivered then enough times that you know they’re good *(and if they’re not good, make them good - or scrap them and write new ones)*. You know people. People know you. If somebody asks “hey, do we know anybody who could do a good session about $topic”, your name comes up. You’ve got a decent network of connections - group chats, LinkedIn, email addresses.</p>

<p>Now, find all the conferences in your field with an open Call for Papers (CfP), and get submitting. Dave Aronson over at codeasaur.us maintains a really useful <a href="https://www.codosaur.us/speaking/cfps-ending-soon">list of CfPs which are closing soon</a>. Check that regularly. Many events will cover your travel &amp; hotel costs, although with sponsorship budgets drying up right across the industry that’s not as prevalent as it was a few years ago. If not, maybe you can persuade your employer to pay your travel - “hey, boss, if I can get a free ticket to this amazing conference with all these industry experts, do you think the company will pay my air fare &amp; hotel?”</p>

<p>Lean on your network. What are people submitting to? Which events should you look out for? Which topics are getting a lot of traction (and which topics are not?)</p>

<p>Keep your content fresh. Write new talks. Keep giving them at user groups and community events.</p>

<p>Keep your submissions focused. 2-3 talks per event; don’t submit ten wildly different abstracts to the same conference in the hope one of them will get accepted. Every selection committee I’ve been on, if we see that, we assume the presenter hasn’t actually written *any* of them yet and is throwing everything they can think of into the mix and hoping one of them gets chosen. Not a great way to stand out. An open CFP at a big tech conference typically gets 20+ submissions for every available slot, which means if you reduce it to a numbers game, you’re submitting 20 talks for every one that gets accepted. Keep track of the numbers, and be objective about it.</p>

<h3 id="year-4-get-bored">Year 4: Get Bored.</h3>

<p>It’s great fun doing this for a while… but it’s also exhausting. Some people hit it hard for a few years, do all the things, go to all the places, make a lot of great friends and happy memories, and then wake up one day and decide that’s enough. Some people do a few talks, tick it off their bucket list and decide that’s enough for them. Some settle into a gentle routine of 3-4 events they’ll do every year. And yes, some of us end up treating our calendars like a game of Tetris, juggling flights and trains and hotels and meetups and conferences and spending half the year on the road and the other half writing talks and workshops and all the other things it’s hard to do when you’re at the airport.</p>

<p>That’s why you gotta figure out ahead of time what “success” looks like. If you’re doing it for fun, remember to have fun - and if you find you’re not enjoying it any more? Stop. If you’re doing it as promotion or marketing? Track your leads. Make sure it’s actually generating the attention and the revenue it’s supposed to. If you’re doing it for money, be mercenary: no pay, no play. Not every event is the same, of course. In a given year I’ll have some events that are fun, some that are lucrative, some that are running alongside workshops or training engagements. Just make sure you know which is which.</p>

<p>Finally: respect your audience. Whether you’re talking to five people at a meetup, fifty at a community event, or five thousand at a huge international conference: those people are the reason you get to do this. They have given up their time - and often a substantial amount of money - to hear what you have to say. They deserve your best shot, every time. If you find you’re bored, fed up, tired, running talks on autopilot or making mistakes because you just don’t care? It’s time to try something else - and remember, there’s a thousand aspiring speakers out there who would dearly love to take that spot instead of you.</p>

<p>Now get out there. Work hard, have fun, teach us awesome things, and if you ever want me to look over an abstract or a slide deck, drop me a line - <a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8aeef3e6ebe4caeef3e6ebe4e8efebfefee3efa4e4effe"><span data-cfemail="c8acb1a4a9a688acb1a4a9a6aaada9bcbca1ade6a6adbc">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>. I’d be happy to help.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-1883798277085402615" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>Early microprocessors were very slow when operating with floating-point numbers.
But in 1980, Intel introduced the 8087 floating-point coprocessor, performing
floating-point operations up
to 100 times faster.
This was a huge benefit for IBM PC
applications such as AutoCAD, spreadsheets, and flight simulators.
The 8087 was so effective that today's computers still use a floating-point system based on the 8087.<span id="fnref:ieee-754"><a href="#fn:ieee-754">1</a></span></p>
<!--
It's hard to compute floating-point operations both quickly and accurately.
Problems can arise from overflow, rounding, transcendental operations, and numerous edge cases.
Prior to the 8087, each manufacturer had their own incompatible ad hoc implementation of floating point.
Intel, however, enlisted numerical analysis expert [William Kahan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kahan) to design accurate floating point
based on rigorous principles.
    The 8087 has its problems, but it was a large improvement on earlier floating-point systems.
    The designers of the 8087 commented on the guidance offered by Professor Kahan: "We did not do as well as he wanted, but we did better than he expected."
-- The 8087 Primer, page viii
-->

<p>The 8087 was an extremely complex chip for its time, containing somewhere between
40,000 and 75,000 transistors, depending on the source.<span id="fnref:count"><a href="#fn:count">2</a></span>
To explore how the 8087 works, I opened up a chip and took numerous photos of the silicon die with a microscope.
Around the edges of the die, you can see the hair-thin bond wires that connect the chip to its 40 external pins.
The complex patterns on the die are formed by its metal wiring, as well as the polysilicon and silicon underneath.
The bottom half of the chip is the "datapath", the circuitry that performs calculations on 80-bit floating point values. 
At the left of the datapath, a <a href="https://www.righto.com/2020/05/extracting-rom-constants-from-8087-math.html">constant ROM</a> holds important constants such as π.
At the right are the eight registers that form the stack, along with the stack control circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/8087-die-labeled.jpg"><img alt="Die of the Intel 8087 floating point unit chip, with main functional blocks labeled. The die is 5mm×6mm.  Click for a larger image." height="587" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/8087-die-labeled-w450.jpg" title="Die of the Intel 8087 floating point unit chip, with main functional blocks labeled. The die is 5mm×6mm.  Click for a larger image." width="450"></a></p><p>Die of the Intel 8087 floating point unit chip, with main functional blocks labeled. The die is 5mm×6mm.  Click for a larger image.</p>
<p>The chip's instructions are defined by the large <a href="https://www.righto.com/2018/09/two-bits-per-transistor-high-density.html">microcode ROM</a> in the middle.
This ROM is very unusual; it is semi-analog, storing two bits per transistor by using four transistor sizes.
To execute a floating-point instruction, the 8087 decodes the instruction and the microcode engine starts executing
the appropriate micro-instructions from the microcode ROM.
The decode circuitry to the right of the ROM generates the appropriate control signals from each micro-instruction.
The bus registers and control circuitry handle interactions with the main 8086 processor and the rest of the system.
Finally, the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2018/08/inside-die-of-intels-8087-coprocessor.html">bias generator</a>
uses a charge pump to create a negative voltage to bias the chip's substrate, the underlying silicon.</p>
<p>The stack registers and control circuitry (in red above) are the subject of this blog post. 
Unlike most processors, the 8087 organizes its registers in a stack, with instructions operating on the top of the stack.
For instance, the square root instruction replaces the value on the top of the stack with its square root.
You can also access a register relative to the top of the stack, for instance, adding the top value to the value two positions down from the top.
The stack-based architecture was intended to improve the instruction set, simplify compiler design, and make function
calls more efficient, although it didn't work as well as hoped.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/stack-diagram.jpg"><img alt="The stack on the 8087. From The 8087 Primer, page 60." height="204" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/stack-diagram-w350.jpg" title="The stack on the 8087. From The 8087 Primer, page 60." width="350"></a></p><p>The stack on the 8087. From <i>The 8087 Primer</i>, page 60.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows how the stack operates. The stack consists of eight registers, with the Stack Top
(ST) indicating the current top of the stack.
To push a floating-point value onto the stack, the Stack Top is decremented and then the value is stored in the new top register.
A pop is performed by copying the value from the stack top and then incrementing the Stack Top.
In comparison, most processors specify registers directly, so register 2 is always the same register.</p>
<h2>The registers</h2>
<p>The stack registers occupy a substantial area on the die of the 8087 because floating-point numbers take many bits.
A floating-point number consists of a fractional part (sometimes called the mantissa or significand), along with
the exponent part; the exponent allows floating-point numbers to cover a range from extremely small to extremely
large.
In the 8087, floating-point numbers are 80 bits: 64 bits of significand, 15 bits of exponent, and a sign bit.
An 80-bit register was very large in the era of 8-bit or 16-bit computers; the eight registers in the 8087
would be equivalent to 40 registers in the 8086 processor.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/registers.jpg"><img alt="The registers in the 8087 form an 8×80 grid of cells. The close-up shows an 8×8 block. I removed the metal layer with acid to reveal the underlying silicon circuitry." height="684" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/registers-w500.jpg" title="The registers in the 8087 form an 8×80 grid of cells. The close-up shows an 8×8 block. I removed the metal layer with acid to reveal the underlying silicon circuitry." width="500"></a></p><p>The registers in the 8087 form an 8×80 grid of cells. The close-up shows an 8×8 block. I removed the metal layer with acid to reveal the underlying silicon circuitry.</p>
<p>The registers store each bit in a static RAM cell. Each cell has two inverters connected in a loop.
This circuit forms a stable feedback loop, with one inverter on and one inverter off.
Depending on which inverter is on, the circuit stores a 0 or a 1.
To write a new value into the circuit, one of the lines is pulled low, flipping the loop into the desired state.
The trick is that each inverter uses a very weak transistor to pull the output high, so its output is easily overpowered
to change the state.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/inverter-loop.png"><img alt="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." height="121" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/inverter-loop-w250.png" title="Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1." width="250"></a></p><p>Two inverters in a loop can store a 0 or a 1.</p>
<p>These inverter pairs are arranged in an 8 × 80 grid that implements eight words of 80 bits. Each of the 80 rows has two <em>bitlines</em> that provide access to a bit.
The bitlines provide both read and write access to a bit; the pair of bitlines allows either inverter to be pulled low to store the desired bit value.
Eight vertical <em>wordlines</em> enable access to one word, one column of 80 bits.
Each wordline turns on 160 pass transistors, connecting the bitlines to the inverters in the selected column.
Thus, when a wordline is enabled, the bitlines can be used to read or write that word.</p>
<p>Although the chip looks two-dimensional, it actually consists of multiple layers.
The bottom layer is silicon.
The pinkish regions below are where the silicon has been "doped" to change its electrical properties, making it an active
part of the circuit.
The doped silicon forms a grid of horizontal and vertical wiring, with larger doped regions in the middle.
On top of the silicon, polysilicon wiring provides two functions. First, it provides a layer of wiring to connect the circuit.
But more importantly, when polysilicon crosses doped silicon, it forms a transistor. The polysilicon provides the gate, turning the transistor on and off.
In this photo, the polysilicon is barely visible, so I've highlighted part of it in red.
Finally, horizontal metal wires provide a third layer of interconnecting wiring.
Normally, the metal hides the underlying circuitry, so I removed the metal with acid for this photo.
I've drawn blue lines to represent the metal layer.
Contacts provide connections between the various layers.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/memory-cell-layers.jpg"><img alt="A close-up of a storage cell in the registers. The metal layer and most of the polysilicon have been removed to show the underlying silicon." height="336" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/memory-cell-layers-w500.jpg" title="A close-up of a storage cell in the registers. The metal layer and most of the polysilicon have been removed to show the underlying silicon." width="500"></a></p><p>A close-up of a storage cell in the registers. The metal layer and most of the polysilicon have been removed to show the underlying silicon.</p>
<p>The layers combine to form the inverters and selection transistors of a memory cell, indicated with the dotted line below.
There are six transistors (yellow), where polysilicon crosses doped silicon. Each inverter has a transistor that
pulls the output low and a weak transistor to pull the output high.
When the word line (vertical polysilicon) is active, it connects the selected inverters to the bit lines (horizontal metal) through the two selection
transistors.
This allows the bit to be read or written.</p>

<p>Each register has two tag bits associated with it, an unusual form of metadata to indicate
if the register is empty, contains zero, contains a valid value, or
contains a special value such as infinity.
The tag bits are used to optimize performance internally and are mostly irrelevant to the programmer.
As well as being accessed with a register, the tag bits can be accessed in parallel as a 16-bit "Tag Word".
This allows the tags to be saved or loaded as part of the 8087's state, for instance,
during interrupt handling.</p>
<h2>The decoder</h2>
<p>The decoder circuit, wedged into the middle of the register file, selects one of the registers.
A register is specified internally with a 3-bit value. The decoder circuit energizes one of the eight register select
lines based on this value.</p>
<p>The decoder circuitry is straightforward: it has eight 3-input NOR gates to match one of the eight bit patterns.
The select line is then powered through a high-current driver that uses large transistors.
(In the photo below, you can compare the large serpentine driver transistors to the small transistors in a bit cell.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/decoder.jpg"><img alt="The decoder circuitry has eight similar blocks to drive the eight select lines." height="273" src="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/decoder-w600.jpg" title="The decoder circuitry has eight similar blocks to drive the eight select lines." width="600"></a></p><p>The decoder circuitry has eight similar blocks to drive the eight select lines.</p>
<p>The decoder has an interesting electrical optimization.
As shown earlier, the register select lines are eight polysilicon lines running vertically, the length of the
register file. 
Unfortunately, polysilicon has fairly high resistance, better than silicon but much worse than metal.
The problem is that the resistance of a long polysilicon line will slow down the system.
That is, the capacitance of transistor gates in combination with high resistance causes an RC (resistive-capacitive) delay in the signal.</p>
<p>The solution is that the register select lines also run in the metal layer, a second set of lines immediately to the
right of the register file.
These lines branch off from the register file about 1/3 of the way down, run to the bottom, and then connect back
to the polysilicon select lines at the bottom.
This reduces the maximum resistance through a select line, increasing the speed.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/select.jpg"><img alt="A diagram showing how 8 metal lines run parallel to the main select lines.

The register file is much taller than shown; the middle has been removed to make the diagram fit.</p>
<h2>The stack control circuitry</h2>
<p>A stack needs more control circuitry than a regular register file, since the circuitry must keep track of the
position of the top of the stack.<span id="fnref:status-word"><a href="#fn:status-word">3</a></span>
The control circuitry increments and decrements the top of stack (TOS) pointer as values are pushed or popped
(purple).<span id="fnref:patents"><a href="#fn:patents">4</a></span>
Moreover, an 8087 instruction can access a register based on its offset, for instance the third register
from the top.
To support this, the control circuitry can temporarily add an offset to the top of stack position (green).
A multiplexer (red) selects either the top of stack or the adder output, and feeds it to the decoder (blue),
which selects one of the eight stack registers in the register file (yellow), as described earlier.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/8087-stack/patent-diagram.jpg"><img alt="The register stack in the 8087. Adapted from Patent USRE33629E. I don't know what the GRX field is.

<!--
    The stack has a key role in most 8087 instructions.
    The `FLD` (Load Real) and `FSTP` (Store Real and Pop) instructions and their variants push or pop a stack value respectively.
    The `FST` (Store Real) instruction reads a stack value without popping it.
    Many instructions affect the top stack register and a specified position in the stack, such as
    `FXCH` (Exchange Registers).
    The standard arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) can use the stack in multiple ways.
    The "classical" form is to perform the operation on the top two stack locations and replace the top stack value
    with the result.
    Alternatively, the second argument can come from an arbitrary stack location, with the result going into either
    the top of stack or the second location.
    The top value can also be popped, shrinking the stack.
    Finally, one argument can come from memory.
    The less common arithmetic operations (e.g. square root, partial remainder) operate on the top of stack or the
    two top elements as appropriate.
    The point of this is that the 8087 uses the stack in a wide variety of ways, so the circuitry reflects this
    complexity.

    The stack pointer can be directly manipulated with the
    `FINCSTP` and `FDECSTP` instructions (increment or decrement stack pointer).
    The stack pointer is part of the Status Word, and can be stored to memory with the `FSTSW` (Store Status Word)
    instruction. It can also be stored to memory or loaded from memory as part of the `FLDENV` and `FSTENV`
    (Load Environment or Store Environment) instructions or the `FSAVE` and `FRSTOR` (Save State and Restore State)
    instructions.
-->

<p>The physical implementation of the stack circuitry is shown below.
The logic at the top selects the stack operation based on the 16-bit micro-instruction.<span id="fnref:microcode"><a href="#fn:microcode">5</a></span>
Below that are the three latches that hold the top of stack value.
(The large white squares look important, but they are simply "jumpers" from the ground line to the circuitry, passing
under metal wires.)</p>

<p>The three-bit adder is at the bottom, along with the multiplexer.
You might expect the adder to use a simple "full adder" circuit. Instead, it is
a faster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-lookahead_adder">carry-lookahead</a> adder.
I won't go into details here, but the summary is that at each bit position, an AND gate produces a Carry Generate
signal while an XOR gate produces a Carry Propagate signal.
Logic gates combine these signals to produce the output bits in parallel, avoiding the slowdown of the carry rippling
through the bits.</p>
<p>The incrementer/decrementer uses a completely different approach.
Each of the three bits uses a toggle flip-flop.
A few logic gates determine if each bit should be toggled or should keep its previous value.
For instance, when incrementing, the top bit is toggled if the lower bits are 11 (e.g. incrementing from 011 to 100).
For decrementing, the top bit is toggled if the lower bits are 00 (e.g. 100 to 011).
Simpler logic determines if the middle bit should be toggled.
The bottom bit is easier, toggling every time whether incrementing or decrementing.</p>
<p>The schematic below shows the circuitry for one bit of the stack.
Each bit is implemented with a moderately complicated flip-flop that can be cleared, loaded with
a value, or toggled, based on control signals from the microcode.
The flip-flop is constructed from two set-reset (SR) latches. Note that the flip-flop outputs are crossed when fed back
to the input, providing the inversion for the toggle action.
At the right, the multiplexer selects either the register value or the sum from the adder (not shown), generating the signals
to the decoder.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks of the stack approach</h2>
<p>According to the designers of the 8087,<span id="fnref:references"><a href="#fn:references">7</a></span>
the main motivation for using a stack rather than a flat register set was that instructions didn't have enough bits to address multiple register operands.
In addition, a stack has "advantages over general registers for expression parsing and nested function calls."
That is, a stack works well for a mathematical expression since sub-expressions can be evaluated on the top
of the stack.
And for function calls, you avoid the cost of saving registers to memory, since the subroutine can use the stack without disturbing the values underneath.
At least that was the idea.</p>
<!--
The designers considered a "classical" stack architecture, which has only two or three cells in hardware and accesses
the rest of the stack from memory. However, this approach was rejected because the excessive traffic between the memory and stack would have been a bottleneck.
-->

<p>The main problem is "stack overflow".
The 8087's stack has eight entries, so if you push a ninth value onto the stack, the stack will overflow.
Specifically, the top-of-stack pointer will wrap around, obliterating the bottom value on the stack.
The 8087 is designed to detect a stack overflow using the register tags:
pushing a value to a non-empty register triggers an invalid operation exception.<span id="fnref:underflow"><a href="#fn:underflow">6</a></span></p>
<p>The designers expected that stack overflow would be rare and could be handled by the operating system (or library code).
After detecting a stack overflow, the software should dump the existing stack to memory to
provide the illusion of an infinite stack.
Unfortunately, bad design decisions made it difficult "both technically and commercially" to handle stack overflow.</p>
<p>One of the 8087's designers (Kahan) attributes the 8087's stack problems to the time difference between California,
where the designers lived, and Israel, where the 8087 was implemented.
Due to a lack of communication, each team thought the other was implementing the overflow software.
It wasn't until the
8087 was in production that they realized that "it might not be possible to handle 8087 stack underflow/overflow in a reasonable way. It's not impossible, just impossible to do it in a reasonable way."</p>
<p>As a result, the stack was largely a problem rather than a solution.
Most 8087 software saved the full stack to memory before performing
a function call, creating more memory traffic.
Moreover, compilers turned out to work better with regular registers than a stack,
so compiler writers awkwardly used the stack to emulate regular registers.
The <code>GCC</code> compiler <a href="https://langdev.stackexchange.com/a/2408">reportedly</a> needs 3000 lines of extra code to support the x87 stack.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Intel introduced a new floating-point system called <a href="https://www.cs.uaf.edu/2012/fall/cs301/lecture/11_02_other_float.html">SSE</a>, followed by AVX in 2011.
These systems use regular (non-stack) registers and provide parallel operations for higher performance,
making the 8087's stack instructions largely obsolete.</p>
<h2>The success of the 8087</h2>
<p>At the start, Intel was unenthusiastic about producing the 8087, viewing it as unlikely to be a success.
John Palmar, a principal architect of the chip, had little success convincing
skeptical Intel management that the market for the 8087 was enormous.
Eventually,
he said, "I'll tell you what. I'll relinquish my salary, provided you'll write down your number of how many you expect to sell, then give me a dollar for every one you sell beyond that."<span id="fnref2:references"><a href="#fn:references">7</a></span>
Intel didn't agree to the deal—which would have made a fortune for Palmer—but they reluctantly agreed to produce the chip.</p>
<p>Intel's Santa Clara engineers shunned the 8087, considering it unlikely to work:
the 8087 would be two to three times more complex than the 8086,
with a die so large that a wafer might not have a single working die.
Instead, Rafi Nave, at Intel's Israel site, took on the risky project: “Listen, everybody knows it's not going to work, so if it won't work, I would just fulfill their expectations or their assessment.
If, by chance, it works, okay, then we'll gain tremendous respect and tremendous breakthrough on our abilities.”</p>
<p>A small team of seven engineers developed the 8087 in Israel.
They designed the chip on Mylar sheets: a millimeter on Mylar represented a micron on the physical chip.
The drawings were then digitized on a Calma system by clicking on each polygon to create the layout.
When the chip was moved into production,
the yield was very low but better than feared: two working dies per four-inch wafer.</p>
<p>The 8087 ended up being a large success, said to have been Intel's most profitable product line at times.
The success of the 8087 (along with the 8088) cemented the reputation of Intel Israel, which eventually became Israel's largest tech employer.
The benefits of floating-point hardware proved to be so great that Intel integrated the floating-point unit into later processors
starting with the 80486 (1989).
Nowadays, most modern computers, from cellphones to mainframes, provide floating point based on the
8087,
so I consider the 8087 one of the most influential chips ever created.</p>

Interest rates are high, which has stifled construction and pushed up the cost of mortgages. As a result, more Americans are renting, and roughly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/arh-2024-cost-burden-share">half of those households</a> are spending more than a third of their income on shelter.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This crisis has many causes: restrictive zoning codes, arcane permitting processes, excessive <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/local-government-community-input-housing-public-transportation/629625/">community input</a>, declining construction productivity, expensive labor, and expensive lumber. And, some say, the aggressive entry of private equity into the housing market. Institutional investors have bought up hundreds of thousands of American homes since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, outbidding families and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/housing-crisis-hedge-funds-private-equity-scapegoat/672839/">pushing up rents</a>—a trend lamented by everyone from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthout.org/articles/ocasio-cortez-digs-into-private-equity-for-buying-houses-and-jacking-up-rents/">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/14/harris-vance-housing-crisis-00183484">J.

Who’s going to win in a bidding war for a three-bedroom in a suburb of Cincinnati: a single-income family with a scrabbled-together 10 percent down payment or a Wall Street LLC offering cash? Still, housing economists and policy analysts have argued that institutional investors have played at most a bit part. Supply constraints began cropping up on the coasts a generation ago, if not earlier, whereas Wall Street started buying up significant numbers of homes only after the Great Recession and especially after the pandemic. Moreover, even if big investors are purchasing thousands of homes, they don’t own significant numbers of homes compared with small-scale landlords and individuals.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/">Rogé Karma: The secretive industry devouring the U.S. economy</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Yet in some markets, the balance has shifted.

In some communities, they control more than 20 percent of properties.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">I figured that big investors might be picking up vacation rentals in Colorado and expensive apartment buildings in the Bay Area and the Acela Corridor. They are, the report’s authors told me. But these investors are pouring the most money into “buy low, rent high” neighborhoods: communities, many of them in the South and the Rust Belt, where large shares of families can’t afford a mortgage.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“They’re pulling all the starter homes off of the market in low-income, high-minority-density neighborhoods,” George McCarthy, the president of the Lincoln Institute, told me—a trend that is intensifying the country’s yawning racial wealth and homeownership gaps. In Cleveland, corporations own 17.5 percent of residential real-estate parcels. In the city’s East Side, which contains many predominantly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://visual.clevelandhistory.org/black-population-suburbs/">Black neighborhoods</a>, just one in five homebuyers in 2021 took out a mortgage. The rest—many investors, presumably—paid in cash or took out a loan from a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://signalcleveland.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cuyahoga-Home-Mortgage-Lending-3-20-23.pdf">non-traditional financier</a>.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/housing-crisis-hedge-funds-private-equity-scapegoat/672839/">Jerusalem Demsas: Meet the latest housing-crisis scapegoat</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Baltimore’s majority-Black McElderry Park and Ellwood Park/Monument neighborhoods, owner-occupants made just 13 percent of purchases in 2022. In a majority-white neighborhood not far away, owner-occupants bought more than 80 percent of homes that same year, and out-of-state corporations owned less than 1 percent of residential parcels.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The report made me see the country’s real-estate crisis in a different light. Private-equity firms and other deep-pocketed investors aren’t why Seattle and Boston are unaffordable. Those cities have had shortage-driven housing crises that have intensified over decades. The firms aren’t why many towns in the Mountain West have seen jumps in home values and a corresponding increase in homelessness, displacement, and eviction. In those communities, white-collar emigrants from big cities have arrived and outbid locals. But investor money is distorting the housing market in communities with low wages and decent-enough housing supply, pushing thousands of Black and Latino families off the property ladder. Tens of thousands of workers who would like to invest in a home are instead stuck paying rent, and putting up with the associated uncertainty.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">While not all corporate landlords are bad landlords, <em>some </em>are bad landlords. Corporations are more likely to threaten to evict and to actually evict <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/real-problem-corporate-landlords/619244/">their tenants</a>. They are also prone to skimping on maintenance and upkeep. “At the neighborhood level, when more than half of the properties are owned by outside investors—when you’ve now flipped that neighborhood from being primarily homeowner driven to investor driven—that matters, because homeowners behave very differently, politically and otherwise,” McCarthy said. An out-of-state investment firm might be less likely than a longtime resident or a local property manager to plant shade trees and demand safe sidewalks, for instance.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In response to the rising corporate ownership of homes, a variety of politicians have pushed for policy fixes. In New York, Governor Kathy Hochul has proposed legislation barring firms from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/fighting-new-yorkers-governor-hochul-highlights-2025-state-state-proposal-disincentivize">bidding on single-family or two-family homes</a> for the first 75 days they are on the market. Washington State is contemplating capping the number of units that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mynorthwest.com/mynorthwest-politics/washington-bill-4/4040703">corporations can own</a>. Other legislators have suggested revoking <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2224">tax benefits</a> from large-scale owners.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">McCarthy said that caps probably would not work well: Corporations might simply set up multiple entities to get around the rules and keep purchasing properties, for instance. “It’s just not going to fly,” he said. But he supports treating firms that own more than 10 properties in a given jurisdiction as commercial owners rather than residential owners, subjecting them to higher property-tax rates and higher taxes on their capital gains.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If nothing is done, what’s happening to majority-Black communities in Ohio and Virginia and Georgia and Michigan might start happening in communities around the country. Private equity might not be causing the housing crisis, but corporate owners could end up making it a lot worse for everyone.</p></section></div>]]></description>

    <p><strong>Stephen Ramsay</strong></p>
    <p>Or hell, why not do it in <em>x86 assembly?</em></p>
    <p>Let’s get a few things out of the way before I go any
    further with this seemingly impertinent thought, because it’s
    nowhere near as snarky as it sounds.</p>
    <p>First, I don’t particularly <em>like</em> vibe coding. I
    love programming, and I have loved it since I made my first
    tentative steps with it sometime back in the mid-to-late 90s. I
    love programming so much, it always feels like I’m having too
    much fun for it to count as real work. I’ve done it
    professionally, but I also do it as a hobby. Someone apparently
    once said, “Do what you love and you’ll never work a day in
    your life.” That’s how I feel about writing code. I’ve also
    been teaching the subject for twenty-five years, and I can
    honestly say I am as excited about the first day of the
    semester now as I was when I first started. I realize it’s a
    bit precious to say so, but I’ll say it anyway: Turning
    non-programmers into programmers is my life’s work. It is the
    thing of which I am most proud as a college professor.</p>
    <p>Vibe coding makes me feel <em>dirty</em> in ways that I
    struggle to articulate precisely. It’s not just that it feels
    like “cheating” (though it does). I also think it takes a lot
    of the fun out of the whole thing. I sometimes tell people
    (like the aforementioned students) that programming is like
    doing the best crossword puzzle in the world, except that when
    you solve it, it actually dances and sings. Vibe coding robs me
    of that moment, because I don’t feel like <em>I</em> really did
    it at all. And even though to be a programmer is to live with a
    more-or-less permanent set of aporias (you don’t
    <em>really</em> understand what the compiler is doing,
    really—and even if you do, you probably don’t <em>really</em>
    understand how the virtual memory subsystem works, really),
    it’s satisfying to understand every inch of my code and
    frustrating—all the way to the borderlands of active
    anxiety—not quite understanding what Claude just wrote.</p>
    <p>But this leads me to my second point, which I must make as
    clearly and forcefully as I can. Vibe coding actually works. It
    creates robust, complex systems that work. You can tell
    yourself (as I did) that it can’t possibly do that, but you are
    wrong. You can then tell yourself (as I did) that it’s good as
    a kind of alternative search engine for coding problems, but
    not much else. You are also wrong about that. Because when you
    start giving it little programming problems that you can’t be
    arsed to work out yourself (as I did), you discover (as I did)
    that it’s awfully good at those. And then one day you muse out
    loud (as I did) to an AI model something like, “I have an idea
    for a program…” And you are astounded. If you aren’t astounded,
    you either haven’t actually done it or you are at some stage of
    grief prior to acceptance. Perfect? Hardly. But then neither
    are human coders. The future? I think the questions answers
    itself.</p>
    <p>But to get to my impertinent question…</p>
    <p>Early on in my love affair with programming, I read <a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf"><em>Structure and
    Interpretation of Computer Programs,</em></a> which I now
    consider one of the great pedagogical masterpieces of the
    twentieth century. I learned a great deal about programming
    from that book, but among the most memorable lessons was one
    that appears in the second paragraph of the original preface.
    There, Hal Abelson and Gerald Sussman make a point that hits
    with the force of the obvious, and yet is very often
    forgotten:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>[W]e want to establish the idea that a computer language
      is not just a way of getting a computer to perform operations
      but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing
      ideas about methodology. Thus, programs must be written for
      people to read, and only incidentally for machines to
      execute.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I’ve been repeating some version of this to my students ever
    since. Computers, I remind them, do not need the code to be
    “readable” or “ergonomic” for humans; they only need it to be
    readable and ergonomic for a computer, which is a considerably
    lower bar.</p>
    <p>Every programming language—<em>including assembly
    language</em>—was and is intended for the convenience of humans
    who need to read it and write it. If a language is innovative,
    it is usually not because it has <em>allowed</em> for automatic
    memory management, or concurrency, or safety, or robust error
    checking, but because it has made it easier for humans to
    express and reason about these matters. When we extol the
    virtues of this or that language—Rust’s safety guarantees,
    C++’s “no-cost abstractions,” or Go’s approach to
    concurrency—we are not talking about an affordance that the
    computer has gained, but about an affordance that <em>we</em>
    have gained as programmers of said computer. From our
    standpoint as programmers, object-oriented languages offer
    certain ways to organize our code—and, I think Abelson and
    Sussman would say, our thinking—that are potentially conducive
    to the noble treasures of maintainability, extensibility, error
    checking, and any number of other condign matters. From the
    standpoint of the computer, this little OO kink of ours seems
    mostly to indicate a strange affinity for heap memory.
    “Whatevs!” (says the computer). And pick your poison here,
    folks: functional programming, algebraic data types, dependent
    types, homoiconicity, immutable data structures, brace styles…
    We can debate the utility of these things, but we must
    understand that we are primarily talking about <em>human</em>
    problems. The set of “machine problems” to which these matters
    correspond is considerably smaller.</p>
    <p>So my question is this: Why vibe code with a language that
    has <em>human</em> convenience and ergonomics in view? Or to
    put that another way: Wouldn’t a language designed <em>for vibe
    coding</em> naturally dispense with much of what is convenient
    and ergonomic <em>for humans</em> in favor of what is
    convenient and ergonomic for machines? Why not have it just
    write C? Or hell, why not x86 assembly?</p>
    <p>Now, at this point, you will want to say that the need for
    human understanding isn’t erased entirely thereby. Some version
    of this argument has merit, but I would remind you that if you
    are really vibe coding for real you already don’t understand a
    great deal of what it is producing. But if you look carefully,
    you will notice that it doesn’t struggle with undefined
    behavior in C. Or with making sure that all memory is properly
    freed. Or with off-by-one errors. It sometimes struggles to
    understand what it is that you actually want, but it rarely
    struggles with the actual execution of the code. It’s better
    than you are at keeping track of those things in the same way
    that a compiler is better at optimizing code than you are.
    Perfect? No.&nbsp;But as I said before…</p>
    <p>Is C the ideal language for vibe coding? I think I could
    mount an argument for why it is not, but surely Rust is even
    less ideal. To say nothing of Haskell, or OCaml, or even
    Python. All of these languages, after all, are for people to
    read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. They are
    practically adorable in their concern for problems that AI
    models do not have.</p>
    <p>I suppose what I’m getting at, here, is that <em>if</em>
    vibe coding is the future of software development (and it is),
    then why bother with languages that were designed for people
    who are not vibe coding? Shouldn’t there be such a thing as a
    “vibe-oriented programming language?” VOP. You read it here
    first.</p>
    <p>One possibility is that such a language truly would be
    executable pseudocode beyond even the most extravagant fever
    dreams of the most earnest Pythonistas; it shows you what it’s
    doing in truly pseudo code, but all the while it’s writing
    assembly. Or perhaps it’s something like the apotheosis of
    literate programming. You write a literary document “expressing
    ideas about methodology,” and the AI produces machine code (and
    a kind of literary critical practice evolves around this
    activity, eventually ordering itself into structuralist and
    post-structuralist camps. But I’m getting ahead of myself).
    Perhaps your job as a programmer is mostly running tests that
    verify this machine code (tests which have also been produced
    by AI). Or maybe a VOPL is really a certain kind of language
    that comes closer to natural language than any existing
    programming language, but which has a certain (easily learned)
    set of idioms and expressions that guide the AI more reliably
    and more quickly toward particular solutions. It doesn’t have
    goroutines. It has a “concurrency slang.”</p>
    <p>Now obviously, the reason a large language model focused on
    coding is good at Javascript and C++ is precisely because it
    has been trained on billions of lines of code in those
    languages along with countless forum posts, StackOverflow
    debates, and so on. Bootstrapping a VOPL presents a certain
    kind of difficulty, but then one also suspects that LLMs are
    <em>already</em> being trained in some future version of this
    language, because so many programmers are already groping their
    way toward a system like this by virtue of the fact that so
    many of them are already vibe coding production-level
    systems.</p>
    <p>I don’t know how I feel about all of this (see my first and
    second points above). It saddens me to think of “coding by
    hand” becoming a kind of quaint Montessori-school stage in the
    education of a vibe coder—something like the contour drawings
    we demand from future photoshopers or the balanced equations we
    insist serve as a rite of passage for people who will never be
    without a calculator to the end of their days.</p>
    <p>At the same time, there is something exciting about the
    birth of a computational paradigm. It wasn’t that long ago, in
    the grand scheme of things, that someone realized that rewiring
    the entire machine every time you wanted to do a calculation
    (think ENIAC, circa 1945) was a rather suboptimal way to do
    things. And it is worth recalling that people
    <em>complained</em> when the stored-program computer rolled
    around (think EDVAC, circa 1951). Why? Well, the answer should
    be obvious. It was less reliable. It was slower. It removed the
    operator from the loop. It threatened specialized labor. It was
    conceptually impure. I’m not kidding about any of this. No less
    an authority than Grace Hopper had to argue against the quite
    popular idea that there was no way anyone could ever trust a
    machine to write instructions for another machine.</p>
    <p>Same vibe, as the kids say.</p>

                                    I’ve been making devlogs since the very start of this portfolio and you can find them on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@BrunoSimon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Youtube channel</a>.
                                    <br>Even though the portfolio is out, I’m still working on the last videos so that the series is complete.

<div><p>To me, the valuable comments are the ones that share the writer's expertise and experiences (as opposed to opinions and hypothesizing) or the ones that ask interesting questions.

<div><p>I guess... That is the point in my opinion.</p><p>If you just say, "here is what llm said" if that turns out to be nonsense you can say something like, "I was just passing along the llm response, not my own opinion"</p><p>But if you take the llm response and present it as your own, at least there is slightly more ownership over the opinion.</p><p>This is kind of splitting hairs but hopefully it makes people actually read the response themselves before posting it.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46206767"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46206767" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46206767&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46206457"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Maybe I remember the Grok ones more clearly but it felt like “I asked Grok” was more prevalent than the others.</p><p>I feel like the HN guidelines could take inspiration from how Oxide uses LLMs. (<a href="https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576" rel="nofollow">https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576</a>). Specifically the part where using LLMs to write comments violates the implicit social contract that the writer should put more care and effort and time into it than the reader. The reader reads it because they assume this is something a person has put more time into than they need to. LLMs break that social contract.</p><p>Of course, if it’s banned maybe people just stop admitting it.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46206783"><td></td></tr><tr id="46206702"><td></td></tr><tr id="46206837"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46206837" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46206837&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46206457"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I find such replies to be worthless wastes of space on par with "let me google that for you" replies. If I want to know what genAI has to say about something, I can just ask it myself.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>By: Blake Scholl, Founder &amp; CEO, Boom Supersonic</p>



<hr>







<div>
<p>It started, as many things do these days, by scrolling on X.</p>



<p>I was reading post after post about the power crisis hitting AI data centers—GPU racks sitting idle, waiting not on chips, but on electricity. I texted with Sam Altman—who confirmed power was indeed a major constraint. I pinged our engineering team—and found that they already had the outline of a plan to build a power turbine based on our Symphony supersonic engine.</p>



<p>After a few conversations, it became clear: AI didn’t just need more turbines—it needed a new and fundamentally better turbine. Symphony was the perfect new engine to accelerate AI in America. About three months later, we had a signed deal for 1.21 gigawatts and had started manufacturing the first turbine.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Today, we’re announcing Superpower, our new 42‑megawatt natural gas turbine, along with a $300M funding round and Crusoe as our launch customer. And most importantly: this marks a turning point. Boom is now on a self-funded path to both Superpower and the Overture supersonic airliner.</p>



<p>I want to share the real story of how this happened—and why supersonic technology is exactly what America’s energy crisis demands.</p>

<h4>America Doesn’t Have 10–15 Years to Solve Its Power Problem the Old Way</h4>

<p>If you’ve been paying attention, you know the U.S. is in a genuine energy crunch. GPU racks are idling because they can’t get power. Data centers are fighting over substations and interconnection queues. Meanwhile China is adding power capacity at a wartime pace—coal, gas, nuclear, everything—while America struggles to get a single transmission line permitted.</p>



<p>AI won’t wait for us to fix the grid. And the United States simply doesn’t have 10–15 years to build out power infrastructure the old way.</p>



<p>Hyperscalers have already moved to their own Plan B: behind‑the‑meter power plants. You’ve seen XAI’s Colossus I and II in Memphis. OpenAI’s Stargate I in Abilene. These projects are powered by arrays of aeroderivative natural-gas turbines—which are, fundamentally, modified jet engines from the 1970s. There’s something brilliant in this approach: the transition from gigantic “frame” turbines to arrays of mid-size “aeroderivative” turbines mirrors the computing industry’s shift from mainframes to blade servers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The problem? The “blade servers” of the energy world are old tech and they’re sold out. Because the most popular “aeroderivative” turbines are based on subsonic jet engines, they’re happiest when the outside air temperature is -50°F—like it is when going Mach 0.8 at 30,000 feet. As outside temperatures rise, there is no option but to throttle back the engines—or else the turbine blades literally melt down. These turbines begin losing power at about 50°F and by the time it’s 110°—as often happens in popular data center locations like Texas—30% of generation capacity is lost. Nonetheless, major manufacturers all have backlogs through the rest of the decade and none is building a new-generation advanced-technology turbine.</p>

<h4>A Supersonic Engine Core Makes the Perfect Power Turbine</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1440" height="810" src="https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-3-1440x810.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-3-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-3-160x90.jpg 160w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-3.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px"></figure>







<p>When we designed the Symphony engine for Overture, we built something no one else has built this century: a brand-new large engine core optimized for continuous, high‑temperature operation.</p>



<p>A subsonic engine is built for short bursts of power at takeoff. A supersonic engine is built to run hard, continuously, at extreme thermal loads. Symphony was designed for Mach 1.7 at 60,000 feet, where effective temperatures reach 160°F—not the frigid -50°F conditions where legacy subsonic engines operate.</p>



<p>This gives Superpower several critical advantages:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Full power even with high ambient heat</strong> – Where legacy turbines lose 20–30% at 110°F, Superpower maintains its full 42MW output without derate.</li>



<li><strong>Waterless operation</strong> – Legacy turbines need huge quantities of water for cooling to avoid thermal derate in hot environments. Superpower doesn’t. It stays at full output, water‑free.</li>



<li><strong>Cloud‑native control and monitoring</strong>. Superpower inherits the telemetry and operations stack we built for XB‑1. Every turbine streams real‑time performance data, supports remote control, and flags anomalies before customers ever notice.</li>
</ol>



<p>Superpower and Symphony are based on virtually identical turbine engines. Both share the identical core (HPC and HPT) and a slightly tuned low spool. In the place of Symphony’s hollow-core titanium fan, Superpower adds two additional compressor stages plus a three-stage free power turbine connected to a high-efficiency generator on its own shaft. Additionally, the engines use slightly different fuel nozzles, Symphony’s optimized for Jet A vs. Superpower’s for natural gas.</p>

<h4>Scaling Production the Supersonic Way: Vertical Integration</h4>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1440" height="810" src="https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-4-1440x810.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-4-1440x810.jpg 1440w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-4-160x90.jpg 160w, https://boomsupersonic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/251209-FlyBy_ai-needs-more-power-than-the-grid-can-deliver-supersonic-tech-can-fix-that-4.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px"></figure>







<p>The legacy aerospace supply chain is congested. When the mission is urgent and the supply chain congested, you build the supply chain. The new Superpower Superfactory starts with a simple vision: raw materials in one side of the building, gigawatts of completed power turbine packages out the other side. We’ve already started making the first parts—and much of the production equipment to support 2GW/yr is on order. With this new financing we’re ready to accelerate further.</p>



<p>If America wants to build at the speed AI requires, vertical integration isn’t optional. We’re standing up our own foundry and our own large scale CNC machining capability. We’ll have more to share on the Superpower Superfactory in early 2026.</p>

<p>Superpower is sort of like our Starlink moment, the strongest accelerant we’ve ever had toward our core mission of making Earth dramatically more accessible.</p>



<p>The fastest way to a certified, passenger-carrying Symphony engine is to run its core for hundreds of thousands of hours in the real world, powering Earth’s most demanding AI data centers. Every hour a Superpower turbine spins is an hour of validation for Symphony. Every gigawatt we deliver strengthens our vertical integration and manufacturing capability. And with Superpower profitability funding the remainder of the aircraft program, we’ve done something rare in aerospace: created a self-sustaining path to a new airliner.</p>



<p>Superpower also reminds me of what Boom is at our core: a team willing to take on what others say is impossible, to do with a small team what big companies might not even attempt.</p>

The shares are trading for around 33 times expected earnings over the next 12 months, a level they’ve only hit a few times in the past 15 years, with a high of 35 in September 2020. The stock’s average multiple over that time is less than 19 times. Apple is now the second most expensive stock in the Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index, trailing only Tesla Inc.’s whopping valuation of 203 times forward earnings.

<p><strong>Catch your best ideas before they slip through your fingers</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever have flashes of insight or an idea worth remembering? This happens to me 5-10 times every day. If I don’t write down the thought immediately, it slips out of my mind. Worst of all, I <em>remember</em> that I’ve forgotten something and spend the next 10 minutes trying to remember what it is. So I invented external memory for my brain.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing</strong> <strong>Pebble Index 01</strong> - a small ring with a button and microphone. Hold the button, whisper your thought, and it’s sent to your phone. It’s added to your notes, set as a reminder, or saved for later review.</p>
<p>Index 01 is designed to become muscle memory, since it’s always with you. It’s private by design (no recording until you press the button) and requires no internet connection or paid subscription. It’s as small as a wedding band and comes in 3 colours. It’s made from durable stainless steel and is water-resistant. Like all Pebble products, it’s extremely customizable and built with open source software.</p>
<p>Here’s the best part: the battery lasts for years. You never need to charge it.</p>
<p><a href="https://repebble.com/index#buy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-order today for $75</a>. After worldwide shipping begins in March 2026, the price will go up to $99.</p>

<h3 id="design"><a href="#design"><span>#</span>Design</a></h3>
<p>Now that I’ve worn my Index 01 for several months, I can safely say that it has changed my life - just like with Pebble, I couldn’t go back to a world without this. There are so many situations each day where my hands are full (while biking or driving, washing dishes, wrangling my kids, etc) and I need to remember something. A random sampling of my recent recordings:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Set a timer for 3pm to go pick up the kids</em></li>
<li><em>Remind me to phone the pharmacy at 11am</em></li>
<li><em>Peter is coming by tomorrow at 11:30am, add that to my calendar</em></li>
<li><em>Jerry recommends reading Breakneck</em></li>
<li><em>Mark wants a Black/Red PT2</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Before, I would take my phone out of my pocket to jot these down, but I couldn’t always do that (eg, while bicycling). I also wanted to start using my phone less, especially in front of my kids.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-1-2c146dc6-62c0-4079-8f46-56413e3f5ae9.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p>Initially, we experimented by building this as an app on Pebble, since it has a mic and I’m always wearing one. But, I realized quickly that this was suboptimal - it required me to use my other hand to press the button to start recording (lift-to-wake gestures and wake-words are too unreliable). This was tough to use while bicycling or carrying stuff.</p>
<p>Then a genius electrical engineer friend of mine came up with an idea to fit everything into a tiny ring. It is the perfect form factor! Honestly, I’m still amazed that it all fits.</p>
<p>The design needed to satisfy several critical conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Must work reliably 100% of the time. If it didn’t work or failed to record a thought, I knew I would take it off and revert back to my old habit of just forgetting things.</li>
<li>It had to have a physical press-button, with a satisfying click-feel. I want to know for sure if the button is pressed and my thought is captured.</li>
<li>Long battery life - every time you take something off to charge, there’s a chance you’ll forget to put it back on.</li>
<li>Must be privacy-preserving. These are your inner thoughts. All recordings must be processed and stored on your phone. Only record when the button is pressed.</li>
<li>It had to be as small as a wedding band. Since it’s worn on the index finger, if it were too large or bulky, it would hit your phone while you held it in your hand.</li>
<li>Water resistance - must be able to wash hands, shower, and get wet.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ve been working on this for a while, testing new versions and making tweaks. We’re really excited to get this out into the world.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my favourite things about Index 01:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does one thing really well - it helps me remember things.</li>
<li>It’s discreet. It's not distracting.  It doesn't take you out of the moment.</li>
<li>There’s no AI friend persona and it’s not always recording.</li>
<li>It’s inexpensive. We hope you try it and see if you like it as well!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="key-details"><a href="#key-details"><span>#</span><strong>Key Details</strong></a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available in 3 colours and 8 sizes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Colours: polished silver, polished gold, and matte black</li>
<li>US ring sizes: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13</li>
<li>You can pre-order now and pick your size/colour later before your ring ships.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cost and availability:</strong> Pre-order price is $75, rises to $99 later. Ships worldwide, beginning in March.</li>
<li><strong>Works with iPhone and Android</strong>: We overcame <a href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/apple-restricts-pebble-from-being-awesome-with-iphones" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s best efforts</a> to make life terrible for 3rd party accessory makers and have Index 01 working well on iOS and Android.</li>
<li><strong>Extremely private and secure</strong>: Your thoughts are processed by open source speech-to-text (STT) and AI models locally on your phone. You can read the code and see exactly how it works - our <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pebble mobile app</a> is open source. Higher-quality STT is available through an optional cloud service.</li>
<li><strong>No charging:</strong> The battery lasts for up to years of average use. After the end of its life, send your ring back to us for recycling.</li>
<li><strong>On-ring storage:</strong> Recording works even if your phone is out of range. Up to 5 minutes of audio can be stored on-ring, then synced later.</li>
<li><strong>No speaker or vibrating motor:</strong> This is an input device only. There is an RGB LED, but it’s rarely used (to save battery life and to reduce distraction).</li>
<li><strong>Works great with Pebble</strong> or other smartwatches: After recording, the thought will appear on your watch, and you can check that it’s correct. You can ask questions like ‘What’s the weather today?’ and see the answer on your watch.</li>
<li><strong>Raw audio playback</strong>: Very helpful if STT doesn’t work perfectly due to wind or loud background noises.</li>
<li><strong>Actions: W</strong>hile the primary task is remembering things for you, you can also ask it to do things like ’Send a Beeper message to my wife - running late’ or answer simple questions that could be answered by searching the web. You can configure button clicks to control your music - I love using this to play/pause or skip tracks. You can also configure where to save your notes and reminders (I have it set to add to Notion).</li>
<li><strong>Customizable and hackable:</strong> Configure single/double button clicks to control whatever you want (take a photo, turn on lights, Tasker, etc). Add your own voice actions via MCP. Or route the audio recordings directly to your own app or server!</li>
<li><strong>99+ languages:</strong> Speech to text and local LLM support over 99 languages! Naturally, the quality of each may vary.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="future-plans"><a href="#future-plans"><span>#</span>Future Plans</a></h3>
<p>Let me be very clear - Index 01 is designed at its core to be a device that helps you remember things. We want it to be 100% reliable at its primary task. But we’re leaving the side door open for folks to customize, build new interactions and actions.</p>
<p>Here’s how I’m thinking about it - a single click-hold + voice input will be routed to the primary memory processing path. Double-click-hold + voice input would be routed to a more general purpose voice agent (think ChatGPT with web search). Responses from the agent would be presented on Pebble (eg ‘What’s the weather tomorrow?’, ‘When’s the next northbound Caltrain?’) or other smartwatches (as a notification). Maybe this could even be an input for something like ChatGPT Voice Mode, enabling you to hear the AI response from your earbuds.</p>
<p>The built in actions, set reminder, create note, alarms, etc, are actually MCPs - basically mini apps that AI agents know how to operate. They run locally in WASM within the Pebble mobile app (no cloud MCP server required). Basically any MCP server can be used with the system, so intrepid folks may have fun adding various actions like Beeper, Google Calendar, weather, etc that already offer MCPs.</p>
<p>Not everything will be available at launch, but this is the direction we are working towards. There will be 3 ways to customize your Index 01:</p>
<ol>
<li>Trigger actions via button clicks - configure a single or double click to do things like take a photo, control your Home Assistant smart home, Tasker function, unlock your car. This will work better on Android since iOS Shortcuts doesn’t have an open API.</li>
<li>Trigger actions via voice input - write an MCP to do….basically anything? This is pretty open ended.</li>
<li>Route your voice recordings and/or transcriptions to your own webhook - or skip our AI processing entirely and send every recording to your own app or webapp.</li>
</ol>
<p>### FAQ</p>
<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>People usually wear it on the index finger. Inside the ring is a button, a microphone, a Bluetooth chip, memory, and a battery that lasts for years. Click the button with your thumb, talk into the mic, and it records to internal memory. When your phone is in range, the recording is streamed to the Pebble app. It’s converted to text on-device, then processed by an on-device large language model (LLM) which selects an action to take (create note, add to reminders, etc).</p>
<p><strong>When do I pick my size?</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to pick your ring size and color after placing a pre-order. If you have a 3D printer, you can <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/hardware/tree/main/ring/pebble-index-01/3d-cad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">print our CAD designs</a> to try on. We’re also planning a sizing kit. You can view the <a href="https://repebble.com/index01-carousel/index01-dimensions.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">measurements of the inner diameter</a> of each ring size.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://repebble.com/assets/meet-pebble-index-01-external-memory-for-your-brain-4-dd455665-61da-4315-b377-e37e90cc57b3.png" alt="" loading="lazy"></span></p>
<p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p>Roughly 12 to 15 hours of recording. On average, I use it 10-20 times per day to record 3-6 second thoughts. That’s up to 2 years of usage.</p>
<p><strong>Is it secure and private?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, extremely. The connection between ring and phone is encrypted. Recordings are processed locally on your phone in the open-source Pebble app. The app works offline (no internet connection) and does not require a cloud service. An optional cloud storage system for backing up recordings is available. Our plan is for this to be optionally encrypted, but we haven’t built it yet.</p>
<p><strong>Is a paid subscription required?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of battery is inside?</strong></p>
<p>Index 01 uses silver-oxide batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Why can’t it be recharged?</strong></p>
<p>We considered this but decided not to for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You’d probably lose the charger before the battery runs out!</li>
<li>Adding charge circuitry and including a charger would make the product larger and more expensive.</li>
<li>You send it back to us to recycle.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wait, it’s single use?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We know this sounds a bit odd, but in this particular circumstance we believe it’s the best solution to the given set of constraints. Other smart rings like Oura cost $250+ and need to be charged every few days. We didn’t want to build a device like that.  Before the battery runs out, the Pebble app notifies and asks if you’d like to order another ring.</p>
<p><strong>Is it always listening?</strong></p>
<p>No.  It only records while the button is pressed. It’s not designed to record your whole life, or meetings.</p>
<p><strong>What if the speech-to-text processing misses a word or something?</strong></p>
<p>You can always listen to the each recording in the app.</p>
<p><strong>Why no touchpad?</strong></p>
<p>We experimented with a touchpad, but found it too easy to accidentally swipe and press. Also, nothing beats the feedback of a real gosh darn pressable button.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a speaker or vibrating motor?</strong></p>
<p>No. The button has a great click-feel to indicate when you are pressing.</p>
<p><strong>Does it do health tracking like Oura?</strong></p>
<p>Nope</p>
<p><strong>How durable and water-resistant is it?</strong></p>
<p>It’s primarily made from stainless steel 316, with a liquid silicone rubber (LSR) button. It’s water-resistant to 1 meter. You can wash your hands, do dishes, and shower with it on, but we don’t recommend swimming with it.</p>
<p><strong>Does it work with iPhone and Android?</strong></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p><strong>I love customizing and hacking on my devices. What could I do with Index 01?</strong></p>
<p>Lots of stuff! Control things with the buttons. Route raw audio or transcribed text directly to your own app via webhook. Use <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCPs</a> (also run locally on-device! No cloud server required) to add more actions.</p>
<p><strong>Is this an AI friend thingy or always-recording device?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>How far along is development?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve been working on this in the background to watch development. It helps that our Pebble Time 2 partner factory is also building Index 01! We’re currently in the DVT stage, testing pre-production samples. We’ll start a wider alpha test in January with a lot more people. Here’s some shots from the pre-production assembly line:</p>

<p dir="auto">Kaiju is a 2D/3D game engine written in Go (Golang) backed by Vulkan. The goal of the engine is to use a modern, easy, systems level programming language, with a focus on simplicity, to create a new kind of game engine.</p>

<p dir="auto">The current version of the base engine renders extremely fast, faster than most would think a garbage collected language could go. In my testing a release mode build of a game in Unity with nothing but a black background and a cube runs at about 1,600 FPS. In Kaiju, the same thing runs at around 5,400 FPS on the same machine. In fact, a complete game, with audio, custom cursors, real time PBR rendering with real time shadows, UI, and more runs at 2,712 FPS (in "debug" mode) <a href="https://x.com/ShieldCrush/status/1943516032674537958" rel="nofollow">screenshots or it didn't happen</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Go (golang)?</h2><a id="user-content-why-go-golang" aria-label="Permalink: Why Go (golang)?" href="#why-go-golang"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I love C, and because I love C and found out that Ken Thompson played a part in designing Go, I gave Go a chance. It has been such a joy to use and work with I decided to port my C game engine to Go. Go is a modern system-level language that allows me to write code the way I want to write code and even have the opportunity to do some crazy things if I want to (no strings attached). Also the simplicity and "just works" of writing Assembly code was a great boost to my happiness.</p>
<p dir="auto">What's more, it's a language that other developers can easily learn and jump right into extending the engine/editor. No need for developers to re-figure out some bespoke macros or crazy templating nonsense. It's flat, easy, straight forward, and the foot-gun is hidden behind some walls, but there if you want it. Furthermore, developers can write their games in Go directly, no need for some alternative language that is different from the engine code (but we'll include Lua for modding).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What about the Garbage Collector?!</h2><a id="user-content-what-about-the-garbage-collector" aria-label="Permalink: What about the Garbage Collector?!" href="#what-about-the-garbage-collector"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I am creating this section because I get asked about it when I mention "Go", possibly not realizing that most public game engines use a garbage collector (GC).</p>
<p dir="auto">The GC is actually a feature I'm happy with (shocker coming from a C guy). Well, the reason is simple, if you're going to make a game engine that the public will use and needs to be stable, you need a garbage collector. Unity has C# (and possibly an internal GC as well), Unreal has a GC (and it could use a tune up if you ask me), Godot has a GC albeit their scripting language or when you use C#. It is actually very important for public engines to have a GC because people are only human and make a lot of mistakes, mistakes they'll blame on you (the engine developer) before they blame themselves.</p>
<p dir="auto">Coincidentally, the overall design I have for the engine plays very well with the GC and last I measured, I have a net-0 heap allocation while running (may need a new review). If you don't abuse the GC, you shouldn't generally feel it, it runs concurrently as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'll be the first to admit, I think the developers of Go can create a better GC than I can, and probably better than Unreal and Unity too.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I'm the kind of person who thinks about the design and implementation of hash tables. One design which I find particularly cute, and I think deserves a bit more publicity, is Robin Hood open-addressing with linear probing and power-of-two table size. If you're not familiar with hash table terminology, that might look like a smorgasbord of random words, but it should become clearer as we look at some actual code.</p>
<p>To keep the code simple to start with, I'm going to assume:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keys are randomly-distributed 32-bit integers.</li>
<li>Values are also 32-bit integers.</li>
<li>If the key <code>0</code> is present, its value is not <code>0</code>.</li>
<li>The table occupies at most 32 GiB of memory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each slot in the table is either empty, or holds a key and a value. The combination of properties (1) and (2) allows a key/value pair to be stored as a 64-bit integer, and property (3) means that the 64-bit value <code>0</code> can be used to represent an empty slot (some hash table designs also need a special value for representing tombstones, but this design doesn't need tombstones). Combining a key and a value into 64 bits couldn't be easier: the low 32 bits hold the key, and the high 32 bits hold the value.</p>
<p>The structure for the table itself needs a pointer to the array of slots, the length of said array, and the number of non-empty slots. As the length is always a power of two, it's more useful to store <code>length - 1</code> instead of <code>length</code>, which leads to <code>mask</code> rather than <code>length</code>, and property (4) means that <code>mask</code> can be stored as 32 bits. As the load factor should be less than 100%, we can assume <code>count &lt; length</code>, and hence <code>count</code> can also be 32 bits. This leads to a mundane-looking:</p>
<pre><code><span>struct</span> hash_table_t {
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots;
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask;
  <span>uint32_t</span> count;
};
</code></pre>
<p>Property (1) means that we don't need to hash keys, as they're already randomly distributed. Every possible key <code>K</code> has a "natural position" in the slots array, which is just <code>K &amp; mask</code>. If there are collisions, the slot in which a key <em>actually</em> ends up might be different to its natural position. The "linear probing" part of the design means that if <code>K</code> cannot be in its natural position, the next slot to be considered is <code>(K + 1) &amp; mask</code>, and if not that slot then <code>(K + 2) &amp; mask</code>, then <code>(K + 3) &amp; mask</code>, and so on. This leads to the definition of a "chain": if <code>K</code> is some key present in the table, <code>C<sub>K</sub></code> denotes the sequence of slots starting with <code>K</code>'s natural position and ending with <code>K</code>'s actual position. We have the usual property of open-addressing: none of the slots in <code>C<sub>K</sub></code> are empty slots. The "Robin Hood" part of the design then imposes an additional rather interesting property: for each slot <code>S</code> in <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>, <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) ≥ Score(S.Index, K)</code>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>S.Index</code> is the index of <code>S</code> in the <code>slots</code> array (not the index of it in <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>).</li>
<li><code>S.Key</code> is the key present in slot <code>S</code> (i.e. the low 32 bits of <code>slots[S.Index]</code>).</li>
<li><code>Score(Index, Key)</code> is <code>(Index - Key) &amp; mask</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties give us the termination conditions for the lookup algorithm: for a possible key <code>K</code>, we look at each slot starting from <code>K</code>'s natural position, and either we find <code>K</code>, or we find an empty slot, or we find a slot with <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) &lt; Score(S.Index, K)</code>. In either of the latter two cases, <code>K</code> cannot have been present in the table. In the function below, <code>Score(S.Index, K)</code> is tracked as <code>d</code>. In a language with a modern type system, the result of a lookup would be <code>Optional&lt;Value&gt;</code>, but if sticking to plain C, property (3) can be used to make something similar: the 64-bit result is zero if the key is absent, and otherwise the value is in the low 32 bits of the result (which may themselves be zero, but the full 64-bit result will be non-zero). The logic is thus:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>table_lookup</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>uint32_t</span> key)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>for</span> (<span>uint32_t</span> d = <span>0</span>;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = (key + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(key == (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) </span>{
      <span>return</span> (slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>) | (slot &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(((idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) &amp; mask) &lt; d) </span>{
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>If using a rich 64-bit CPU architecture, many of the expressions in the above function are cheaper than they might initially seem:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>slots[idx]</code> involves zero-extending <code>idx</code> from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by <code>sizeof(uint64_t)</code>, adding it to <code>slots</code>, and then loading from that address. All this is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.</li>
<li><code>key == (uint32_t)slot</code> involves a comparison using the low 32 bits of a 64-bit register, which is a completely standard operation on x86-64 or arm64.</li>
<li><code>(slot &gt;&gt; 32) | (slot &lt;&lt; 32)</code> is a rotation by 32 bits, which again is a single instruction on x86-64 or arm64.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, if using riscv64, things are less good:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the <code>Zba</code> extension is present, <code>sh3add.uw</code> is a single instruction for zero-extending <code>idx</code> from 32 bits to 64, multiplying it by <code>sizeof(uint64_t)</code>, and adding it to <code>slots</code>. If not, each step is a separate instruction, though the zero-extension can be eliminated <a href="https://gist.github.com/corsix/65ffbd66bbd199b3d77e4ec24c3d3724">with a slight reformulation</a> to encourage the compiler to fold the zero-extension onto the load of <code>table-&gt;mask</code> (as riscv64 usually defaults to making sign-extension free, in contrast to x86-64/arm64 which usually make zero-extension free). Regardless, the load is always its own instruction.</li>
<li><code>key == (uint32_t)slot</code> hits a gap in the riscv64 ISA: it doesn't have any 32-bit comparison instructions, so this either becomes a 32-bit subtraction followed by a 64-bit comparison against zero, or promotion of both operands from 32 bits to 64 bits followed by a 64-bit comparison.</li>
<li>If the <code>Zbb</code> extension is present, rotations are a single instruction. If not, they're three instructions, and so it becomes almost worth reworking the slot layout to put the key in the high 32 bits and the value in the low 32 bits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving on from lookup to insertion, there are various different options for what to do when the key being inserted is already present. I'm choosing to show a variant which returns the old value (in the same form as <code>table_lookup</code> returns) and then overwrites with the new value, though other variants are obviously possible. The logic follows the same overall structure as seen in <code>table_lookup</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>table_set</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>uint32_t</span> key, <span>uint32_t</span> val)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>uint64_t</span> kv = key + ((<span>uint64_t</span>)val &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
  <span>for</span> (<span>uint32_t</span> d = <span>0</span>;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = ((<span>uint32_t</span>)kv + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      <span>// Inserting new value (and slot was previously empty)</span>
      slots[idx] = kv;
      <span>break</span>;
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>((<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>kv </span>== (<span>uint32_t</span>)slot) {
      <span>// Overwriting existing value</span>
      slots[idx] = kv;
      <span>return</span> (slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>) | (slot &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>uint32_t</span> d2 = (idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)slot) &amp; mask;
      <span>if</span> (d2 &lt; d) {
        <span>// Inserting new value, and moving existing slot</span>
        slots[idx] = kv;
        table_reinsert(slots, mask, slot, d2);
        <span>break</span>;
      }
    }
  }
  <span>if</span> (++table-&gt;count * <span>4u</span>ll &gt;= mask * <span>3u</span>ll) {
    <span>// Expand table once we hit 75% load factor</span>
    table_rehash(table);
  }
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid the load factor becoming too high, the above function will sometimes grow the table by calling this helper function:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>table_rehash</span><span>(hash_table_t* table)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> old_mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint32_t</span> new_mask = old_mask * <span>2u</span> + <span>1u</span>;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* new_slots = <span>calloc</span>(new_mask + <span>1u</span>ll, <span>sizeof</span>(<span>uint64_t</span>));
  <span>uint64_t</span>* old_slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>uint32_t</span> idx = <span>0</span>;
  <span>do</span> {
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = old_slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot != <span>0</span>) {
      table_reinsert(new_slots, new_mask, slot, <span>0</span>);
    }
  } <span>while</span> (idx++ != old_mask);
  table-&gt;slots = new_slots;
  table-&gt;mask = new_mask;
  <span>free</span>(old_slots);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Both of <code>table_set</code> and <code>table_rehash</code> make use of a helper function which is very similar to <code>table_set</code>, but doesn't need to check for overwriting an existing key and also doesn't need to update <code>count</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>table_reinsert</span><span>(<span>uint64_t</span>* slots, <span>uint32_t</span> mask, <span>uint64_t</span> kv, <span>uint32_t</span> d)</span> </span>{
  <span>for</span> (;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = ((<span>uint32_t</span>)kv + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      slots[idx] = kv;
      <span>break</span>;
    } <span>else</span> {
      <span>uint32_t</span> d2 = (idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)slot) &amp; mask;
      <span>if</span> (d2 &lt; d) {
        slots[idx] = kv;
        kv = slot;
        d = d2;
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>That covers lookup and insertion, so next up is key removal. As already hinted at, this hash table design doesn't need tombstones. Instead, removing a key involves finding the slot containing that key and then shifting slots left until finding an empty slot or a slot with <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0</code>. This removal strategy works due to a neat pair of emergent properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>If slot <code>S</code> has <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) != 0</code>, it is viable for <code>S.Key</code> to instead be at <code>(S.Index - 1) &amp; mask</code> (possibly subject to additional re-arranging to fill the gap formed by moving <code>S.Key</code>).</li>
<li>If slot <code>S</code> has <code>Score(S.Index, S.Key) == 0</code>, and <code>S</code> is part of some chain <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>, then <code>S</code> is at the very start of <code>C<sub>K</sub></code>. Hence it is viable to turn <code>(S.Index - 1) &amp; mask</code> into an empty slot without breaking any chains.</li>
</ul>
<p>This leads to the tombstone-free removal function, which follows the established pattern of returning either the old value or zero:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>table_remove</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>uint32_t</span> key)</span> </span>{
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>for</span> (<span>uint32_t</span> d = <span>0</span>;; ++d) {
    <span>uint32_t</span> idx = (key + d) &amp; mask;
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot == <span>0</span>) {
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(key == (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) </span>{
      <span>uint32_t</span> nxt = (idx + <span>1</span>) &amp; mask;
      --table-&gt;count;
      <span>while</span> (slots[nxt] &amp;&amp; ((slots[nxt] ^ nxt) &amp; mask)) {
        slots[idx] = slots[nxt];
        idx = nxt;
        nxt = (idx + <span>1</span>) &amp; mask;
      }
      slots[idx] = <span>0</span>;
      <span>return</span> (slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>) | (slot &lt;&lt; <span>32</span>);
    } <span><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(((idx - (<span>uint32_t</span>)</span>slot) &amp; mask) &lt; d) </span>{
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The final interesting hash table operation is iterating over all keys and values, which is just an array iteration combined with filtering out zeroes:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>void</span> <span>table_iterate</span><span>(hash_table_t* table, <span>void</span>(*visit)</span><span>(<span>uint32_t</span> key, <span>uint32_t</span> val)</span>) </span>{
  <span>uint64_t</span>* slots = table-&gt;slots;
  <span>uint32_t</span> mask = table-&gt;mask;
  <span>uint32_t</span> idx = <span>0</span>;
  <span>do</span> {
    <span>uint64_t</span> slot = slots[idx];
    <span>if</span> (slot != <span>0</span>) {
      visit((<span>uint32_t</span>)slot, (<span>uint32_t</span>)(slot &gt;&gt; <span>32</span>));
    }
  } <span>while</span> (idx++ != mask);
}
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>That wraps up the core concepts of this hash table, so now it is time to revisit some of the initial simplifications.</p>
<p>If keys are 32-bit integers but are <em>not</em> randomly-distributed, then we just need an invertible hash function from 32 bits to 32 bits, the purpose of which is to take keys following ~any real-world pattern and emit a ~random pattern. The <code>table_lookup</code>, <code>table_set</code>, and <code>table_remove</code> functions gain <code>key = hash(key)</code> at the very start but are otherwise unmodified (noting that if the hash function is invertible, hash equality implies key equality, hence no need to explicitly check key equality), and <code>table_iterate</code> is modified to apply the inverse function before calling <code>visit</code>. If hardware CRC32 / CRC32C instructions are present (as is the case on sufficiently modern x86-64 and arm64 chips), these can be used for the task, although their inverses are annoying to compute, so perhaps not ideal if iteration is an important operation. If CRC32 isn't viable, <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/hash-prospector/issues/19">one option</a> out of many is:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>u32_hash</span><span>(<span>uint32_t</span> h)</span> </span>{
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>16</span>;
  h *= <span>0x21f0aaad</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>;
  h *= <span>0x735a2d97</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>;
  <span>return</span> h;
}
</code></pre></td><td><pre><code><span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>u32_unhash</span><span>(<span>uint32_t</span> h)</span> </span>{
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>; h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>30</span>;
  h *= <span>0x97132227</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>15</span>; h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>30</span>;
  h *= <span>0x333c4925</span>;
  h ^= h &gt;&gt; <span>16</span>;
  <span>return</span> h;
}
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>If keys and values are larger than 32 bits, then the design can be augmented with a separate array of key/value pairs, with the design as shown containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the array index of the key/value pair. To meet property (3) in this case, either the hash function can be chosen to never be zero, or "array index plus one" can be stored rather than "array index". It is not possible to make the hash function invertible in this case, so <code>table_lookup</code>, <code>table_set</code>, and <code>table_remove</code> <em>do</em> need extending to check for key equality after confirming hash equality. Iteration involves walking the separate array of key/value pairs rather than the hash structure, which has the added benefit of iteration order being related to insertion order rather than hash order. As another twist on this, if keys and values are variably-sized, then the design can instead be augmented with a separate array of <em>bytes</em>, with key/value pairs serialised somewhere in that array, and the hash structure containing a 32-bit hash of the key and the <em>byte</em> offset (within the array) of the key/value pair.</p>
<p>Of course, a design can only stretch so far. If you're after a concurrent lock-free hash table, look elsewhere. If you can rely on 128-bit SIMD instructions being present, you might instead want to group together every 16 key/value pairs, keep an 8-bit hash of each key, and rely on SIMD to perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel. If you're building hardware rather than software, it can be appealing to have multiple hash functions, each one addressing its own SRAM bank. There is no one-size-fits-all hash table, but I've found the one shown here to be good for a lot of what I do.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Built for production-grade workflows.</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Devstral 2 supports exploring codebases and orchestrating changes across multiple files while maintaining architecture-level context. It tracks framework dependencies, detects failures, and retries with corrections—solving challenges like bug fixing and modernizing legacy systems.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The model can be fine-tuned to prioritize specific languages or optimize for large enterprise codebases.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We evaluated Devstral 2 against DeepSeek V3.2 and Claude Sonnet 4.5 using human evaluations conducted by an independent annotation provider, with tasks scaffolded through Cline. Devstral 2 shows a clear advantage over DeepSeek V3.2, with a 42.8% win rate versus 28.6% loss rate. However, Claude Sonnet 4.5 remains significantly preferred, indicating a gap with closed-source models persists.</p>

ChatGPT is not "intelligence", so please don't call it "AI".
<p>
I define "intelligence" as being capable of knowing or understanding,
at least within some domain.  ChatGPT cannot know or understand
anything, so it is not intelligence.  It does not know what its
output means.  It has no idea that words can mean anything.
</p><p>
I call it a <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#ArtificialIntelligence">"bullshit generator"</a>
because it <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5">generates output "with indifference to the truth"</a>.
</p><p>
The same applies to many other "generative systems", for the same
reasons
</p><p>
The widespread public error of attributing intelligence to those
systems leads millions of people to a misplaced trust for them.
Please join me in spreading the word that people should not trust
systems that mindlessly play with words to be correct in what those
words mean.
</p><p>
Another reason to reject ChatGPT in particular is that users cannot
get a copy of it.  It is unreleased software -- users cannot get even
an executable to run, let alone the source code.  The only way to use
it is by talking to a server which keeps users at arm's length.
</p><p>
Doing your own computing via software running on someone else's server
inherently <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">trashes your computing freedom</a>.
